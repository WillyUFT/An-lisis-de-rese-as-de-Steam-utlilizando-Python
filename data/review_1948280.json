You start with a few cards and a villager. You use your villager to make other things. \nYou discover cards, like structures, craftables, weapons, etc.\nAs the game progresses, you have invaders that enter your field, and you must defend with your villagers, that you hopefully got some weapons for.\nYou can buy card packs that allow you to gain more resources, and eventually grow a bigger village with more villagers. \nThe simplicity of the game is very welcoming, since the speed of the game combined with the medium level of growing difficulty makes for a growing challenge that is nice and rewarding.\nIf you are clever, the game mechanics let you to create small \"engines\" that allow you to make growing your village easier and less clicking and dragging and pausing everywhere. ie putting a logging camp next to a board builder and let the cards stack and eventually make nice expensive boards.\nI havnt even looked into the mods for the game yet, but I am so excited to check them out. There is so much potential to be unlocked in this game, as the groundwork enables the expansion of the game to be limitless. Very happy that it is modable.\nIf you are remotely interested in the game, give it a try. Its cheap, and you are supporting a great studio of honest hard working developers that have very unique game ideas.\n\nTO THE DEVELOPERS:\n\nPlease never stop expanding this game!\n\nStacklands has UNLIMITED potential in terms of different mechanics and game play.\nI would love to see a multiplayer co-op version, as well as a multiplayer VS mode.\nI have yet to explore the mods to this game, but the developers have such a great base game to work with that they could build so many great features, themed expansions, story lines, challenges, bosses, multiplayer, weapons, enemies, mechanics, combos, etc.\nI really hope that the developers, with so much positive reception to the game, have big plans for it. \nShut up and take my money for everything for this game. 10/10",

I... enjoy the combat.\n\nBut there's a lot of needless hassle built into the game. I haven't found any fence building, where you can seperate non-enemy cards from moving around. I haven't found any conveyor belts or beasts of burden that'll move vegetables back into the garden as soon as they harvest, or similar. \n\nThere's an interesting early-game balance in having the right amount of villagers where you can produce the most without starving yourself by harvesting more fruit bushes than returns to you via fruit and soil/farms/gardens.\n\nSo I'm left at an impasse, where I either never pause and have inefficient moons (a.k.a. turns) or grind the game down to a halt to micromanage every single garden and stove. This dragging around every single second is made worse by moving animals, the fact that cards can be pushed around, and the inability to properly organize. \n\nAt its largest, the playspace is also way too cramped to have nice, segmented breathing room.\n\nCombat was also always an afterthought for me. When you go on an incursion, you'll face all types of enemies with counters and advantages. Since you don't know what you'll face, a generic equal split of classes had the most consistency, so equipping whatever strongest stuff I had was best. Counters are neat on the defensive, when you can actually pick your battles. \n\nI haven't beaten the game yet and don't intend to, either. I've unlocked the university and I'm making about 100 coins every moon. Whatever surprises there might be in the future, I can't be bothered dragging cards anymore.

and content are as welcoming as they could ever be.\n\nThe farming, the combat, the crafting, the resource gathering; all of these concepts feel conected to one another through the unconventional mean of a card game; mixing all of these factors with the board managment and your survival, keeping you on your toes the entire time.\n\nIf the stress of constantly managing your space and the board isn't your thing, the game is welcoming enough to provide various settings like pacifist mode or longer days to ensure you are having fun your way, as well as a pause button, if you ever feel like things are moving too fast. \n\nAll in all, Stacklands is a wonderful experience, and can offer something to pretty much all types of gamers; it's easy to get into while also offering various deep systems if

The concept of the game (survival game except everything is cards) is pretty neat, but man. This is basically an idle game that inconveniences you to set things up more often, and with a weak sense of scale. You're going to be micromanaging food and resources all the way until just before the end of the game with mundane mouse clicks and dragging and there won't be anything to justify the tedium. Then you'll beat it, or maybe you won't, and you probably won't think to play the game again.\n\nMost of the excitement is in thinking about what could be coming next. Unfortunately, it never delivers on expectations. All of the explorable \"locations\" are also just progress bars that fill and sometimes drop mobs on you, except for specifically the Island, which itself isn't particularly unique - once you get the right set of Ideas, 1 Sand and 1 Gold Ore, you can just return to the main land and never go back again. Going to and from the Island is also a chore, since it triggers the day to end and forces you to feed all of your Villagers without accounting for the time lost. This could upset your food production if you aren't careful.\n\nCard interactions are entirely limited to stacking, aside from combat and the Crane. Combat automatically resolves itself, with each card lining up horizontally as they fight.

If you've ever fantasised about being the mayor of a village built entirely out of cards (who hasn't, right?), then look no further! From the moment you drop your first villager card next to a berry bush and watch those little berries get harvested, you'll know you're in for a treat. It's like playing poker, but instead of losing money, you gain resources and your villagers don't starve. #Winning \ud83c\udf52\n\nCard Packs? Oh, you betcha! It's like opening a bag of potato chips, but each chip is a possible game-changer for your little paper community. 'Oh look, a windmill card, let's slap that baby down next to the bakery!' You can practically hear your virtual villagers chanting your name as you transform their lives with every pack you open. But don't forget, the Moon waits for no one! Those little munchkins need to eat, or else you're going to have a village that looks like a 'Where's Waldo' of skeletons. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02\n\nThe ultimate goal? Show that big baddie who's boss by decking out your villagers like medieval superheroes and sending them into battle. It's like 'Avengers: Endgame,' but instead of the Infinity Gauntlet, you've got a Cardopedia! Don't want to fight? That's cool; just enable 'Peaceful Mode' and make love, not war. But where's the fun in that? All in all, if you've ever wanted to play God with a deck of cards, Stacklands is your sanctuary. The only thing missing is a card that summons a therapist to help you deal with your newfound addiction to this game. \ud83e\udd23\ud83c\udccf", "timestamp_created": 1693665785, "timestamp_updated": 1693665785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145518272": {"recommendationid": "145518272", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229160712", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2718, "last_played": 1693433738}, "language": "english", "review": "good shit", "timestamp_created": 1693657370, "timestamp_updated": 1693657370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145505138": {"recommendationid": "145505138", "author": {"steamid": "76561199401001742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1699837380}, "language": "english", "review": "awsome", "timestamp_created": 1693640602, "timestamp_updated": 1693640602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145504655": {"recommendationid": "145504655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240247254", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1693659152}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La misma noche que me dej\u00f3 mi novia me compr\u00e9 este juego, fue una de las mejores experiencias con videojuegos que he tenido hasta ahora.

Other games have experimented with this sort of mechanic before, such as cultist simulator and even some prehistoric browser games, but this game is the first to make it feel the most \"game-like\" for me. I love the idea of stacking cards to get certain combinations, which then exponentially tumbles out of control in what you can do. The problem is that It feels very whimsical and new at first, but quickly becomes tedious and repetitive. \n\nLets start by laying down what you can do in this game. Your overall goal of the game is to advance your tribe by developing your cards into new tools, food, and equipment. You have to manage your villagers by feeding them, equipping them, and sending them into combat. There is a basic tech system, which is essentially going from wood/stone to iron and then finally to gold. But ultimately, its pretty simple. Getting new cards is done by buying in-game card packs. These packs are bought with coins and the coins are earned by selling your cards (all cards have a coin value). You can just experiment with resources to discover new crafting recipes or you can get idea cards. Idea cards are random drops from the card packs you buy and they list exact recipes for new tech. You start with only a few card packs to buy but new card packs to purchase are discovered when you make certain progress with tech/recipes. Once you have discovered all card packs and the cards inside those packs (the game will let you know), you have found everything the game has to offer. Combat is also pretty simple. Send your units into battle and they will auto hit the enemy directly across from them. There are 3 types of damage and they form a rock-paper-scissors effectiveness triangle (magic --> range --> melee --> magic). The way to beat the game is buy defeating the final demon lord boss.\n\nNow, I would have really enjoyed this 10-15 Civ building ride, except the game is bogged down by two major flaw's. \nOne, automation. Stacking cards on top of each other in the beginning is fun. That fun evaporates when you have to keep stacking the same cards over and over. And it only gets worse as new tech come into the picture. Now, there is a tiny amount of automation and management, but no where near what you need or smooth enough. And this automation comes into picture towards the latter half of the game. I would say in the last couple hours even. It really bogs down everything you do and the joy of discovering new stuff. \n\nTwo, card movement. At first, I really enjoyed managing where my cards were and how things were organized. But then I soon realized that cards crashing into other cards moves them. That means when an iron pops out of a mine and lands on a carrot, it moves the carrot. When an enemy spawns and starts roaming around, any cards it runs into, move. You could have an entire farm set up that auto makes carrots and is all neatly organized just how you like it. Only to come back a minute later and everything has shifted around because the carrots flying out have pushed the cards. The game is actively trying to ruin your set ups. And no, that's not a fun mechanic. This one is less severe than the automation problem because it doesn't completely ruin the experience, but it is a little infuriating. \n\nSo because of these two flaws, I found myself towards the middle and especially towards the end, wanting the game to come to a close. I started to dread finding new buildings and resources to make because that meant more clutter that moved around, and more things I couldn't automate. The bedrock for this game is really amazing. I'm glad I did give it a go because it was a little eye opening on how creative you can get with card stacking. I could see a whole genre emerging from this and cultist simulator. But I don't think I'm ever going to touch this specific game again. \n\n\nOverall 3/5: A decently fun bite-sized Civ game that experiments with a rarely used card stacking mechanic. The mid and late game is bogged down by a severe lack of automation forcing you to stack cards repeatedly you have already stacked before. The fact that cards can be moved around by other cards also brings in unnecessary frustration. You could skip this one but its short enough that I think it has value in just experiencing how unique it is.", "timestamp_created": 1693588144, "timestamp_updated": 1693588144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145452227": {"recommendationid": "145452227", "author": {"steamid": "76561199385992204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 977, "last_played": 1699124430}, "language": "english", "review": "its a nice \"card game\"...", "timestamp_created": 1693578297, "timestamp_updated": 1693578297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145443393": {"recommendationid": "145443393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022997215", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1689388869}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Quick Ratings[/h1]\n\n[b]Overall[/b]: 4/10  - Stacklands is a game about survival, decorated in a card-style gimmick.

I'd say slightly above average, because they are clean. Very simple.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - The gameplay is very boring and also click intensive. You need to survive each day, by having at least 1 villager alive by the end of it. This is based around so many overused modern survival game ideas (not dying of hunger for example), but it doesn't execute it in any interesting way in terms of gameplay. It's just tedious and annoying. It's not particularly difficult, and there is basically no strategy. The card theme is merely a gimmick, the core gameplay underneath it is bad.\n\n[b]Music/Audio[/b] - It's fine. Not particularly memorable. Not bad.\n\n[b]Uniqueness[/b] - What drew me to the game was that it looked unique. I was fooled by the card aspect. It's anything but unique. It's the same old survival tropes wheeled out again. Instead of catching a fish and cooking it, you are just dragging a berry card over a villager card. I gave some points for the card aspect, but it really is just a gimmick.\n\n[b]Monetisation[/b] - It's ok as far as I can tell. I removed some points because it seems as though they're going down the DLC nickle and grab route. The price is also arguably overpriced at \u00a38, for such a simple game with not much to it.\n\n[b]Overall Thoughts[/b] - While initially looking unique, it doesn't offer anything interesting in terms of gameplay. It's not difficult at all. It's a slog to play through and I have no motivation to, there is no reward for doing so. Ok, I survive another day, so I get to click on more card packs and do more intensive clicking that lacks any required strategy. Good survival games reward the player for surviving (by unlocking a new equipment that makes your life easier and less click intensive for example). This game rewards the player for surviving by throwing more card packs to open, more complications, more text to read, and more recipes to keep track of. It's a simple game. It's a boring game.

It was engaging enough to keep me busy for around 20 hrs. The game play is very satisfying to play to want to keep uncovering more. Unfortunately, the fact that this game basically can go on forever with no real Meat and Potatoes to speak of after you hit the \"Final Final Boss\" It starts to run out of steam. And then, WAM DLC, and the obsession starts all over again. And as quickly as it came it then again quickly fades. The DLC that was offered provided some serious upgrades to the game play mechanic to keep certain events from happening, or to purposely let them happen to see different things occur that may either net you additional resources, or desperately needed gear. There are some SERIOUS usability quirks with this game, but are manageable which are kinda part of it's charm. Examples being fiddly card placement annoying you, or unable to figure out what you are trying to make with what resources you currently have, you have to work your way backwards from what you are actually trying to build which can be frustrating. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this game as much as I did, but I recommend to give it a try, even if it isn't on sale. I'm happy there is modding support and there are a few good looking mods out there that may solve some of these quirks, but once you reach near \"peak resources\" so your not wanting of much, there is nothing to hinder, or push you to go farther and that's when the cracks really start to show themselves in the game play loop. In under 30 hours I have gotten all the achievements, for those who are achievement collectors. I think the challenge modes are a real solid addition, and potentially could be more sustainable. the addition of food spoilage does help to make sure your managing those resource carefully, A more challenge focused mode could be really helpful in getting some more life out of this game, a crossword puzzle sort of day mode. There isn't much \"content\" add in Stacklands for the modding community. If I knew more about programming, I'd probably give it a go and try to implement this challenge mode feature.  New Weapons and Classes might help expand the game, but you would also have to bring more challenging everyday enemies. Weather events might be a useful addition, rain could speed up crops but bring the threat of wolves or other beasts to your flat cardboard based village of sorts. Dynamic changes would help liven up challenge mode for sure. I think the Trees/Fruit Trees could really just become their own kind of permanent resource card with a certain number of them put in a stack, like 10x to make an Apple Grove for example, but takes a lot of time to make it a reality. beyond 10 villagers you start to see diminishing returns as you may have a lot of villagers out there sitting around doing nothing. 7 seems to be the sweet spot, but you can't take them all with you. More incentives for having villagers and villagers leveling up when given the aging mechanic in the DLC for upgrading in their class so to speak could be a really cool addition. There needs to be more things happening to keep your attention, but not so much to be overwhelming or an annoyance. every 3 or so days I kept finding myself asking, now what? The sudden appearance of the Final Final Boss was abrupt, and I was very lucky I had the right set of villagers and gear to sit there and decimate him. The threat of the portal spawning creatures diminished over time, so you could do what you wanted, but then took away reasons to keep playing. Potentially this could be a breakout hit, even a streaming game, if there was more incentive to keep playing like many Rogue-likes out there. More refinement of what makes this game great, more incentive to play, less annoyances, something else to do with the structure cards(sheds,cathedrals, warehouses, ect ect). Don't get me wrong, this game does feel polished to a certain extent, but I think they stopped polishing after a certain amount of time to get the game out. It needs more - Stacklands 2? , more DLC - It's in the hands of the developers now to see if they want to continue this game. \n\nTLDR: Thanks for the unique and interesting experience of playing Klondike / Solitaire and allowing my face cards to do battle :)  -  Final score 7/10 - Enjoyable, but a medium length experience that may not bring you back to keep playing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1692978901, "timestamp_updated": 1692978901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144992689": {"recommendationid": "144992689", "author": {"steamid": "76561199388149151", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2566, "last_played": 1688495008}, "language": "english", "review": "an amazing stress cure after playing any *fnaf* horror game\n...\nor it could backfire and get a cardiac arrest due to the stress caused by your entire pop killed because you accidentally dropped a goblet on a temple \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1692975452, "timestamp_updated": 1692975452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144980518": {"recommendationid": "144980518", "author": {"steamid": "76561199502087195", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 892, "last_played": 1692963049}, "language": "english", "review": "very cool eel", "timestamp_created": 1692963134, "timestamp_updated": 1692963134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144973289": {"recommendationid": "144973289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022639320", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1068, "last_played": 1693064190}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, simple on the surface with a surprising amount of content and depth.

It's pretty cheap and that's a very good thing, else I would never recommend it.  In my review, I'll focus on the not so good aspects of the game.  The 96% positive reviews are nice, but is it really an instant buy kind of game?\n\nIt's a micromanagement hell or heaven, depending on what's your personal view on micromanagement.  As the game progresses and you get access to more buildings, more equipment, more villagers, it adds to the micromanagement required.\n\nEach villager can be equipped with 3 pieces of equipment.  Ofc, they get more powerful by doing so.  But the difference between most equipment is underwhelming.  As long as you have enough villagers and you equip them with something, you'll get pretty good results.\n\nRecipes for new stuff can be bought.  However, there's some RNG involved.  It took me forever to find the recipe for a smelter.  That stalled all progress.  I finally got it, but running in circle while waiting for it was not enjoyable.\n\nThe cards on the board keep getting kicked and moved for many reasons.  It is annoying.  There's an item that can help with that at some point, but it's not available early game and you'd need tons of it to really make a difference.\n\nMy villagers were slowly healing as time passed, no idea at what rate exactly.  However, I completed the game without ever finding another way to heal them out of combat.  It could be that it's just impossible.  Or it could be that I missed the way to do it.  Either way, it's bad.  If there is a way to heal them that I missed, it should have been more obvious than it is.\n\nI played for 30 hours.  I had fun for about half that time, which isn't bad for the price.  The rest was a grind, micromanagement, and more of the old stuff I had already seen.\n\n15 hours of fun.  Not too bad.

Like the crafting, exploration, and combat elements have very satisfying progression and that nice kind of slightly goofy creativity that makes this type of game fun.\n\n[h2]Upkeep[/h2]\n\nPut simply the game has way way too much upkeep. For upkeep tasks you have to feed your villagers, fight off attackers, keep yourself within the card limit, and organise your cards. Of these upkeep tasks combat and the card limit are fun challenges and the other two are painful chores.\n\nFirst of all organising cards in this game is really frustrating. The cards bounce off each other when they get too close, which keeps things from being covered but will quickly nudge all of your nicely lined up cards out of position. There are a lot of cards that produce more cards which makes the problem so much worse. This made me want to avoid what should be some of the most fun interactions in the game: opening card packs and exploring.\n\nThe card packs are especially frustrating for a few little reasons. You buy them from the top of the board, which is awful because stacks grow downward taking up more vertical space, so the top of the board would be the best place to put many things if not for this. There is also the incredibly obnoxious interaction where when you buy one with a chest it immediately puts the chest and pack on top of each other and they shove away from each other being as disruptive as possible for nearby cards.\n\nThe food system is frustrating for a few reasons. The major one is that because the food values needed for your villagers are so small, the crafting times for a lot of the steps in making food are very long. This makes it very easy to lose villagers barely to not having enough time to finish something. The time values in the game are hidden as well so you can't easily determine if this is going to happen ahead of time.\n\nThe other big frustration with food is that care was taken to make it difficult to automate. This means that you need to spend a lot of time coming back and babysitting it, and it makes a mess of the stuff around it spewing out cards. You do have the ability to take most actions while the game is paused, but taking advantage of that for every little thing slows the pace of the game to a crawl.\n\n[h2]Quality of Life[/h2]\n\nIt will be interesting if they keep adding to the game and improve on the above. They might also just be able to sidestep the problem by giving you enough quality of life to counterbalance the above issues.\n\nThe game has very low visibility in a few ways that would be fairly easy to improve and that would make it a lot easier to manage the chaos.\n\nThe first of which is the fact that the kind of minimal aesthetic of the game really hurts your ability to be able to quickly see what is going on. On the cards themselves the easiest things to make out are the card type, the health/food, and the value. With the exception of enemy cards being easy to spot these are some of the least important bits of information to give priority to. The card icons need to be the most obvious things on the card. An accessibility option to make the icon circle in a different colour for each individual card would help enormously with playing the game(even if it makes it much uglier). The icons of similar cards also look very similar which looks great but doesn\u2019t help with telling them apart. This wouldn\u2019t help much with when the cards are stacked though, the name line would have to be clearer for that or there would have to be some other indicator(like showing a task icon for what is happening above the top card).\n\nThe other visibility issues that show up are that cards with higher numbers on them could probably use other indicators to help the user quickly parse them at a glance (like chest fullness as a bar), you don\u2019t really have any way of knowing how many cards you have and where, the unnecessary info box scroll is infuriating, it isn\u2019t easy to see what the stats of weapons are(or how they sum up), and you need to click through to see what equipment villagers have.\n\n[h2]Good Stuff[/h2]\n\nThis is the only game I\u2019ve ever played where regular enemy invasions aren\u2019t infuriating. For how often they happen they have a good amount of variety, they aren\u2019t that disruptive, and they drop great loot. Having them just drop all sorts of random things is a great decision. You don\u2019t have that many of any item at a time in the game and resources stay useful for a long time. This is a lot more fun than the typical dropping just equipment/money/food that many games do which gets repetitive much faster.\n\nThe game has a lot of stuff in it so you keep getting those good dopamine hits from unlocking more useful stuff pretty often(especially compared to most roguelikes).

Equip your villagers and enter into automated turn-based combat, enforced by a rock-paper-scissors class advantage system and defeat small hordes of somewhat horrifying enemies such as wolves, skeletons and slimes.\n- [Direct and open relationships] Unlike Baldur's Gate characters (Which I've never played at all since I'm not a lame dnd fanatic), villagers do not have any feelings or judgement whatsoever. There is no race involved. No care about gender or ethics. No one cares if you romanced the red tomboy because you got lucky on a few dice rolls and took her out on a few dates in a dungeon or something. You place two villager cards on a house card and you get a baby card. That's it. Any two villagers. So much better than having artificial feelings involved.\n- [Party management] Don't worry about mulling over character sheets, each villager has their own head slot, armor slot, and a weapon slot that defines their class. That's it. If they die, they drop all their items and leave the world forever, waiting for you to hook two random villagers up to make a replacement.

Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle.\n\nSTEP 17\nGlaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.\n\nSTEP 18\nChill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.\n\nSTEP 19\nBrush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp \u2013 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices.\n\nThe game very good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n", "timestamp_created": 1691441338, "timestamp_updated": 1691441338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492957741022109985", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143612572": {"recommendationid": "143612572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198854421911", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 376, "last_played": 1691440783}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego, lo recomiendo para los que le gusten los juegos de cartas y la gesti\u00f3n de recursos, aqu\u00ed hicieron una mezcla casi perfecta.

The production could stop also if the crane detects a full crate. \n- When more cranes pick up from the same resource magnet, currently one crane is favored over the others in transferring the item, resulting in an uneven distribution of goods.

Unlocked \"ideas\" persist between games so while you might take until day 24 to figure out how to build a lumber camp on your first game, you could focus on getting one ASAP the next game.

I think it's worth the price and is a fun game - keep that in mind as I go into a bit more detail about some of the friction points down below.\n\nAs I mentioned, Stacklands tends to become a bit of a slog as time goes on. It kind of has the 'inventory hell' problem that some games have, where you're essentially a god but still have to figure out where you're going to put all these damn sticks that keep filling up you pockets. It's a bit overwhelming when you have so many cards, which themselves are producing cards. And yes, you can create chests, but I haven't figured out a convenient way to access the things inside the chests besides taking them out one at a time. And cards slide around all over the place unless you have glue, which kind of sucks to make. And yes, you can automate things using a crane, but those suck to make too, and also take up a lot of space to use. And at some point you'll be swimming in coins. You can make a wishing well to help throw them away, but the materials required to make it appear (at least for me) only once you're neck deep in coins. Maybe I'm asking too much. It seems like a lot of solutions exist, but they're pretty DIY - what I would like are some kind of global improvements (ie make this and now all cards will stick in place) or something of the like. The solutions themselves feel like a bit of a hassle, and often come when you're absolutely clamoring for them (which I get is a balance - but it feels too weighted in favor of the 'generating need' side rather than the 'fixing the issue' side). \n\nAgain, Stackland is a great game with a lot of heart, I just think some tweaks to utilities would make more enjoyable for me personally.", "timestamp_created": 1687486757, "timestamp_updated": 1687486757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140527080": {"recommendationid": "140527080", "author": {"steamid": "76561199075204497", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1687480962}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tetas y magia \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1687481218, "timestamp_updated": 1687481218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140516679": {"recommendationid": "140516679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253860986", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2171, "last_played": 1687465487}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little way to spend a day.

Everyone who loves this game must be suffering from some sort of stockholm syndrome. Everything gets moved around to destroy your organization whenever anything spawns or moves through it. Your cards producing other cards will throw things you've placed near them away, even occasionally when they should stack. The item you can create through a rough grind of resources to stick your cards in place disables most stacking or production, rendering it pointless.\n\nAfter having done some research, I have come to the conclusion all these frustrating aspects of the game are entirely intentional. Most of the game is designed to look relaxing and neat with obvious systems in place for organization and growth. The rest of the game is programmed to disallow these features to work to the frustration of the player. There is no ultimate point to the game other than forcing the player to power through these obstacles with mechanics shown in the future to mitigate them. As described, these mechanics simply do not work and force the player into extra grinds for no benefit.\n\nAbsolutely a waste of time, and that would be fine if it was a relaxing waste of time.

Para mi es uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado \u00faltimamente, sin exagerar. A ojos de cualquiera puede parecer un juego bastante sencillo, con una interfaz que al principio no acaba de convencer y te piensas que es el t\u00edpico juego mal hecho y con unas mec\u00e1nicas tope rebuscadas e injugables. Pero no, para mi sorpresa es todo lo contrario. Ahora explicar\u00e9 punto por punto todo lo bueno y malo que tiene este juego.\n\nPara empezar el objetivo del juego es acabar con lo que parece ser una bruja dentro la cu\u00e1l amenaza a nuestro pueblo con m\u00faltiples hordas de enemigos cuando aparece el extra\u00f1o portal (aunque hay algunos jefes los cuales tambi\u00e9n te supondr\u00e1n un desaf\u00edo acabar con ellos). Tienes que evitar a toda costa que estos monstruos acaben con tus aldeanos ya que si mueren todos, acabar\u00eda tu partida. \n\nEl nombre del juego representa totalmente la mec\u00e1nica de este, ya que vas a tener que hacer stacks, muchos stacks, para completar este juego y avanzar en \u00e9l. La verdad que nunca me hubiese imaginado que un juego con este tipo de mec\u00e1nica pudiese enganchar tanto. \n\nOrganizarte en este juego es crucial, ya que vas a notar que cuando est\u00e9s haciendo muchos stacks, las cartas se van a ver colisionadas entre s\u00ed provocando a\u00fan mas el desorden en tu tablero. Pero este juego la verdad es que ha pensado en todo. Para ello puedes fabricar cofres de almacenamiento, que poni\u00e9ndolos debajo de una mina o fundici\u00f3n, los materiales se guardan autom\u00e1ticamente en ellos, y no solo eso, esta a tu disposici\u00f3n la fabricaci\u00f3n del pegamento, el cu\u00e1l hace que cualquier stack que tengas sobre \u00e9l, se quede pegado en el tablero y deje de moverse, algo que es muy necesario a la hora de tener un juego limpio y organizado.\n\nExisten dos tipos de biomas en los que vas a poder jugar, uno ser\u00e1 el bosque y el otro la playa. Esto lo hace mas refrescante aun, ya que dentro de cada bioma podr\u00e1s hacer unas cosas y en el otro otras, invit\u00e1ndote a descubrir nuevos crafteos y funciones dentro de cada uno.\n\nEn cuanto a las batallas con criaturas, no hay nada que destacar, el combate es muy sencillo. Tampoco se le puede pedir mucho mas a un juego de este estilo, no va a tener un combate super desarrollado. Pero s\u00ed que se tendr\u00e1 en cuenta la armadura y el arma que usen tus aldeanos para poder hacer x cantidades de da\u00f1os a ciertos enemigos. Algunos enemigos son mas vulnerables a la magia y otros al da\u00f1o f\u00edsico, por lo que te hace pensar en alg\u00fan tipo de estrategia antes de combatir contra ciertos enemigos.\n\nLa verdad es que todo tiene una funci\u00f3n y todo tiene un porqu\u00e9, tiene tan bien cimentadas las bases y tan bien ejecutada las mec\u00e1nicas y funciones que se van desarrollando que pocos fallos se le pueden atribuir a este t\u00edtulo.\n\nPasar\u00e1s inevitablemente por todos los crafteos, edificaciones, funciones posibles que ofrece el juego para pas\u00e1rtelo al 100%. Esta muy bien pensado el hecho de que todo, en cierta manera, est\u00e9 ligado para lograr un objetivo.\n\nQuiz\u00e1 algo que me parec\u00eda desesperante y ocurr\u00eda de seguido, era al combatir contra un monstruo con un grupo grande de aldeanos.  Lo que ocurr\u00eda era que todos los aldeanos se pon\u00edan en fila y de alguna manera lograba mover y desordenar mis stacks incluso con pegamento.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, un juego muy divertido, adictivo y con un precio asequible, lo cual me hace preguntarte \u00bfQu\u00e9 haces que no lo has comprado ya?", "timestamp_created": 1684251463, "timestamp_updated": 1684252065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138365097": {"recommendationid": "138365097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256901660", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 369, "last_played": 1696221864}, "language": "english", "review": "At first I thought this game would suck... 6 hours later I realized that I was indeed, wrong.

It has equal amount of incredible and horrible parts:\n\n[h1]Incredible: [/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is incredible: The mix of factorio with more active playstyle is fun to play. How many hours of AFK have you put into games with resources? Minecraft, factorio, cookie clicker, they all have the issue of boring stretches of waiting as your farms give you the necessary resources to continue playing the game.\n\nThis game solves it neatly. There aren't some minigames to play while you build up resources or other gimmicks to make the wait worthwhile. Instead, time itself is used as a resource because of the day mechanic, not as an arbitrary roadblock to lengthen the time used in the game: A villager building something needs few seconds, which prevents them from gathering food, generating valuables or fighting monsters. And at end of each day, you need food to sustain the villagers. So time is an resource. It's a simple solution, and it works.\n\n[h1]Mid:[/h1]\n\nThe user experience could be better. Many reviews complain about some basic mechanic like how animals and monsters push your cards around and how it's hard to organize an automatic factory because generated cards are placed randomly around the table. There are in-game solutions to these though, like animal pens and resource magnets.\n\nHowever, having the recipes and items required for these solutions unlocked randomly as the game progresses is a stupid decision.\n\nIf there's an issue with user experience, why not fix it at the source? Why do animals and monsters push cards around? Why are generated cards placed randomly? There's no good reason to do this, it doesn't change how the game is played, it just makes it more annoying before you have unlocked the solution for these issues.\n\n[h1]Horrible:[/h1]\n\nEven if some issues have in-game solutions, many don't. Cards stack downwards, so creating a proper storage step between two generative cards is impossible. If the cards stack too much, it's end cannot be reached by other cards and cannot be pulled from or pushed into without micromanaging the stacks. There's many of minor issues like these that cascade into larger annoyances, from how 1/8th of all board space is used by board space increasing cards to how the best automatic food farms, like a milk farm, fill 1/4th of the board with all the food it's generating, and you can't turn them off and back on easily.\n\nThere is even a secondary playfield you can unlock, which is meant to be a \"hard\" mode, as unused food spoils over time. But you can just use hot pots to store the foods without spoilage, which trivializes the entire mechanic.", "timestamp_created": 1683833877, "timestamp_updated": 1683833877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487987995147705078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138142953": {"recommendationid": "138142953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043998750", "num_games_owned": 1075, "num_reviews": 172, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1683819717}, "language": "english", "review": "Stacklands is a simple game that you can complete relatively quickly.

Absolutely recommended, especially for only $5!\n\nI do have a few things to gripe about:\n\nIf you really get into the weeds on resource management (mid/endgame), you'll find some of the automation tools they added to the game are kind of half baked.  They work sometimes and other times, they are frustrating.  [spoiler]  Cranes can just start flinging cards around for no particular reason.  They can fix themselves without intervention.  Or not.  I found this happened most often when multiple cranes were pulling from the same source.  Cards get a little moved around? No problem, the crane just grabbed your lumberjack and threw him into the sawmill.  Totally fine.  -_- [/spoiler]  Anyway, once I discovered how unreliable these were, I quickly discarded plans to fully automate my food supply.  Handling some wood production, sure, but not something that could result in villagers starving if it broke.\n\nAnimals and fights knocking around your carefully arranged cards becomes a test of your patience.  Either you accept it or you don't.\n\nI wish there was a better explanation of combat.  I eventually figured it out on my own, but for about the first half of the game, I just let my villagers fight.  I had no idea that you could rearrange your units *during combat* to achieve the most efficient match ups.

I would of paid a good $15 for it if I knew how fun it'd be for me personally!\nBasically, it's a card game.. And a resource management game.. And a rogue like? Somehow, it's all of that and more! The card game part is more of an aesthetic until you get to combat, where it very much is, with enemy types, equipment, weapons, and headgear to choose from to change your card's battling type (Magic, Range, or Melee).\nFor resource management, that's almost the entirety of the game. You use your villagers to make sure you have food to feed those villagers. Then you have to make sure you don't have too many cards on your board that you have to sell them, so you build Sheds and Warehouses, which also expands the board itself. The more villagers you have, the more you can do, and you even need multiple villagers to build something like a temple (Don't do anything with the temple until you're ready to fight something with like 300 HP, which is a lot when your little guys do around 1-4 damage). \nNow for the rogue like. How is it a rogue like? You learn, that's how! You unlock ideas and card packs as you play. Ideas are like your own personal wiki, they tell you how to build things and a little bit of what those things do. You also unlock new card packs by doing quests. When all of your villagers die and you have to start over the game, it weirdly isn't as frustrating as it can be for some games. I think this is because you've gained Ideas, yes, but also general knowledge. You know what you need to do for the future. You now know the recipes, but also how to make sure you don't die or what's the most stable way of feeding your village to the point you can safely increase the population.\nObviously, I heavily suggest this game for those who like resource management specifically, since it's most of the game and the other aspects are significantly less prevalent, but pleasantly there.", "timestamp_created": 1683089288, "timestamp_updated": 1683089288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137708312": {"recommendationid": "137708312", "author": {"steamid": "76561199500677382", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1463, "last_played": 1684134431}, "language": "english", "review": "this is good very good its the best", "timestamp_created": 1683077466, "timestamp_updated": 1683077466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137702669": {"recommendationid": "137702669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869983036", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1690734835}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little game.

In this case, the difference is that Stacklands is also something of a colony builder, with small elements of action. It obviously doesn't match the narrative experience of Weather Factory's machines, but that's fine - this one is more about chill vibes and an enjoyable experience.  Mechanically, it is mostly the games superior, with clear objectives, good guideposts, satisfying loops, and a rising complexity of action.\n\nWhere the game generally falls down is in the later stages - the more cards you are managing, the more you want for effective tools to prevent busywork.  Manually sifting through manure so you can create individual farm plots in the dozens feels awkward, particularly when the obvious fix would be to just dump the food into the poop and let the computer sort it out.  Clean lines of automation feel vaguely possible, were it not for the abundance of intersecting cards constantly jostle and reorganize your board while you are playing on it.  The stacks dont ever condense, they simply reach absurd sizes that consume your table space and defy any hope of efficiently organizing.\n\nBefore you have reached the more interesting stages of the game you will be utterly swamped assigning something like 20-40 individual actions or recipes a minute just to try to make reasonably productive use of your time, and consulting a list of hundreds of recipes with minimal search functionality (you can search for an end product by name but can't search for products by their ingredients, which is frustrating when trying to remember what, say, magic dust goes into, or what the third tier of building type X is).  The brain burn becomes pretty real, and I wasn't inclined to find the final objectives due to the levels of annoyance in setting them up.\n\n That being said, for a fairly relaxed card game, this game has a flexible level of depth, an appealing aesthetic, and a pretty balanced set of systems.  It's fun to explore, lasts a good chunk of hours, and is a good mix of challenging and (usually) fair.

It's a town sim, turned into a card game where you stack cards together to make things happen. You have to make sure your villagers have enough food by the end of the time, and you've got to keep your cards within the maximum board limit, which you can expand through crafting certain storage cards.\n\nIt's a game that, although early on can be bothersome to open packs and get the right cards you need, is absolutely worth the price. I originally stole it from a friend's library, but it felt like a highway robbery to not get it for myself. For the low low price of 4 USD/EUR/WhateverCurrencyYouUse\u2122, you can get anywhere from 8-12 hours of gameplay out of this bad boy. \n\nIt's mainly a relaxing management game before anything else, and I would definitely recommend it if you want to break the mold and have a breath of fresh air. The downside is that there isn't too much replayability unless you're planning to try your hand at speedrunning it, but that's not worth mentioning vs how enjoyable your first run will be.

Despite some attempts to mitigate this in the Order & Structure update, it is an unavoidable end result of the questionable decision to go with physically interactive cards . The promotional trailers and screenshot always show you a board with few cards, because the later boards are always a mess of cards pushing each other, or glitching around the edges of the board. You can embark on the mission of using the newly added logistic cards to mitigate this, but those are janky as well, so you will spend about the same time establishing your genius board as you would by constantly fixing it instead. I have to question the decision of the developers to stick to the whole \"physically interacting cards\" gimmick, especially that there seems to be no upside to it.\n\nThe game currently does not feature any replayability \u2014 it is a simple exercise of completing all the quests, and, if you want, getting all the cards. This is fine, I got 20 hours out of it, but the game uses \"run\" terminology \u2014 as in, calling starting a new game \"new run\" \u2014 implying that it was desired. So I am mentioning this.\n\nOther than that, stacking cards to turn them into other cards, that will allow you to get different cards, which will get you booster packs with even more new cards is very rewarding, and therefore addictive.

This game takes the actual actions of punching trees for wood, mining rocks, and all the usual early-survival game action and turns it into a card game. Stack certain card combos and you can upgrade, receive new items, and create new buildings. Like many survival games, it is all about balance; you have to make sure you have enough villagers to ensure you can fight off mobs, but you also have to make sure you have enough food production to feed those villagers.

Stacklands is nothing short of a masterpiece giving life to each card that is available in such a refreshing way.

It's not. It's roughly a 20-30 hour game, and it's ridiculously cheap.\n\nYou do almost everything in the game by making stacks of cards. The simplest is to drag a villager on top of a berry bush to harvest berries. Make a garden by dragging some cards on top of a Soil card, farm vegetables by dragging them on top of the Garden.\n\nThe main loops are setting up reliable food production, making more villagers, making money, gathering and refining resources, and making tools, weapons, and armor for your villagers. \n\nIt plays in real time, but you can pause at any time and re-arrange things. I did a *lot* of pausing, myself.\n\nNow and then there's combat. You sell cards periodically to buy \"booster packs\" of unknown cards, and the more advanced packs sometimes include monsters you must fight instead of new resources. You pile  your fighters on to the monster, and they exchange blows until they die or the monster's defeated.\n\n\"Research\" in the game is \"idea\" cards, which tell you about a card combination, and permanently record the details in your research log. You can figure some things out on your own easily, like smelter + ore + wood -> metal bars, but the combinations for most advanced buildings aren't obvious.\n\nThis game seems purposely designed to frustrate players who like things neat and organized. When cards pop out from a building, if they land near another card, they'll push that card away. You can make neat rows of cards for a production line, but you're guaranteed that after a few cycles of production it'll be a mess because of cards pushing each other.\n\nThere are cards that make your playing area bigger. There doesn't seem to be an upper limit to your village space, but it's still going to be a colossal mess by the late game.\n\nOther than that, it doesn't have a lot of downsides.

great survival game made into a relaxing game of cards. Though this game may not be technologically advanced, the visuals have a nice hand-drawn visual art style that will pull you right in. Time to stack on this review.\n\nArtstyle:\nAs already stated this game has a hand-drawn visual art style. The cards may not have lots of detail, but you know exactly what they are and what they do. This game is simple but in a relaxing homemade fashion. \n\nAtmosphere:\nThe calm music and visuals will help soothe you even when all your villagers are dying and fighting evil pirates. This game delivers a great stacking card game that keeps on going. Nothing more needed to mention on the atmosphere that you can't already observe in the trailer. \n\nGameplay:\nDon't be deceived by the title and screenshots, this game is not necessarily a deck builder but rather a survival game made out of cards. It's actually a really nice pairing but there is no \"hand\" in this game. It is a game where you perform actions by stacking cards on one another rather than controlling a character to an object to perform the action. \n\nPrice:\nA great game for the price and even better on sale!\n\nConclusion:\nLook I really enjoyed the game. It's just one of the few survivor games that I would consider relaxing. The game has its own charm and golly is this game addicting.  \n\nScore:\n8/10 Berries", "timestamp_created": 1679250468, "timestamp_updated": 1679542381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134987075": {"recommendationid": "134987075", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997792412", "num_games_owned": 1191, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1673715558}, "language": "english", "review": "Stacklands is a game about stacking cards. It is not a card game yet has everything to do with cards. Everything is a card and all of them can be stacked as a means of progression.\n\nSee a rock? That\u2019s a card. See a villager? Card again. Stack them. Get some stone out of it. That stone? Yup, another card. Stack three stone and you got a block, which is a card. You get the idea. The basic formula is a tried and true one; villagers are workers and get fed once a day or die, resources get worked, farmed and improved, research is done and the game progresses. Oh no, what\u2019s this? An evil witch has sent monsters to kill you? Kill them back, find out where they are coming from and prepare for a boss battle.\n\nThe formula works well and Stacklands doesn\u2019t push any new boundaries there but manages to strike the perfect balance between survival, combat and growth. This makes the game easy to get into while packaging it in a card format makes it unique and interesting enough to keep one engaged.\n\nCombat is simple and consists of turn based auto attacking by every card in the bout. No user input required. The meat of the game is resource management and growth anyway so keeping the focus away from micro managing combat is a good way to achieve that. Most of the time will be spent on making sure your villagers have enough to eat by the end of the day and securing enough resources to make the next big thig that will progress you further. Combat comes when progress is halted due to missing key components which can only be obtained through combat. Either you choose to fight or the fight comes to you eventually. Resource progression and advancement doesn\u2019t get too deep which keeps the game short and sweet while the mystery of what\u2019s to come keeps you plugged in and stacking cards.\n\nSokpop Collective have outdone themselves with this game. Their philosophy of making short games and pumping them out one by one with technical quality and a loving hand proves once again; while these games may not be as deep and lengthy as one hopes, especially when they are at the level of quality as Stacklands, it is reassuring to know we get to try more unique experiences than the collective 20 year output of a triple A studio.\n\nStacklands is great: fun, easy to pick up, unique and full of references. 10-15 hours to 100% for 4\u20ac, dare I even ask?", "timestamp_created": 1679250087, "timestamp_updated": 1679250087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787373840808868408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134980937": {"recommendationid": "134980937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139169658", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 286, "last_played": 1679674531}, "language": "english", "review": "surprisingly a lot of things to do wasn't expecting the game to be as deep as it is \nnice game overall", "timestamp_created": 1679244366, "timestamp_updated": 1679244366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134977218": {"recommendationid": "134977218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859188298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1682277783}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Simplemente perfecto, entretenido, y divertido.", "timestamp_created": 1679241088, "timestamp_updated": 1679241088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134975816": {"recommendationid": "134975816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006539860", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1677341574}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than a sandwich and a pack of crisps for about the same price.", "timestamp_created": 1679239899, "timestamp_updated": 1679239899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134975044": {"recommendationid": "134975044", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089045314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 371, "last_played": 1686779276}, "language": "english", "review": "gam fun.

Combat, starvation, and villager deaths brought an appropriate amount of intensity to decisions; however, with enough strategy and forethought, the player isn\u2019t doomed to failure by chance alone, as is often the case in other games like it. Stacklands features a pleasing array of resources and crafting combinations, and I had a constant feeling of progression while playing it as the new unlocks were well-paced and kept me engaged. \n\n[spoiler]The secondary locations, the Desert Island and Dark Forest, brought some interesting new challenges. Their mechanical difference in allowing a subset of villagers there, yet if they died you resume control over the others, allowing a more relaxed sense of \u2018adventuring\u2019 since you don\u2019t have to risk it all for exploration and have a monster wipe your whole village.[/spoiler]\n\nThe game showed a few sore spots for improvement, however. Some RNG in deck pulls was abysmal, with clearly no forgiveness mechanics built in / guaranteed pull rate. This was irritating when I was trying to pull for inexpensive resources (sand, flint, soil) and it took dozens of attempts to pull one, as if the game knew what I wanted and refused. Additionally, I\u2019m not sure why anchoring/auto-sorting card stacks had to require their own expensive recipes to aid in UX -- that felt like something that should have been configurable, and not having it felt odd and mildly inconvenient. \n\nAll in all, Stacklands is a bargain for its price. While I don\u2019t think Stacklands brings anything particularly innovative to the genre and it lacks replayability once you beat it, it\u2019s a fun time and I definitely enjoyed myself. At a mere $5, this game well surpassed my expectations.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1677117812, "timestamp_updated": 1677117812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133391823": {"recommendationid": "133391823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215633640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 445, "last_played": 1677464098}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome and fun!", "timestamp_created": 1677117385, "timestamp_updated": 1677117385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133380038": {"recommendationid": "133380038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200496894", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1677095732}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego es tremendamente redondo.

Wealth of content for such a small game. Gets chaotic if you let it. Easily worth twice the asking price.

They went back and added a lot of content with the surprising popularity of this game. I'd honestly like it developed even more though. \n\nSome automation features are very imprecise, which normally would be fine, except it beats the purpose of automation if you are always having to manually fix the imprecisions. And it could use a few more things to flush out that system. \n\nIt could use basic polish like multiple save files.\n\nThe game could be greatly extended with longevity content. Such as challenge runs. Like no pause, limited pack purchases, worse/less pack contents, beat the game without ____, etc. \n\nI would easily by an expansion for the game with these features and more content. To be clear, it doesn't need more content. Mostly, i think some additional bosses or combat arenas (that don't mess with your layout). The bosses can mostly all be beat with the same strat. So different mechanics that require different counters would be interesting. Though I don't feel combat is the major focus of the game. \n\nSo that's just to point out where the game could use improvement. But it's absolutely a great game as is!

As you sell things you can buy more card packs, that come with more resources and \"ideas\" for how to build new things and further your society. It's rogue-like in nature - you can get wiped by a monster invasion or not have enough food to feed your peeps, and then you start over haha.\n\nSticking with it and learning to adapt are important - you learn faster that way. I wiped a couple times before I really got in the groove and made it to end game. It felt good to be rewarded for innovation and sticking with the upfront difficulty.\n\nVisuals are a simple and fun hand drawn feel. Nothing crazy, but it gets the job done.\n\nAnd that's basically it haha. I don't want to say too much because I want people to experience it for themselves, it really was a blast.

The polish is a bit lacking in some areas, and after a dozen turns or so it can get tedious to manage all the cards within the time of a turn. The game is also actually quite rich in content, which is great and motivating to play further, but this depth takes also the form of a large amount of resources to manage, which again quickly gets strenuous.\nI can however, completely see myself coming back to this game from time to time, and having a great hour building my little card village and being crushed by goblin archers. I don't think I will ever try to 100% the game and its quests, since after 20 turns or so the game requires some very involved micro-management.

The concept isn't too far from your traditional game like Civilization except it's far simply and cards replace your units, resources, and structures. \n\nIt also has a likeness to a game like Minecraft where you have to collect resources and learn about the various crafting recipes. Learning about recipes is actually a huge aspect of the game and is called, \"Insight\". You can earn money and sell cards you don't need then use the money to buy card packs which have a chance of include Insight cards: cards that have new crafting recipes. You can also feel free to experiment of resource combinations to try and guess the crafting recipes on your own.\n\nI thought this game would have a high learning, but it is designed very well. From the get-go you are introduced with quests that guide you in learning how the game works. If you lose in the first few runs, it's no biggy because you pick up the quests and insight where you left off. It's up to you to bring back all the resources you had before.\n\nI would guess that I am about 70% way through the game by now. At this point I only have two major complaints: as you get further into the game, you will start to have [i]lots[/i] of cards in your hand. This produces two problems: \n\n(1) A good chunk of your time will be devoted to constructing \"sheds\" which increase the amount of cards you can have in your hand by 4. This number is a pretty big deal in the early game, but by late game it is small and insignificant compared to the amount of cards you will be needing. Thus a considerable amount of time will be spent constructing sheds. A fix would be to introduce an upgraded version of the shed that can be constructed with late-game materials.\n\n(2) You can stack cards, but stacks can't overlap. When you make something, the new card is spat out in it's own stack. This new stack can sometime overlap with existing stacks and cause things to shuffle around. This becomes very annoying when you have many strategically placed stacks; bogging down your efficiency. It would be nice if there were an \"anchor\" card that would prevent this.\n\n[h3]Steam Deck Notes:[/h3]\n\nRuns great. The default controls are nearly perfect. I would recommend rebinding R1 to hide the quests menu since that functionality is not bound by default.\n\nThere are only two problems I have come across: \n\n(1) Normally to pause the game, you press \"B\". Then \"Y\" is used to accelerate the game time. Now when you open the quest menu, the game pauses on its own and resumes when you close the menu. But if you manually pause the game before opening the menu then close it, the game will remain paused. [b]However[/b], to resume the game you will have to press \"Y\". For some reason, \"B\" stops working when you do this.\n\n(2) There are certain in-game events that cause a small notification menu that pops up in the middle of the screen. For some reason, there is no way to close the menu (that I know of) using the controller. So you will have to use \"Steam+<modifier>\" to manually close the menu.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43582006-Tooth-Brushers]My curator page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1675905445, "timestamp_updated": 1675905445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132444155": {"recommendationid": "132444155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247839710", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 360, "last_played": 1690221067}, "language": "spanish", "review": "who the hell needs games with ultra high realistic Unreal Engine 5 RTX 4090TI 69GB RAM i13 17k graphics when you hav:\n\ncard gaem.", "timestamp_created": 1675896875, "timestamp_updated": 1675896875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132443663": {"recommendationid": "132443663", "author": {"steamid": "76561199094061349", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1675980346}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun", "timestamp_created": 1675895979, "timestamp_updated": 1675895979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132433517": {"recommendationid": "132433517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251386358", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1675617147}, "language": "english", "review": "love it", "timestamp_created": 1675880553, "timestamp_updated": 1675880553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132433193": {"recommendationid": "132433193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288128473", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2881, "last_played": 1685109356}, "language": "english", "review": "very enjoyable. relaxing...", "timestamp_created": 1675880062, "timestamp_updated": 1675880062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132432027": {"recommendationid": "132432027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368050705", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1503, "last_played": 1673074697}, "language": "english", "review": "Pure Addictions", "timestamp_created": 1675878365, "timestamp_updated": 1675878365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132412551": {"recommendationid": "132412551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393236840", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1385, "last_played": 1675910122}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun base-builder card game that will bring out your min-maxing skill.
