That last point I found particularly surprising: you see I was not expecting to have a seamless auditory experience while playing this thing, but the composer indeed took the amazing extra step to create transitory segments between consecutive tracks where sampling from the next track randomly starts taking over the instrumental of the still ongoing one for a couple seconds before the real track itself begins. Sometimes the game is way too unforgiving and demands absolute precision despite it's not-so-great controls, but all things considered I had a fun time.

You move around on inline skates and can do all kinds of fun tricks. There are many unlockable characters you can have join your crew, and they have varying stats on attributes like speed and technique. You can design your own tags in multiple sizes in an in- game editor, (which I found very robust with many options,) or you can select from one of a number of pre- made designs. There is controller support (which I would recommend using). Again, the controls are pretty good once you learn it.\n    Overall I would recommend adding this game to your steam library (I found myself not wanting to turn it off).

Whilst I had not engaged with any of the side missions/levels, the main story only took me 3-4 hours to complete. That's 3-4 very fun hours, but just an extra hour or two would have been greatly appreciated.

The story is not exactly the most memorable story you'd find, but it rounds out the game a bit with some lore. The gameplay is fun and funky. The addition of police officers shooting at and using flamethrowers against a simple graffiti-spraying rollerskater may seem a bit extreme.

This port has some issues, but if it's your only option then don't pass up the chance to play the game.\n\nLet me preface this by saying JSR is a bit of an oddball among SEGA's DC-era franchises.  The controls are somewhat stiff, and while serviceable for the game it definitely makes things harder for beginners than other games (including its own Sequel and BRC).  But at the same time, the game's artstyle and soundtrack are unrivaled-- Hideki Naganuma and the other artists are masters of their craft, Rob Zombie is there for some reason, it's Iconic.  The game loop is simple yet addicting despite the controls, with chaining tricks and whatnot being extremely satisfying.  I could go on, it's very much a Style over Substance kinda game but in the best way (that being that the Substance isn't far behind).\n\nBut this is also the kind of game I'd suggest nabbing on another console.  This port is... not that great, as has been the case with a lot of the Steam DC ports sadly.  Notably, the game doesn't like to load properly on startup off a fresh install-- you have to go in and literally swap the Config and Game names in the files for it to run.  And certain graphical effects, namely the little light trails when you jump or go fast enough to trick, simply stop working if you play on resolutions above 720p.\n\nIn short, if you have a DC, 360, or PS3, get the game there.  If not, then do know that there WILL come some trouble trying to get the PC port to work.  Otherwise, great game, definitely try it out.", "timestamp_created": 1694026452, "timestamp_updated": 1694060285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584114551544189453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145771163": {"recommendationid": "145771163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120796113", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 887, "last_played": 1695075116}, "language": "english", "review": "Best with a controller", "timestamp_created": 1693990925, "timestamp_updated": 1693990925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145722669": {"recommendationid": "145722669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413641921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1693938404}, "language": "english", "review": "best \u00a35 ive spent in a long time", "timestamp_created": 1693938465, "timestamp_updated": 1693938465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145716173": {"recommendationid": "145716173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069829877", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1696785114}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not a forgiving game at all, its also really fun if you can get past that.

Even the sequel/spiritual successor Jet Set Radio Future--which is an overall huge improvement on this game--doesn't surpass this game when it comes to pure aesthetics. This is a truly special game.\n\nHowever, this port is awful. I can't get past the 3rd level because the game will just randomly crash, and when I looked up how to stop the game from crashing... there's no real solution.

The game made me want to slam my desk a few times and im a type who seldom gets angry at a game. However, I loved the style so much that I've decided to tough it out.

First, she lets you into the land of dreams, after which you go into the abyss, filled with a lot of torment and suffering until the very end. This does not happen immediately, but afterwards you stumble on every ledge in the hope of passing the level.\n\nBut let's start not with this, but with the individuality of this product. This is a truly great game that has its own style, original music by Hideki Naganuma and gives you the opportunity to express yourself in all colors. In addition, it has a very interesting level design, in which you can get confused at some point, but once you understand the movement, you understand at the click of your fingers where you painted over, where you didn't paint over, where you got, and where you didn't have to get.\n\nFurther, cops are a separate conversation. Here I am ready to pay tribute to the SEGA company, they stuffed up to the very throat. These devils are very heavy in the later stages of the game, and if it seemed to you that tanks are not a problem, try to fight off the gang pack on jetpacks with machine guns in your hands. I assure you, you will not get bored :)\n\nAnyway, the most curious thing I noticed about this game is how it teaches you. At first you are happy, then you get high, the high turns into anger because of the stupid controls and the police officers embracing the character from all sides, but slowly you begin to memorize tracks, a movement, use different tactics to complete the level, try to do more (or less), which, in the end, is rewarded with rank. And yes, there are about six ranks there, and the latter are not very bad, and at the same time not comforting, it still spurs a person to get better results.\n\nActually, that's all I wanted to say, I passed it only today.\n\nThank you for your attention, good luck in your endeavors!", "timestamp_created": 1693244856, "timestamp_updated": 1693244856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595530807971954346", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145194235": {"recommendationid": "145194235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318190080", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1693245509}, "language": "english", "review": "Nostalgia is one hell of a drug, makes you forget the major issues this game had and that's Controls/Gameplay everything else is amazing but my god why are the controls constantly restricting and fighting my inputs.

This game really shows its age considering lot of games that dropped in the same era control much tighter and is way more responsive (jesus the graffiti prompts don't even trigger properly 80 percent of the time) For its time it was really something special but revisiting this many years later I cannot in good conscious recommend this title.

Cyberfunk is, here are a few reminders. This game is old and tho looks great the gameplay can be frustrating. I\u2019m playing both games simultaneously for the first time and JSR hasn\u2019t been as fun of a play through as BRC. It was surprisingly slower paced than what I expected, just never felt like my character got any good speed. The grinding mechanics stink because you have to land the blades perfectly in the center of the rails. There is no snap to help guide your character if you are off by a bit. The levels are too small and random things are placed in areas where you would either jump into a rail or jump out from a grind. The visuals are stunning, which is enough to keep me wanting to play the game and collect the graffiti.

Very good soundtrack for the most part and the art style is really cool.\nGot me more hyped for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk if anything, a game like this with modern controls would be so sick.", "timestamp_created": 1691970391, "timestamp_updated": 1692014470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144130745": {"recommendationid": "144130745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198953419762", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1587489667}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick:\n\n5/5 \n\nThis is one of my favorite games.  Jet Set Radio is a unique game, that has become somewhat of a cult classic with the help of its even better sequel Jet Set Radio Future.  It has an interesting story and premise, with a whole cast of colorful and likable characters.  When you play the game, you feel good about everything that you're doing.  The tone is lighthearted and a little bit comical, which can be perfect if you're looking for a game that is challenging, yet also relaxing.\n\n\n\nMore:\n\nI remember when Jet Set Radio first released.  The cel shaded graphics were still somewhat new at the time, and it helped the game to stand out.  It looks great, even today, and is one of my favorite aspects of the game.  There is a strong 90's aesthetic in the game, with bright colors and almost retro-ish character designs all over the place.  Spray painting or tagging is the main mechanic of the game, so naturally the spray painted graffiti art style makes itself apparent everywhere.  \n\nVisually the game is as good looking as it is unique.  There is a simplicity to the models and the environment that is complimentary to the style.  You could look at the game and tell that it's low-poly, but it does not feel that way.  When you play the game, it feels as though it looks the way it's supposed to look. \n\nMusic is very important to this franchise.  Some of my favorite songs actually come from the Jet Set Radio games.  When I was younger, and playing this game with my friends, we would often sing along to the tracks.  They're very memorable and upbeat.  Sometimes we would even play some of them in the car when we rode around town while not playing the game.  I have a feeling that the music in the game is one of the things that most fans will hold up as an iconic identifying feature of the game.\n\nThe characters are all great.  You play as a group of graffiti artists on jet powered roller blades that grind on rails all over the city spray painting over rival gang's graffiti with your own.  Your group, the GG's, has a bunch of characters to choose from that are all different and cool in their own way.  They have different stats as well, which makes them play slightly differently.  Everyone probably has a favorite character, but I doubt anyone 'hates' any one of them.\n\nIf you've played 'collect-a-thons' in the past, then you might like the game-play in Jet Set Radio.  You don't necessarily collect items to complete the levels, but it's somewhat similar.  You begin each level with the goal of finding and tagging all the rival gang's graffiti.  There are enemies that follow you around and try to stop you, and there is a time limit for each level.  Every now and then there are the equivalent of boss fights, in which you have to fight against rival gangs or by spray painting the body of an actual boss character.  \n\nThe world is a city that I assume is in Japan, or is just styled that way.  There are many memorable locations, and it feels great navigating across the rooftops or through the sewers at high speed while tagging different locations.  This game is a triumph of various disciplines coming together to make something unique and fun in the gaming world.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691966368, "timestamp_updated": 1691966368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144114683": {"recommendationid": "144114683", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076836102", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 601, "last_played": 1694219744}, "language": "english", "review": " Sega understand the concept of love", "timestamp_created": 1691950951, "timestamp_updated": 1691950951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144091654": {"recommendationid": "144091654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198979688751", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 154, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1691932038}, "language": "english", "review": "TurboJet", "timestamp_created": 1691932953, "timestamp_updated": 1691932953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144057987": {"recommendationid": "144057987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319712052", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1691900962}, "language": "english", "review": "sneakman", "timestamp_created": 1691900984, "timestamp_updated": 1691900984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144057423": {"recommendationid": "144057423", "author": {"steamid": "76561199102705466", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1700284539}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean what can i say?

I needed to learn how to use a hex editor for the first time (on my steam deck which just complicated things) just to fix some code that was keeping the game from saving properly. But once you get that out of the way, it'll still crash and freeze periodically, often right after you finish a level, so you'll have to play it all again.\n\nAs for the game itself, the controls are a bit glitchy, and often don't respond the way you want them to. It\u2019s fine in the beginning, but when the levels start opening up (and the in game map is THAT bad), the paint spots increase and spawn in harder to reach areas, and the enemy spawns get cheaper and cheaper, then \"quirky\" controls become game-ruining inconveniences.\n\nJSR is fun, and you can get maybe hours of fun out of it before you reach your breaking point like I did. But I can't recommend anyone seek it out or call it a must play.\n\nDefinitely check out the S-tier soundtrack though\n\nUpdate:  Bombrush Cyberfunk came out, and that is basically JSR fixed.

It was so ahead of it's time that it's hard to believe.\nForming a gang of cool grafiti painting skaters is a good concept on it's own, but the devs hav complemented it with amazing visual style and soundtrack, making it a very consistent and impressive experience.\nThe game has one small downside, however. It's the learning curve. As many people have noted, Jet Set Radio has quite unusual controlls. I wouldn't say that they are bad, but they need time to get used to. Most of my first playthrough consisted of constant overshooring/missing the rails, getting killed by enemies and so on. BUT! Soon enough i started feeling the movement and it became amazing.

You don't really have no meter telling you how much power is left, only a little exclamation marker above your head telling you can't use them.\n\nSecond, it feels more floaty than a game like this should. It makes it far more difficult to gauge how far you're going to jump. What is worse, your jumps where you do tricks throw you off even more.

The cel-shaded graphics are beautiful to look at, even if blocky by modern standards. The game has a great ambient, with street vibes accompanied by a great original soundtrack.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s something nasty about the game. Very, very nasty. The gameplay SUCKS. Seriously, there\u2019s so much wrong with this game. The controls lack precision, especially when in the air, making jumps feel like a lottery most of the time. Good luck trying to jump into grind spots, and even more trying to jump off it to where you want. Wall jumping is even worse. You\u2019ll get stuck in stupid places, with the camera not helping.\nBut you won\u2019t need to play very far to see the issues. Just play the stupid \u201ctutorial\u201d. Some tasks aren\u2019t intuitive or well explained, and the last one requires you to get a combo of 50 tricks, which trust me, unless you already have some experience with the game, will be an exercise in frustration.\nWith practice, you\u2019ll definitely improve and learn some tips to better control your jumps, but my experience until that point was one of the most frustrating ones I\u2019ve ever had in gaming. I\u2019ve had my share of hard games, but the good ones make you feel it\u2019s your fault when losing. Here, I lost count of my swearing against this game and it\u2019s BS gameplay.\nOn top of that, there\u2019re the enemies, which are alright on their own, but are super annoying when juggling the crap controls at the same time.\nThe boss battles are also another problem. The objective is to get behind rivals and tag them multiple times. They are a bit challenging, but what I have an issue with is the bad hitbox detection for tagging and the stupid decision to put the tagging button on the same button as the camera reset. Seriously, in this remaster a lot of buttons on the controller aren\u2019t even used, so there\u2019s no excuse for this. It\u2019s so annoying trying to tag rivals just for the camera to randomly juggle around because the tag failed, so the camera gets reset instead.\nThen there\u2019re the achievements, requiring for example that you get the best rating for every level. I don\u2019t have a problem with them. What I have a problem with is the fact that you can\u2019t retry a level mid-way. Why??? Not being a feature in the original release doesn\u2019t excuse the lack of its implementation here. It just makes things much harder, especially because you can\u2019t replay story levels. There\u2019s a retry option after you beat a level, but once you\u2019re back on your hub, you have complete the game first and then catch up to where you were.\nThese are some of the biggest issues I have with the game, but there are way more, most related to the level design. I can see the appeal of the game, as it definitely looks and sounds cool when looking at good gameplay footage. That\u2019s what dragged me in. But I can\u2019t forgive it for the frustration it gave me, especially in the first hours. And for me, gameplay is way more important than graphics or style. So, my advice is to STAY AWAY from this.

I can forgive some issues in an era-adjusted sense, as it is a first-generation 32-bit game, but below is a list of issues I can't look past:\n\n* (Pause Menu) Cannot choose to restart stage from the beginning.\n* (Pause Menu) Cannot end/save stage immediately (specifically, upon gathering all Graffiti souls for a given area)\n* Cannot stage select while in NG+ i.e. if you miss a Jet ranking in Story mode, you have to play through the story *again* until you reach the desired stage.\n* Dash-jumping is faster than regular dashing. It's kind of a necessity since trick-looping is required in Technique mode, but still.\n* Graffiti occasionally gives +50 to score but there's no documentation in-game regarding how to receive the bonus.\n* Hit detection to jump onto cables/tightropes is...not great. No visual clarity among them either - black cables in a dark setting (Benten, Grind Square) doesn't build confidence. You end up having to 'feel' your way through a stage more than seeing it, and it's a painful learning curve for when you're just starting out on any given stage.\n* (Technique mode) When time is up, your character stops completely. This means your character can and will fall to the ground, potentially causing damage.\n\n* The majority of the time you collide with anything, expect to lose all speed/velocity and take 100% of the 'loss' during the impact. The next few points deal with similar issues.\n* Every time you collide with a rival in a race, you take damage and knock-back while the rival is completely unaffected. \n* Uneven terrain is infuriating to 'interact' with. The best example of this is the ground-touching lift in Grind Square: it's marginally off the ground, so you can't skate onto it directly - you have to hop onto it.\n* Angled surfaces can leave you stuck. the half-pipe in Shabuya and the sewer loops in Kagone are notorious for stopping you outright while being on a 30-degree incline. And good luck trying to jump off the half-pipe and through a door to stairs, you can miss that and lose a Jet Crush in that one moment alone.\n* If you're hit by a car, it has the potential to knock you onto its roof and then drive out-of-bounds, forcibly ending the stage.\n\n* (Shabuya) The \"connecting\" screen between the three main areas is disorienting upon first discovery, as the directional controls change immediately (or shortly?) upon transition. \n* (Benten/Kogane) Rooftops are uneven, sometimes causing your character to temporarily be unable to dash or jump, the only two forms of generating speed. This can and will result in occasionally stumbling off of the roofs and onto the ground.\n* (Kogane: Fight or Flight) Sewer -> Fall into water -> You can spawn immediately into paratrooper gunfire, which knocks you back into the water you just climbed out of. \n* (Bantam Street: Jet Crush) You have to spray the vertical surface of the designated target, which is not immediately obvious as it's the only instance of an elevated vertical-facing spray-target in the game.\n* (Grind Square) It's possible to be standing on the lift and have policemen grab you before the lift rises and/or when it's just starting to rise. \n* (Grind Square) Point thresholds for Jet rankings are 15-20% too high across the board. Philosophically, you shouldn't have to engage in infinite Technique loops to get a Jet rating in Graffiti mode.\n\nI could be cynical and say something snide like \"Jet Set Radio is only popular because you pirated it when you were 11 years old, and engaging in vandalism while being shot at by paratroopers/tanks/helicopters shamelessly fueled your prepubescent woe-is-me persecution complex\" - and let's be honest, audience, I'd be right - but I'm not going to say that. \n\nInstead, I ask you to consider why a game has a 90%+ positive rating but less than 7.5% of its owner base reached the ending.", "timestamp_created": 1679242690, "timestamp_updated": 1679242690, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492875337600708008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134895510": {"recommendationid": "134895510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058838611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1679152882}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely incredible!

The only big nitpick, for me, were the enemies in the game. Some you are able to get off of you, but I found the ones that couldn't be removed were frustrating at times, especially when you had an x-large pattern you needed to perform.\n\nBut what you're going to be playing this game for, and what probably interested you in the product to begin with, was the aesthetic. And needless to say, the music and art direction and perfection. Even with the minor gripes I had, I found myself beaming every moment from the fantastic sound and music. As well as wanting to jump right back in and see this beautiful world around me. I'm usually on the side that I would rather take a game with a style and personality over graphical fidelity, and this is just another example of style holding up so well.\n\nLastly, my playthrough did last be about 4ish hours, but just means you can keep on coming back for more and it won't be a huge time investment, as well as grinding out those high scores, if you want.

However, in December i finally got a computer that was capable of running more than a word doc, and had no idea this was on steam until January, so after 100%ing it, here's my complete thoughts.\n\nFirst off I have to say that if you wanna non bias review you should look elsewhere because I will not retrain from including mine lol. After wanting to play the game for so long, my exceptions might of been a bit high, but it didn't matter because Jet Set Radio gave me everything I wanted and more. This was a short game, but at 8 bucks it still makes me a criminal for buying it, so it's a good thing JSR thought me how to run away from the police and look stylish doing it. Rolling around on skates through all of Tokyo-to could not of been more fun. I know I probably don't need to mention it but, the soundtrack was absolutely phenomenal, definitely gonna try and get this on CD. I played with a PS4 controller and it worked flawlessly, just play the tutorial first to figure out which buttons are which lol. As fun as this game is, it certainly doesn't come without challenges. The graffiti art can be a little hard to get used to, as I felt like I needed to over-rotate the stick to actually get it to count, but that's really my only complaint.

Luckily the visual style keeps the game looking quite fresh despite 23 years worth of patina. The movement and camera controls do show some age, but not to a degree that you can't get used to them. Once you do, the movement does actually become rather nice and ever-so stylish. And the soundtrack is still one of the all-time greats.\n\nMy second playthrough of the main story only took around 4.5 hours after having beaten it for the first time in 2014, so it's definitely not the longest. I imagine first-time players will progress through the game a bit slower than I did though. However, there is still more content and collectibles to grind out if the main story isn't enough skating action.\n\nI would definitely recommend this piece of gaming history.

This is basically a flow platformer with some tricky precision execution thrown in. Don't let the tricky controls scare you off; this game gets better the more you play it and the better you get at it. It frustrates you with slow base speed, but the trick is that you gain speed every time you jump, encouraging you to jump and wall-jump and trick and grind and just generally go ballistic until you're every bit as frenetic and wild as the music this game blasts at you.\n\nIt's a one-of-a-kind experience. First impression is rough, but it's 100% worth it to reach that awesome experience you get once you're good at it. The graphics are primitive but charming, the music is great, and the theming and story, if basic, are on-point. Nothing else does what Jet Set Radio does, so dive right in and keep practicing and having fun with it until you get that awesome Thanks for Playing screen. Soak it in; games like this come very rarely.\n\nIf you want more detail, this game requires some advanced technique-chaining. It's got a vibe like Mario 64, but with even more emphasis on momentum and planning your moves ahead, and with more consistently-good level design (Mario 64's early levels are great, but most people dislike those like Rainbow Ride. Jet Set Radio's got one questionable level set on Wall Street, but it holds up better overall. I played them back-to-back.)\n\nThe sheer joy of chaining moves, flowing around a stage and dodging the Rokkaku goons is priceless.", "timestamp_created": 1673843544, "timestamp_updated": 1673844891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130944409": {"recommendationid": "130944409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067202032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 76, "last_played": 1676845220}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game but we need JSRF on pc to like come on and please for the love of god make a movie too", "timestamp_created": 1673834974, "timestamp_updated": 1673834974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130872318": {"recommendationid": "130872318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198435136939", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 466, "last_played": 1673913690}, "language": "english", "review": "has swag", "timestamp_created": 1673749933, "timestamp_updated": 1673749933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130869805": {"recommendationid": "130869805", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126371740", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 799, "last_played": 1690732971}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, can't wait for Jet Set Radio Future pc port :)", "timestamp_created": 1673746541, "timestamp_updated": 1673746541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 83, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862927436828613281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130842170": {"recommendationid": "130842170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058181481", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1146, "last_played": 1532063421}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a bit janky, but charming either way.

But I'm not saying it's perfect either, as it's very apparent during some frustrating missions in the game that make the game not so fun. Despite all that, I found the other missions to be fun, even if I mess up tricks quite a bit. I feel that this game still holds up well to this very day if you have an deep appreciation of older games like I do, but I think anyone could enjoy this game, even if they hadn't played much older games, it's just that they need the patience and dedication in order to get used to the controls, but it's much harder nowadays because games are becoming easier for anyone to pick up and start playing, making it more accessible for even someone who has never played a game before to start playing just fine, which is great, I'm all for that, but I wish everyone could appreciate older games and truly try to play them longer until they gotten used to the controls just enough to see if they like the game or not instead of quitting the game after a few or more minutes from not being able to do the cool shit right away, as some people are like that, they don't give older games the chance they deserve, but that's just me, agree or disagree as you wish.\n\nAnyways, most of us can all agree that the style and the aesthetic of this game is absolutely amazing, it perfectly captures the essence of the late 90s and it's obsession with the \"millennial future\" that was so popular at the time. Overall the game is super colourful, bright and cheerful that'll surely make most people smile and have a great time staring at while they play. And the music, oh my god the music..it's one of the best. Hideki Naganuma did an excellent job on the soundtrack, along with everyone else who worked on it. A lot of these tracks are absolute bops like let mom sleep and humming the bassline. \n\nHere's my list of my favourite tracks in the game:\n-Let Mom Sleep\n-Humming The Bassline\n-Miller Ball Breakers\n-Everybody Jump Around\n-Magical Girl\n-Up-Set Attack\n-Mischievous Boy\n-Sneakman\n-'Bout the City\n-Sweet Soul Brother \n-Super Brother \n-Rock It On\n\nThese are my personal favourites, but they're still other great tracks in the game that deserve the attention for sure, although I personally find the final boss music \"Grace and Glory\" not as good as the other tracks in the game, but that's about it, everything else, I enjoy.\n\nOverall, I say give it a chance if you hadn't played much older games, and a must play if you have a deep appreciation for older games and don't mind the jank that comes with older games.

I got to the end after about 5.9 hours according to Steam. \n\n[h1]What is [i]Jet Set Radio[/i]?[/h1]\nIt's a rerelease of a Dreamcast game, originally called [i]Jet Grind Radio[/i] in the States for some reason. This is sort of a sportsy action game where you take one of several different rollerblading youths and have to tag (spray spray paint on) different buildings and billboards and cars and so on while doing fancy tricks. \n\nIt's all out gang warfare in the streets of Tokyo-to! Instead of blasters, these rudies are armed with cool skates and spray paint! Fight off the other gangs as you express your art (right on top of theirs, haha!) and watch out for the cops and other goons who are more than willing to use deadly force! \n\n[h1]What Worked For Me[/h1]\n[b]Music[/b]\nI think the music carries this game. Even when I'd run out of time (999 seconds?!?), or when I'd repeatedly fail to win a race or copy a rival, the songs kept me going, and several of them aren't even bad to listen to outside of the game. I won't say it's the best gaming soundtrack ever, but it just fits this game so well. There are some licensed tracks, but Hideki Naganuma's sampled tracks are something else, too. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nDespite my issues with the controls or my lack of aim, the main gameplay loop was pretty engaging. It's fun to screw around and do tricks, and the very minor puzzle element in finding good places to tag before the authorities get serious was interesting. Like I said with the replay value section, if you're the type to chase high scores, then this will be a big draw too. And because of the way the missions are structured, you're not stuck in 'tag the town' hell or whatever else for too long, so there's quite a lot of variety, too.  \n\n[b]Premise[/b]\nGang 'violence' being solved with the use of graffiti while the police and corrupt corporations try to erase you with extreme prejudice? What the hell is wrong with Tokyo-to?! There's something playfully goofy about the setting and story despite the stakes being high and all. When you hear the police captain radio in [i]tanks[/i] with no concern for the consequences to deal with teenagers putting up graffiti, you know you're in for something ridiculous. There's potential for the game to swing into dark topics like the abuse of authoritative power and all, but the game keeps things cartoony and silly, and nobody (except one character off-screen) really gets hurt. \n\n[h1]What I Didn't Like[/h1]\n[b]Camera[/b]\nThis is a two-parter.\n\nFirst, the camera has an unfortunate tendency to be a hindrance if you're near a wall since it'll collide with it and screw up where you're looking. It does fine anytime else, but if you're in tight spaces, prepare for pain. The second part really comes into play during the 'tag the rival gang' missions. Because you have to hit the left trigger to tag and the left trigger also repositions the camera, it can get very disorienting if you repeatedly hit the button but aren't yet close enough to actually tag them. There were several unused buttons on the Dreamcast even, so why wasn't one of those buttons used for centering the camera instead? \n\n[b]VS gang battles[/b]\nThis kind of ties to the above about mashing left trigger causing the camera to repeatedly center itself, but it's pretty difficult to tag people in the back ten times each while you're trying to chase them down, and it absolutely must be in the back--though you're likely going to get knocked back or down if you approach the enemy from the front when they're standing still. You can tag while grinding, but my frustration was just from constantly playing catch up and having to spam LT to hope I hit them enough times while their back was turned.\n\n[b]No stage select...at first[/b]\nThere were a few times I wanted to just hit one of the stages I cleared already and just screw around or try to explore to figure out routes. This isn't possible in the first chapters, but the JET X stages that unlock in the final chapter do give you the space to play around. I didn't try the second loop of the game to see if you can actually select a stage freely or if you're stuck going through each one-by-one. \n\n[h1]Verdict - 5/5[/h1]\nIt's kind of funny to play this so long after [i]Sonic Adventure 2[/i]. I know there were months between both games' releases, but I wonder how much influence this had on the latter's development. Considering the presence of grinding rails, the different stage ranks that weren't present in the first [i]Sonic Adventure[/i], and Shadow skates... I don't know, awfully strange coincidences if that's all these are. That grind rails and ranks have been a [i]Sonic[/i] staple since is just serendipity, huh? \n\nThat said, this game was a real treat. If I didn't have a dumb smile on my face, I had the 'try to do your best' tongue on upper lip look plastered on there instead. It was a good challenge, but still really fun to play, and the funky beats definitely were a highlight for me. I'm not the kind of person to chase high scores, so I'm probably done with the game, but I'm definitely glad this one popped up on my radar.", "timestamp_created": 1668998617, "timestamp_updated": 1668998617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675260722637176514", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125808804": {"recommendationid": "125808804", "author": {"steamid": "76561199106895247", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1668585642}, "language": "english", "review": "i have not been able to open the game sadly.. i love this game and i would love to play it again after years and yeas of not playing it. when this game was gifted to me by a friend and was really exited to play it but i cant open the game, i have tried so many different things to fix it but i could not do it.", "timestamp_created": 1668938790, "timestamp_updated": 1668938790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536878228187561035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125787052": {"recommendationid": "125787052", "author": {"steamid": "76561199216769014", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 827, "last_played": 1691804060}, "language": "english", "review": "Such an amazing game I don\u2019t think I can ever get enough jet set radio in my life", "timestamp_created": 1668905786, "timestamp_updated": 1668905786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125666981": {"recommendationid": "125666981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010386225", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1668744644}, "language": "english", "review": "Couldn't get into it.

Its cel shaded style Is great. The story basically Involves you In this youth gang who goes around spraying graffiti around Tokyo for claiming your turf or going up against other youth gangs. The cutscenes are wacky and fun and are entertaining to watch.\nThe games style Is very of Its time with Its art direction and soundtrack having a very late 90s early 2000s feel to It but In 2022 all of that still holds up great as I love Its Art style and the soundtrack Is good to give the game an extra fun energy to It which makes the levels more fun. \nSpeaking of the levels they are very well designed. There's only 5 areas but as you progress the same few areas get more expansive and big which makes them fun to explore later on In the game. In these places the game will assign you to rather spray paint onto other rival gangs members, Race other people who will join your group after beating them in a race, Spray at random parts of the places to claim to other gangs that this turf is yours and there Is also some missions where you try get as many points as you can before timer runs out. \nThe points one Is none story related but still a fun challenge to do. The character selections Is quite big in this game. Depending who you pick they control the same In terms of there movements but some can get more spray paint cans than others and some might have a higher health bar and some might have different combos when your spraying graffiti.\n I think all the characters are very well designed and stand out. I usually like playing as Beat, Mew and Combo. I Especially recommend playing as Combo when you unlock him as his health bar is massive. \nThis game has a bit of a learning curve to It but once you understand how the game plays It is really fun to grind and skate around these levels spraying graffiti and doing the characters different combos with spraying on your left stick (If being played by an Xbox or Playstation controller like me). \nThe game offers fun replay factor with trying to get high ranks on each level which I trying to do. \nEach area Is so memorable I sometimes even just going around the levels and explore them cause Its so enjoyable.\nOverall This game is high up there In my list of favorite games. The game play, graphics, style + everything else I love.

However when I first tried to play JSR on steam i had LOADS of issues, initially i couldn't get the game to open at all and it turns out the steam shortcut was crashing it for some reason. I also couldn't use my controller and i have no clue what fixed that. other than those issues i had when first trying to play the game its been pretty much smooth sailing apart from a few crashes.\n\nThe game itself is absolutely amazing, its hands down one of my favourite games of all time and has a really nice mix of difficulty yet accessibility to casual players. The visual artstyle is shockingly amazing ESPECIALLY considering this game came out in the year 2000 and still looks good. Ontop of this the music is absolutely sublime, the game would be outright incomplete without it. Hideki naganuma and everyone else did an amazing job adding style and character to the world and manages to stand on its own without the context of the game (although not always). As for the gameplay its great, some people call it clunky but i have no clue how that'd be the case unless you're just really bad at it because i find it to be smooth. Other than that tangent it's incredibly fun and satisfying.\n\nTLDR: its really good and absolutely worth the price\nPs: Works great on deck !\nJet set radio future port please :)", "timestamp_created": 1666726717, "timestamp_updated": 1685814973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124357271": {"recommendationid": "124357271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198989482451", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 615, "last_played": 1696305132}, "language": "english", "review": "the most addictive game that i ever played, i just love jsr<3", "timestamp_created": 1666679189, "timestamp_updated": 1666679189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510638296604156494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124336823": {"recommendationid": "124336823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246278600", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 655, "last_played": 1697159863}, "language": "english", "review": "Music that's violently smooth\u2014it's Jet Set Radio!

While watching the game's documentary in the bonus section, I felt for how much the creators loved this game and wanted to make something fun. Unfortunately, they were dealing with the system capabilities of their time. This is probably one of those perfect examples of a retro game beloved by its fans and probably amazing for its time, but which doesn't hold up. I would even admit this is a gem worth trying if you can live with the flaws and difficulties. Try it if you like this kind of thing or want to experience something that probably influenced a whole lot of people \u2026 but otherwise, I can't recommend this game for most people.\n\nStarting on the positives, there's a decent sense of accomplishment for getting all the achievements, which extends this pretty short game to an acceptable length. Though the Detached achievement is super frustrating for how you can't know until the end if you did everything right. I like the dance party menu and the interesting group of icon characters, and there's also a lot of neat levels with more connections and paths between areas than you might realize, like the subway platforms or leaving the downhill area from the bottom. Though the super-vertical Grind Square is painful every time you fall and actually kind of lame once you realize how the infinite grind loop works.\n\nWell that was fun listing all the positives. My struggle to enjoy this game came from how frustrating and imprecise the controls were. Perhaps that was partly on me for using keyboard controls, but there were awkward moments that a controller wouldn't have helped. For example, racing against others is extremely annoying because just bumping into someone will send you skating off in the opposite direction no matter how much your character weighs. The designers knew this made racing almost impossible because they actually have the NPC stop and wait for you at the half-way point. Only the last half actually matters, and your real opponent for getting high ratings is the clock.\n\nThere's a bunch of characters to select from, but I'm not sure if any of them actually skate differently in this skating game? Big characters feel slower, but they can win races too. Some characters seem to jump higher, but not consistently. A section on How To Skate buried in the options will tell you that a character's stats are for how many points they get when doing either skate tricks or graffiti, but the latter doesn't change how the art looks to you. They also say that characters who are good at graffiti will carry less paint, which basically increases the challenge for those speed-focused runs, but then you can unlock characters with great graffiti scores and big paint storage.\n\nThe tutorial teaches you things you will never need to use like skating backwards (which is almost impossible with keyboard controls) then does a terrible job teaching important things like wall riding (they tell you to run at a wall, but not that only certain walls actually work for this) and then require you to figure out the essentials of infinite grind loops from there. The in-story \u201cfollow my example\u201d challenges were way better at teaching essential concepts, yet that challenge type is criminally underutilized and maybe should have been much more central to the game. I was actually happy when unlocking Pots involved a tough one.\n\nI don't like some of the sound design choices they made in this very sound-inspired game. Some music is fine (I was reminded of the far better The World Ends With You, Gameboy version) but I wanted to keep the music as low as possible because every track in the game is a loop that gets annoying fast and they fail to keep a variety going. There's even some music in the bonus section and radio player that doesn't play during story missions? Also you can't fine-tune the volume, there's just one slider that only goes down to 50%. I get them wanting to have their music blasting, but why not give me control too? And characters constantly shout the most annoying catchphrase lines over and over when they do things, so mostly I chose my character by who was least irritating.\n\nLast and kind of least, the quarter pipes are bad, the final level sucks and I experienced a few game crashes in situations where maybe the game code was over-taxed. On the other hand, this game does get better after the initial frustrations wear off. For me, I started having some fun well after finishing the short main story and deep into my NewGame+ while chasing achievements, only after I understood what I was supposed to be doing and what mattered. That's basically the problem. A game should not take that long to get good. So unless you can stick around for that moment of zen, I would not recommend this retro gem.", "timestamp_created": 1664085382, "timestamp_updated": 1664090859, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45267486572265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122737144": {"recommendationid": "122737144", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970668601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1664017978}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever!

Perhaps my experience would have been better with a controller. Then the game itself.. well it is JSR, the game being in HD really is great to look at with all those colors. The sound is nice to hear with headphones, but then after a while its HD visuals blended in and just made me wish I was playing it on the dreamcast with vga. \n\nAgain These are just my own nitpicks and opinion on this, my expectations were to see more extra content and more fun added on to the game. I am not saying this is a bad game, this just didn't seem to entice me to play the HD version rather than the dreamcast version. Thats mostly because I do own one and if you don't have a dreamcast then for the price right now the PC version isnt a bad deal.

The soundtrack is great, even though its slightly more annoying than JSRF's, but I do enjoy both. The characters, design, the world, it all has great style and personality. And the gameplay loop is great. The only thing is how the player controls. I have tried so many times to finish/get into this game and I just can't do it, Its probably because I grew up on JSRF but whenever I play this game, it feels like the controls are just fighting you the whole time. It feels like I'm playing QWOP but with rollerskates. Everything is so sluggish and the direction of your jump feels so inconsistent and the momentum is all weird and it feels like your treading through a knee deep swamp. Part of this is likely from my bias towards JSRF as I grew up playing that game and I didn't know JSR existed until later in life, but I just enjoy everything about JSRF better. Atmosphere, art style, music, controls, maps. The only thing I can say about JSR that is better is the graffiti mechanic, but even then the input feels inconsistent with some of the inputs. If you just want a game for the experience and the atmosphere, and the controls aren't a big deal to you, give this a try, it bleeds personality and it's a very unique game, you won't get another game like this with the exception of JSRF.

Fortunately I ended up sticking with it, because with a bit more time I finally started to see this as an absolutely fantastic little experience. At its core, JSR is also a game that felt as if it allowed me to better understand certain dichotomies between the game design approach between Nintendo and Sega and how they were able to cultivate a lot of experiences that felt remarkably distinct, each with their own pros and cons to them. While Nintendo tended to approach games largely from the perspective of having a player understand the majority of the game's systems immediately and intuitively to make for something inviting and accessible, Sega consistently seemed to more go for the approach of \"Hey, the first few hours of this are going to suck but once it clicks it's the best stuff ever\". This feels especially true for this game however, as getting into it proves to be a bit rough due to the control scheme feeling incredibly loose and difficult to handle, with a wide turn radius and a constant sense of momentum that means you can't immediately slow down making it really difficult to start off with as even the most simple obstacles feel like fighting against the game. However, with a bit of time, once you get used to it all, it becomes increasingly clear how so many of the mobility quirks that you have lend themselves perfectly to the level design.\n\nFor a movement system that practically requires the player to be getting a bit of a running start to properly gain momentum and actually reach a lot of higher locations, not to mention maintaining this speed for a pretty long time whether you want to or not since rollerskates just tend to do that, it needs to be complemented by level design that supports this, and here's where Jet Set Radio largely shines. Grind rails, secret areas and just your general avenues of traversal tend to be spaced out in such a way where you can flow naturally from one location to another as long as you have a general idea of where everything is. Jumps are spaced in such a way that you'll be finding yourself effortlessly perfectly positioning yourself to barely slow down after a while, it goes from something that feels like it's fighting against the player to something that feels incredibly intuitive, but then also satisfying due to the player knowing how much they had struggled at first to make even the most basic of manoeuvres. It all contributes to a feeling that the game is less interested in seeing you merely beat the stages, and instead wants you to absolutely master them.\n\nThis idea of mastery continues to be represented through the way that the enemies within the game are handled, initially seeming like pointless distractions that serve to frustrate and slow you down, but actually being utilised as a clever way to further force the player to understand the levels and plan their routes carefully from the start. Because the intensification of enemy waves is based exclusively off of how many spots you've tagged without the time taken having any bearing, planning is a far more important step to the game than it first lets on, to the point where once you figure out how to approach getting around a stage, the pacing can often feel rather leisurely, with even the most intense waves still being easily managed due to the remaining targets being simple to reach nonetheless. So many elements that initially seem like a hindrance to the Jet Set Radio's experience ultimately prove to contribute to the core gameplay loop in an incredibly organic way to the point where you'll often feel as if you're just being let loose without any real sense of overbearing guidance, even though the game is really nudging you in the right direction for the entire duration.\n\nThis reaches its peak with the rival battles thrown throughout the game, that either make you race against someone or just follow what they do, which doesn't only often lead to you being taught about certain tricks to make getting around easier, one example being sliding across walls for extra height, but you'll often be taught about little shortcuts as well. These end up feeling exciting not only because you're being taught about so many things that were always there that you probably just didn't know about, but it all links back into making replaying those stages later all the more satisfying as you once again get to entirely redefine your route with these new tricks and passages in mind, feeding into the remarkable replayability that the game has. Of course, despite all of this, it's still hard to deny that the best aspect of the game for me is just how much insane style it has to it, with the colourful, cel - shaded art making every area be filled to the seams with so much charm, bringing life to what could've potentially been a dreary urban sprawl. The art is further complemented by Hideki Naganuma's amazing soundtrack that takes a lot of cues from instrumental hip hop and the big beat scene to make for one of the coolest OSTs to a game out there, with even the occasional lulls in quality still carrying such a strong vibe to carry the game's aesthetic up into the stratosphere.\n\nOn the whole, while I cannot fault anyone who plays this game and hates it for the way you control your character, it not only is a system that progressively feels better the more you play, but the design of the levels and encounters themselves is absolutely incredible in how it perfectly balances between knocking the player around and silently guiding them into feeling like they're pulling off some absolutely insane stunts. While I already love the game, it's also another case where it almost feels built to be replayed a bunch, and those small annoying moments that appear from time to time are nowhere near enough to tank the experience by very much.

The story is so over the top that I can't help but laugh.\n\nThe only problems I really have with this game, and I'm not even sure if it's the game or if it's this port, are that the controls are extremely janky, along with the camera being really inconsistent at times. along with the ridiculous achievements. But I can live with these things; this game is simply too much fun to let them detract from my experience.\n\nMy biggest question is: where is Jet Set Radio Future? That game improves upon every aspect of this game and is overall a more polished experience. I doubt we'll ever get it on Steam (seeing as it's been 10 years since this port was brought to Steam), but I don't want to give up hope.

For its time, this is a classic. [b][i]There is, without any doubt, fun and nostalgia to be had[/i][/b]\u2014I played to full completion of the story, plus some miscellaneous challenges/activities that offered further replayability.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay fails to hold up under modern scrutiny, and as such I cannot recommend this game to the [i]majority[/i] of potential players.\n\n[h1]Technical Issues[/h1]\nThis game is an old port. Be prepared for the possibility that you may need to [b](1)[/b] launch in compatibility mode, [b](2)[/b] download old redistributables not packaged with the game, and/or [b](3)[/b] jump through other small hoops to get the game to boot properly.\n\nI first tried playing a couple years ago, but critical assets (characters, scenes...) would not load properly. I gave up and tried again more recently, and only experienced a few (2\u20134) hard crashes.\n\n[h1]Controller vs. K&M[/h1]\nThe debate over which is better isn't relevant. I played with both, across multiple missions of varying difficulty, and even switched mid-mission at times to see if a certain sequence of movements would be easier. You'll get used to the default control mapping, and you will encounter the same problems with scuffed movement and camera woes. Ultimately, I decided that keyboard and mouse felt a little bit better.\n\nIf you truly must, you can remap your controls. Although, there is an accursed \"multi-purpose\" button, and you cannot separate the two wildly different actions assigned to it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Thoughts[/h1]\n[h2]The Camera[/h2]\nIn narrow areas, or anywhere where your back is against a wall, the camera angles itself poorly. Clipping, being pushed above or below... even as you rotate it manually, the camera is likely to get stuck. Effectively, sometimes you just [b][i]don't have control[/i][/b] over your own camera.\n\nThere is a \"reset camera\" button, but it's not useful. Even in those problematic areas, all the \"reset camera\" button does is spasm about for a couple seconds, and then return to its unhelpful state. I'd recommend not using this feature, but it's mapped to the same button used for spraying graffiti\u2014[b]the most important action in the game[/b].\n\nChase missions highlight this flaw best, but any mission that involves spraying graffiti within a narrow timing window is rough. For chase missions in particular, you need to graffiti the back of a moving target multiple times. The ideal strategy is to spam the graffiti button when you're directly behind the target. However \u2013 the position you have to be in is precise, you move slightly faster than the target, touching the target will stun you, and you need to follow the target through turns and grinds.\n\nThe result is that you can't see anything. As you tailgate the target, you [i]frequently[/i] lose and regain the ability to graffiti multiple times each second. Thus, your camera will constantly be swinging around wildly.\n\n[h2]Freedom of Movement[/h2]\nJet Set Radio's gameplay solely hinges on the concept of movement. Unfortunately, it fails to provide you with responsive movement. When movement works, it feels great. There is a genuine mastery you can gain over the system, even with its flaws. But when it doesn't work, it feels needlessly cheap, and greatly discouraging. So for this to be the game's biggest flaw,\u2014this is incredibly disappointing.\n\nMy biggest gripes stem from rails refusing to cooperate. Try to skate on, but you slide off. Try to jump on, but the game pushes you away and you miss the rail by a hair's width. Land the rail without momentum, and now you're forced to slowly hop across the rail to move forward.\n\nYou can't immediately jump off the rail to try again either. Without momentum, you're unable to propel yourself far enough to not get magnetized back on. So you must hop forward a few times to build momentum, then jump perpendicularly to get far enough away from the rail to disconnect from it.\n\n[h2]Level Design and Enemies[/h2]\nOn a higher note, the level design is fun. The locations are stand-out, and aesthetically interesting. I complain about the grinding, but the rails and walls are cleverly placed throughout the map to make it possible for really cool tricks to be performed once you hit a higher level of mastery. Some of the final missions even take you across all of a location's sub-areas, which is really cool.\n\nIn many ways, the only real downside of the level design is that it doesn't feel like the enemies were designed for the maps they've been placed in. They succeed in being a hazard, but they're not fun and many lack meaningful counterplay (despite being placed in large quantities).\n\nTear gas doesn't pay respect to the rhythm of the game, so it can just interrupt your movement if it gets queued up at a bad time. Tanks are interesting, but having ten of them with machine guns feels silly and needlessly punishing when the tank cannon already exists. The difficulty build-up to attack helicopters makes sense and they feel fine to play against, but the maps they're placed on don't feel designed for them. Some of the more static enemies are placed next to a medium or large graffiti, and the best \"counterplay\" is to just face-tank the damage for the i-frames.\n\nThe final mission (and final boss) is also quite weird. It utilizes basically none of the elements the game teaches you up to that point, and the level design feels hollow. There's no real sense of accomplishment in completing this mission for me, and the build-up to it was far better than the final mission itself.\n\n[h2]Story and Characters[/h2]\nRealistically, you're not playing for the story. Although it's a shame that Captain Onishima is an infinitely more interesting character than the actual villain, and yet he just [i]exits the story[/i] with such little acknowledgement. Regardless, all the character designs are still unique and interesting.\n\n[h1]In Conclusion...[/h1]\nIf you're just wanting to hit up an old classic for some good music and nostalgia, go for it. But if you're looking to revisit the gameplay, I strongly recommend against it. There are more modern games that do it better.", "timestamp_created": 1653883233, "timestamp_updated": 1653884467, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690316617488861084", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116215352": {"recommendationid": "116215352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402656467", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1691189352}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego, muy original y con muy buena banda sonora", "timestamp_created": 1653861342, "timestamp_updated": 1653861342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116201641": {"recommendationid": "116201641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857365417", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1654302668}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta chido", "timestamp_created": 1653842036, "timestamp_updated": 1653842036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116187441": {"recommendationid": "116187441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198992785181", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1657951878}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool game with a nostalgic aesthetic", "timestamp_created": 1653822945, "timestamp_updated": 1653822945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116168021": {"recommendationid": "116168021", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974936987", "num_games_owned": 1385, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 357, "last_played": 1653786122}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to try to keep this review short.\n\nI finally finished this in 2022 and it still is absolutely dripping with style and charm, from the music, menus, art, etc. However, some of the objectives can be confusing because the map is essentially useless and the camera is almost always a problem.

bad controls and design. Conceptually, I like it, but levels become almost impossible to complete after the first chapter is finished. Don't believe me? Look at the trophy stats. I'm not sure if this is because of the port itself or if the original game was this frustratingly bad. Things that should be simple, like WALKING UP FUCKING STAIRS can make or break your success in the racing missions. The programming for doing tricks off of ramps is frustratingly fickle. I'd rather solo Melania with no mimic and and no healing potions in Elden ring than try to get up the stairs that are attached to the top of a small half pipe ever again. You have to be VERY specific in your speed, angle and timing, to a point that is just unnecessary. There's also many levels where you have to spray graffiti at the end of a wall ride, but if you are still wall riding, no spraying, but if you jump off the wall and automatically do a trick, forget about spraying then, too. So your window for spraying is very small, good luck hitting it, and good luck hitting all the wall ride tags before the time runs out.

Suprise, it still does.  I'd say it's better now, seeing as how an hour flies by when playing. The QoL changes and extras, along with short load times, really help this package for someone looking for 3D platformer they might not know they wanted, but are glad they stumbled across.    The games approach to grind lines that act as a 'traditional' platforms in other games, on top of scoring and gaining speed.  \n\nThe controls are still the same as I remember them, except I'm playing on a Dual Shock 4 instead of the DC controller, and they feel tighter as a result.  The right stick camera control is  a nice addition.\n\nHow it handles grinding is still a talking point as it was upon it's release.  It's not always initially known what is and isn't grind-able or wall ride-able and even then it could come down to the angle you come from.  There are some spots that require you to experiment that you would think to work easy enough.  Once you get those down the game will reward you and you'll find a game is extremely rewarding to navigate in style through on multiple runs, like any good game.\n\nGraphics and presentation are still top-notch after all these years.  The dense hills and cities of Neo-Tokyo and even the U.S. added stages still look gorgeous especially night.  The varied terrain and  various ways to get around are still a blast to navigate.  \n\nIf you're looking for a 3D platformer cut from a different cloth, this is one that is still worth your attention.\n", "timestamp_created": 1650596367, "timestamp_updated": 1650596367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114247334": {"recommendationid": "114247334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981958278", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1690666291}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me dieron ganas de matarme jugandolo pero est\u00e1 muy bueno", "timestamp_created": 1650578282, "timestamp_updated": 1650578282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114200653": {"recommendationid": "114200653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412167866", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2152, "last_played": 1678848793}, "language": "english", "review": "yes\n", "timestamp_created": 1650501784, "timestamp_updated": 1650501784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511627912521362305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114198819": {"recommendationid": "114198819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255320198", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1650968190}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I LIKE BOOBA\" - Hideki Naganuma", "timestamp_created": 1650498466, "timestamp_updated": 1650498466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704471409320831299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114119204": {"recommendationid": "114119204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202616517", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1302, "last_played": 1670828084}, "language": "english", "review": "I can finally officially say I can roller skate now, a desire and journey that started from this very game :))))", "timestamp_created": 1650365798, "timestamp_updated": 1696802371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114019674": {"recommendationid": "114019674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380877091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1760, "last_played": 1546089676}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is everything 90s in the absolute best way possible. \nArt: looks great, music: iconic, rollerblades: bought, knees scraped, I'm more than happy!", "timestamp_created": 1650217246, "timestamp_updated": 1650217246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113991302": {"recommendationid": "113991302", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096447877", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1697916554}, "language": "english", "review": "This is possibly the best game ever created.

Plus, the way to unlock extra characters can be a bit tedious or pose a tough challenge to casual players, such as myself.

Picking a character with high power (health) and low graffiti (graffiti takes less time and you can carry more cans) made it far easier to enjoy my time with the game. Though characters with higher graffiti are an option for chasing high scores.\n\nWith its distinct visual style and fantastic soundtrack, there's plenty to love about the game. Certainly the soundtrack was at least half the reason for my interest.\nNot knowing much about the game other than the music, aesthetic and a recommendation, I was pleasantly surprised by the politics of police brutality and villainous corporations. Then there's the ridiculous escalation with villains sending tanks and helicopters after graffiti-artist teens. It took me a while before I accidentally discovered that it's possible to take down helicopters by spraying graffiti on them. Glorious! A quiet, grounded game this is not. XP\nKnowing that you can take down helicopters and some tougher enemies with graffiti is also helpful for harder levels, though I did realise on reflection that the game was trying to teach me that during the graffiti-gang-wars section where you chase down rivals to graffiti their backs until they surrender.\n\nPretty regularly a challenger appears at your window, and you complete their challenge to unlock them. Usually this consists of pulling off the tricks they demonstrate to you, but occasionally there's a race. One pair of character unlocks is tied to story progression and therefore not optional like the other challengers.

A bit of soulsborne you-will-likely-fail-several-times zen is a good mindset to bring.\n\nSo yeah, if the look and sound of Jet Set Radio tickle your fancy, consider getting it on sale, brace yourself for the bumps in the road, and enjoy the wild ride and the energetic voice of our DJ Professor K.", "timestamp_created": 1641565171, "timestamp_updated": 1641565171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107520202": {"recommendationid": "107520202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268447810", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1669860146}, "language": "english", "review": "Skate\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1641563982, "timestamp_updated": 1641563982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107503853": {"recommendationid": "107503853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353373918", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1659036308}, "language": "english", "review": "soundtrack is good", "timestamp_created": 1641540762, "timestamp_updated": 1663298427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107430521": {"recommendationid": "107430521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799244487", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4357, "last_played": 1692695087}, "language": "english", "review": "Certified hood classic.", "timestamp_created": 1641451052, "timestamp_updated": 1641451052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.747714698314666748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107380601": {"recommendationid": "107380601", "author": {"steamid": "76561199046186443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1178, "last_played": 1679949587}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun game, funky soundtrack. i recommend it\n", "timestamp_created": 1641394977, "timestamp_updated": 1678362302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107366273": {"recommendationid": "107366273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138146808", "num_games_owned": 843, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1641554279}, "language": "english", "review": "as much as I love the gameplay, songs n the graphic art styles on this game.

If you find yourself hating how this game controls, here is a tip: controlling your speed and maintaining momentum is everything. That, and understanding exactly how much your directional inputs effect your jumps off of rails, are all you really need to get a feel for. If you can pass the tutorial, then you'll start to get it.\n\nSome clear oversights are present that Sega could address if they put in a bit more effort. Off the top of my head: \n - Stage selection from the stage score menu would be ideal for grinding Jet ratings. Having to play through the whole game just to play through a story stage you already completed is inconvenient. \n - Music from Jet Set Radio Future being unlockable is great and all, but it is only accessible in an extras menu with there being no option to use it in-game, which is just a waste. \n - No \"retry\" option in the pause menu; you have to go back to the Garage and then reselect a stage to try again which is also inconvenient.\n - With all of the characters unlocked, I have to scroll through SEVEN other characters before I can select Gum and that is a [b]PROBLEM[/b].\n\nI really didn't think I would play this game as much as I have. I thought I would beat it, then beat JSRF, then be satisfied until Bomb Rush Cyberfunk releases. But after I finished JSRF, days passed, but I wasn't quite ready to move on. It seems I am unable to resist my primal human urges to grind rails and disrespect authority to a funky beat, so I'm probably just going to keep playing this game until I 100% it.\n\nTL;DR rock that shit homie", "timestamp_created": 1640298365, "timestamp_updated": 1640298365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106370256": {"recommendationid": "106370256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072146750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 743, "last_played": 1640282668}, "language": "english", "review": "Holds up surprisingly well.

possibly one of the most fun games I have played in recent years. Jet Set Radio (or jet grind radio if you will) is a game similar to Tony Hawk Pro Skater. You do tricks and you have a time limit, but what makes this game stand out is your mission isn't to collect tapes or get a sick score, rather to cover up other people's graffiti. The characters are some of the most unique people I have seen in a video game. There's Beat, who ran away from home and is known to be a trouble maker. There is slate who has a big nose like squidward and can carry so many spray paint cans. Then there is my favorite, cube. Nothing too special about her, I just think goth girls are cool. The tricks in this game are a bit harder to pull off than pro skater, you can't just mash buttons and get an insane combo. You usually have to start grinding, build up some speed, and then jump to do a trick. This works out just fine, in my opinion. The story itself is interesting for a roller skating game. Basically there are gangs/groups of people that like to spray paint all over tokyo. Your group, The GG's, has one goal. To lay down some phat lines on other people's graffiti, while being chased by the cops. There are a couple of twists here and there that keep the story interesting. The music is literally the best video game music I have heard in recent years. Most of it is by Hideki Naganuma and I feel like it fits the tone of the game. In the USA version, we got some real sweet metal tracks. Dragula by rob zombie and just got wicked by cold, which are my personal favorites. Overall, this game is amazing.

I've been putting it off because I though it would be like GTA which isn't my type of game.\n\nThe style of this game is iconic. Hideki Naganuma is definitely one of my favourite video game music producers and I would consider JSR's soundtrack to be one of my all time favourite video game soundtracks of all time. If you're not intending to buy the game, you should AT LEAST listen to the soundtrack. The art style is timeless, the use of cel shading makes the game look good even by today's standards. \n\nThe game generally controls well, although it can be a bit clunky at times, however I would recommend playing this game with a controller. I played this game with my keyboard because I'm poor, and when it came to graffiting I could only play as characters who had less complicated moves. So, please, PLEASE play this game with a controller for the definitive experience. \n\nAs for the plot it's thrown so many curveballs at me in it's insane! One of the best parts of this game, in my humble opinion, is seeing how brutal the police gets with their attempts in stopping you. From tanks, to tear gas, you name it! Not to mention the ending, which I will obviously not spoil, after finishing the game I was in such a state of shock that I had begun taking yoga classes. It's not shocking in the sense that it is horrifying or traumatic, it's just REALLY bizarre and I didn't know how to process it. \n\nHowever, I would DEFINITELY recommend this game, it's such a great experience that no other game could ever replicate (well ignoring Bomb Rush Cyberfunk). \n\nNow SEGA, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE PORT JET SET RADIO FUTURE TO STEAM!

It's absolutely worth experiencing.\n\nGraphics:\n\nMaybe it's pointless to talk about graphics for a game that released over 2 decades ago, but Jet Set Radio practically pioneered cel-shading in gaming. The game's bright color-palette and comic-like appearance gives it a distinct style that ages well compared to other games from its time.\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nNeed I elaborate? It's probably the reason you're even interested in this game. Let's look at the funk!\nHideki Naganuma is a name that gets thrown around, and without a doubt his are some of the most iconic and recognized tracks. There are other artists who've contributed tracks to this game. in addition to Hideki Naganuma's distinct sample-infused funk, you'll also encounter tracks from other similar DJs such as Richard Jacques, Castle Logical, Deavid Soul, and Toronto. Hilariously, the game even features a song that directly references and glorifies the Super Mario Brothers, sung by Guitar Vader.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis is something not many people elaborate on... but it should definitely be talked about. Jet Set Radio was developed by a young, passionate, and inexperienced team. So whilst all the game's ideas are implemented in earnesty and in fun... they do not mesh together well.\n\nThe elements will be examined separately.\n\nThe trick system: Jet Set Radio's grinding system is serviceable, but is highly based on the momentum you have when starting the grind. Navigating upwards is often difficult and requires planning and time. Tricks are performed automatically as you grind, and also when jumping whilst going a certain speed, or when jumping off a wallride. Learning how and where to chain these tricks together is both satisfying and rewarding. The one thing you really need to be wary of however, is that any direction held on the thumbstick will cause you to jump sharply in that direction. When it is intended it works great. When you think you're holding forward and you veer off to the right... it can be a problem. Halfpipe jumps while not very important to the gameplay loop, nevertheless aren't always pulled off when you expect them to be.\n\nThe graffiti system: The central objective of Jet Set Radio is to spray graffiti tags on various surfaces throughout a level. For medium and large tags, this is done through stand-still quick time events. While the QTE's themselves are fun to pull off... the length of vulnerability you suffer from attempting them is at best stress-inducing, and at worst makes it impossible to finish a tag 'cleanly' in some positions.\n\nEnemies: The enemies in Jet Set Radio have very creative visual design, but do not play nice with the graffiti system. Some large tags, (some of which require 7 seperate QTE sequences to be done in a row for max points!) Lie in areas that enemies either guard or patrol... and most of the enemies are completely invincible and cannot be distracted from the spots you need to tag long enough for it to be safe. The only thing you can do to prevent from dealing with this issue is strategically selecting the order in which you do tags... but even so, some of the levels in the third chapter forbid this technique entirely.\n\nConclusion: Jet Set Radio is a beautiful work of art. But its gameplay loop makes it hard to play 'cleanly'. The game's challenges mainly comes from design choices that do not harmonize well with each other. This being said, Jet Set Radio as an *idea* for a franchise is utterly remarkable, and stands as a cult classic due to its criminally untapped potential.", "timestamp_created": 1639446000, "timestamp_updated": 1639446000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105549632": {"recommendationid": "105549632", "author": {"steamid": "76561199083761941", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 629, "last_played": 1641752708}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly a masterpiece WAY ahead of its time.

Lindos gr\u00e1ficos para 2000 e a jogabilidade \u00e9 totalmente divertida, eu sempre acho jogos de skate ou patins divertidos. N\u00e3o vejo qualquer problema com esta portagem para PC, os controles s\u00e3o s\u00f3 um pouco dif\u00edceis de dominar, mas com bom esfor\u00e7o voc\u00ea logo se acostuma depois de algumas horas.\n[h3][b] Nota: \u00d3timo [/b][/h3]", "timestamp_created": 1636976057, "timestamp_updated": 1641590851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504892349243164063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102798894": {"recommendationid": "102798894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198425477048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1130, "last_played": 1683685542}, "language": "english", "review": "idk, game good", "timestamp_created": 1636932215, "timestamp_updated": 1636932215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102718309": {"recommendationid": "102718309", "author": {"steamid": "76561199116365284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1661171185}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will change your life ong", "timestamp_created": 1636819322, "timestamp_updated": 1636819322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102689457": {"recommendationid": "102689457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024162709", "num_games_owned": 811, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1636781103}, "language": "english", "review": "I got the Feel the Beat (Start the game for the first time) achievement, loaded the first level, quit, and never looked back.", "timestamp_created": 1636781176, "timestamp_updated": 1636781176, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421313494443893433", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102659401": {"recommendationid": "102659401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035411290", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 4362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4362, "last_played": 1640649407}, "language": "english", "review": "Jet Set Radio is everything good about video games.", "timestamp_created": 1636736039, "timestamp_updated": 1678151884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51754385232925415", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102596322": {"recommendationid": "102596322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343504633", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 570, "last_played": 1647807054}, "language": "english", "review": "Very vibrant and colourful, it's always cool to pull off tricks, and the music from composers like Hideki Naganuma, Deavid soul are amazing", "timestamp_created": 1636646261, "timestamp_updated": 1636646261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102573253": {"recommendationid": "102573253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417045363", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 361, "last_played": 1657520533}, "language": "english", "review": "ITS LIKE SIIVAGUNNER!

The cel-shaded graphics are great and have been copied in many other games since. It has my favourite soundtrack of all time, with a mix of hip-hop, J-pop and rock songs that are all brilliant.

These are:\n\n- Story (If applicable)\n- Gameplay\n- Graphics\n- Music\n\nJet Set Radio has an alright story in my opinion. When it comes to gameplay, the controls on the PC are a bit confusing in terms of spraying graffiti which is a mandatory action within the game. It took me a while to figure out how to perform the more complicated directions which involves tapping numerous keys at the same time. I also figured out TODAY that you could skate backwards. I love the graphics. The cel-shading is really good for the time it was made in and the character designs are really unique. My personal favourite is the design for the Love Shockers. I also love the fact you can create your own graffiti. The music is epic. I mean epic. Certain tracks are really memorable like Humming The Bassline, Let Mom Sleep, That's Enough and Improvise.

Not much in terms of effects and particles, but overall the game is pleasant to look at and quite distinct.\n+ The soundtrack is fantastic. Hideki Naganuma (ignore his reddit-tier twitter) is a fantastic musician and his work in this game is some great stuff (check out his other stuff in Sonic Rush and Lethal League, its worth it). There is also a number of other musicians participating, overall the soundtrack is stellar. \n+ The controls let you do some really fun things once you get used to them. Skating and chaining combos while avoiding Rokkaku/Police leads to some really thrilling gameplay which all comes thanks to your skill, no handholding at all.\n+ A lot of characters to choose from letting you pick a character that feels the best for you.\n\n[h1]Now for the bad things:[/h1]\n- Controls while fine once you get used to them are really, how should i put it, stiff. You are on rollerblades, which is fair enough, but things like jumping from rail to rail require a lot of practice, since the stick influences the direction of your jump [i] really [/i] hard\n- The difficulty curve. You would be hard pressed to find a game that requires you to adapt and learn this quickly as Jet Set Radio. You do the first couple of \"tutorial\" challenges, then you do the first level. Everything is normal. Then you start doing levels in any order you want. But whats that, a rival fight? You can recruit more characters, so why not give it a try. These are noticably more difficult, but you can do it with enough trial and error. Then you get to chapter 2 after like 2 hours of gameplay, and you are thrown into some really difficult stuff, like the race against Beat as Combo, which you are not winning on your first couple of tries. The last chases against gang members where you have to tag them are brutal as well, requiring you to keep trying and brute forcing it. Controls dont help, as the stiffness makes you feel like a snail compared to the on-rails AI which does all these crazy tricks while you desperately try to keep up. You will manage eventually, but the path to beating the game is not an easy one. \n- Tutorial is an optional thing in the menu, but its more difficult than around 80% of the actual game. Trying to chain 50 tricks together at the end of it is not something you can expect someone who just bought the game to do in a reasonable amount of time (under 2 hours). Ive been playing this game on dreamcast and i still find that difficult. \n- Unlocking the extra characters is a chore. Getting the JET rating on every level in the game is much more difficult task than it should be. And you unlock a bunch of them at once, so there isnt even a sense of progression. \n- Some of the achievements sound so painful to do i dont even wanna attempt them, despite being an achievement whorj myself. Not getting latched onto or using every graffiti? Really game?\n\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nA fantastic game definitely worth your time. Its not a walk in the park and it will test your resolve in trying to get through it, but the punishment for mistakes is not that big, at worst its a restart of a level which can all be completed relatively quickly once you know the layout. Music is amazing, the looks still hold up. A definite classic you should get, and its on sale pretty often. Here's hoping for a JSRF release someday. \n", "timestamp_created": 1632484002, "timestamp_updated": 1632484002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70824897289276123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99836620": {"recommendationid": "99836620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393159579", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1632800740}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best videogame soundtracks of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1632404868, "timestamp_updated": 1632404868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523121416568756104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99790232": {"recommendationid": "99790232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198822117183", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 932, "last_played": 1641135848}, "language": "english", "review": "Mm funky..", "timestamp_created": 1632321769, "timestamp_updated": 1632321769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614052414894104004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99778211": {"recommendationid": "99778211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079609072", "num_games_owned": 694, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1632303518}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is genius, and it still holds up.

I'd like to clear up that I love this game and think the art and everything on the visual and auditory side are great. This soundtrack in someways even eclipses the sequel which is also great. If you don't know about any of this then you will undoubtedly have a blast experiencing it for the first time.\n\nWith that acknowledged I feel I must admit that the gameplay for this game can be very hit or miss. Rail grinding and tagging walls is fun but there are constantly things interrupting the flow of whatever line you may be doing. Running up stairs, getting weird collision with the level that stops all your momentum, the game not letting you land on a rail that you should've... There are a lot of things that would make me describe the movement in this game as super floaty. Generally, you would be surprised how difficult it can be to maneuver in this game. I think that for a game pretty much entirely about tricks and movement, this one falls short in many departments especially as you start to get into the later levels which are lot more tight and punishing. It hurts me to level this much criticism on this game but I genuinely think that the movement is super unpolished and for a game of this kind its outmatched (in this department) by its contemporaries like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. At the end of the day though this remake is extremely cheap and I feel that with the price in mind there is a lot more to be gained than lost here.\n\nIf you want to try Jet Set Radio, there is no reason why my criticisms should stop you.

The art style holds up 21 years later.\n\n- Iconic soundtrack. Though limited in quantity compared to something like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2, the soundtrack covers any genre you could possibly associate with urban graffiti and pulls it off almost universally across the board. I'm not sure if you can customize the soundtrack but I just never saw any need to do so because everything is at [i]least[/i] good, at there are a handful of songs and tracks that absolutely propel this game into the stratosphere of legendary video game OSTs (with some licensed songs that do their part perfectly, and in [i]Improvise[/i]'s case, steals the show).\n\n- Impossibly fun. The skating mechanics are far more simplistic than something like Tony Hawk but they work perfectly, since most of the time the grinds you pull off are secondary to painting walls with stunning graffiti art. The stylized graphics of cel-shading were the only way this could be achieved, and with Jet Set Radio, the marriage of style and art melded so perfectly that the most famous and highly regarded imitator ended up being Nintendo with [i]The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker[/i], which just so happens to be another of my favorite games and is bar none the most beautiful Zelda game to date. The style holds up so well I'm disappointed that it largely isn't seen much anymore. We can chalk that up to a bunch of cel-shaded imitators not being very good games I guess.\n\n- The time limit associated with each level you play makes it feel very much like Tony Hawk, and it plays very much like an extended but simple version of it in modes were trick score constitutes the bulk of your points. I should clarify that it's simple but never too simple, and the grinds you're capable of put the blobs of goo in Tony Hawk to shame. Pulling off huge grinds is never not satisfying and it makes anything you do in this game a joy to play, combined with covering the streets with fantastic artwork and making your pursuers look silly in the process.\n\n- The scoring operates on a scale which goes in order from bottom to top: Pedal, Motor, Engine, Turbo, Nitro, and Jet. Increasing your score unlocks new fun things like hidden characters, giving you tangible incentive besides achievements to continue playing and improving.\n\n- The main narrative of this game is as stylized as the artwork, but it's incredibly short even for its day. People used to modern games might be underwhelmed with what the game has to offer at first, but like the underrated [i]Luigi's Mansion[/i], it pays off to replay the game and discover new ways to make the levels infinitely enjoyable. It has bigger areas compared to Tony Hawk that contain interconnected zones, making the city you skate through feel surprisingly realistic. Few games even today can pull that off without just throwing the entire city into the game. The urban feeling present here is palpable.\n\n- I love every character in the game. Cube is my favorite, followed by Gum. Each of them have stats that indicate how much health they have, how much they score off grinds, and how much they score off graffiti (and how tricky it is to pull graffiti off). These stats are labeled in-game as Power, Technique, and Graffiti, and are a clue as to which characters you should use in which modes. Each character also can hold a certain max amount of spray paint cans, which you collect in each level to paint graffiti, further adding or subtracting challenge and nuance.\n\n- Despite being older, it works well on my modern PC. I don't remember it crashing, and there's only the odd and rare sound glitch you'll need to tolerate. I run an AMD system on Windows 10 Home with a 2080 Super. Full controller support is included to my knowledge. I use a wired Xbox One controller.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Quality of life components universally present in modern games don't exist in this one. The inability to restart the level you're playing from the pause menu without having to go back to the garage makes Jet Crush (a mode where you race AI characters to paint a certain area on the map) particularly annoying when you make a mistake that dooms you to lose. When that happens, all you can do is wait until your opponent gets to the end, which could be any number of seconds. The entertaining dance your character does if left idle is little compensation, and if I wasn't high all the time it might piss me off rather than just annoy me a little. You could also choose to go back to the garage, re-select the stage, and slowly scroll back to whatever character you were using just to try again, but that's not nearly as fun as having Gum sway and swing her arms to the beat for a few seconds.\n\n- The game is short and there are only five levels + the inventive and unique boss level. There isn't a clunker in the bunch and all of them are multi-tiered either vertically or horizontally, but I won't say I wasn't disappointed when I technically beat the game in about five hours (and I play games slowly).\n\n--\nCONCLUSION:\nThis is a fantastic game, even today.

Both times, I've been disappointed. This game has A++ presentation, but the gameplay is terrible.\n\nControls are the worst. You will know exactly what you want to do and how to do it, but the game will decide it will not do that thing. Something as simple as going up a ramp becomes a chore. You'll either not be able to correct your direction by a few degrees and miss it or try to grind the rail and end up not grinding the rail. There were times when I had to paint something by wall riding over it, and I was wall riding and was incredibly close to it, but the game never let me paint it. All the while police are trying to kill me, I might add.\n\nGameplay is annoying. Each stage has a time limit of a little over 11 minutes, so they're not short but not long either. If you fail the mission for whatever reason (and you will), then you have to do the entire sequence again. Stages are almost like puzzles. Your objective is to go around painting predetermined spots on each map. You have to collect spray cans that are usually located on grind rails and then paint the spots. At specific completion percentages, the police will come after you with increasingly better troops. It starts with motorcycle squads, police dogs, or whatever else, then it ups it to maybe tear gas firing squads, and even helicopters that shoot homing rockets at you. You have to know what is coming and where they will attack you so you can get those paint targets first. So first time through, you won't know any of that, so you're guaranteed to fail pretty much.\n\nCombine the puzzle-like police troops, the aggravating time limit, and the frustrating controls, and you get a game that looks and sounds awesome but will sorely disappoint you when you actually try to play it.

But when a game causes you to rage quit, I think that serves as more than a recommendation as to why you should not play it. Jet Set Radio boasts a gorgeous cell-shaded art style that has aged surprisingly well thanks to the HD boost and an intermixing of primary colors that blend well together. It reminded me a lot of the Dick Tracy film, which had a similar color palette, albeit here it's much more vibrant.\n\nHowever, all that artistry is wasted on a motion game with poor motion. Jet Set Radio came out in a time when slippery grounds were so common we let them slide (no pun intended)- the idea of translating this natural gameplay flaw into the skating genre was honestly genius given skating's inherent gliding nature.\n\nThe problem is very simple- the directional control is either sloppy or outright absent. Sure, when you're moving throughout the levels just sliding, the joystick works fine. However, the second you try to combine the speed boost with anything other than a straight jump, you get into a tangled web of poor response. Trying to angle your jump fails; trying to turn backwards falters; trying to jump between rail lines is impossible; trying to use a jump to boost you on a rail line is impossible. Essentially what the game wants you to do is come at everything from a straight point with enough built-up velocity, which completely limits the kind of freedom and makes movement a pain. Adding salt to the wounds are the presence of policemen, who seek to stop you as part of JSR's discount-Cyberpunk story of youth rebelling against authority through graffiti. Any gunshot or tear gas hit kills your momentum instantly. Combine this with a camera that is close behind you and limits your field-of-view and you have a system where you honestly have no choice but to backtrack and go back at an obstacle again and again. Not helping things is the fact that sometimes your character won't even attach onto a railing despite you landing on it.\n\nHonestly, there were two quick fixes here: one, provide a manual lock-on for players to easily move or jump b/w objects, and two, provide an insta-boost for players to go from 0-100 (i.e., go from a static position to a moving position). Both would've gone a long way towards alleviating the turning and speed problems.\n\nThe OST was good from the few levels I played- I particularly liked how the NPCs bopped with whatever beat was playing in the background. Voice acting is limited, but I wasn't a fan of Billy Brown's performance as DJ Professor K- it honestly seemed like he was trying to imitate Sam Jackson from Do the Right Thing, but he lacks the passion and comes off as a light-sounding Keith David.\n\nBut overall, the problems with movement caused me to rage quit. Will I come back to it? It's possible- it certainly wouldn't be the first time I've returned to at title that made me rage quit. But then again, life is short, and I have a huge backlog to get through. I probably should've foreseen that things would've been difficult given how poorly-designed and drawn-out the tutorial was.

One that I remember fondly from the age of the Dreamcast. It was unique back then and I\u2019d go so far as to say it still is. Try to imagine a style/rhythm game like DDR mashed with Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater and you have Jetset Radio. Gameplay revolves around rollerblading in level-based environments; performing tricks and throwing up graffiti via quick time events. It\u2019s an interesting gameplay loop that often pits the player against a clock and NPC enemies designed to slow you down. There\u2019s a fair amount of collectibles and optional stages for the completionist in you to have a good time.\n\nThe best thing about this game are its colors, style, and music. Characters are larger than life portrayals of misfit graffiti-artist-rollerbladers. I mean, just saying that out loud makes me grin. These things combined make revisiting Jetset a nice change of pace in contemporary times. The palettes are bright and vivid and the level design looks like a decent reproduction of 90s Tokyo. The artwork is amazing and you can tell that the creators took special care importing the work of top graffiti artists. I also enjoyed messing around with the create your own graffiti section, but the interface could use a good overhaul. It\u2019s not very user friendly.\n\nOne thing that must be addressed is the port. I can\u2019t help but feel like this is not the version of the game that people want to be playing in 2021. The controls are\u2026 not great. If you\u2019ve played modern extreme sports games like Skate, this might be a tough sell for you.  Along with this, I feel like the game\u2019s AI and design is just too muddy. NPCs are relentless and really only serve to grind any particular session to a halt. This was a steal on sale, but after spending a decent amount of time with the game, I can\u2019t help but feel like I should be waiting for a remaster.\n\nI\u2019ll give the recommendation because the game wants to be one of a kind. It\u2019s presentation and premise are spectacular, but it was not smooth sailing through this particular version. Proceed with caution as I can see this port jading a new audience against what I know is actually a stellar game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1620746225, "timestamp_updated": 1620746225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91803609": {"recommendationid": "91803609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045783578", "num_games_owned": 1352, "num_reviews": 394, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 551, "last_played": 1620709134}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game that I was never able to play when it first came out.

After all these years and since the amazing Dreamcast, this hit from Sega is still an awesome game!\nVery hard, on a timer, supported by an incredible soundtrack and still very cool visuals, the game does not lose its originality, It is unique. A lot of collectibles sometimes situated at close to unreachable places permit to change the tags you are going to spray to cover the multiple rivals ones or to listen musics in your garage. I gloat at the crazy lieutenant chasing you like a psychotic and the hordes of cops launching tears grenades or jumping on you like in a rugby match. Dogs are not less terrible. Sliding on ramps and riding walls permit to avoid them while increasing your highest score. The pirate radio and its toaster telling the world your adventure are excellent. \nTo evaluate its difficulty, just look at the achievements. You will see how many players have not  finished it. Damned, I am going to be one of them... but I am already one of those who had back in the days and still have today so much fun with this game.\n\nThis is a pure arcade game for break beat and hip hop culture enthusiasts with a pure soundtrack.

waaaay back when it came out on the Dreamcast, everyone was raving about it and praising it.\nI never managed to actually enjoy it, i always felt the movement was annoying and just stiff and the game, with movement as a central element, was utterly frustrating.\n\nSo here i am decades later and i see it cropping up here and STILL everyone is raving about it.\nI honestly do not understand this, especially with plenty of games that have AT THE TIME had already better movement and depictions of momentum and now there being even more of those, the controls are just ridiculous, slow and clunky.\nAnd that the levels are as narrow and enclosing and limiting as they are does not help in the slightest, since you can't really adjust to circumstances and go alternate routes or something when the clunky controls mess you up. \n\nIt's just a frustrating gameplay experience that not even the admittedly great visual design can save for me.\n\nAnother word to the soundtrack which people also rave about a lot, i already sat my arse down into fire anyway so why not with the soundtrack as well.\nAs is the case with quite a few game soundtracks, the music is quite good because it fits the visuals and mood.\nOUTSIDE of the game it is a soundtrack that is a bit too chaotic, messy and mostly quite noisy.\n\nHowever, this is a case of taste and it is not the first time i like a games soundtrack when playing the game that is not really for me outside of it. \n\nRecommended alternatives: Some of the earlier Tony hawks stuff, the Mirrors Edge games and funny enough a shooter called Ultrakill that is also all about movement in tricky areas and for stylepoints and feels MUCH better to play then this.", "timestamp_created": 1616952376, "timestamp_updated": 1616952376, "voted_up":

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

You won't be able to spend a minute without at least 2 of these occupying your brain. It's funky.\n\nThe rollerskating, representative of [i]JSR[/i]'s gameplay, is pretty fun! I usually don't enjoy skating games because I'm unfamiliar with the subject and hate remembering button combos to do tricks. However, [i]JSR[/i] breaks skateboarding gameplay down to the minimum. Assuming you play with a controller, you essentially use two buttons and the analogue sticks, but even that's a luxury, since the game was designed with only one analogue stick because of the Dreamcast's controller. But that's all [i]JSR[/i] needs to have the movement that it does. Grinding is automatic, explained away by giving the characters magnetic rollerskates that stick to all sorts of rails, and tricks are performed automatically given you have enough airtime during a jump. And like that, you skate around and tag your territory.\n\nWhich brings me to the graffiti, representative of [i]JSR[/i]'s style and identity as a whole. As you probably noticed, it has lots of it. The cel-shading was supposedly used to make the game more cartoony and hide the polygons of the late 90s models, but it ended up making [i]JSR[/i] a game that scales up to modern resolutions incredibly well and stands out quite a lot from your typical game of the era, when almost every game company tried making their games as photorealistic as possible. [i]JSR[/i] has a seriously rebellious attitude and the kind of punk spirit of kids fighting against authority for their right to party.\n\nWhich brings me to the music. My god, the music. The bulk of the soundtrack was composed by Hideki Naganuma, who went on to make music for other games, such as [i]Sonic Rush[/i] and [i]Lethal League Blaze[/i], while the rest of the soundtrack consists of licensed tracks that all fit the game perfectly (except for the inclusion of Rob Zombie, but that may just be my personal distaste). At some points, the gameplay can admittedly feel a bit frustrating or unfair, but hearing the soundtrack while playing just puts a smile on my face all on it's own. I come back quite often just playing the graffiti missions and listening to the music, just vibing everytime.\n\nIt might not be 100% perfect, but this game makes me want to get some rollerblades and start drawing grafitti. And I'm already working on the graffiti.\n\n9/10 - Rock the spot!", "timestamp_created": 1614798082, "timestamp_updated": 1614798118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195110321044922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87790595": {"recommendationid": "87790595", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013543173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1588778234}, "language": "english", "review": "While not as good as future (in my opinion).

To explain, JSR is a rough draft of its sequel JSRF, especially concerning the gameplay. While JSRF gameplay is precise, dynamic and fun, JSR gameplay is clunky, slow and tedious, whether you use a keyboard or a controller.\n\nDon't believe the nostalgic reviews telling you it's a great game. It's not the case. The soundtrack is great though. Buy the soundtrack if you want, not the game. Let's say the truth, Sega should have ported Jet Set Radio Future. It deserved it far more than JSR. Maybe some day, they will. Concerning JSR, I do not recommend it, even with the current price.

A lot. I got into it for two reasons: My best friend recommended it to me, and the main composer of the OST made Sonic Rush's. At first it didn't click, and I wasn't sure why. Later on, I played the rest of the Sega made Dreamcast titles on Steam and I realised: You have to approach this game with the right mentality. It was released for a very niche console over 20 years ago, you have to expect jankiness.\n\nBut despite that, I really don't have complaints here. I love all of the maps in the game. The controls take some time to get used to, but they're quite reliable (most of the time). The artstyle is excelent, making it stand out even to this day. All of the locations are just beautiful, especially the ones set in Japan. The story is quirky and fun (cute, as I call it). The characters are really memorable. The gameplay mixes platforming with graffiting, and some gimmicks here and there.\n\nAnd of course, that soundtrack. [i]Hideki Naganuma[/i]'s first work (as far as I'm aware), and while I don't think it's his best job, it's still extremely memorable, unique and... well, funky! But I'd also like to point this out: please listen to the rest of the soundtrack, not only Hideki's works. Because he made awesome music, but the rest don't stay behind. [i]Rob Zombie[/i], [i]Cold[/i], [i]Jurassic 5[/i], [i]Featurecast[/i], [i]Richard Jacques[/i], and specially [i]Deavid Soul[/i]: all of their contributions (although I think I'm missing some) are just as good!\n\nI think I've said it all now.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly.

SUPER\n\nNo fixes or tweaks were necessary. The game ran at 1440p widescreen without any problems.\n\nOpinion:\n\nJet Set Radio is a platforming game about rollerblading, spraying graffiti all over town, staying one step ahead of the pigs trying to stop you and looking stylish while doing it. \n\nIt's impressive how well this game still holds up, twenty years after its original release on the Sega Dreamcast. Usually you'd expect a game so focused on being cool to come off as dated and out of touch as time went on, but not here. Its unique cel shaded art style allows the visuals to age gracefully, while the character designs and soundtrack still largely hold up today. (Okay, well, maybe Dragula is a bit dated...)\n\nIt's unfortunate that the game is locked to 30fps, but that's not a deal breaker for me. Furthermore, the movement controls can be a bit awkward due to everybody being on skates, but they get easier to deal with as you play. When the stars do align and you manage to pull off a string of tricks and tags, the game is at its best.\n\nThe main game takes about five hours to beat, but keep in mind I've already played the game multiple times so it's slightly faster for me than somebody who's coming in blind.

If any game of Sega's NEEDED a proper remake rather then a \"HD\" port this would be it.\n\nThe foundation of this game, despite what it looks like is not an xtreme sports graffiti game, rather it is a platforming collect-a-thon, and a poor one at that. \n\nThere are rarely moments one is playing this game you do not have the controls or the camera fighting you, I say this as someone who was hyped af at previews of this game back in the day, and owned JSRF as well, (never had a Dreamcast for JSR.) Quite honestly, this game was dated as soon as it hit the market much less now. Its control feels more like something that was a launch title for the ps1 rather then a game that came out when the PS2 was on the market. \n\nBut the issues don't stop at the controls and camera. As previously mentioned this game is very much a platformer, even if it tries to hide that fact and it is a platformer combined with frustrating level design that will have you backtracking fairly sizable distances if you fall, (and you will fall.) This issue is compounded by the fact that every single stage you play is on a timer as well which adds to the frustration. \n\nI say you will fall because as mentioned the controls of this game will be fighting the player with vague jumps off angles at directions that may not go as you intended and landings on sloped surfaces that make it difficult to come to a stop without throwing yourself off a ledge since you are on rollerblades. It is not a matter of if you will fall, but when. \n\nLast thing to say about the gameplay are the \"race\" levels. While not the most difficult are still a cause of frustration. They have you racing an NPC to a spot to tag graffiti. You are never told or shown where this spot is. You simply need to follow the NPC and hope you don\u2019t mess up in doing so, because if you lose sight of them you will have 0 indication of how to find the tagging spot. (unless its already in line of sight.) These areas also have you frequently going in parts of levels you never even knew existed, much less seen. So, odds are quite good you will be replaying these levels a few times to follow the NPC then try to cheese them by cutting them off somewhere towards the end to reach the spot.\n\nEven the tagging the rivals levels while not as bad suffer from an erratic camera since you camera center button and tag button are bound to the same button meaning any attempt to tag the rival has your camera violently pulling itself to center over and over again.\n\nQuite honestly this is a game that would have been remembered as nothing more then a subpar relic of the Dreamcast if it wasn\u2019t for the theming, art direction, and style. And even that doesn\u2019t hold up here. While the game has aged better visually then if it went for a realistic style Sega/Blit Software have done the bare minimum to get this running on modern hardware and nothing more, textures/decals are extremely low res and pixelated which stick out like a sore thumb at resolutions of 2012, much less today.
