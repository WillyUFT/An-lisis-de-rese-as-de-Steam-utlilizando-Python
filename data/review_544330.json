Beneath its colorful exterior lies a dark underbelly of terror, a machiavellian maze designed by the twisted genius of The Architect. This game is the digital equivalent to dancing with the devil. \n\nThey always said Noodle was different from the other snakes. While the other noodles sunned themselves lazily by the watering hole, this Noodle lived for the thrill of the hunt. There is a dark intelligence shining behind that languid tongue, an all-consuming drive to dominate whatever lands dare cross his path.\n\nNoodle's single-minded pursuit of gathering ridiculously placed gemstones shows a disturbing fixation on goal-oriented behavior. The fixated gaze, the flickering tongue - all signs of a calculated killer. That's no garden snake - it's an embodiment of the PCL-R checklist.\n\nThe level design, the obstacles, the puzzles, all serve to showcase Noodle's dark and twisted mind. Each level is a twisted labyrinth of danger and despair, where one wrong move could spell your doom. And as you navigate these treacherous terrains, the Determined Noodle's smirk will be etched into your soul, a constant reminder of the malevolence that lurks within.\n\nAs you guide this unstoppable force through his elaborate death mazes, it becomes horribly clear - you are merely a pawn in Noodle's sinister game. He slithers and slinks with focused determination, never hesitating to put others in harm's way to get what he wants. The smug self-satisfaction in noodle's face shows us a creature devoid of any guilt or remorse, a hunter on the prowl. Just look into those eyes - the icy emptiness of a true apex predator.\n\nBy world 2 you begin trembling at every shadow, haunted by Noodle's lurking presence just out of sight. Is that a phantom hiss on the wind, or his cold flesh sliding over sticks and stone, ever-closing in your position? Sanity itself hangs by a thread as you navigate deeper into his carefully crafted domains, built for no other purpose than to break the minds of those foolish enough to challenge his throne.\n\nBy world 3 I was a paranoid, jittery wreck. Every rustle of grass or chirp of bird was Noodle, closing in for the kill. What twisted machinations went on in that serpentine brain of his? What dark desires fueled his relentless pursuit of more, more, MORE gems? I've seen the work of many serial killers, but none so cunning and calculated as Noodle. He was like Hannibal Lecter with scales - always three moves ahead, and smiling that horrifying smile.\n\nWith every collected gem, his smirk grows wider. He's savoring the hunt. The fa\u00e7ade crumbles. Noodle is no clumsy garden snake. He's a predator. A monster. Your hands shake on the controls as his face leers from the screen. Those dead eyes look right through you.\n\nYou begin to question it all. Who is The Architect? What does Noodle want? Is any of this real? Madness creeps in. Harmless distractions make you flinch. Every shadow holds lurking danger.\n\nYou've stared too long into Noodle's void. Something has stirred, deep in the reptilian part of your brain. Primal fear.

There is an annoying friend character like in all 3d platformers, but what ever it's saying is easily skipped.\n\nThe game looks nice and the level design in solid. Some missed opportunities, like the wind gameplay is just odd. It would seem like using it to float around was an obvious thing to do, but instead you get a one button quick time event where the annoying little bird just plays the game for you a little bit.\n\nLike I said, the controls are fine. I got the hang of it quite fast and actually it works surprisingly well. Maybe after you learn the basics some little annoyances start to appear. Like the end part of the body is just a dead weight you drag around, it doesn't help you in any way and if your head hits an obstacle, it doesn't slow anything else down that the head. Which sometimes leads to annoying deaths as your head doesn't go where you want it to, but the rest of the body just zooms on and off the cliff.\nI never found any use for the \"grip\" button, which the game keeps telling me is super duper vital - again and again. It seems it's just a suppression button for \"slither\". But I can just not press slither.\n\nAnyways. I have had fun with the game.

The main appeal of this game is the mechanic of moving around by only slithering and wrapping around things to reach different areas. \n\nThe gameplay within this game can be seen in multiple ways. On one hand, the layout of levels are intuitive and attractive, with each level presenting a new and exciting challenge. I believe the gameplay is well constructed for the most part, and they even give you save spots right before or after difficult sections, so you don't need to feel nervous about dying once you finish a difficult section and need to go to the next one. But on the other hand, the difficulty and annoying nature of the movement of your character becomes frustrating very quickly. The levels take a while to complete if you are collecting every item, and if you are doing this, you are likely to need to make many difficult maneuvers to collect them, which may lead to many death or inconveniences, such as forgetting a coin near the start of the level once you are already near the end of the level. Factors like these make it hard to play more than 1-3 levels in one sitting. \n\nThe soundtrack is also very nice. It is a small selection of songs, but they were very well made. My favorite track is from the lava realm, but the other realms have some solid tracks too.\n\nUnfortunately, one of this game's weak points is the story and characterization. The story is irrelevant, and the characters simply don't have character. They are simply a means to an end. They are only here because you need someone to play as, and you need a sidekick to evoke the same feeling as games like Banjo-Kazooie or Spyro. Along with the lack of character in the characters, there isn't really much of a story to this game, which is fine. I generally understand why I'm collecting gems for gates in this game, but it doesn't feel like I'm really doing anything significant. It is more like I am just collecting things just because that is what the game tells me to do.\n\nOverall, Snake Pass is a difficult game with an interesting gimmick. The story, characterization, and certain portions of the gameplay could be better; however, the game is an overall good experience. I wouldn't recommend this game to achievement hunters, as it is sort of a painful achievement hunt, but I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn't care about that.", "timestamp_created": 1682665373, "timestamp_updated": 1682665373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664217770099639893", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137367980": {"recommendationid": "137367980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181474903", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1682598975}, "language": "english", "review": "This is more of an interesting tech demo than a game. The controls and camera need a little bit of work, as it ends up feeling incredibly inconsistent to play. Everything is physics based, and I can't help but think that sometimes it is better to not make everything strictly based on physics in order to achieve a better feel and give the player a bit more control. It is a pretty finicky experience that had me janking my way around the levels sometimes, but getting janked by the level at other times.\n\nAs a game, there's really nothing of substance here. There are 15 levels but they may as well all be pretty much the same thing. The motif only slightly changes from level to level. The collectibles are literally just that, and don't actually do anything beyond giving you some sense of accomplishment I guess? It seems that if you get 100% you unlock a new skin, but there's very little reason to play the game after that unless you are intent on speedrunning.\n\nIf you can get the game on sale for a couple bucks or something, then it might be worth it just to mess around for a bit. Though it's really nothing to write home about, and they could have been much more imaginative with adding things like new abilities or a higher degree of variation in the levels. It would have been cool to see something like boss fights at the end of worlds, too. Either that, or some moments with set pieces that are interesting.\n\nThe checkpoint system is also a little wonky, with physical buttons you have to land on in order to save your progress in the level. If you just went through a big set of snaking around over a perilous void, grab the main collectible you need to beat the level, and then die after, you're going to have to do it all over again instead of just starting from when you collected the main piece. It can get a little annoying.\n\nThere are also cutscenes you can't skip that sort of overstay their welcome, and your spot in the level select isn't saved so you have to navigate back to the level you left off on one by one. The options menu is also pretty lacking. Minor problems, but they start to get old pretty fast.\n\nCan't comment on the music because I turned it off and played my own.", "timestamp_created": 1682599845, "timestamp_updated": 1682599845, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514735639095306396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137093002": {"recommendationid": "137093002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230560996", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 578, "last_played": 1682137569}, "language": "english", "review": "Another to add to the list of games that should definitely have a sequel but just don't for some reason.

While most games anthropomorphize snake characters to give them familiar control schemes, this game drills down into imagining what it would be like to control a real snake. The control scheme is deliberately weird and clunky \u2014 to the point that, according to Steam statistics, half of all players never even finished the first level! \u2014 but that\u2019s what makes it so unique. Controls are similar to how vehicles are usually handled in video games: Instead of being able to freely move in any direction, you can only accelerate forwards and steer on the go. However, the physics of the snake\u2019s body add more depth to this and are amazingly well-done. Climbing across objects requires you to coil around them for support, just like real snakes do, and you have to keep track of how your weight is distributed across such a long body to ensure you don\u2019t lose balance. Also, moving in straight lines is very slow, but you can slither side-to-side to build up speed, which I thought was really neat. The controls initially feel very confusing and even basic tasks require deep concentration, but over time they become second nature. The whole thing is a really clever, inventive, and well-done idea. The game\u2019s tagline is \u201cThink like a snake,\u201d and by the end I definitely was \u2014 like all good puzzle games, it encouraged me to expand my way of thinking.\n\nAdditionally, I really enjoyed the aesthetics. Environments are very colorful and well-lit, so important objects never feel hidden by the level design. Noodle himself is absolutely adorable, and I especially love the distressed noises he makes when he slips or grips tightly \u2014 it\u2019s not only cute characterization, but a genuinely helpful audio cue to help you keep track of his huge body. Unlike in most platformers, I rarely felt frustrated by failures, because Noodle was so silly and charming I couldn\u2019t stay mad at him.\n\nMy one criticism is that the game really needed a \u201cskip cutscene\u201d option. Cutscenes are replayed every time you revisit a previous level, which is a real pain in a collect-a-thon platformer where you\u2019re encouraged to return to levels to get stuff you missed. Similarly, while I respect that you have to return to a checkpoint to record collectibles as obtained so you can\u2019t just bypass the puzzle by making a suicide jump off a cliff, checkpoints could have been more frequent; there were many times where I had to re-collect items while redoing a difficult sequence I died on a lot. Something like Celeste\u2018s mechanic where they get recorded as soon as you touch safe ground would have been a lot smoother.", "timestamp_created": 1682083993, "timestamp_updated": 1682083993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136914580": {"recommendationid": "136914580", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994496209", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2434, "last_played": 1678489837}, "language": "english", "review": "bon delire le bail", "timestamp_created": 1681837309, "timestamp_updated": 1681837309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136727473": {"recommendationid": "136727473", "author": {"steamid": "76561199129709626", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 266, "last_played": 1681929908}, "language": "english", "review": "no joke played this while i was high and spent 10 minutes looking at how pretty the water was", "timestamp_created": 1681546877, "timestamp_updated": 1681546877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537393152713775635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136521521": {"recommendationid": "136521521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198848382060", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1681216849}, "language": "english", "review": "while an interesting concept the controls are a bit too clunky, the camera is a nightmare at times and your general slowness is maddening", "timestamp_created": 1681217052, "timestamp_updated": 1681217052, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547998189926147461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136186437": {"recommendationid": "136186437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004546096", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 276, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1680748396}, "language": "english", "review": "What a colorful, cute, polished mix of joy this game is.\n\nThe controls (keyboard+mouse for me) are done well and feel really intuitive.

Sooner than later you'll find yourself sliding-stretching-curving-swinging like a really slick snake and it feels great.\n\nThe snake's ever-changing facial expressions and gasped groaning gives it so much character. 15 large, gorgeous locations to explore and find collectibles cleverly hidden and/or difficult to snatch (as you need to get back to any checkpoint for the pickups to count).\n\nI did not find most of the game particularly difficult. Some select coins were challenging to grab but just playing the story mode is fine. That is until the last two levels where the difficulty spikes noticeably. Not to a point where it competes with hardcore platformers or anything but your younger brother probably won't get through it. I also saw someone complain about the snake being too slow, well perhaps you should pay a speck of attention at the tutorial and slither/zig-zag to go faster.\n\nAnyway, the minor downsides are a few unskippable cutscenes and lack of rewards.

The fact that actually playing the game is also wonderful is just a bonus. The control scheme of Noodle is a really interesting one that is particularly effective at making you entirely rethink how to approach even the most basic of platforming challenges, replacing thoughts of jumping to new areas with understanding how to slither up the bits of environment surrounding you. It ends up having a dynamic more akin to a puzzle platformer than a more traditional one, where almost every obstacle's challenge stems from working out how to approach something as opposed to the execution of that approach itself.It's not as if the game doesn't require good execution at all either though, since the control scheme is initially pretty tough to wrap your head around all the intricacies of, particularly the careful balance you often need to strike between being very meticulous and being fast. The level design plays into this very nicely as well, with a lot of sections being built in such a way that you're able to bypass a lot of seemingly difficult challenges if you fully come to terms with the nuances of your movement, leading to an experience that feels rife with discovery that largely feels self-motivated. It goes a long way in making you feel like you're beginning to understand the unconventional methods you need to take to accomplish basic traversal without feeling directly enforced either, leading to a unique experience in a way that isn't as immediately apparent as the fact that you're playing as a snake.The presentation elevates things that bit further as well, with the beautiful, lush environments and fantastic soundtrack making it pretty pleasant to exist in these levels even if you're stuck at a particular section for an extended period of time while you're further refining your movement. One thing I think would've been nice is something to have added a bit more variety to the individual stages though, as while what the 15 levels here have still make for a fun time, it does begin to wear out its welcome a tiny bit by the final couple, and I think it's just because of the lack of real variety beyond a couple of clever obstacles that still didn't feel like quite enough to differentiate one level from the next. It's definitely not a dealbreaker since there's some appeal in coiling around the various poles and platforms to reach greater heights even after you've done it countless times, but some more unique stage elements would definitely elevate this further. Even with that said though, this is great, would highly recommend for people to play this if they're interested in seeing a rather fresh take on collectathons.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1679795709, "timestamp_updated": 1679795709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135420721": {"recommendationid": "135420721", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993509913", "num_games_owned": 1467, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1680056082}, "language": "english", "review": "[list]A imperfect but fun platformmer in the vein of a less stressful Getting Over It.[/list][list]Unfortunately the saving/checkpoint system is outdated and just bad.

Here's a game that would've been better off had it remained a game jack project.\n\nBoasting luscious Nintendo bright aestethics, wonderfully rendered in Unreal Engine and the whimsical UI design of a Rayman game, I present to you a game which is best enjoyed by watching others play it for 10 minutes then forgetting it ever existed.\n\nYou think to yourself: this looks relaxing, this looks fun, this could be my chill-out game when I'm feeling tired. But alas, NO.\n\nDespite having perfectly competent art direction and an immaculately executed core mechanic, the design is atrocious.\nThis is a sin onto the gaming space, bringing in early tweens restrictive hand-holding and tutorializing like a Wii era 3rd party Nintendo game.\n\nThe companion character is worse than unncesary. This worthless, piece of dung hummingbird for some reason keeps popping up tutorializing the most basic things, interupting the gameplay every 30 seconds with unskippable cutscenes which triggered at the start of each level. \n\nTHis utter trash character can interupt you after you just cleared a quarter of the stage, just to announce\" HURR DURR! OH NO! THE GEMS ARENT IN THE PORTAL. WE HAVE TO GET THE GEMS> REMEMBER? THE THING YOU DO EVERY LEVEL? HURR DURR?\nAnd then you die because his cutscene interupted you while you were scaling an obstacle and it moved the camera and killed your controls so now you fell, and YOU LOSE ALL PROGRESS.\n\nYes, for God-knows-what-reason this game has no freaking persistance. If you fall down a cliff you lose all progress. WHY?! Why in a game with NO TIMER and NO LIVES I have to finish every level perfectly without one slip-up or I lose all my progress.\n\nYou know what the fun in these collect-athon games is? IT'S EXPLORATION.\nHow am I supposed to want to explore and get everything if everytime I try something fun I get punished and have to go through the whole stage again. \n\nI end up just wanting to get the gems to unlock the exit and go to the next stage instead of wasting my time trying the same stupid obstacles over and over again and losing all my progress.\n\nWhoeve designed these systems literally ruined all the work their more competent colleagues did.\n\nFreaking unplayable. This is just a frustration factory. \nA real shame. \nIf you just corrected these minor aspects, which would actually be removing components, rather than any creative work, you'd have an amazing chill game.\n\nIf someone makes a mod to remove the stupid humming bird and stop the progress reset on falls, this game is worth a spin.\nUntil then, stay the hell away.\n", "timestamp_created": 1674755159, "timestamp_updated": 1674755159, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489022344350814819", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131480910": {"recommendationid": "131480910", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122668729", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 87, "playtime_at_review": 1800, "last_played": 1700528690}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Physics,  good game play.", "timestamp_created": 1674588770, "timestamp_updated": 1674588770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131409627": {"recommendationid": "131409627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011877096", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 529, "last_played": 1674487265}, "language": "english", "review": "Super cool concept for a platformer.

Also, it's *not* particularly relaxing; you'll often find yourself tightening your grip on the mouse/controller and cringing as you try not to slip off ledges.\n\nWHAT GENRE IS THIS GAME?\nIt's not quite an adventure in the spirit of Banjo-Kazooie. I would actually liken it more to Mirror's Edge. Like Mirror's Edge, the game is based entirely around your skills with a particular set of moves/controls.\n\nHOW DIFFICULT IS THIS GAME?\nThere's a steep learning curve at the beginning, but about an hour or two into the game, you'll realize that the game is pretty easy to complete. However, the game is significantly more difficult if you try to collect all the collectibles and *especially* if you try to collect all the Steam achievements. This game is good for both casual gamers and \"serious\" gamers alike.\n\nIS THIS GAME WORTHWHILE?\nYes, this game is definitely worthwhile. The most common complaint among the negative reviews seems to be that people don't like the controls. Well, mastering the controls is the whole point! Be prepared for a steep learning curve over the first hour of gameplay, but if you're OK with that, then I think most people would enjoy this game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1672873148, "timestamp_updated": 1672873148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534019172191619873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130081318": {"recommendationid": "130081318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198973821986", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1672281874}, "language": "english", "review": "i beg you devs, add sex with the hummingbird.", "timestamp_created": 1672806464, "timestamp_updated": 1672806464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472067475318908691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130075606": {"recommendationid": "130075606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239910450", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1672799957}, "language": "english", "review": "it's like dark soiuls", "timestamp_created": 1672799997, "timestamp_updated": 1672799997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506775081157684326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130042573": {"recommendationid": "130042573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082764480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 385, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1672766123}, "language": "english", "review": "Snake Pass is a short physics based 3d platformer/collectathon that has a different approach to the genre.

Messing up means you've committed that much more time to redoing a section, and the added bonus of losing the collectables you've gathered since the last checkpoint makes it all the more tedious if you're a completionist. \n\n-Camera: When you get to the rotating bits, it becomes hell trying to maneuver Noodle while also maneuver the camera around the moving object.\n\n-Accessibility settings: There are none, barring the \"easy\" preset for the controls. For a game that seems to market toward all ages, you'd think it would incorporate some options to make it more comfortable and enjoyable for everyone. (And no option to disable controller vibration in-game? [i]Smh my head...[/i])\n\n-Cutscenes: You can't skip em. They aren't all that interesting and they start to get pretty annoying when you want to replay levels. \n\nOverall, Snake Pass is cute and fun the majority of the time. The pursuit of mastering the controls is the game's focal point and what I keep coming back for.

Story is simple and cute.\nThe gameplay is fun and smooth and mechanics work mostly as probably intended. This can be frustrating if you're not used to how it all works especially if going for some harder collectibles right from the beginning. To maximise enjoyment of this game, I would highly recommend taking the time in the first few levels to really get used to the controls and behaviour of the snake body and how best to utilise that when moving along climbable objects horizontally and vertically. There are also ways to creatively use some of the mechanics for collectibles to make things a bit easier.\n\nCompleting the levels isn't hard, some of the achievements and collectibles are the difficult part, but if you're interested in trying, it is definitely important to master the mechanics to avoid tearing your hair out from the frustration of dying for 100th time like I did the first time I tried playing it ;) For me at least it made a huge difference once my brain clicked on how to best approach certain types of situations/climbable material.\n\nKind of annoying:\n- Sometimes the mechanics don't work how you might expect, but once I got used to how it works in game it wasn't too much of a problem, just occasional bits where it could have been better.\n- Cutscenes unskippable even on second playthrough which is a bit of a pain when replaying for achievements", "timestamp_created": 1672506165, "timestamp_updated": 1672506165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129555633": {"recommendationid": "129555633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230700524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1673232084}, "language": "english", "review": "Loving the game, learning so much about snake movement, more respect for those creatures more than ever.\n\nThis game does underwater sections beautifully, the mechanical puzzles and the ones with movable objects are fantastically fiendish\n\nOnly complaint i have is on the camera, not sure if its intentional on devs part but for the control mechanism designed into this game good camera is critical given the difficulties of some of the puzzles.

In my book, the game nails the movement of the snake. This is so unique and ultimately satisfying, that I'd go so far to call this game an 'experience' (in the good sense).\n\nTHE MEH\nAll the rest is either okay or flawed. The soundtrack, although apparently composed by the Donkey Kong-guy doesn't go beyond serviceable in my opinion. Graphics and story also don't get in the way of the fun, but are not amazing either.\nThe learning curve is more of a tiny wall. Steam achievements show that like 50% of players drop off before the first real achievement (crazy!) and only about 5% finish the game. I also raged after 20min, but after like an hour it clicked and I felt totally comfortable.\n\nTHE BAD\n- The camera comes close to making this unplayable at times. \n- There is a sense of 'jankyness' that runs through the game, in how the main menu or stage select looks like.\n- The game actually straight up got confused at some point and soft-locked.\n- In a puzzle-/precision-platformer, each challenge should be tackled in succession and then saved, like it's mostly done in Celeste. Instead, there are (admittedly rather frequent) checkpoints. But there is no joy in redoing stuff you already mastered. A game like this should not induce risk-reward trade-offs, but should encourage players to attempt difficult maneuvers at all times.\n- The open-worldyness does not help the game. Partly due to the abysmal camera, I did not enjoy exploration at all and just wanted my gauntlet of platforming challenges.\n- Too frequent, unwanted hand-holding in the beginning (gets better).\n- Too short with only 6 hours of playtime. To be fair - the lack of diversity in gameplay also meant that I would not have wished for more game after that point.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n- Regular price is \u20ac20. If money isn't too tight, you are willing to invest in a game and/or you want to play something you never played before, then I'd recommend the game even at that price. Otherwise it'd be a no.\n- Sale price is \u20ac3: go for it!\nFor all its flaws, I must recommend the devs for trying something radically different, executing formidably where it counts the most and creating a memorable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1669436861, "timestamp_updated": 1669436861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126929184": {"recommendationid": "126929184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198234440488", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 365, "last_played": 1669427969}, "language": "spanish", "review": "He jugado el juego y me he podido pasar sus 15 niveles pero no lo puedo recomendar por 3 cosas que para m\u00ed son imperdonables. \n1\u00ba: El juego tiene una historia de mier**.

[/b]\n\nI had a great time with this game. Remarkably, the whole thing (controlling a snake in 3D in a platforming environment) feels original, and technically, I think the goal has been well achieved. It does however require time to get used to the controls, and even more to master them. It gave me some kind of Octodad vibes, except without the arguably social commentary, and much slower paced. As such, especially getting some of the trickiest collectables can be stressful, in a good way though if you do have the patience to learn the ropes.\n\nI must admit I didn't personally find the game as hard as what its reputation seems to indicate, and so it took me about 7 hours to finish the game and get all the collectibles. That being said, the game could indeed use a bit more checkpoints at times and the camera does tend to fight against the player in more enclosed areas. I'd say don't forget you can zoom in and out a little, which sometimes makes a big difference. And while we're at it, you might want to know (at least I wish I knew) that after finishing the game once, you receive a special power, snake vision, that lets you see through walls and thus, no need to worry much about the more excessively hidden collectibles you might miss (assuming you care about them).\n\nThe visuals and the music are amazing! Although both could arguably gain from more diversity after a while. Honestly, only four songs for all the levels gets a bit repetitive, especially if you take the time to reach the optional collectibles. But in the end, it remains accessory to the experience, which is profoundly mechanical. In any case, I was quite pleasantly surprised!

This means that your method of movement is fairly unique, as you have to slither around and coil yourself around poles in order to get around. It's quite awkward to try to coil yourself around stuff but later on it'll become second nature to you. It is quite slow compared to other games and \"platforming\" rewards careful patient movement, as rushing or panicking will likely cause Noodle to slip off whatever pole or bit of landscape he's on and send him plummeting to his doom.\n\nHowever, this same slowness can be a detriment to the experience. The game is hard and you will die a lot especially when trying to gather all the various collectibles. While there are checkpoints scattered across the levels failure means you'll keep having to repeat the same careful movements over and over just to get back to where you failed at prior. This gets time-consuming and tedious.\n\nSpeaking of time-consuming, the game likes to wrest control of Noodle and the camera for unskippable pseudo-tutorial sections. You'll have to deal with them every time you respawn or replay a level. In fact, these forced pauses can straight up kill Noodle if you activated them in a bad spot! The length of death animations and how long it takes to resume control when respawning at a checkpoint is also a bit too long.\n\nThe camera itself is quite wonky, it's not uncommon to have your vision of Noodle and obstacles that you need to navigate obscured by random objects being in the way or because the camera is too zoomed in. It can be quite disorienting and infuriating when Noodle dies cuz you can't tell what's going on. The camera can also result in your control over Noodle being rendered more awkward and erratic as he goes where you don't want him to go, which is quite bad in a game as previously stated rewards methodical movement.\n\nAs for the levels themselves, they're broadly good. There's a variety of mandatory and optional obstacle courses mainly designed out of poles in different positions that manage to be quite distinct and fun to navigate in practice. Levels also need you to collect three different gems to use the exit. These gems are almost always found on different paths that you can tackle in any order, and they loop back on the main hub of each level which makes accessing the paths to other gems convenient and relatively speedy.\n\nThere are four worlds each with a different theme and four (three in the case of the final one) levels each. They each introduce new kinds of obstacles to contend with which keeps things fresh and focus on them just enough where you get a good interesting experience with em where they don't wear out... except for the third world but I'll get to that later.\n\nI do feel like the four worlds do feel a bit samey though. While they do have different skyboxes, soundtracks, minor decorative differences, and lighting the building blocks of the levels and what Noodle will be slithering over will still be overgrown ancient Mesoamerican themed stone ruins covered in bamboo poles no matter what. It's not a deal breaker in any way but it would have been nice if there was more distinction in the visuals of the different worlds.\n\nMy biggest problem however, are with one particular kind of obstacle. Moving blocks and poles. They make the camera and movement controls [i] really [/i] act up. Furthermore, in a game whose basic controls and issues encourage slow patient movement moving platforms and poles suddenly demand that you make quick decisive actions and constantly move in a game that isn't built for that sort of thing. \n\nFailure no longer feels like the result of your own mistakes but instead the result of bullshit fucking you over in ways outside of your own control. Success no longer feels vindicating and rewarding by having you demonstrate to yourself you own improved proficiency at the game letting you successfully navigate its challenges but instead makes you sigh in relief as you lucked out and managed to get past something unfair.\n\nThe worst instance of the issues the game has is the third world, which is a fire themed one. Not only does the main obstacle here, hot coals, obscure your vision when you touch them but the color grading in said world makes stuff even harder to see due to how red and darkened everything looks. And then it has the highest amount of the aforementioned moving platforms and poles in the game, which combined with the vision issues makes things even more frustrating.

It's fun, but it's also broken and diabolical.\n\nIn Snake Pass you play as a chain attached to a lead weight. You steer the lead weight left, right, back and forth and can lift it up a certain distance, however once you let go of the 'lift head' button it drops like an anchor and if you're careless while climbing the momentum will drag you to an unfortunate death while as you scream in terror. The front half of your snake can grip onto horizontal and (to a point) vertical surfaces such as walls and monkey bars, but appears to have a disproportionate amount of trouble with any degree of inclined surface, which cause him to slow down or slip off in a direction you might not expect. There is a 'grip' button that is supposed to help you not slip off things. It doesn't really help with that most of the time to the point that I'm not sure what it actually does mechanically, but there are a couple of situations where holding or tapping it helped with... something or other. The back half of your snake has no particular ability to move or grip on its own, however it will stabilise you on certain surfaces (in a way that is hard to describe) and is essentially a helpful platform that follows the front half when it isn't actively trying to kill you.\n\nSpeaking of platforms, the game is a platformer, which traditionally means that you play as a biped who advances the game by jumping between said platforms. However, in this game you play as a snake, who cannot jump by traditional means due to the unforunate circumstance of not having any legs. On top of this Noodle is a disgusting vegetarian who is incapable of striking like a regular snake meaning he is also incapable of jumping by nontraditional means. Instead he has to cross between platforms by stretching his body and slithering over and around monkey bars or by swimming in that deadly substance known as DiHydrogen Monoxide, which tragically claims the lives of millions of platforming bipeds every year. Fortunately, Noodle is immune to the stuff.\nSometimes between the platforms there is ground, so if you fall down have to try over. At other times there is fire, spikes or nothing between the platforms, in which case if you fall down you have to try over. Sometimes the platforms move and/or rotate with their attached collection of monkey bars, in which case you have to carefully time crossing between so that you don't fall down and have to try over. Also later on there are gusts of wind which either mildly inconvenience you or bug out Noodle's physics.\nBy the way most of the time on the fire puzzles Noodle's tail just barely hangs into the fire so he screams in agony the entire time. Fun fact.\n\nThe way you solve most puzzles doesn't really change much in concept (you wrap around shit and try not to go too slow/fast), but that isn't so bad because zooming around as a snake doesn't seem to get old. If you swish Noodle's head from side to side while moving like a real snake (i.e. slithering) you will pick up speed and momentum. The problem is that you will get stuck on objects on the ground, real or imaginary, and inclined slopes will kill your momentum entirely, so a lot of the time you are not zoomin at all. If you brush past grass or a pipe or rock then Noodle will often drop down to a snail's pace until his whole body is past the obstacle. Some objects can make him stop entirely until you backtrack past them. However, those times when you actually are zoomin do kind of make it worth it.\n\nI'm going to clumsy segue into difficulty now, which results almost entirely from the game's physics model being capricious and brutally unforgiving. On some puzzles you just slip off for no reason. Noodle is cued to scream in terror any time he falls off an object, and on certain puzzles for no visible reason he screams the entire time you're doing it. I think it's what happens whenever the monkey bars are at a 15 degree or more incline, which tend to yeet you into the abyss if you slow down for a couple seconds or fail to keep wrapping Noodle around the bars consecutively. I don't mean to imply that if you slow down you'll slide down the bar's incline. Instead, for some reason Noodle's coils unravel from the tail and then the weight and momentum of his falling back half rips his front half off the bars. For contrast, if you're climbing up the side of a flat wall and can hook Noodle's neck just barely over the top edge, you can wiggle him back and forth and he slowly pulls himself up. This works on totally horizontal monkey bars to a lesser degree - Noodle can do as many pullups as he wants as long as the bar isn't just barely on an incline, or if it isn't Tuesday.\nOn that line of thinking, your snake's passive ability to grip onto objects often doesn't work properly when any physics other than straight downward gravity are being applied. If a puzzle is moving you side to side or rotating, sometimes Noodle will unravel and get left behind or otherwise get shot off in a random direction and fall into the abyss. I recall one platform that moved quickly up and then to the side. It had a vertical monkey bar for you to grip onto, however Noodle would always unravel and then fall off before reaching the top, and the only way to avoid this was to do the snake equivalent of jogging on the spot. No other puzzle in the game did this to me as obviously, but it did vindicate the suspicion I had that certain puzzles just break the game somehow.\nJust as an aside, you would think that the 'grip' button would be designed to help in this kind of situation, but it didn't work in this case or on any inclined bars and it also stops Noodle from moving forward while you press it in which case it becomes a handy and convenient 'slip off and die' button instead. Oh the irony.\n\nI don't think the developers understood the difficulty of their own game. I went for 100%, and some of the most frustrating coins to collect were right at start of the game in puzzles that consisted of a few slightly inclined bars hanging just below the edge of a cliff, which as previously mentioned have a habit of flinging you to your death. This sort of design resulted in the game's difficulty curve looking more like a difficulty electrocardiogram. That said, maybe it would've been different if I hadn't gone for collectables, but I don't think there would've been much game left over if I had cut them out.\nOn the counterside to that, if you master slithering you can abuse that momentum to easily blast through, over or around a large number of the game's puzzles. In all honesty I found circumventing puzzles far more fun than challenging them as intended by the developers, and it began to feel a little bit like revenge after a while, too.\n\nWhile I'm here I may as well comment on the game's checkpoint spam. That's not to say that there are a huge number of checkpoints IN the game, but rather if you don't enjoy frustration then you'll be visiting one after every couple of collectibles because dying takes them back off you. I appreciate that they had to put this mechanic into the game so that you can't grab coins by yolo flinging yourself into the abyss, but it did nevertheless waste a huge amount of time, and it doesn't help that Noodle isn't always allowed to go at max speed. The result was that my go-to strategy since level 1 has been to find a save point after doing any puzzle that took more than several moments to beat. For me this was like the platformer equivalent of being stuck on the road behind a grandma driving at half the speed limit.\n\nOn controller you may find yourself dying a lot when you take your thumb off the 'lift head' button to adjust the camera. They could have made his head stay put and made the 'dive' button lower your head instead but no. The camera sucks too.

The gameplay is pretty simple. Coil and twist your snake across the map and find all the collectibles. While that sounds simple enough, the controls and cameras can sometimes fight you and make you think your snake is drunk at times. Like most platformers though, the swearing in anger at deaths and the elation of getting everything on the maps is what makes the game fun.\n\nMy only gripe is that I felt there was not enough difference in the worlds to truly make them feel all that different. Like if 80% of all the maps all have the same cookie cutter portions, then the repetitiveness starts to sink in. In fact, I could normally only play a map or two before I had to take a break to avoid burnout. There was enough game here though that made me want to finish it. \n\nOverall, I got 7 hours of decent platforming out of the game.

A 3D Platformer fun colorful graphics and great music is just what I like. Then I played a few levels and didn't like it, and didn't touch it again. I fought with the controls. I got it in a bundle on steam and figured I'd give it a try again. I'm glad I did, but this game is not without faults. It is not a 3D platformer in the same vein as Banjo, Crash, Spyro, or Croc, despite being a ( loose) platformer, and in 3D. I say loose platformer, not as a pun, but because you're not going to be running, or jumping. You will be slithering, coiling and falling. It's more a physics based platformer, and you can fight the controls a lot before getting them, if you get them. Once you get them, it's very satisfying to do some fun tricks and cheese through parts of the levels, you can do some pretty crazy level skip portions when you get good at them.\n\n\nPros: \n-Great Graphics, colorful vibrant levels\n-Great mascot, Noodle is cute and reminds me of 90s platformers like Croc, Crash, Banjo and Spyro design wise\n-Fun collectathon\n-What music there is, is catchy\n-level design is fantastic\n-Once you get the controls, they are fun! I recommend easy controls, it's just less buttons to hold. (I used controller, but I played a level with KB/M despite not preferring it, and it controlled great as well.\n\n\nCons:\n-No enemies. Like I said, the only thing you will fight is the controls.\n-No Bosses either\n-story is really non existent, and bad, even by kids game/platformer standards.\n-Cutscenes , dialogue and animations are not skippable, which while they aren't plentiful or long, when you're replaying for achievements it gets old, and the end level cutscene gets annoying quick\n-Needs more music variety. I think they're are maybe like 8 tracks in the game if that. At least from what I heard.\n-More Levels, or collectables. Each world has 4 levels except the last which has 3. Only 4 worlds. The last level isn't like a big boss level either, a normal level. It's like they just straight up forgot the last level. You can likely get every achievement and 100% this game in ten hours or less if you try or are better at this sort of game.\n-Camera, the camera in this game is bad. A pan out or top down view to check surrounding would be great, you'll die a few times too many due to not being able to see your character.\n\n\n\nOverall, the pros outweigh the cons for me and I very much recommend this game.

With true-to-life slithering and swimming, and even life-like breathing, this novel and beautifully rendered game delivers an immersive snaking experience.  The rich tropical world and upbeat music create an engaging work of art through which to weave and coil.  A great deal of time and energy went into this product, and it shows.  The snaking mechanics are novel and brilliant.\nBecause the game is so close to perfection, I can't help but point out one issue that may create friction with the target audience.  When coiling, there is necessarily a point where up becomes down, or vice versa.  On stopping the coil, at times this immediately reverses the direction in which you were snaking.  It can cost you all progress instantly on a given structure.  There is a steep learning curve with this mechanic, and it is not intuitive to everyone, including the armchair or casual puzzle gamer to whom this design should innately appeal.  From my perspective, the natural solution is a strong grip mechanic to anchor when changing positions or directions.  In real life, arboreal snakes grip with the ends of their tails to avoid the fate of Noodle who, true to his name, often plummets from his perch due to his flaccid tail.  The grip function just seems to slow his roll a bit, and it will not offset loose coils that can cost him progress if he misdirects.  Instead, having the back quarter of his tail hold his position would help the player \"get a grip\" while using the innovative controls.

I've never played a game quiet like it, and I absolutely love it. Can you find the all powerful Keystones and restore magic to the land?  \n\nThe Pixar-esk cartoon world of Snake Pass is well rendered, with saturated colors, and a focus on a South American rainforest aesthetic. Stone ruins, wooden structures, bodies of water, and interactive mechanisms beak up the large swatches of green which dominate the game. The ever expressive orange snake (smartly named Noodle) pops against the backdrop, and is animated with an impressive amount of detail and personality. Noodle is a delightful dude. The ability to change the their expression on the fly is hilarious, and I found myself doing it constantly. Later level include lava, and water worlds to keep things from getting stale.\n\nThe music comes from legendary composer, David Wise, who's best known for his work on the Donkey Kong County series. The atmosphere is upbeat, and some of the tracks are down right funky. It's a perfect match, as his talents are put to good use here. The King of Jungle Music Strikes Again. \n\nWhile the collectathon isn't a new concept, Snake Pass feels fresh due to the fact you're not jumping and climbing like a standard platformer. YOU'RE A SNAKE! This means you MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD LIKE A SNAKE. Stretching, slithering, wrapping, clinging, and swinging is the name of the game. The physics driven animations and interactivity is tied to the joysticks, along with several simple button presses. Tying yourself to branches and wrapping around objects becomes second nature, as you try to collect everything you can. The puzzles themselves offer a fair challenge, and the execution of the solutions becomes gradually harder as you travel with a humming bird ally, who can grab your tail, which is remarkably useful for anchoring, stretching and gliding.\n\nAnyone who is considering this one should just get it. You'll love Noodle, as well as the gameplay of Snake Pass. It's a cute, fresh game that will stands out in your platforming library. I hope they do a sequel someday. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1649561648, "timestamp_updated": 1649561648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113553959": {"recommendationid": "113553959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368503295", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 168, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1649470704}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent graphics!

Shame it is surrounded by a myriad of frustration ticks.\n\nCamera behavior and checkpoint saving are the worst offenders here by far. To start, while camera can be rotated freely, the input scheme (no remapping for \"recommended\" controller, of course) frequently requires to hold some of the face buttons, thus locking the right thumb out from handling the stick. But even if one manages to adapt, there's no camera clipping through scene objects, so any collision (whether it's a stone wall or a two-pixel pebble) will likely span and zoom in/out the view unpredictably. And with all levels placed over bottomless pit, sooner or later this will lead to snake's death, which is the perfect time for the player to discover that collectibles aren't being saved between checkpoints \u2014 a questionable decision by itself, a bad one with such high undeserved fail rate, and a boneheaded one for a collectathon with an emphasis on unconventional controls.\n\nBasically all other aspects just add to irritation after that. UI elements constantly get in the view, as does the bird companion. Bird that also pesters the player with mandatory tutorial messages during the first levels. Tutorial messages that also can come as unskippable cutscenes. Actually, cutscenes are unskippable just period, all of them: from the area ending dialogue to bird's victory dance three times a level.

The game on first look seems like it is directed towards kids, what with the trivia that the snake is apparently vegetarian, but the gameplay itself can be a frustrating ordeal that I cannot see myself as a kid wanting to play, and seems to be meant for hardcore platformers. Maybe they are aiming for kids REALLY into platformer games?\n\nI will first get into what this game did good. The environment is colorful and pleasant to look at. The music is also great, unsurprisingly due to the fact it was composed by David Wise. The characters themselves are adorable and this is one of the cutest snakes I have seen in any media (the snake is even named 'Noodle'). It is also one of the most innovative 3-D platformer I have seen, being that you are a snake having to traverse the levels like how a snake would and was refreshing to play, for at least the first few levels.\n\nHowever, the flaws and what the game lacks becomes more apparent the further you get into the game. Yes, the gameplay is innovative, but so is the idea of utilizing 3 other GBA in tandem with a Gamecube for a 4 player coop for FFCC. Innovative gameplay doesn't necessarily translate to good gameplay. For one thing, this game is a physics-based game, and I often find that I have to utilize lots of precision to ensure that the snake won't simply slide off platforms, fail to grip on scaffold, or whiplash in a direction that I did not meant to go. I also wished that everything the snake could do is introduced in the first level instead of spaced out to later levels. One of the biggest problems, which is also another innovative idea this game has, is to have the snake slither left and right to pick up speed. While novel and fun to experiment with, it becomes a chore and in some cases, more frustrating than needed due to the fact that many puzzle elements requires a certain momentum that you simply cannot gather from lack of space to slither.\n\nThe music while nice to listen to, becomes repetitive over time because there are 15 levels spread over 4 different sections, and each section only has ONE type of music playing, which gives the game a grand total of 6 different OSTs: 1 in the title screen, 1 in stage select, and 4 for the actual levels.\n\nWhile the game did introduce some form of a plot and antagonistic force, there seems to be a missed moment which has been mentioned by other players as well, as the producers could have introduced some boss level at the end of each area. Considering the snake character can activate switches, this could easily have translated into traversing the environment to activate switches and defeat the boss. But instead, its just 15 levels, with different elements for 4 areas.\n\nAnd yet this game is already considered a vast improvement over the first teaser trailer on youtube. No really, if the game was released looking like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4SEbhaGYLI I would have given this game a 2/10 for innovation alone.\n\nOverall this game feels meh for me, as I feel like it is more deserving of a score of 7/10 at BEST.", "timestamp_created": 1641001283, "timestamp_updated": 1641001283, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106985518": {"recommendationid": "106985518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056477655", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 438, "last_played": 1596275145}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was but it pleasantly surprised me.

I first downloaded this game a few years ago, pirated. I was younger and didn't have a bank account yet, and my parents hated spending money on games. I completed the game and moved on. Every once in a while I'd miss the movement in this game, and so I'd occasionally just open it to do a level or two - until Windows started detecting the pirated version I downloaded as a virus, so I had to uninstall it.\nThis year, I started working, and have my own money and bank account. Of course I wanted to come back and buy this game for real - because I love playing it, and because I want to support the developers for creating such a unique and fun experience. I got all achievements too.\n\nThe story... Honestly it feels like they just forced a story into the game after finishing it, so it has no actual effect on the levels as you play them, which isn't right. [spoiler]I wish we could be more involved with the crow guy, maybe have some sort of boss fight at one point.[/spoiler] But no one cares about the story. Let's talk gameplay.\nIf you're gonna play it, try to collect all the orbs and coins you see. There's a lot of interesting challenges this game has to offer, but only if you go for all the collectibles. They're hard at first, because they're often a challenge of how good you are at controlling the snake, but that's how you get used to the movement. Once you do - it's smooth as butter. I literally played this game on controller years ago, and now I don't have a controller so I had to use kbm, didn't matter because I already got used to the snake movement, it's like riding a bike. Unlike other games like Rocket League, where the switch between kbm and controller is a lot more significant, in this game you just need to learn how to wrap and coil yourself around to move between obstacles. The movement is so fun and unique once you get used to it you might find yourself addicted to it like I was.\nI know we're probably not gonna get an update or DLC at this point, several years after the game's release, but I do wish this game had more levels. I feel like 15 just isn't quite satisfying enough... And although all of these levels are very well crafted and decorated, and they all offer new challenges and mechanics... I just wish the game had some more content. More costumes too, like, what's the point of the 8bit costume if you're only gonna unlock it after beating the game??\nI feel like the game is just a few interactions short of perfect. It could've had some more meat to it, if for example, you had parts where gravity shifts for an entire section, or parts where something is chasing after you, or if you had to complete a certain character's request to earn a keystone. Stuff like that. If this game ever gets a sequel, I hope these things make it in... There's so much more you could do with a movement based game like this.\nOverall, I highly recommend Snake Pass. It's a fun, unique, and refreshing approach to a 3D platformer, that you just don't see anywhere else.

For some reason, devs decided to introduce certain controls in not the first level, and the first tutorial shows only A and D, instead of full WASD(which you could argue should be apparent, but at that point you have no clue how it's supposed to work), I found the controls extremely unintuitive and pretty much random for quite a chunk of the game until I had to learn the controls by myself by accidentally hitting W at some point to realize how the snake works, by which point I already cleared up multiple levels, getting into very hard places with only half the controls...\n2. After 4 years of people online talking about no-deaths achievement being inconsistent, there is still no indication of which levels have registered and which haven't. Cleared every level for every achievement right away, still had to play through half the game again to get it, no clue if it was me or the game that missed it tbh.\n3. Last level has some misplaced death triggers by the green keystone:\n-If you get on top of the circular structure, you die because of the level above. Technically, there's nothing there, so it doesn't really matter, however what really matters is that...\n-You randomly die while going onto the sticks near the keystone itself, where you can't not go.

The snake game is classic and bringing it to 3D surely would work.\nAnd... Collectables!!! there's nothing better to explore the mechanics of a game than adding collectibles. It makes us explore the levels and use all the skills we learned while playing the game. It's all more interesting here that our movement it totally different from what we're used to.\n\nHowever, it stops here. The rest of the game is a mess.\n\nFirst of all, the controls. They are... bad. They are relative to the camera, not to the position of the snake, and there is no option to change that. Considering that you constantly need to adjust the camera in order to get some of the harder collectables, you often find yourself going on a different direction that you need to. And it may kill you sometimes.\n\nTalking about deaths, while it's a common thing in platformers, here it's TOO PUNISHING. Falling in a pit and respawning feels slow enough, and we can't tell how saving works until we're screwed by the checkpoint system. Yes, there are some checkpoints (something in the ground that lights up when you pass on it) and it saves your progress. So, if you spend 10 minutes collecting a hard coin, continue the stage and die a lot further without passing a checkpoint... well, too bad, do it again. And they're also annoying to find, so you spend a lot of time also looking for the checkpoints.\n\nLastly, the cutscenes. If you want to complete the game, you'll probable play through the stages multiple times, and YOU WILL HAVE TO WATCH EVERY CUTSCENE EVERY TIME. Yes, they're unskippable and the devs said that it's kinda intended due to poor programming. So yeah... that says a lot.\n\nOverall, if you just want to play it once and call it quits, I guess that it's an ok game.\n\nIf you want to play for the full experience... don't.", "timestamp_created": 1625707298, "timestamp_updated": 1625707298, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498044103384017944", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95096227": {"recommendationid": "95096227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394971228", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1625494739}, "language": "english", "review": "cute snek", "timestamp_created": 1625479726, "timestamp_updated": 1637777844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95070691": {"recommendationid": "95070691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198432782478", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1625442385}, "language": "english", "review": "Charming game design and concept, but the controls suck.

This all makes the game much, much more frustrating than it is enjoyable.\nI went to the end of it purely due to my weakness to the sunken cost fallacy, and it was a real self-inflicted pain.\n\nThere are so many other good puzzle/platform games around, so I would recommend you give this one a \n[i]pass[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1624406441, "timestamp_updated": 1624406441, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604905128479003906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94126739": {"recommendationid": "94126739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299263114", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1690226077}, "language": "english", "review": "Noodle is a complete d1ckhead", "timestamp_created": 1624300157, "timestamp_updated": 1624300157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94083713": {"recommendationid": "94083713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001704751", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1659403680}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this at a friends house and could not put it down.

I found the movement controls bizarre and the camera management infuriating. It wasn't that I had no idea what the game would be like before playing, but that it seemed like I was never going to gel with their implementation.\n\nOf course then I switched to a controller and the whole game felt a lot better. So this is my warning, really; I think the keyboard and mouse controls are awful. That I'm sure some people can get it to work effortlessly for them I can entirely believe, but it felt far more natural to control movement with a stick than it did a couple of buttons. All this is really about what the point of the game is; you control a snake and snakes do not move like we do. Obvious, yes, but atypical for a game to convey and in taking a blatant observation Snake Pass really tries to nail what moving about as a snake would be like.\n\nIn this regard Snake Pass can feel a lot like a long-form proof of concept. There is no gating of abilities, apart from specific instances logically infused towards the end of the game, merely how you apply them to the 15 stages. Split between being a platformer and a puzzle game, you'll spend your time navigating enclosed levels with a variety of collectibles scattered around. Of these some are required to complete a stage, the majority to help guide you around and a few designed to test your skills and exploratory habits. Outside of the necessary items, hunting the rest down is entirely up to you. Though checkpoints around the level are frequent, some of these items are devilishly placed to the extent that it becomes very familiar to see Noodle, the titular snake, falling to his death.\n\nThe part of the game that is just about moving around in an intricately designed space is rather pleasant. The movement is unique, but in full flow feels about as good as any traditional platformer. Between the vibrant, vivid landscapes filled with critters that are lovingly animated and a simple, but fitting soundtrack, I find the game world presents a very inviting space. Even stages filled with hazards can be stunning in their own way. It's certainly not going to strain your graphics card, but for a small scale title I do find it easy on the eyes.\n\nThe presentation does betray just how challenging the game can get though. Levels can be completed in minutes, especially if replaying them in the time trial mode or even leisurely, but it is equally possible to find specific collectible items requiring a considerable amount of time; one of the final levels had an item that took around 40 minutes to get alone. At some point it's hard to tell if it's the game that's specifically hard in the moment or if the frustration is causing you to play worse. Normally this is fine. These challenges are optional and whilst they call to you, sparkling in the distance asking you how you're supposed to not just get them but safely return to a checkpoint, you can ignore them. That said, there are moments in certain stages, especially towards the end, where a required route seems abruptly difficult.\n\nSo whilst traversal can be fun, the pressure applied can pile on quickly. Even with the controls down, I was still finding myself struggling with the camera and infrequently with Noodle. The direction you move in is based on where Noodle's head is. That you have a clear point of interaction here makes sense, but it means you're reliant on this head to clearly indicate what will happen if you move. Between the camera sometimes being outright antagonistic and Noodle taking a more estimated interpretation of your commands, too many times I felt like I had done nothing wrong and the game failed me.\n\nFor a challenging game this is a pretty cardinal sin. Were it not for the fact that this rarely happens on required routes, it's quite likely I'd have put the game down far before clearing it. Between the game's charm and foolish bravado, it's very easy to keep plugging away until you get it right. That the game is relatively short and a visual treat goes a considerable way though to mitigating the frustrations I have.\n\nAll in all Snake Pass is a game very committed to its design and purpose, sometimes annoyingly so. Like most fair challenges though, overcoming its obstacles, discovering nooks and crannies and mastering the movement to pull off actions that game doesn't point you towards but hints at with the terrain does produce a very satisfying feeling. If it's worth the challenge and frustration I'm not entirely sure, but I do think that it's too unique, too well polished to simply go ignored. It is a good game, but almost equally frustrating.\n\n*Game obtained during a free giveaway on Steam*", "timestamp_created": 1623768501, "timestamp_updated": 1623768501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697648286819458008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93560266": {"recommendationid": "93560266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072702246", "num_games_owned": 788, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1623410615}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is great, but controls are bad and levels punishing which combines to a real frustration", "timestamp_created": 1623410670, "timestamp_updated": 1623410670, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499092549085617065", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93308793": {"recommendationid": "93308793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214823695", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1624570935}, "language": "english", "review": "Great price, great game!", "timestamp_created": 1623000091, "timestamp_updated": 1623000091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93299029": {"recommendationid": "93299029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027268898", "num_games_owned": 1026, "num_reviews": 174, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1623146451}, "language": "english", "review": "Really cool game actually, the controls need some time to getting used to.

You can move the camera with the right stick and lift your head with the A button. The goal in each level is to collect the three key stones to open the gate to move on to the next level. This is done by wrapping yourself around poles and other objects to climb and traverse through a stage.\nThere is an \"easy\" control option to move entirely with the left stick, but I wouldn't recommend it as it means you can no longer move your head independently for trickier spots.\n\n[h1]What I like:[/h1]\n+ 15 levels split up into four worlds. \n+ The third world, the volcano area, stands out as the most visually different from the rest.\n+ Levels contain multiple checkpoints which can be activated over and over again by returning to them. Beneficial just before attempting a difficult climb. Dying sends you back to the checkpoint with your progress reset to how it was when you last hit the checkpoint.\n+ Optional easy collectable blue orbs and difficult collectable coins for extra challenge. Unlock snake sight after beating the game to help find missed collectables. When replaying levels, once an item is collected, the level can be quit with the collectable retained.\n+ Time trial mode and arcade mode to replay levels with different goals. \n\n[h1]What I don't like:[/h1]\n- Three of the four worlds are simply grassy with blue skies. I would've liked to see more diverse environments.\n- When holding down RT, your body and tail can move while your head doesn't. This isn't a bug, but a situation where your snake doesn't have the strength to pull forward, but the body moves anyway and can lead to losing your grip and falling (to your death).\n- Cutscene dialog boxes are not voiced and advance automatically, meaning you can't stop to read them at your own pace if you don't read fast enough.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nThis is a fun short game with a unique character controller setup. It is interesting to learn how to move in a different manner from most games. Some challenges may be a bit frustrating, but is overall enjoyable.\n\n[h1]Here is a demonstration of the game:[/h1]\nhttps://youtu.be/KVVkQW_Rl6Y", "timestamp_created": 1622923299, "timestamp_updated": 1622923299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530201315879821777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93206578": {"recommendationid": "93206578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085114551", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1616799539}, "language": "english", "review": "\u304f__,.\u30d8\u30fd.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000/\u3000,\u30fc\uff64 \u3009\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\uff3c ', !-\u2500\u2010-i\u3000/\u3000/\u00b4\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 \uff0f\uff40\uff70'\u3000\u3000\u3000 L/\uff0f\uff40\u30fd\uff64\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000 \uff0f,\u3000 /|\u3000 ,\u3000 ,\u3000\u3000\u3000 ',\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\uff72 \u3000/ /-\u2010/\u3000\uff49\u3000L_ \uff8a \u30fd!\u3000 i\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a \uff8d 7\uff72\uff40\uff84\u3000 \uff9a'\uff67-\uff84\uff64!\u30cf|\u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 !,/7 '0'\u3000\u3000 \u00b40i\u30bd| \u3000 |\u3000\u3000\u3000\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 |.\u4ece\"\u3000\u3000_\u3000\u3000 ,,,, / |./ \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a'| i\uff1e.\uff64,,__\u3000_,.\u30a4 / \u3000.i \u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a'| | / k_\uff17_/\uff9a'\u30fd,\u3000\uff8a.\u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 | |/i \u3008|/\u3000 i\u3000,.\uff8d |\u3000i\u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000.|/ /\u3000\uff49\uff1a \u3000 \uff8d!\u3000\u3000\uff3c\u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 \u3000 k\u30fd>\uff64\uff8a \u3000 _,.\uff8d\uff64 \u3000 /\uff64!\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 !'\u3008//\uff40\uff34\u00b4', \uff3c \uff40'7'\uff70r'\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a'\u30fdL__|___i,___,\u30f3\uff9a|\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000\uff84-,/\u3000|___./\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000'\uff70'\u3000\u3000!_,.", "timestamp_created": 1622865015, "timestamp_updated": 1622865015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463917523622512817", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93138481": {"recommendationid": "93138481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060692740", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1593921564}, "language": "english", "review": "HISSSSS I'm a sssssnake and I ssssslither around to ssssearch for collectibles level after level... my movement animation and methodology isssss ssssimply sssspectacular and revolutionary", "timestamp_created": 1622766622, "timestamp_updated": 1622766622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93085175": {"recommendationid": "93085175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011788106", "num_games_owned": 1300, "num_reviews": 171, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1622691689}, "language": "english", "review": "wrap her in my warm embrace", "timestamp_created": 1622691812, "timestamp_updated": 1622691812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93012228": {"recommendationid": "93012228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842056047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 575, "last_played": 1622696387}, "language": "english", "review": "twsertsdxhbdfcgjchvjfghjmtfc,u", "timestamp_created": 1622578509, "timestamp_updated": 1636991725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92965732": {"recommendationid": "92965732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009381925", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 931, "last_played": 1622295522}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality snek game.

Punto final.\n\n\n\nEl gameplay es confuso al principio pero mola:\n\nEres una serpiente y te arrastras. No hay saltos ni piruetas, solo tienes que aprender a moverte como si fueras una serpiente para llegar a lugares altos y traspasar obst\u00e1culos. Se hace un poco complicado al principio pero una vez le pillas el truco es bastante bueno.\n\nHe visto rese\u00f1as de que los controles son malos, pero yo jugando con teclado y rat\u00f3n no he cambiado ninguna tecla. Todo me parece correcto. Creo que es m\u00e1s el manejo de la serpiente que es dif\u00edcil de acostumbrarse pero luego resulta gratificante.\n\nYo recomendar\u00eda jugar por lo menos 1 hora para acostumbrarse. Sino no le des demasiadas vueltas y mejor dale al rembolso.\n\n\n\nEl objetivo es conseguir las tres piedras que abren el portal.\n\nLuego hay 15 esferas azules y 5 monedas que son opcionales. No sirven para nada, solo te desbloquean una apariencia para la serpiente si las consigues todas, aunque acabar\u00e1s yendo a por todas, m\u00e1s por el desaf\u00edo que por la recompensa.\n\nCompletar el juego deben ser unas 8-9 horas, pero si vas al 100% (todas las esferas y monedas) puede durar hasta 12 horas como en mi caso. Si ya vas a por todos los logros, pues m\u00e1s, pero no se cuanto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn resumen:\n\nJuego corto y sencillo pero muy \u00fanico. No se parece a ning\u00fan otro juego que yo haya jugado y eso que me gustan mucho los plataformas de conseguir coleccionables, as\u00ed que me ha gustado jugar a algo diferente y divertido.\n\nObtenido gratuitamente en la Humble Store.\n\n\nGracias por su lectura.", "timestamp_created": 1622140102, "timestamp_updated": 1622140102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92584852": {"recommendationid": "92584852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198956282494", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1655898812}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing sandbox game.

Noire, etc, so I didn't reach the 2 hour refund limit even within 2 weeks. SO on June 11th 2020, when Humble gave away Snake Pass as a 'freebie', I was still eligible for a refund for Snake Pass, so I filed a ticket to Steam Support, and I assume I automatically got the refund. The very next day, I activated the steam key I got from Humble, and the game was back in my account \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.

It introduces us to characters in the last levels of each of it's realms [spoiler]only to completely throw it out of the gate and end with a goofy \"happy ending\", nullifying all of the foreshadowing with the [i]'dark bird with evil eyes'[/i] sub-plot as well.[/spoiler]\n    [*]The grass in this game reeks of default_unrealengine_grass4.obj, and it's the same aliased, pixelated and blurry textures everywhere. Most levels feel like they have been made using a level-editor, and are then filled in with trees, artifacts, bamboos and other environment-filling models, and apart from the 4 different realms, each level in the same realm look like it has copy-pasted the same map 4-5 times [i]while changing the level design, of course[/i]\n    [*][u]The snake's head sometimes glitches into the wood visually[/u], so it's hard to determine which side of the rod/log the head is facing, so you don't know for sure whether to coil clockwise or anti-clockwise in the split second decision, hence sometimes trying to correct yourself may lead to the body winding out of the coil and falling off of the log. This isn't part of the cons, but: especially in the wind levels, where your muscle memory is so used to coiling in a certain direction, you need to start coiling in the direction not-opposite to the direction of the wind, otherwise your head may not be able to make it back to get another grasp of the log due to the strong wind resistance.\n[/list]\n\n[u][b]Pros:[/b][/u]\n[list]\n    [*][u]Noodle and Doodle are adorable.[/u] They're a scaly and a furry respectively, what's not to love about that?\n    [*][u]The soundtrack[/u] is [i]'catchy music composed by Donkey Kong Country maestro, David Wise'[/i]\n    [*]The game is definitely best played with the [u]non-easy[/u] controls with an Dual-stick analog controller like the Dual Shock or Xbox controller. If you had to use a keyboard to realistically simulate what a controller does as an input for this game, you would need to have 3D QWOP configuration or something...

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

No need for story or character or any of that, just make the mechanics work with some decent levels and it should be enjoyable. Obviously it's more complicated than that, game development is never easy, but Snake Pass nonetheless fails in delivering on the promise of its concept.\n\nThe problem is simple: slippery, physics-based mechanics combined with difficult and punishing levels. When controlling the titular snake, Noodle, it feels as though you only control the upper half of him, with the rest of his body being dead weight. On top of this, he feels less like a snake and more like an eel, since he lacks any kind of grip. As a result, you constantly slip off whatever you're trying to climb, and it's [i]infuriating[/i]. Add to that the moments where you have to jump between different climbing structures, with distances that are extremely difficult to judge, especially later on in the game.\n\nAnother problem with the mechanics is that they make you hold buttons way too much. I played with a keyboard and mouse, and you have to hold left click to move, space to hold your head up (to climb upwards), rightclick to get more grip (if it actually did anything) and you have to work WASD quite hard during climbing sections. As a result, my hands hurt after playing for anything more than an hour. \n\nAnd why, [i]why[/i], can't you look up in this game? The camera just locks at ground level, even when you stand by the ledge and there shouldn't be anything in the way. Just... [i]why[/i]?\n\nAll of this is aggravated by the level design. There are death pits everywhere, The game is actually built around them. If the levels would have required less trial and error, if it would have been based in a forest or something so that there would have been a ground level to fall onto, then I think that I would have enjoyed the game way more. Instead, at several parts of the game you end up watching the falling animation over, and over, and over, and over again. The checkpoints are numerous, and somehow still ends up feeling too few for a collectathon where collecting things is a massive pain.\n\nNow, I don't mind frustration. I have nothing against difficult games, and I've played several platformers in the past that made me quite mad. But a core feature of difficult games is the ability to make failing fun, or at least let you feel a sense of your own skill progression as you grind it out. Snake Pass instead makes you feel lucky. Not that you can't be good at the game, I ended up figuring out different strategies for problems like I usually do. But it just [i]feels[/i] luck-based. For example, I could fail at getting a collectible several times only to suddenly get a break where the physics of your tail happened to fall through it (which counts as collecting it). I would say that I felt cheated, but honestly I was relieved every time it happened, which is never a good sign.\n\nI admit, I might just be bad at this game. Maybe it's better with a controller as well. The problem might just be mine. But on the other hand, as I write this, only 4,3% of players have actually finished Snake Pass, me among them. I started getting golden achievements for simple progress after only an hour or two. That has to be indicative of something, right? So, as a result, I simply can't recommend the game.

Usually, I get the crutch of playing some sort of humanoid or anthropomorphic creature and know how to do basic movements, because (and until proven guilty in the court of Area 51) I am most definitely a human and not a Cetacea from the planet Va-de 835, waiting for humans to commit nuclear fallout to evolve themselves, before I and my species help move them peacefully into the heightened system of space communism. That would be ridiculous and I'd accuse you of being a conspiracy theorist. HA. Anyway, learning how to devolve myself back into a creature without arms, legs, or namely thumbs, was quite the challenge. It's been a long time... I mean for us as humans to have evolved, millennia ago.\n\n[h1] Where Was I? [/h1]\nThe climbing mechanics could use some work, I'll be honest, feels like you're more slippery than you should be, and the grip mechanic I feel should have been used to help climbing as a mechanic in total. Instead it acts as a barely passable system to hold yourself in place. Snakes are sleek, but they are not slippery, and although you can climb pretty well, it breaks the immersion when (in the first few stages) it seems like a great interpretation of how snakes are so fascinating on their movement; Just to later be dropped off a cliff, because your tail is functionally not there, and you can slide right off a pole to your death. How do they make up for it? Your \"Kazooie,\" for all intents and purposes, can lift your tail up, which helps with speed, and can act as a counterbalance. Something in retrospect should be unnecessary, but the developers really wanted to nail in the Banjo Kazooie homage. \n\n[h1] Did you mention Homero R\u00f3mulo Cristalli Frasnelli? [/h1]\nThere are few places where this game can improve outside of a tighter climbing mechanic. The movement system relies on you having some idea of how snakes move, then continuing to remember that, and apply it to increasingly difficult tasks. while in a game that experiences genuinely good game design. The music is fun, and in fact there are neat hidden objects that use water or wind, to create the music you hear in the levels, quite a nice immersive touch. The game could have been longer, or based on the story itself, it would have made sense to have a hub world. which I can imagine would have been fun.

Some of the blue wisps can take up to nearly 30 deaths to collect, but when you finally get good enough to collect them all (and the coins as well) it is very pleasing And I\u2019m glad they added a little unlock at the end of that. My only complaints are that I feel like there should be at least 2 more check points in the last world levels and I also wish there was a little more to the end game other than arcade and time trial that could add little more replay ability.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1609111767, "timestamp_updated": 1609111767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83226296": {"recommendationid": "83226296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324857509", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126, "last_played": 1608836071}, "language": "english", "review": "I find it boring. yet it is enjoyable to a certain extant, and I recommend that if you like the way this game looks you should try it for yourself/", "timestamp_created": 1609009621, "timestamp_updated": 1662548520, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.401337772607803345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83116311": {"recommendationid": "83116311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071784940", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1595834537}, "language": "english", "review": "this game really makes you FEEL like a snake", "timestamp_created": 1608905898, "timestamp_updated": 1608905898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551960170269012451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83106621": {"recommendationid": "83106621", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980759235", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1608895428}, "language": "english", "review": "Not really optimised for mouse and keyboard.

There are four worlds, earth, air, water, and fire.  In each world you will play four levels, except for the last world (air) has three.  Each level becomes more and more difficult.  You must snake your way up and across pipes by wrapping yourself around them and not falling off.\n\nThe physics of the game are actually pretty decent.  When in the air, your snake seems to fly a bit more than normal, but when slithering on the floor or from platform to platform, gravity, and your snakes balance feel pretty good and are not necessarily surprising in how you react to the world around you.\n\nThrough each level you can collect wisps, blue glowing balls, and coins.  Neither are needed to beat the game, other than to get an 8 bit version of Noodle, you, or Doodle, your bird friend that follows you everywhere.  Your bird friend can be helpful at times as he can hold your tail, which can help in balancing in certain occasions and in the air levels, he can help you jump over chasms, so much the good physics statement earlier.\n\nThis game is not too difficult, but it can be especially if you are looking to get all achievements and all collectibles.  The not dying on any level achievement was tough, especially that last level which really works your skills.\n\nThe snake looks great and mimics the movements and look of a real snake very well.  I was impressed by the game, even if it truly has a very simple mechanic.  Only a certain amount of your head will go up, because, well, a snake doesn't stand, but if you coil up, it can lift its head a bit higher.  The graphics are fun and fit well with the genre and the attempt at a storyline, but again pretty impressed with the animations and movement of Noodle.\n\nIf you can get this for less than $10 then you should get it.

Then you begin the first level. As you attempt to grab that one coin under the bridge, you realise that this game could only have been conceived by the Allied Mastercomputer. But, as AM will do, the suffering eases, and the experience becomes more akin to your initial perception of what Snake Pass would be. But the continuous, repetitive Exotica throwback that constitutes the soundtrack is an ever-present reminder of the cyclical nature of suffering and pain. As you work through the particularly difficult segments, those little protrusions in the levels which offer only an unending time-loop, where a minor mistake or momentary camera change can cost you everything, you begin to learn the values of patience and precision. Again and again, our poor Noodle plummets to the abyss below, and the rhythmic dance of LT, RT, and A begins to befuddle the fingers, the futility of life and it's unending trails bears heavy. But, to push through, to overcome and work inch-by-inch, taking the time to perfect each individual button press, eventually leads to that satisfying sound effect as we collect another seemingly inconsequential item. But this satisfaction is short-lived, and we once again find ourselves in turbohell, flailing violently as we plummet to the depths yet again and wonder just what kind of sadist would build a place like this. Just -who- would construct such a thing, look at it with great consideration, and say to themselves \"this looks like a reasonable place to live\".

Haven't tried it with KB+M, but I imagine it's probably more difficult than controller.\n\nThe game is pretty short - it took me a little under 6 hours to beat all 15 levels, and that's with collecting 75%+ of the optional collectables. If you want to 100% the game, it'd probably take several more hours than just beating it, as you need to get all of the collectables and beat every level without dying, among other things.\n\nOverall, I recommend it.

It's a 3D snake which physics are simulated very realistic. Unlike other platformers the snake doesn't have one point of mass where gravity is tied to, but it has its whole body simulated where gravity drags on every part. This means you cannot just concentrate on the head which your are controlling, but have to look for what the rest of the body is doing behind as well. Otherwise it could be, that the mass of the tail will drag you down a pit, or if you lean too much forward you'll slip down, or your middle part may slip off the bamboo bar dragging you down although the head seemed safe in that spot on top of the bamboo bar. Luckily Noodle the snake has his companion Doodle the hummingbird which will lift up your tail on a button press. You cannot adapt the usual platformer experience, you have to learn this new movement and I like that very much!\n\nIt features the usual 3D platformer collectathon. Collect 3 gems to finish each level, collect 20 optional blue orbs scattered across each level, collect 5 optional golden coins in hidden or in difficult to reach places, touch the gatekeeper idol in each level to earn their blessing. And a few more optional achievements.\n\n[b][u]So how well is this suited for kids?[/u][/b]\n\nMy daughter liked it very much! She regularly asked if we could play \"that snake game\" :)\n\n[b][u]Content[/u][/b]\n+ Positive is the peaceful nature of the game. A mysterous creature stole all the colorful shiny gems, dropped them across each level and you have to get them back, It's very colorful and the two friends Noodle and Doodle are cute, speak about harmless things and do not make stupid jokes only adults may understand, but speak kids-friendly.\n+ Colorful world\n+ There is no blood. \no I can't say \"no violence\" but have to say \"mild\" violence, because Noodle can fall into spikes or get burned in fire and glowing hot fire rocks. This will make Noodle's face transmit that it feels pain. You can not really \"die\" here, but you vanish in a fading white and respawn at the last checkpoint. But Noodle still closes its eyes when falling into spikes. You can also fall off the edge of the level making Doodle's face transmit \"Oh nooooo, please heeeeelp\".\n\n[b][u]Controller difficulties[/u][/b]\nThe default controller setting is right shoulder button (R2) to move forward, left joystick (L) for left/right and A for lifting the head. This may be difficult if the kid's fingers are not grown up enough to simultaneously reach A button with the thumb while the index finger rests on the shoulder button R2. My 4 year old daughter managed to do it, but it was hard. However, there is an option available to switch to \"easy\" controller setting. This will get rid of the shoulder button R2 and instead make the left stick also go forward. Then it's only L and A to be pressed with left thumb and right thumb. This is much better suited for kids. It's not only easier to reach the buttons but also easier to get into your head. There is much to be looked out for if you want to control the snake. Going for easy controls is easier to get into the game, using the default setting is better for precise movement.\n\n[b][u]Level design[/u][/b]\nAt the start I found it very frustrating that you do not keep what you collected unless you touch a checkpoint. It makes sense, though, because some coins require you to not only reach them but also make it back to the safe green again. That's why you don't keep what you collected after \"dying\". I would have found it better if your progress would save everytime you are on \"safe\" ground. I played this with my daughter and kids are not the most patient ones. Losing 5 orbs and a coin making us redo the last 10 minutes only because we didn't know how checkpoints work was very frustrating.\n\nCheckpoints are not explained anywhere, not their existence nor how they work. Be sure to know this: checkpoints are those triangle plates which light up a blue snake when you crawl over them. They can be activated as often as you want. Just crawl away from it, collect something and crawl over it again. There are several checkpoints in each level and only one of them can be active. The specific checkpoint active is signalized by the blue light the shape of a snake. \n\nAlso: You can't quit a level without losing your progress. You can't quit the level and continue it another time. You always have to play through a level collecting all 3 gems to save your progress. This is not optimal for kids as their speed and time commitment is not fit for this adult like design. Just now we said we had to stop to do something else and had to quit the game. Unfortunately our progress is not saved. The game told us that the progress will be lost, but we cannot let it run until we have time again, so this is a negative point about the game for kids.\n\n[b][u]Also For Adults?[/u][/b]\nI played this with my daughter only for the first 8 levels. The harder later levels I played on my own. And ss you can see I got every achievement of this game! I must have liked it! (I really liked it!) It was very interesting to master the snake physics and each mechanic of crawling up and along the many paths. I liked the graphics and adored the blur effect on distant objects. Everything looks so beautiful! The challenges and overall difficulty are suited for adults. The story content is for kids, but still enjoyable as an adult.", "timestamp_created": 1600290947, "timestamp_updated": 1608590032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76060162": {"recommendationid": "76060162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047454339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1627527540}, "language": "english", "review": "A platforming \"puzzle\" collectathon where you play as a cartoony snake doing snake stuff like slithering and swimming and flying on gusts of wind with help from your bird friend.

It can be hard to get the hang of at first, but once you figure out how to slither at speed, and how to climb by coiling and constricting you will start to have a lot of fun.I played with both keyboard and mouse, and controller.... controller was my preferred way to play this game by a significant margin - the analogue sticks and triggers provided a much more tactile response that the keyboard and mouse did.Its more than just a gimmick, but that said its still just a collectathon that rewards you with shiny objectives for your increased mastery.

The game looks great, thanks to the Unreal Engine, though the worlds themselves are very standard fare (Grass, Water, Fire, Air).\n\nIts all well and good, but the physics and controls sometimes dont make any sense. I get how the controls work - you control Noodle and since you cant jump, you have to wind yourself along like a real snake, meaning to climb wooden rods, you have to snake yourself around them. In the first few worlds, the physics based gameplay is actually really fun and, if you master it, it shows a lot of promise and is something new and interesting.\n\nEspecially in the last two worlds, though, the physics-based movement becomes a little too much for the engine to handle. Noodle itself is really floaty, so you can often make jumps or drops that probably werent intended. Every single rod in the game feels like it is doused in oil and just very slippery. One button in the game is for \"tightening\" around rods, which only sometimes works, and sometimes it doesnt. Often it feels like you fell for no reason and it can get a little frustrating in the later levels.\n\nEven so, the game is definitely interesting and something different when it comes to gameplay, so I will give it a cautious thumbs up. On sale I would recommend checking it out, but if you dont like the way it plays in the first two hours, it will definitely not get better later on.", "timestamp_created": 1598502533, "timestamp_updated": 1598502533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497907936573028564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74962582": {"recommendationid": "74962582", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967773420", "num_games_owned": 735, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1646500749}, "language": "english", "review": "This takes the patience of a saint to actually play.

El personaje que vamos a tener que controlar esta vez es una serpiente y esto afecta a todo. Manejar a Noodle (la serpiente protagonista) es todo un reto y te va a llevar tiempo y muchos intentos dominarla.\nLa gracia del juego, es que las situaciones que presenta (plataformas, escenarios, obst\u00e1culos) tienen que ser resueltas pensando como una serpiente. Este factor se nota mucho y es de lo que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3 del juego. Hay muchas zonas en las que es necesario enroscarse, hacerse un nudo para poder aferrarse, serpentear, etc\u00e9tera y todo esta implementado perfectamente.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2196051418\nPara m\u00ed, este juego presenta muchos aspectos positivos. Tiene una banda sonora que enamora, unos escenarios y gr\u00e1ficos muy coloridos, bien logrados y preciosos, el control de la serpiente es muy bueno (algo que me preocupaba bastante antes de empezar a jugarlo, que tan incomodo podr\u00eda llegar a ser controlar a Noodle). Pero con diferencia, lo que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3 fue su curva de aprendizaje. El juego te explica los controles b\u00e1sicos y con ello, las herramientas para afrontar las distintas situaciones que est\u00e1n por venir, pero no como afrontarlas. Es uno mismo el que va a tener que aprender a desplazarse, aprender a colgarse de los elementos, afrontar todo como una serpiente.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2195047555\nEn cuanto a la dificultad, el juego consta de 4 mundos, cada uno con cuatro niveles exceptuando el \u00faltimo que tiene solo tres. Cada nivel tiene tres tipos de coleccionables. Tres piedras que son obligatorias (no muy complicadas de obtener en la mayor\u00eda de los casos), 20 wisps (orbes azules que son opcionales, algunos estar\u00e1n a la vista, otros ligeramente escondidos y otros ser\u00e1n dif\u00edciles de alcanzar) y finalmente, la verdadera estrella, las monedas. Hay un total de 5 monedas por nivel (que tambi\u00e9n son opcionales), y la mayor\u00eda son muy dif\u00edciles de recolectar, ya sea por que est\u00e1n escondidas o por que hay que atravesar un tramo del mapa cuya dificultad es un poco m\u00e1s elevada respecto a la ruta normal del nivel.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2195047399\nFinalmente, aspectos negativos le encuentro muy pocos.

It suggests to use a controller since it's a little difficult to use mouse and keyboard and I did find it much easier using my controller.

The game was unique in that it was a platform where you cannot jump, and have to move in a way similar to a real snake in order to traverse effectively.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 6 / 10\nSlither your way through the levels!", "timestamp_created": 1597254604, "timestamp_updated": 1597254830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482230335474014282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74182134": {"recommendationid": "74182134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011624003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 101, "last_played": 1596982424}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like mastering unique control schemes and using them to explore, you're in for a treat.

Don't get me wrong, it's great fun slithering around and exploring and finding collectibles\u2014it scratches that completionist collect-athon itch very generously and with mechanics so fundamentally different than the usual platformers and exploration games\u2014but it lacks a lot of polish that ends up leaving me irritated and unappreciative. There's the minor inconveniences, like the overindulgent animations. Cutscenes are unskippable. despite the fact that you can encounter them multiple times, and feature excruatingly slow dialogue and animations. Even respawning from a checkpoint or finishing a level overstays its welcome. Another inconvenience is that, alongside the challenging achievements and the completionist achievements, there are hidden achievements that just ask you to perform some movement mechanics far more times than you would in a normal playthrough of the game. It has a childish vibe to it that I don't know that I can explain.\n\nBut then there's the big thing that disquiets me: the cheese. Snake Pass is eminently cheesable. For a game about exploring level geometry with an unorthodox climbing mechanic, one would think there might be more careful curation of what geometry is climbable and what puzzles are skippable, but very rarely do the skips or climbs feel intentional. They are often \"off-brand\" for the gameplay (you climb a lot slower, or jam through a gap or up an environmental decoration) and have no collectibles or even dev acknowledgements of these places' accessibility (at best, they give high ground for janky-looking jumps to other parts of the level). There are only 15 levels, one of which is a tutorial, so it's discomforting that I felt like I played them more thoroughly than the devs did.\n\nI won't lie, I experienced a fair share of fun and challenge playing this game. But I also got from it a lot of irritation, and, when I pause and reflect on it, a lot of heartache, a yearning for the game this should've been but wasn't.

The game's aesthetics (visuals and music) are on point, and the story is... passable, I guess. The level design is really good--it makes good use of the fact that you are a snake, and, the collectibles are just as fun to collect as the rest of the game is to play. That being said, the collectibles are fairly useless--all they do is unlock some mildly amusing skins. The game is also pretty short, so that, plus the pointlessness of the collectibles, plus the boringness of the story, makes the game feel pretty lackluster despite its aesthetic polish. Plus, it can be kinda rage inducing until you get a good handle on the controls.

I always wanted to play Snake Pass when it released in 2017, but never got around to it. Thanks to the gift from Humble Bundle, I was able to complete it today to 86%. I might return to attempt the 100% completion - my original intention - but I'm currently reluctant given how frustrating some sections were. Anyhow - I have a few thoughts on my experience which I'll detail below.\n\nI was initially impressed with the vivid environments, cute platforming duo, and of course, the chilled out soundtrack from can't-put-a-musical-foot-wrong-David Wise. All those elements harmonise extremely well in Snake Pass, and Sumo Digital should be proud of such success. The story, while very minimal, is a sweet 'G' rated narrative that's ideal for kids. As many an online commenter has stated, it's more than acceptable for platformers, like Mario, for instance, to serve players a gameplay-first, story-last journey, and still be compelling. Snake Pass certainly ticks the box there. There are also no enemies, so if you're after a game that doesn't promote violence, look no further. It's rare to find a pacifist 3D platformer. Where it all unravels (pardon the pun) however, is in general gameplay. \n\nThe whole game is centred around being able to master Noodle's (the snake protagonist) movement. The tutorials on it are fairly brief, but it's common knowledge that snakes slither and coil around things, so perhaps there needn't be too much explanation anyhow. Still, mastering it, at least in my opinion, is no easy feat. It's rather easy to make a blunder because Noodle doesn't move in the angle you wanted, and the camera angles can be wildly uncooperative, which then leads to multiple deaths and much frustration. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the earth and water worlds, which were great playgrounds for learning to weave through intricate wooden fencing, exploring subaquatic caverns, and more. The fire world raised the difficulty by adding lava that can burn Noodle to a crisp, but still kept me motivated to keep collecting wisps, and occasionally, the harder to reach coins. I lost patience far too often in the wind world, which featured some really fiendish challenges in the final level (even to retrieve the keystones, the only mandatory collectible) that felt more like painful trial and error, instead of that hard-but-fun sweet spot. I was also occasionally confused, not at the lack of checkpoints - there were definitely enough - but their placement eg installing a checkpoint after a moderately hard section instead of after an extra hard section. \n\nAfter Yooka-Laylee (100% completed on PS4), I'm sort of traumatised by any 'roll the ball' tasks, so I wasn't too excited to see them pop up multiple times in Snake Pass as well. To be fair, they *were* much, much better designed, and more fair to the player. In fact, I would just like to commend the level design overall. Navigation was consistently clear and not once did I feel lost on where to go next. Sumo Digital deserves SO much praise for making it look so easy. \n\nI don't think Snake Pass really has any puzzles in it, to be honest. If anything, there's one level in the lava world which requires you to rotate large stone structures in such a way as to form a path, which can then be used to reach a keystone. Everything else felt like a classic 3D platformer adventure. The 'action' label wouldn't suffice here either. You need a great deal of patience, strategy, and precise movement to overcome the various gauntlets on show, and the feeling I kept getting was not unlike that of playing a hardcore stealth game (not action-stealth fusions like Dishonored), something which MUST be played slowly and cautiously to extract maximum value. Therefore, I think the most accurate way to refer to Snake Pass is a precision-platformer. There's much debate on the exact definition of '3D platformer', and, usually, not including a traditional 'jump' button would have disqualified Snake Pass from the classification. But the fact remains that Sumo Digital does indeed describe Snake Pass as a 'platformer', that it most closely resembles the 3D platformer more than any other genre, and, that Noodle can pseudo-jump by lifting his upper body half. Considering a snake's natural abilities, this seems like a most authentic representation of anguine kinetics.\n\nSnake Pass is an enormously creative game that uses a unique gameplay mechanic which ensures the player will be continuously challenged. While there is a lot of enjoyment to be squeezed out, there is an equal, if not larger slice of the game that winds up becoming tedious due to repetition and near-misses. I would have loved it if Noodle's slithering was permanently sticky. Perhaps in Snake Pass 2, one can only hope. Still, I am grateful to have played Snake Pass, and to have brushed shoulders with an fresh movement system and amazingly designed levels.

Eso s\u00ed, no puedes guardar a la mitad de un nivel, si quieres dejar de jugar a la mitad de uno, perder\u00e1s todo tu progreso en el mismo. Por fortuna, la mayor parte de los niveles no son muy largos, y una vez recolectado un coleccionable y terminado el nivel, no es necesario juntarlo de vuelta si quieres darle una segunda pasada para obtener todo.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n: Vale la pena comprarlo.

This feels satisfying for the major part of the game, when you manage to climb across really complex puzzles by slithering around efficiently. \n\nBUT, and  such a huge but (hehe...), the last 5 levels are incredibly frustrating and will suck out all the fun you had until now.

Once your snake is caught up in the wind, it'll feel like you have the core strength of a wet noodle, even if you're coiled around a pole, the wind will simply uncoil you around and throw you in the void.\n-THE F***ING CAMERA man, i can't count how many times i've died because the camera is fully passive and I don't have enough fingers to turn the camera around while i'm coiling around with 3 fingers. Also the fact that the sidekick likes to put his huge face right between the snake and the camera ain't helpin'!\n\nAnyway, the game has its charm, it feels like a N64 platformer of the time, still, i'd love to try a sequel, with the main issues being adressed, and a better story and power-ups!", "timestamp_created": 1593902075, "timestamp_updated": 1593902075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585732400417327881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72036333": {"recommendationid": "72036333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060484327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 559, "last_played": 1652179950}, "language": "english", "review": "At the time of a writing, I've just collected all the keystones in the levels (completed storyline).

You control Noodle, a snake aided by his buddy Doodle, a bird that can help lift Noodle tail a bit to help him. To complete the game, you need to think like a snake, coiling around poles to enhance the grip and allowing climbing structures more effectively. It is a great idea, however it could be better executed. Gameplay felt a bit random to me, because sometimes I wanted to do something, and the game did the opposite, screwing me. Over time, that stuff happened less, but overall gameplay could have had a bit more polish. Another problem is the camera. Countless times it got in my way, leaving me blinded in the middle of a crucial section. That is a bigger issue, because I can see the gameplay faults as me not having enough skill, but the camera is just bad sometimes.\nBeating the story isn\u2019t hard, to be honest, and with 15 stages it isn\u2019t too long either. But if you want to collect everything, that\u2019s where most of the frustration will come from. Sometimes my hands were hurt after hard sections, and that with a controller (I can\u2019t imagine the pain it must be to play this with keyboard and mouse). And, I don\u2019t remember cursing at fictional characters in a long time, but the freaking snake and bird deserved them (although just some of them!). There is some replayability with time attack and arcade modes, each with leaderboards for each level, but unless you are comfortable with the gameplay, I\u2019d say those modes aren\u2019t for you.\nIn the end, while frustrating, I kind of had some fun with it, and even 100% isn\u2019t a terrible challenge, because it\u2019s doable with enough patience. If you\u2019re looking for a different type of platformer, Snake Pass may be for you, but it\u2019s definitely not for everybody. For cheap, it is worth a try, and if you enjoy the first stages, then it is worth a playthrough.

Being restricted to sluggish feeling wiggling without any ability to jump initially feels weird, but is something you get a grasp on fast. After that the game is about becoming one with the snake, like learning its limitations but also its strengths. Playing the final levels was a breeze since at that point the movement felt natural. In that regard, the game is fantastic, and the skill ceiling for it is quite high.\n\nThe level design is centered around three main targets, but is filled with collectables, 25 of them to be exact. They can be located on the path to the targets, slightly further away, behind an obstacle course or sometimes even hidden. However they are quite well placed and evenly distributed across the level, and simply by exploring it they can be found without much extra searching, taking me a few extra minutes at worst to find the last one. The difficulty curve is interesting. The levels move gradually from easy to challenging, but the optional collectables provide extra challenge. Orbs being usually slightly harder than the normal path and coins being the hardest challenges in the game.\n\nOne slight complaint I do have is the checkpoint system. There are reusable checkpoints scattered around the levels. They work well for the more linearly progressing levels but sometimes feel a little out of place and clumsy for the more open ones, since sometimes the nearest checkpoint after collecting a bunch of collectables can be frustratingly far away. I know it provides a decision for taking the safe route or risking and saving time, but at times it does feel kind of odd.\n\nThe music is extremely catchy, even if it at times can get kind of repetitive. The artstyle and aesthetic feels uplifting and chill and looks reasonably good when thinking about pure graphical fidelity. Not much else to say about it, except that it fits the game perfectly.\n\nOverall, the game was short and sweet. The game has a total of 15 levels + unlockable arcade and time trial modes. It took me about 8 hours to get 100% collectables and that time flew by fast.

The camera needs to lock to the rotating elements or the elements need to change. Many people are going to run into these and wont understand why they are suddenly failing so much and give up. Aside from that, sometimes even Doodle gets right in front of the camera. Resetting the camera doesn't always do what you expect.\n\nI really like playing as Noodle.

It took me about 7 and a half hours to beat the game with all the primary collectibles. The game is family-friendly and seems aimed toward kids, but the difficulty of the controls and some of the platforming is probably too high for many younger children. \nThe manner in which you must control your character, a snake, is the bread and butter of the game and I believe it's well done, at least from the perspective of someone who played using a controller. The controls might seem somewhat difficult initially, but it doesn't take long to get a hold of wiggling and wrapping around things after a couple levels. The movement felt adequately snakey to me. I liked the fact that you had to slither back and forth to pick up speed. The nature of the controls however, constantly holding in your RT button and wiggling the analog stick, can leave the hands feeling tired after not too long and would make it a pretty bad choice for people with issues such as arthritis. The camera can be a little wonky on occasion and wind up getting you killed, but for the most part it's not terrible by any means.   \nThe primary fault of the game in my opinion is a heavy lack of variety. There's a couple areas throughout the game which introduce some minor new mechanics: water, switches, moving platforms, and wind. I think that's an exhaustive list, unfortunately. The areas themselves are visually quite samey as well; it's more of a lighting change between them than anything. It would have been a real breath of fresh air to be climbing vines, tree branches, other man-made structures, and more instead of nothing but bamboo fence-like structures for 15 levels straight even if it's just a glorified tile-swap. Rather than mildly forest overrun tribal temple exterior-esque brick for 15 levels straight, some plain heavy-forest area, some temple interior, some volcanic rock or any other areas or tile-sets that would still fit with the setting. It should then come as no surprise that the platforming itself starts to feel a bit stale towards the end too after you grow accustomed to the controls, considering the lack of obstacle-type variation. Maybe had they added a couple actual goals beyond the collectathon elements, which don't do a whole lot to foster a sense of accomplishment, they would have been able to keep things more fresh.\nAlthough I think the game could certainly have been quite a bit better I did get a few hours fun out of it and would be happy to break it out again with my nephew or something.

The learning curve is solid and I went from uneasily making my way up small obstacles to quickly winding my way over poles that jut far over vast death pits with little worry. Mechanics are a little confusing at first, but once I got used to them I found them very lenient and in most cases you only need to just barely make it to a platform and get your head onto it to be able to wiggle the rest of your body up. \n\nIf Snake Pass suffers from anything it's a lack of variety. Over the course of my playthrough I felt like variety of challenges hadn't vastly changed from the first level to the last, aside from the addition of some moving obstacles to climb they only increase the amount of time you have to spend over death pits.

The idea is very interesting and unique, but both the controls and stage designs can be very frustrating at times. \n\nThe game is not very friendly or casual, despite its graphics. There is room for improvement in the controls, which are very unforgiving: It's hard to climb up maintaining grip, sometimes Noodle's head angle changes in an unexpected manner and you fall, the \"lock\" mechanic is not intuitive and Noodle's top speed isn't that great, even after you learn how to slither around. Controls could be more forgiving, Noodle could have more natural grip and still the core gameplay would be the same.\n\nWhenever you die, you lose all objects collected before the last checkpoint, which invites you to constantly go back and forth saving progress, and this combined with Noodle's less-than-impressive top speed, can become tedious especially when the closest checkpoint is not that close or not an easy path to travel. Also, in order to save your collectibles you [u]must[/u] open the portal and finish the stage. That invites players to 100% each stage on their first attempt (\"I don't wanna do this all over again because of a missed coin\") which makes play sessions longer and more frustrating, when you push past the point of enjoyment just to be done with a stage.\n\n[b]Final review:[/b] I recommend enjoying Snake Pass in small doses (like fully completing one stage per day), don't hesitate to use guides (you don't wanna have to redo every stage just to grab a couple of missed objects) and remember, good controllers are expensive, so resist the urge to squeeze and twist while you're shaking in a fit of rage (trust me, these [u]will[/u] come).", "timestamp_created": 1593025453, "timestamp_updated": 1593025790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567845284938812256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71280897": {"recommendationid": "71280897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323725709", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 197, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1593049756}, "language": "english", "review": "IM A SNAKE!!!!!! 4/10", "timestamp_created": 1593016758, "timestamp_updated": 1593016758, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420171231031417847", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71274444": {"recommendationid": "71274444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313883311", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1593007019}, "language": "english", "review": "if you have a controller, go play it. its unique,cute, and colorful.  basically nice game.\n\nbut the wanky camera, very bad keyboard and mouse control make this game doesn't fun anymore. like seriously the keyboard and mouse mechanic was a total mess. \n\ngonna play this again when i got controller, i just feel so depressed in 5th stage with keyboard and mouse. thumbs up for free key from Humble Bundle", "timestamp_created": 1593007672, "timestamp_updated": 1593040841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71267519": {"recommendationid": "71267519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076673528", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1616701248}, "language": "english", "review": "boring but good overall. its for kids", "timestamp_created": 1592996383, "timestamp_updated": 1592996383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71252108": {"recommendationid": "71252108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011864330", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1646226088}, "language": "english", "review": "Fullscreen mode just gives you a blank screen, and your only option is to alt-tab and kill it.

I wonder what was on the mind of the devoloper team that not think on that is not fun do all things again and again cause you lose ... part of those loses are the reason that i have to say no to this game. \nLets start with the controls, i dont see play this on keyboard and even with my ps4 controller i think they make it wrong and without option to fix.  Basicly the game is about make your snake go around something and grab. Ok the problem is that grap stop complety your head and sadly move up your head need a trigger too so basicly you need 3 triggers for a smooth gameplay and game only give you 1 for move. Now this game with two triggers will be more easy for a lot, the movement and the one that let you move the head up. With those two this game could improve a lot.  Also the camera will screw you a lot so you will fall a lot and fall means go back to check points, those are bad made. More when you are looking for all the maps, but later (end game) you get snake eyes for found whatever you missed, worth do all game again for that... well for me .. it not worth for that reason i will leave with finish the 100% and no bother with all achivements. Seems they wanted extended the gameplay with that, they shouldn't do that but just put the time attack mode really work.. or could work with better controls.\n\nSo at the end is more stress that enjoyment based in controls and camera, they put a lot o things only for extended the time when the time attack mode could work. Sadly even with that i dont think worth, at this time i got the all wisps and all coins achivement and is only2.7% of owners that do it, and sadly those are so horrible that i get why. \n\nPD: really i wonder why devolopers not notice all the problems this game have, they are not so hide", "timestamp_created": 1592875214, "timestamp_updated": 1599965342, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71193226": {"recommendationid": "71193226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144386908", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1640328074}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Gee bill, we already have bad camera angles, should we add a bird that blocks out the view even more?\"\n\"Of course\"", "timestamp_created": 1592858558, "timestamp_updated": 1592858558, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71192450": {"recommendationid": "71192450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017419722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1592857234}, "language": "english", "review": "Light and fun game.

Not only is it beautiful, but it is addicting and the features amazing snake physics. I know a lot of people do not like the controls, but I think the controls are incredible. It is hard to get the hang of being a snake, but after you do it is super satisfying to play. The key is to remember you are actually controlling the whole snake, not just the head. You need to balance your head and you tail, and that will trip you up constantly.\n\nNow the game is not long, and I would not recommend spending more than $20 on it, simply for the shear lack of content, but this is a hidden Gem  that you can sink 5-8 hours into. Some of you will hate the snake physics, but some of you will love it. I think this is the Mario of snake games myself just because of how well you can move once you get the physics down.

In that same vein, death is not a setback but an opportunity to learn from your mistakes and keep at it. Patience and perseverance is rewarded.\nThis is a very cute puzzle platformer that focuses on unique movement mechanics including slithering, climbing, and wrapping tightly around posts to traverse 15 moderately sized levels for collectibles.

USE A CONTROLLER they literally recommend you use one. Because the controls with a keyboard are trash, if you have one use a Steam controller. But any USB controller with the help of Steam Big Screen's Controller config you can get a control scheme that will hold up well.\n\n*sigh* Anyways\n\nAs for the game itself its a classic collectathon \"Platformer?\" where you play as Noodle the Snek and must work with Doodle the Hummingbird to pick up keystone's, Gate Keeper Coins, and Blue Wisps in an effort to make level progress and open up the level exit gate with said Keystone's (Which are the only collectables required). But playing as a Snek has its challenges one of which being you can't jump. (Yes a Platformer where jumping is not a thing) So as a Result you must slither up and around things to reach them. The Keystone's are what is required to progress, The blue wisps are special collectables scattered around the level that you have to pick up, most of them are in the way, some not so much. And gate keeper Coins are these special collectables that are put in hard to reach places with the first level giving you a taste of just how hard they are to grab.\n\nPlaying as Noodle is not particularly hard and you can get Doodle to pick up Noodles tail to make it easier to climb over things at the expense that Noodle cant extend as high when Doodle has his tail in which you have to tell doodle to put your tail down. And Because your a snek you need to slither in a left and right alternating motion to gain good momentum or speed. You can also grip to make it so Noodle stiffens up to make more subtle movements up objects to prevent falling. The camera can be hard but the camera buttons when you learn to use them right let you see around noodle for the most part.\n\nAs for difficulty its easy to learn hard to master, most required things are easy to get early on with those coins being the real test of skill in your knowledge on how to control Noodle. Also in classic collectathon fashion if you die, you respawn at your last checkpoint with anything you got before you touched a new checkpoint counted as being lost, forcing you to recollect it. Some can consider it bad game design, but because the levels are not on the very long end. Its more to stop you from jumping off in a kamikaze cheese it attempt to grab that one collectable without skill. And do believe me some of them do require a lot of skill to collect (Mainly the coins as I pointed out earlier)\n\nOverall 8/10 Its a good game to enjoy in short bursts once you get the hang of it, and preferably played with a controller. Because cmon who would come on here and complain and write a bad review about keyboard controls despite the game telling them its recommended to use a controller, surely no one. :D", "timestamp_created": 1592504732, "timestamp_updated": 1592505235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70988186": {"recommendationid": "70988186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025302198", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1593368451}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun to learn to move like a snake.", "timestamp_created": 1592498992, "timestamp_updated": 1592498992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70986578": {"recommendationid": "70986578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147418692", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1594155604}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel like its kinda repetitive, but the snakes name is Noodle, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1592496608, "timestamp_updated": 1592496608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70983969": {"recommendationid": "70983969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149042884", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1592492615}, "language": "english", "review": "not fun", "timestamp_created": 1592492682, "timestamp_updated": 1592492682, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70956721": {"recommendationid": "70956721", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966108393", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1592436515}, "language": "english", "review": "its a cute game but I really dont like the controls", "timestamp_created": 1592436531, "timestamp_updated": 1592436531, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492735326290130615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70955643": {"recommendationid": "70955643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047734274", "num_games_owned": 530, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 923, "last_played": 1592434033}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun 3D puzzle platformer with a really nice aesthetic.\n\nReviews complaining about the controls are missing the point, you're a snake.

Also, it's *not* particularly relaxing; you'll often find yourself tightening your grip on the mouse/controller and cringing as you try not to slip off ledges.\n\nWHAT GENRE IS THIS GAME?\nIt's not quite an adventure in the spirit of Banjo-Kazooie. I would actually liken it more to Mirror's Edge. Like Mirror's Edge, the game is based entirely around your skills with a particular set of moves/controls.\n\nHOW DIFFICULT IS THIS GAME?\nThere's a steep learning curve at the beginning, but about an hour or two into the game, you'll realize that the game is pretty easy to complete. However, the game is significantly more difficult if you try to collect all the collectibles and *especially* if you try to collect all the Steam achievements. This game is good for both casual gamers and \"serious\" gamers alike.\n\nIS THIS GAME WORTHWHILE?\nYes, this game is definitely worthwhile. The most common complaint among the negative reviews seems to be that people don't like the controls. Well, mastering the controls is the whole point!

Fun and relaxing game (if you can handle the controls) padded out with a lackluster story, long levels, and collectibles that barely serve any purpose or motivation to collect them. \n\nPros: \n-Fun to control and slide around (if the controls work for you) \n-Relaxing atmosphere where you can go at your own pace exploring stages. \n-No enemies to worry about helps the relaxing atmosphere. \n- Music is very pleasing. \n-Arcade mode is a fun change of pace if the game is too relaxing\n\nCons: \n-Controls are hard to get used to. \n-Not much variety in music\n-Not much incentive to collect any of the extras. \n-Levels often feel larger than they need to be, with hardly any reason to explore\n-Not much of a story. \n\n================\n\nIntroduction:\nThis is an interesting game that somehow manages to be relaxing and frustrating at the same time. \nAlthough you play as a snake, the game makes you feel more like a human in a snakes body. \nWhen you get the controls down, it's very pleasing to glide along the ground, wrapping around things, and explore. \n\nHowever, the tutorial level does a bad job and teaching you this. I learned a lot of the controls by playing later levels that had bigger structures to wrap around.  The first level has some things to climb, but most are right at ground level. And the ones that aren't are over bottomless pits. They also lead to a coin, and since the nature of this game just encourages you to explore, it can leave a bad first impression to keep trying for the coins and keep failing because the first level seems to forget that it should be getting you comfortable with the controls, not punishing you for stepping outside your comfort zone and skill level to get used to the game. \n\nThose who do stick with the game after this will likely come back to collect the coins and wisps they missed the first time. Which leads me to the second problem with this game. Unskippable cutscenes. Hardly anything goes on in them, and they are hardly worth watching the first time. But you have to watch them everytime you play a level. If you come back to the first level halfway through the game, you're still going to watch the cutscene that introduces you to the characters and story. \n\n================\n\nStory: \nSpeaking of characters and the story, there isn't much good to say. The story feels like it's just tacked on. I'm halfway through the game ( I think ), and it's still not explained what the gates are, and why I should care about fixing them, who the gate keepers are, what the \"thing\" is that sounds like a large bird. \n\n================\n\nCharacters: \nThe characters are okay, but the don't compliment each other at all. The bird starts off the game in a panic, waking the snake up because the gates are broken and you need to fix them. The snake wakes up and maybe looks a little worried? But overall looks like he couldn't care less. His expressions and seemingly not-all-there attitude, along with the birds more serious nature reminds me a lot of Crash Bandicoot and his sister. But I don't think it works here. There's no backstory to these characters, nothing to tie them together. Making the contrast between the bird and the snake much more obvious. Like the bird was only made to be serious and in a panic in a shallow attempt to encourage the player to continue the story. \nCrash Bandicoot doesn't have the most in-depth story either. However, the little things it does goes a long way. Crash and Coco are sisters, so they have history, they have a mentor figure (aku aku), and you know who the villain is and have clear motivation from the start of the game. In this game, I often feel like I shouldn't even care. I mean, why should I? The snake certainly doesn't look like he cares. \n\nThe character design is just fine. Although, I think they could've worked on making the expressions on the snakes face more distinct and less clueless. \n\nOkay, so the story isn't all that great. Let's get into the details about the gameplay. \n\n================\n\nGameplay: \nThe controls seem flawless most of the time. Again, this is assuming you can get used to them. They are confusing at times and the game does a bad job at explaining the mechanics. For example, L2 makes the snake tighten in an attempt to stay in place. But when you are wrapped around something, it's not clear what part of you will stay tightened, and what part will seemingly at random start to uncoil. Sometimes it's the lower half, sometimes it's the upper half. If you get unlucky, it's usually not hard to correct yourself and avoid dying. But it seems nearly impossible to wrap fully around something like an actual snake can. A big part of this seems to come down to just how slippery the snake feels to control. This becomes painfully evident if you attempt to go for the no diving achievement. Ironically, despite feeling slippers, the snake feels slow and sticky on the ground, unless you can get the slithering motion down. \n\nFor the most part, the game doesn't put you in situations where it's hard to correct yourself if you start to slip. My last on the controls are how sometimes the camera locks in place, which can make it extremely difficult as finding a comfortable camera angle is a big part of why this game's controls are at the very least manageable. Thankfully, the game only rarely takes control of the camera away from you.  \n\nThe levels are actually well designed, aside from the first one. They are a little big, and it can be a real drag to realize you forgot a coin or something and have to go all the way back (if you care about collectibles). If there was more of a reason to collect the wisps and coins, or more things to find, or reasons to explore, the levels being so big wouldn't be such a bad thing.  \n\nSpeaking of collectibles, there's two types to collect. In every level, there are 20 wisps and 5 coins. However, these collectibles feel tacked on just to pad out the game. There doesn't even seem to be a difference between the 2. Coins are usually harder to get, but some wisps are in locations just as hard to reach. Not to mention that the wisps blend into the level so well that the levels can look boring and empty. This could've easily been fixed by adding the fruit from arcade mode into the main game. There also doesn't seem to be any backstory to them, and no reason to collect them other than getting 100% completion. No upgrades. No extra levels. Nothing. Not even simple cosmetic options like being able to change the snakes color or something. Well, there is one thing: [spoiler] There's an 8-bit skin for the bird and the snake if you collect everything. [/spoiler]\n\nThe game also has two other game modes. An arcade mode and a time trial mode. Let's discuss them one at a time. \n\nThe time trial game mode is probably exactly how you expect. Simply get through the level as fast as you can. At the end, you can see how your time compares to others. However, this is where time trial falls short. You can only see the fastest times for 2 players above and below you. And there are no numbers to rank the players. You could be the 3rd fastest player, or the 30,000th fastest player, and you'll have no idea. \n\nThe arcade mode is  actually a lot of fun. You have a time limit, but I didn't find it to restrictive. You go around the stage collecting as many fruit as you can before time runs out. Different fruit give different amounts of points. And there being an immediate reward to collecting the fruit, combined with the different types of fruit, makes them very satisfying to collect. I think if they had put the fruit into the main game, it would have been so much more fun to explore the levels. \n\n================\n\nMusic: \nThe music is very pleasing. It's relaxing to listen to and really adds to the experience. Although, as the songs are the same for each level in a world, you're likely to be bored of the song by the time you get to the next world. \n\nSee top for final verdict.", "timestamp_created": 1592088289, "timestamp_updated": 1592088289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492653369903564453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70745476": {"recommendationid": "70745476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113176112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 149, "last_played": 1610954084}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ahhh que rompe pijas", "timestamp_created": 1592087697, "timestamp_updated": 1592087697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70740326": {"recommendationid": "70740326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048750012", "num_games_owned": 3086, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 639, "last_played": 1592069600}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]5.8 / 10[/b] (Critical) - Interesting unique experience. Cute, cozy and questionable.[/h1]\n\u2022 It takes a [b]VERY[/b] long time to properly grasp the controls in Snake Pass, because there's many tricky situations the game doesn't properly teach you how to handle. It takes [b]at least[/b] 5 hours of play time before you'll feel like you're in full control of the snake, and that's only if you're trying to 100% the game as you go, since that forces you to learn tougher tasks, otherwise it takes longer. [b]Quick Tip:[/b] [i]Grip is super useful, and use a controller.[/i]\n\u2022 With that said, Snake Pass is fairly difficult and it emulates a snake very well.\n\u2022 The music is great, composed by [b]David Wise[/b], but there's only about 6(?) [b]primary[/b] tracks in the game repeating for 10+ hours; 4 during actual gameplay, because there's only 1 music track for each world, and there's 4 worlds/realms. I love the music in world 2 particularly.\n\u2022 I think there's a little issue with gameplay consistency. Usually things work as they should, but they also regularly fall apart for no discernible reason even when you feel like you had everything under control.\n\u2022 There's a mechanic where slithering left and right increases your move & climb speed, and avoiding this can slow you down to the point where you can't even move. This mechanic is far more annoying than interesting or enjoyable, from beginning to end. It's not clear [i]precisely how[/i] you should be slithering to efficiently gain speed, and most of the time it grants very little speed. The average move speed in this game is unbearably slow.\n\u2022 There's no button to quickly respawn at checkpoints, which would've been preferable to a slowly falling/dying snake that also slowly respawns into a controllable state.\n\u2022 The camera is obnoxious. Its FOV is too low to get a good sense of the stage layout, which is disorienting, and it constantly zooms too far in if there's nearby objects, and multiple collectibles force a nearly unusable camera. There should've been more than 2 zoom levels or a way to control the zoom level more precisely, which could've been implemented easily by holding RB/R1 while adjusting it with other buttons.\n\u2022 A few of the special challenge achievements have very misleading descriptions and don't like to register.\n\u2022 There's no indicator for which stages you've disturbed the gatekeeper idols in, yet there's an achievement to disturb one in each stage.\n\u2022 There's no indicator for which stages you've beaten deathless, yet there's an achievement to beat all stages deathless.\n\u2022 You can't change graphics settings in-game; it can only be done through the main menu.\n\u2022 Depth of Field can only be disabled by changing the Post Processing setting to Low, which is unfortunately bundled with a bunch of other post processing effects you will want enabled. The game looks significantly better with DoF disabled.\n\u2022 The game's mechanical annoyances pop up a ton in the second half of the game, making the last 2 worlds a bit more frustrating than fun, which probably could've been alleviated with a couple more checkpoints or shortcuts, or addressing the annoyances.\n\u2022 There's no way to disable or adjust controller vibration, which makes it easier to get carpal tunnel.\n\u2022 None of the cutscenes are skippable.\n\u2022 [i]Arcade[/i] and [i]Time Trial[/i] modes are good for replayability, but they don't have any achievements, which you could have done for each of these modes on each stage, so 30 additional achievements for interacting with all of the stages in new and challenging ways.\n\u2022 [b]Snake Pass is kind of cute & cozy though.[/b]\n\nIt's worth trying, but try to go in with a lot of patience.", "timestamp_created": 1592080158, "timestamp_updated": 1592081302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536266326904296875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70739513": {"recommendationid": "70739513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021787653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1592183053}, "language": "english", "review": "Received free from a Humble Bundle promotion.\n\nControls are really fun and interesting and make navigating levels really satisfying.

I'm a huge fan of hard to control games. I've 100%ed I Am Bread and truly consider that game to be amazing. It has difficult controls that are easy to learn quickly and then its just a matter of figuring out strategies. In this game, they never take the time to properly explain the controls and then immediately dump you into scenarios that expect you to start building strategies around these controls that you don't understand and are incredibly obtuse. I tried my best to enjoy this game, but it just isnt very good and the fact that its been out for three years and is still at this level of quality isn't terribly promising.

I've never seen one that had such a strange and unfamiliar non-humanoid style of movement. I'd say the most important thing to know about before getting this game is not to expect it to play like your average platforming game, because if you come in with that expectation, you're probably going to end up frustrated. This is not a fast paced game. You are encouraged to go through the various climbing challenges with a slow, methodical pace, much like a snake would. It's something that can be pretty confusing at first and requires a lot of patience, but once you make sense of the controls, you can tell that the devs put a TON of work into refining how Noodle moves and in perfecting their body's physics. Also, just as one last closing thought, the fact that the protagonist of this game is a snake, and a realistically proportioned one at that. I love snakes a lot and think that a lot of them are very lovely, cute, and affectionate creatures. They get far too much of a negative stigma, so it's nice to see a game that appreciates how great they are.\n\nTLDR: The game is really well made, but don't come in expecting it to be like a normal platformer. It's pretty slow paced and has controls that can be confusing at first (but that's just because of how alien the movement is. It makes total sense once you figure it out.)

The ways in which it evokes this bygone age of gaming is fairly evident just by looking at it: You play as a cute animal in a colorful world and you have to collect things in order to progress. It\u2019s not far removed from games like Banjo-Kazooie or Spyro in that regard. \n\nBut what makes it radically different form pretty much every other game it might superficially be compared to is one key fact: Since you control a snake, you simply can\u2019t jump. And that removes basically everything a traditional 3D platformer usually builds its other systems around. The way the developers managed to create engaging gameplay by not featuring one of the cornerstones of the genre is pretty damn excellent.\n\nSince you can\u2019t jump around to your hearts content, the developers focused on the one thing that every game should strive for: Controlling your character should be fun even without any other challenge in the game. Think about the Mario games. Ever since Super Mario 64, Mario has gotten a large number of varied moves he can execute. Just running and jumping around in all the different ways you can is fun, even before you jump on the first Goomba\u2019s head. And even as recently as Super Mario Odyssey, you can clearly see this principle still paying large dividends. So, true to that principle, Noodle, the snake you control in Snake Pass, is immensely fun to move around the levels by itself. \n\nIt might take you some time to get used to the control scheme and fully internalize what happens when you push an analog stick in any given direction or press a button. Because, since you control a snake, you also have to move around like a snake. Pulling the trigger to move yourself in the direction Noodle is facing may push you forward but if you only move in a straight line, you\u2019ll slow down to a crawl almost immediately. Because snakes don\u2019t actually move around like that. In order to gain momentum, you\u2019ll have to wiggle around just like a real snake would. Since this is a platformer, you\u2019ll need to find ways in order to actually reach higher or lower places safely, so again, you\u2019ll be using techniques borrowed from real life in order to climb around these levels competently. That means winding up tightly around objects in order to maximize friction in order to not slide off.\n\nSince the focus of the game is mastering the movement of the animal you\u2019re supposed to be playing, there\u2019s no actual combat going in in the game. You have enough on your plate with the controls and figuring out how to traverse these levels without also having to bother killing enemies. But you still need a challenge. And it\u2019s safe to say that the biggest adversary in the game is actually your character itself. This concept is nothing new. There are tons of games, often built around poorly implemented physics systems whose challenge stems entirely from getting through the game with a character that\u2019s hard to control. But most of the time this is done for comedic effect and never really intended for graceful play. So, it\u2019s very nice to see that Snake Pass takes the high road here and really wants you to commit to playing as a snake. Because Noodle\u2019s body is obviously affected by gravity. And if the majority of the weight dangles off a ledge, you\u2019ll risk sliding off. Though the game does offer a method of making things easier. Noodle has a hummingbird companion called Doodle and with a push of a button, you can use Doodle to lift Noodle\u2019s tail and carry it around. That doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t fall off a ledge, but it makes it easier when your tail manages to slide off and threatens to pull you along with it, which is nice.\n\nHowever, the fact that Noodle is so finicky to control can still lead to some frustration, especially during later levels that severely ramp up the challenge, notably if you\u2019re bent on really finding all the collectibles. I am by no means a completionist, but whenever I encounter a challenge I enjoy, I at least try to go for as much as I can. But I have to say that the last batch of levels tested my patience at certain points. Especially one of the very final jumps that required me to have Noodle be blown from one platform onto another one by a gust of wind that almost seemed like it deliberately went against every other type of challenge where you have to avoid the wind as best as possible.\n\nBut to the game\u2019s credit, you\u2019re never required to collect more than the requisite three keys that unlock the portal to the next level, so if you don\u2019t care about collecting everything or you just can\u2019t be bothered to overcome a certain challenge, you can just leave it at that.\n\nNow, in the introduction, I mentioned how the game feels similar to 3D platformers of ye olde times. But one thing that is absent and what made that genre so endearing to me were the silly characters, the bonkers narratives and the often irreverent humor in their writing. And this is one aspect that Snake Pass, this time unfortunately, didn\u2019t opt to let itself be inspired by. The justification for why you\u2019re traversing these levels is thinner than one ply toilet paper. It\u2019s honestly not even worth wasting any words in describing it, because it\u2019s so perfunctory. Suffice to say that I would\u2019ve loved to see some actual writing in a game that already features a cartoony world where you control a snake called Noodle. Because the rest of the presentation is pretty much spot on to what you\u2019d expect from this type of game. You have a set of 15 levels divided into four thematic sets around earth, water, fire and air and it all looks gorgeous and the soundtrack is equally great and enjoyable.\n\nIf you\u2019re after a fun and challenging gameplay experience, I can definitely recommend Snake Pass. It\u2019s intelligently designed and offers an interesting and novel way of gameplay. But if you saw any of the trailers or screenshots and got nostalgic for the antics of the likes of Conkers, Banjo and the rest, I\u2019m sad to say that Snake Pass unfortunately isn\u2019t what you\u2019re looking for.", "timestamp_created": 1586440448, "timestamp_updated": 1586440448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014469861984253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66792910": {"recommendationid": "66792910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252805600", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1618930883}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Fun but short platformer. wish they did something like this again.", "timestamp_created": 1586228082, "timestamp_updated": 1586228082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66743749": {"recommendationid": "66743749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136520014", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1586171239}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El colibr\u00ed es un hijo de puta.", "timestamp_created": 1586173650, "timestamp_updated": 1586173650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479094088077545166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66693484": {"recommendationid": "66693484", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970938346", "num_games_owned": 776, "num_reviews": 546, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1586556072}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a competently made game, and it was difficult to decide to ultimately give this game the thumb's down.

Your first collectible will be difficult to grab a hold of, but once you realize how to control Noodle the Snake, every challenge afterward is just repetition of the same basics.\n\nThe controls get some criticism, but they're actually ingenious. Noodle....moves like a Snake. He moves on the slower side, but to bypass potential issues the levels require the most minimal of traversing. There's never so much ground to cover that it showcases the slow move-speed and makes it an issue. I can understand wanting the ability to move Noodle to his left or right, rather than making left and right relative to where the camera is positioned at that time. I also understand that the camera can get a bit finicky and fights you at some points, but barring a few annoyances I never found it to be a detrimental issue to the overall experience.\n\nMy main issue with Snake Pass is the slow pace of everything. Every collectible is an agonizingly time-consuming experience. You're supposed to grab collectibles by wrapping around bamboo and making your way onward once you have a solid grip of where you are presently located. \n\nYou're supposed to move slow. This game is meant to be a slow game. Moving fast means losing your grip.\n\nYou'll find that safely getting anything can take you upwards of 7 to 10 minutes depending on what the circumstances are. Ironically, fewer collectibles and levels would alleviate the issue, as Snake Pass is a game that remains interesting for a small window frame before becoming monotonous. It's not that the game is hard, it's that it's boring.\n\nSnake Pass merits some respect for taking the idea and movement of a Snake, and placing it in a platformer sans the ability to actually jump. Other games have done it better (Bionic Commando), but Snake Pass takes the central tenets of its protagonist and makes it all work. For that I have to give it credit. Its a platformer who's challenge really lies in its physics, which is odd to say but makes sense in practice. But wrapping yourself around bamboo lying above what is a bottomless pit gets old once you solved the entire game within the first hour. And it's not the type of game you can just drop and come back to: you are committed to 30+ minute playtimes unless you want to lose all progress you'be made in a level. There is no saving.\n\nI get the appeal to some, but I just felt like I was wasting time. I understand that the game does some things right, and I've given it its due. But ultimately the game is a slowly trodding affair without much meat or variety in a plate that is too large for the actual substance of the portion served. 3/10.", "timestamp_created": 1580329463, "timestamp_updated": 1580337704, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769755363464355469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62351465": {"recommendationid": "62351465", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989803948", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1579910029}, "language": "english", "review": "You are constantly fighting the controls and camera.

This means a lot of hunting around for arbitrary collectibles hidden in stupid places that aren't difficult to get to, just poorly placed.

You're a goofy slithery snake with an adorable hummingbird friend, and you move like an actual snake. The controls are definitely challenging, which is what makes this game so much fun. It really gives me that PS2 platformer collectathon game vibe that I miss so much with its beautiful jungle and underwater environments. It kind of gives me that cozy Spyro: A Hero's Tail feeling from my childhood. All the music tracks are also extremely catchy.\n\nControls: 8/10 - The fascinating thing about this game is that there's a learning curve to the controls. It can be extremely difficult at first for new players, but fortunately there's an \"easy mode\" for the controls, and you can also play with a controller. Personally I found it much more comfortable to play with a controller, so to me this is the best way to play this game.\n\nGameplay or Concept Execution: 8/10 - You have to think like a snake to move in this game. Additionally this game is like a mini collectathon 3D platformer with terrific platforms and creative level design in the 15 levels across 4 different \"worlds\". Additionally your hummingbird friend Doodle can pick up your tail to help you in some sections. Besides the platforming, there's two more modes: an arcade mode in which you collect as many fruits as you can, and a time trial mode in which you try to beat the level as fast as possible. Personally, I think the game was a little too short, so it loses a point in this category. I completed the game 100% in just 15 hours. Also, the camera can be impossible to deal with sometimes, making the maneuvering harder than probably intended.\n\nThis game has Steam achievements, which I am currently trying to complete 100%. They're challenging to get, so this adds more length to the game.\n\nAesthetic: 10/10 - The 4 worlds in this game are gorgeous and are based on the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind. The game is terrifically optimized. I was surprised how fast it ran on my laptop despite being so detailed. The water in this game looks absolutely delicious, and you will get enjoyment out of diving and dancing in it as a snake. \n\nThe characters are ADORABLE, and there's no voice-acting, thankfully. The characters \"speak\" through little sounds and a text box, but the sounds aren't unpleasant. This game has a wonderful Spyro/PlayStation-like quality and personality to it.\n\nMusic: 10/10 - This game has some of the best music I have ever heard before. Mark my words: every single track will get stuck in your head. Each world has a different vibe that's reflected perfectly in the associated track and actually helps with concentration.\n\nSound Design: 10/10 - The sounds all fit the environments and nothing feels out of place. The hummingbird makes cute rrrr sounds, and the snake makes funny gasps and yelps in a goofy male voice. He actually sounds a little like Spyro, now that I think about it.\n\nFinal Score: \ud83c\udf8d 9/10\n\nSuggestions: More levels, Workshop support, level-editor, co-op, skippable cutscenes, better camera", "timestamp_created": 1572708253, "timestamp_updated": 1621092130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56103236": {"recommendationid": "56103236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006515163", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1572914554}, "language": "english", "review": "Genuine delightful platformer without the ability to jump.You play as a  cheech up snake and use your body hang on poles to progress through out the levels.Its gets a little tougher on the later levels with moving plat forms and death hazards.There is only one enemy type in the game and it's the camera.You have to think a bit at some points about how to go about some the of the puzzles but the camera is your  enemy when you its not in the right spot and you end up missing the plat form you try to reach.I can see why people find it irritating but I'm assuming they have no patience.All and all fun physics game and very easy to pick up a afternoon.Pick it up during a sale", "timestamp_created": 1572587760, "timestamp_updated": 1572587760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526143789291381836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55909849": {"recommendationid": "55909849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231571144", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1572772404}, "language": "english", "review": "The Only Kind Of Noodle I Don't Eat", "timestamp_created": 1572464605, "timestamp_updated": 1572464605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55871039": {"recommendationid": "55871039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023339248", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1613321063}, "language": "english", "review": "Its actually pretty fun.

It has great stylized visuals and a wonderfully unique design. You will likely struggle with the controls and camera at first but after the first few levels, you can easily begin to get a grasp on how to navigate the various obstacles Snake Pass will throw at you. The levels are well balanced when it comes to difficulty. I never felt bored with simple levels, yet I also never felt frustrated with down right unfair designs. The same can be said about the collectable location design. As long as you keep an eye out you can find all collectables by yourself. They are never placed awkwardly in downright obscure or out of bounds areas. Only once did I have to Google a location but that was my own fault as I had missed a lever in plain sight.\n\nThe game is relatively short and certainly could have done with maybe a handful more levels. However in saying that, too many levels and I get the feeling that it may have overstayed its welcome. For those that really enjoy the game there is also Arcade and Time Trial game modes. Lastly, while playing I couldn't help but feel that the game would have been even more fun if it had featured a level creator.\n\nOverall Snake Pass is a wonderful title that I would recommend to anyone looking for something unique. It has great design, art and music. With its only small downfalls being a sometimes awkward camera, shortish playtime and sadly no level creator.\n\nRating: 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1562387890, "timestamp_updated": 1562387890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540949404239654541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53625682": {"recommendationid": "53625682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243238832", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1693979035}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a super fun and relaxing game!", "timestamp_created": 1562311400, "timestamp_updated": 1562311400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53595012": {"recommendationid": "53595012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088391055", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1662860994}, "language": "english", "review": "it's a good & unique 3d platformer kinda game and I personally really like the way the snake mechanics are implemented", "timestamp_created": 1562286492, "timestamp_updated": 1562286492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53428394": {"recommendationid": "53428394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037675458", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 260, "last_played": 1562190016}, "language": "english", "review": "snek", "timestamp_created": 1562190575, "timestamp_updated": 1562190575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53409111": {"recommendationid": "53409111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063626682", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1642454241}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun game that can be rage inducing at time.", "timestamp_created": 1562182240, "timestamp_updated": 1562182240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616461217403411865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53386489": {"recommendationid": "53386489", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983135856", "num_games_owned": 937, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 403, "last_played": 1561661260}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is worth picking up for the movement mechanics alone. Gameplay largely revolves around navigating a snake through obstacles, often by climbing. Not sure about kb/m, but with a controller it's very intuitive and ... snakey. Getting the hang of climbing well is really interesting and fun. \n\nHowever, the game seems to falter later on. The locations are very similar, although there are some pallette swaps. The main problem is that almost every level mainly involves climbing on bamboo. The game throws in a few changes: switches moving portions, very minor puzzle solving. But after you've completed 8 or so levels you really aren't going to see anything new and exciting. \n\nThe game does work well as an exploration game. You are mainly finding 3 different kinds of collectibles at increasing difficulty. Some are right on your path, but others can be hidden quite well.

The graphics are very beautiful. The cartoonish desigh mixed with extra details like the scales on the snake really do blend well together. The stages the selves are very pleasent to look at. The water alone has to be my favorite part. It's just one of those things you appreciate when, you play above and below water.\n\n The animations are really smooth and fluid. As much as I love using keyboards. Using a Xbox one controller is deffiantly the better method to play this game. Even, tho the game is pretty well polished. There are a few issues I did run into. Sometimes the camera gets confused on what to do. Making some climbing areas odd. When, it wobbles from different angles I didn't want. (No I wasn't touching the l /r buttons), sometimes raising the head needs constant movement. But, that's not a big issues.\n\n The character designs are by far well crafted. Although, they may look simple. They just look appealing to the eyes and, will age very well years from now. Even, if I didn't get this game during, the steam spring sell. I can give a high recommendation to buy Snake pass. \n\n Unless, your afraid of cuddly snakes. Or, hate new takes on old ideas. I would still suggest.

On the surface it comes off as one of those obtuse games that are hard to control just for the sake of being hard to control. I do not like those type of games. The challenges feel artificial and while the controls can be mastered of course, they ultimately hinge themselves on sliding scale of random luck that you can only hope to narrow. Snake Pass ISN'T one of \"those games\" though. The locomotion is actually perfectly reasonable, logical, and fair. It's just new, and there's a learning curve. However. There are simply too many so-called quality of life oversights to ignore...\n\nThe most obvious being the checkpoint system. While I can actually excuse this for the sake of added difficulty. It simply does not lend itself to a game that has this many obstacles and slow deaths. Your mistakes build slowly. Your deaths come in animated falls that take a handful of seconds. And your movement to get back to where you failed is slow and tedious. That being said, the level design doesn't really leave many other options. So, it's downright awful. But I don't know what the solution would be. I'd have gladly taken something like a life system with a \"last location on solid ground\" instant-respawn, for even just two or three lives between respawn checkpoint continues. Or even just a button to instant-respawn when you know you've failed. Anything for a slight bit of relief. It's just too painful and slow. \n\nThis pain is compounded by the game being a collectable game. If these were just \"trials\" without collectables? A lot of this quality of life stuff could be overlooked. But there is indeed collectables. One to beat the level. And two more just because. And going for these just makes the design mistakes stand out more than they deserve. Which brings me to the camera; For a game with hard to master controls and countless obstacles to overcome you will still somehow end up blaming the camera for well over 50% of your deaths. This is insane. It starts far too zoomed in by default. It is sometimes sensitive to landscape objects and other times not. And worst of all, your character control directions are locked to the orientation of the camera at any given moment. Nothing harder than trying to coil yourself around a pole as the camera moves and with it so changes your needed inputs. Again, I don't know what the solution is. I would've at least liked to have been able to have the option for direction inputs locked to snake direction rather than camera to see if it is a better option. Or an option to lock the camera in place during an obstacle. Maybe they would've been worse, but I have a hard time believing this was the best camera/inputdirection option. Another small thing was unskippable cutscenes. There's things to collect, I'm going to revisit the level, lemme skip the story part this go around. \n\nI found myself uninstalling the game once I realized I wasn't going to 100% the collectables without breaking a controller. I'm a decade or two past that phase and would like to keep it that way. \"I'm too old for this shi...\" I will perhaps revisit and just play it to beat each level without collecting everything as I really really really enjoyed the concept at the core of the game. The truly fascinating, new, inventive, locomotion was really fun. But this needed a lot more time in the oven. I don't even know if challenge/obstacle/puzzle is the right direction in the first place. I'd love to play with this snake in an open world with similarly difficult collectables parts, but some sort of other objective. Enemies, stealth, eating eggs/rodents? Or something. It just isn't quite there as a puzzle game. Which is another thing it is missing; Workshop/modding support. But oh well.

Basically, once you have the hang of it, you can get way more reckless than you think you can, and it's super fun\n- If you corkscrew upwards you have more structure and you can raise your head higher\n--- In combination with the above, you can slither up walls a little much like you slither on the ground, allowing you to climb walls MUCH higher than you think (at its best you can use this to skip parts of the level, at its worst it's fun and can give you a vantage point to look for things you missed)\n\nSome gripes I have:\n- Can't change keybinds. Mostly this is fine because the controls are good (I'm on controller) but you can't move the camera and use a face button at the same time\n- The above is a problem because the camera moves on its own if the snake moves, and this can get you killed by obscuring your vision while you're moving over a dangerous spot\n- Your snake head is gigantic, and some poles are too close together to fit your head through vertically. This isn't objectively an issue, but it has gotten me killed 3 or 4 times, which was kind of annoying\n- Some orbs are a huge pain in the keister to find. Too well hidden orbs means backtracking, which is super slow in a game where you literally have to slither around with no limbs\n- Cutscenes are completely unskippable in the main playthrough. In time trials and arcade they're disabled, but in the main game you're better off getting everything in the level in one go, so you don't have to go back and watch the cutscene again\n\nKeep in mind none of the above really make the game much less fun overall. It might mean the difference between a 9.5 and a 9 out of 10, and really none of it should influence your decision to buy the game", "timestamp_created": 1548910719, "timestamp_updated": 1548968614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48629931": {"recommendationid": "48629931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044993640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1548778877}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely terrible experience.

Movement seems to be all over the place. One time you slither at light speed, and other times it seems Noodle can't get off the spot no matter how hard you ravish that right stick. Combine that with the fact that every object (no matter how small) has a tangible hitbox, which makes it very easy to get stuck on all the decorative objects like twigs and stones and you have a formula for disaster.\nBut the worst thing about this game, and the worst thing in the history of all 3D games in my opinion, is the camera. Remember the old days of early 3D games in the N64 era, how much you wanted to hurt someone because the camera was so bad? In this game you'll have those feelings again, but three times as much. The camera gets stuck behind objects, you loose sight because something gets in the way (most often decorative foliage), objects between you and the camera make the camera instantly zoom in even though there clearly is enough space and sight, not being able to zoom in or out at times and the camera not auto-adjusting to help you in certain situations (like going with you around corners while climbing a wall) but will do so at other times where it seems to be totally unnecessary and then won't budge no matter how much you want it to move.\nWanna look around for that one object you missed? Too bad, 20 seconds later your bird friend constantly gets in your way if you haven't moved in a while. It's a cute mechanic for when you are not there, Noodle asleep and the camera frozen, but please for the love of god don't block my sight WHILE I'M MOVING THE CAMERA trying to figure out where that one coin is I've missed.\nSpeaking of the bird, his tail grab seems to work only when he feels like it. At least five times during my playthrough I clearly heard Noodle whistle but the Bird wouldn't help me, resulting in death.\nThere could have also been more control options. I've found that pressing the left stick instead of Y to call the bird for help avoids situations where you are already pressing the A button to avoid falling (had to press Y with my chin then), and having the camera zoom in and out by pressing the right stick (the stick that moves the camera in the first place) works much better. I've rebound those keys with DS4Windows for my PS4 controller, but it would've been nice to have those controls available from the start or even being able to individually rebind each function in the game to your liking for people that don't have these tools.\n\nBut that's it for my complains, and there's enough that I nonetheless still love about the game.\nFor one the amazing soundtrack by David Wise, with every track fitting the style of each world perfectly. I think the music alone was the reason I continued to torture myself with the controls and camera, as well as the outstanding look of the game, making great use of the Unreal Engine 4 to make it look like a Pixar movie. And the way Noodle is animated, with the option to give him different facial expressions for different situations made the game rather charming. I stuck to one facial expression through the whole game though, and that was the one you get when you slightly press D-Pad down, giving Noodle that look like he's about to cry, a look of constant fear, sadness, depression and suffering, because I thought all he wanted was to sleep and relax in the sun but bird buddy has him make do all these deadly tasks for his enjoyment and to (rather clich\u00e9) \"save the world\". And because of the camera.\n\nNow the question: Would I recommend this game? If you've played 3D platformers in the past and are used to horrible cameras and are generally a fan of the genre then yes, definitely.

Controlling Noodle really makes you feel like a snake. When you achieve a tricky maneuver, you feel accomplished.\n\nI did have a few gripes, mostly nothing to do with the movement system. First of all, collectibles don't do anything except unlock a skin once the game is finished. And by then, there's no reason to play anymore - the collectibles don't respawn when you restart a level. Noodle also doesn't get any new abilities or access to new mechanics as the game progresses.\n\nThe 'grip' button does f*** all as well. I never used it once.\n\nAnd the plot? Pick up a book written for 4 year olds. That's the plot.\n\nYou're playing this game for the challenge, and the challenge alone. Then the game is finished and you beat the challenge. And it's not an overly long game either.\n\nI still recommend it. It's simple but fun.\n\nI also recommend using a controller.

Consistent, persistent practice really helps with surpassing many of the obstacles, eventually, you'll be climbing your way to victory, and hypnotically swaying through streams with the elegance and grace of a synchronised swimmer.\n\nThere's a nice variety in a challenge with collectables providing a couple of extra hours playtime, and semi-regular respawn points scattered throughout each level. These are very handy, especially around rickety ladders, steep declining edges, or moving pedestals and really tones down the frustration if you fail to grip correctly and fall.  \n\nBeautiful graphics and fresh, vibrant colours help to deliver an interesting environment to explore; lush terrain, waterlogged temples and acrid, fiery biomes.

Initially, what made me wishlist it instantly was that it reminded me a lot of JUJU, that I really enjoyed. I wasn't disappointed. \n\nThe story: in a world made of floating realms, Noodle the snake and his pal Doodle the bird set out to repair a series of portals which serve as access between the various islands. The portals have all been mysteriously looted and made unusable...\nThe game is what it is advertised to be: a kind of family friendly platformer. But beyond this central concept, the whole thing is rather original and absolutely lovely on all levels.\n\n[u] The visuals [/u] \n\n     I thought from the previews that the graphism and overall aesthetics were really nice, and indeed they are, even more so than I thought. It is incredibly colorful, but what's truly amazing is how lively the world/realms feel: every bit of the platforms is detailed, part of the flora moves softly, and there are several little critters that come and go and react to your presence. From beginning to end, you evolve in charming and varied maps, full of life. \n     Also, the two main characters, Noodle the snake and Doodle the bird, are equally lively and colorful, especially Noodle: with a contagious smile by default, he reacts to finding items, to holding tight, to loosing balance or grip and to being lifted by Doodle. He also falls asleep if you don't make him move for a little while. On a side note, he has a pannel of four available expressions, but, personaly, I couldn't part with his basic smile. These two are easily some of the cutest characters I've seen in a game.\n\n[u] The gameplay [/u]\n\n     As you would expect considering the genre Snake Pass belongs to, you gather items in a series of levels in order to access the next one. Most of the items are what I would call collectibles, but to me exploring every corner to find them all is really a big part of the fun, otherwise the game looses in length and interest. \nThe true originality is that the whole gameplay evolves around playing and feeling like a snake, which Snake Pass does wonderfully. You must alternate left and right to make Noodle move forward efficiently (the better the faster), its slithery body is fast on even ground and in water, can turn in all manners to grab a structure or pull himself up (he can actually climb higher on his own than you'd think at first...)... \n     That's where the difficulty also comes from. Noodle won't hold onto something automatically, so you have to be constantly aware of what you're doing as soon as you're not just slithering on plain ground. This results in an almost constant play between physics and dexterity (the Unreal Engine does its job very well in this case, although probably not in the most realistic way, but I don't mind). In that regard, you also have to work with Doodle, who's always there to grab Noodle by the tail to help him compensate his weight depending on the situation. You will also need to make good use of the 360\u00b0 camera, not an easy feat as well. Be warned, these mechanics can be [b] incredibly difficult and frustrating [/b] to master/apply, and it drove me mad several times. You will have to go through quite a lot of trials and errors before you succeed. I was fine with it because I like challenges in games and I have a lot of patience, but I'd tend to say it's not for everyone. That said, difficulty is well balanced overall, with a good number of rather well placed checkpoints on each map, which also save whatever items you found prior to activating them.\n     To finish with, there are four realms to explore, each corresponding to one element. You start with earth (meaning jungle), then continue with water, fire and finally air. First level for each is an easy map, which allows for a rather peaceful discovery of the element, and for Doodle to brief you on new obstacles and mechanisms. Difficulty increases with each level but also with each realm, the fire and air ones being very hard. The latter adds its own mechanics to the gameplay. Each realm is quite unique, and never did I feel like I was doing twice the same level.  \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\n\n     Though there isn't much to say about the overall audio in Snake Pass, it's worth mentionning that just as for the visuals, a lot of care went to the sounds. Noodle's slithering and hissing, Doodle's wings flapping, the critters movements/reactions, the grass, the plants, the wind, the fire... All these also make for a lively environement that you take pleasure to evolve in.\n     The music is also lovely. Mostly soothing, there's one for each realm, evocking each element adequately. \n\n\n[h1] In short [/h1] \n\n[u] Pros [/u]\n- carefully crafted and light hearted indie platformer\n- lovely details and atmosphere\n- varied realms and overall game design\n- cute as hell characters\n- original gameplay; think and act like a snake\n- progressive difficulty\n- fun item hunting\n\n[u] Cons [/u]\n- frustrating at times, requires lots of patience through trial and error; I really liked it but definitely not for everyone.\n- interest and length rest on gathering all collectible items\n- minor audio bugs with moving platforms\n- don't even think about keyboard, you absolutely [i] need [/i] an Xbox controller to play (I actually bought my first one because of this game).", "timestamp_created": 1534013257, "timestamp_updated": 1534871993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44048424": {"recommendationid": "44048424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054184677", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1527626315}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute gimmicky game, fun.", "timestamp_created": 1533920140, "timestamp_updated": 1533920140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43957513": {"recommendationid": "43957513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010331142", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1535583161}, "language": "english", "review": "They should release airplane DLC and get Samuel L Jackson for voiceovers.", "timestamp_created": 1533521399, "timestamp_updated": 1533521399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43955168": {"recommendationid": "43955168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035476645", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1533504752}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing this game in itself was fun, the aesthetics we're pleasing, and the snake was controlled in a unique way I hadn't experienced before.

What we have here is a very unique game that demonstrates very creative/very skilled utilization of Unreal Engine 4. It may be to some people's surprise that Snake Pass is actually a very hardware-demanding game--this is primarily because of the fact that Noodle--the protagonist snake you control--has a body comprised of highly reactive, fine-tuned geometry that entirely obeys the laws of physics inside the game's engine; from head to tail, the snake is wholely reactive to every surface and object it contacts in a realistic manner. In addition to this, varying friction upon different surfaces, reactive water, caustic lighting effects, and reactive foliage (grass) all will give your computer's hardware a run for its money. Considering these demanding hurdles, the port for PC is very well done.\n\nThe art style featured in Snake Pass offers a vivacious palette of colors, and appears in a cartoon-esque fashion. The visual effects of much of the environment look very good, like the reactivity on the surface of bodies of water that pertains to the movement and forces of Noodle. Also, the way the bamboo has a reflective sheen to it, and how bodies of water produce a caustic effect and showcase light refraction are great examples of this game's pleasing eye candy that truly shows how much effort went into the display of the game's image.\n\nThe control scheme for Snake Pass was constructed in a clever way for the player (I STRONGLY recommend using a gamepad controller). Although it might not seem like it at the beginning and the first few hours may be a bit frustrating, so long as you are patient and make a genuine effort, you will likely become significantly more efficient and skillful in controlling Noodle. Wrapping the snake's body around objects, coiling, and gripping are crucial maneuvers for Snake Pass, which the game will gradually teach you.\n\nThe soundtrack of Snake Pass is phenomenal. David Wise--who composed the widely renowned and critically acclaimed Stickerbrush Symphony track for Nintendo--is responsible for Snake Pass's music as well. The music of the game accomplishes an exceptional combination of tones during your slithering exploration. The tracks create a sense of relaxation, but at the same time, they also deliver the feeling of a mission that needs completing. The game's music makes use of a very unique blend of string, air, soft percussion instruments, and even a xylophone. In my opinion, the music is not only fantastic-sounding in a right of its own, but it suits the style, feel, and setting of the game impeccably. The music in Snake Pass breathes effervescent life into its atmosphere.\n\nSnake Pass will offer you a remarkable visual experience, a bubbly, enthusiastic soundtrack, an extraordinarily unique take on 3D platforming, and controls that are more than aptly suited for the gameplay (and will require some learning).\n\nTL;DR\n- A wonderful and imaginative 3D platforming game\n- Impressively polished 3D visual assets and visual effects\n- Marvelous soundtrack composed by David Wise (composer of Stickerbrush Symphony)\n- A commendable, well-optimized port for PC\n- Excellent work, Sumo Digital\n\nUPDATE (11/21/18): I nominated this game for the \"Best Envrionment\" Award for the 2018 Steam Awards because the atmosphere that the developers created for this game is unique, serene, and deserves recognition.", "timestamp_created": 1530137810, "timestamp_updated": 1542864122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686462223529815674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43095683": {"recommendationid": "43095683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081860215", "num_games_owned": 1580, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1530084318}, "language": "english", "review": "This was disappointing.

It has a physical presence in the world, so it collides with and is pushed around by level geometry.

Which is weird since you play a snake in it. But unlike other games that have you press a contextual button when it flashes up on screen, or at best give you a challenge that can be easily beat once you have the timing down, Snake Pass recreated that sweaty-palm feeling of \u201cCan I reach that next ledge?\u201d and the subsequent breathless moment when you let go and hope you can reach it and hold on. \n\nIt takes some getting used to, but the controls are very well done and fluid. The game recommends a controller and I\u2019ll second that recommendation. You control the snake\u2019s head with left stick and A button, then move the body forward with the left Trigger. To move, you need to slither back and forth like a snake and to climb, you have to wrap yourself around poles and other objects, then stretch out to the next pole or ledge. It\u2019s extremely hard at times, but also a lot of fun and steamy satisfying to finally reach the gold coin that you spent 10 minutes trying to get.\n\nAt 9 hours, I\u2019m about 2/3rds through the game, but probably won\u2019t make it much farther. Like I said, the game is frustrating at times, and the save system doesn\u2019t help. You can\u2019t save and quit in a level without losing all your progress, which means you have to dedicate yourself to seeing a level all the way through before sitting down. The levels themselves aren\u2019t that hard; the biggest and most punishing challenges are the 5 gold coins in each level, which are purely optional. Still, it\u2019s hard to commit to finishing a level and dying repeatedly in the attempt when all I want to do is unwind for a few minutes. \n\nMid-level save points are occasionally frustrating too. I get why the game doesn\u2019t count the coins and water bubbles you pick up after you die, otherwise you could just suicide jump for difficult coins and skip half the challenge of getting back safely. But the save spots are few and far between. Sometimes I\u2019ll see a coin in an impossible place, but haven\u2019t saved recently. Rather than risking my progress so far, I head forward to the next save spot, then backtrack to the coin. It breaks up the flow, and could have been fixed by just making any flat and \u201csafe\u201d terrain a save spot. \n\nEven though I didn\u2019t finish the game, it wasn\u2019t boredom or frustration that made me put it down.

This list is a mixed bag of one game I like, one game I dislike and one I haven\u2019t been able to play.  However Snake Pass is definitely a shining example of game design, and in fact great gameplay all over. \n\nSnake Pass clearly has its roots in the classic 3D platformers.  Its art style reminds me of Banjo Kazooie and Yooka Laylee instantly, but where I feel like Yooka Laylee didn\u2019t bring enough new to the table, Snake Pass may have brought too much new gameplay, and I\u2019m not actually angry about that. \n\nThe core of this game is a story about a Snake named Noodle and a Bird named Doodle, called Snake and Bird for the rest of this review, as the names are a bit silly and didn\u2019t make a strong impression on me.  They explore levels to find out why bad things are happening in the forest, and the truth of this is, I played the game two weeks ago and don\u2019t remember the story that much, though I do remember the story being weak.  In my notes, the only mention of the story is the fact the entire story is really told in the last cutscene and ends what could be a cliffhanger (an unnecessary one). \n\nOn the other hand, Snake and Bird are freaking adorable. While Bird is a good looking character, Snake is adorable, as you can see here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1322964944\n\nThe player is given the four d-pad directions to change his face similar to how Little Big Planet does it.  While Snake faces away from the camera for most of the game, I can\u2019t help but enjoy how great the facial animations are.  The characters are great looking and the levels are gorgeous.\n\nHowever there is no voice acting and while most of the game doesn\u2019t require it, the small cutscenes there are use a noise generation similar to Banjo Kazooie, and it works, but it\u2019s just a touch annoying, though used far less than Yooka Laylee.\n\nNow we get to the gameplay and this is where Snake Pass shines.  Snake Pass has the player play the Snake and slither around.  Instead of moving in a specific direction, the player is able to move faster by shifting back and forth, it\u2019s a bit of the defining feature of the game.  Some people hate the repetition and some people love the feeling, and while in the first level or two I found it a bit annoying, I got used to the motion and I adore the unique feeling of traversing the levels.  I felt like a snake, and I realized that\u2019s not a character type that I typically have played in a game.  This game feels fresh to me. \n\nSince you\u2019re a Snake you\u2019re forced to think like one.  You don\u2019t have a normal jump, but you are able to slither up poles and objects, going from one limb to another and curling your long body around them to rise up and climb.  From there you can extend yourself out and reach other objects, slither along beams, or grab onto rotating platforms.  Each is required to beat the game and each one works quite well once you get a handle on it. \n\nI find it hard to really compare this to another game.  This isn\u2019t Yooka Laylee which is like Banjo Kazooie.  It is a really unique system where the goal is to support your body as you reach out to your next objective, whether it be a platform or a collectible (more on those in a bit).  You\u2019re able to grip whatever you are curled upon and then arch your body over to the next target.\n\nThe maneuverability of the snake is absolutely fantastic.  I love that reach, and the feeling that sometimes I just needed an extra inch, which would require me to arch out an extra inch and lose the valuable grip, that required me to make a last-ditch effort to make the move I wanted, it mostly worked.  A few times I felt like I was cheesing the system by getting just my head up the wall and then somehow gimmicking my body back on solid ground. \n\nThen again other times I felt the system \u201cbroke\u201d in just the right way.  The player isn\u2019t able to jump, he\u2019s only able to raise his head, however, there were places which required the snake to reach out and make the right move or curl up on a specific object I didn\u2019t care to try.  So I tried to fling myself off one end of a log and was able to almost throw myself to the next object.  This is a bit of a rare occurrence but the fact is the snake almost jumped in the air and I was able to make these great awkward leaps work.  I\u2019m sure speed runners will use them to great effect but just playing it myself I loved the feeling of the motion. \n\nOf course, there was a reason I had to jump, there are a number of manners of \u201cdeath\u201d in the game, and they\u2019re all about the same, whether it be a never ending pit that surrounds islands, spikes, lava or being crushed, the adventure is never without peril.  While the danger rises sharply for the second half of the adventure, the snake never seems to be completely outmatched and almost every death feels like a failure of the player rather than a cheap unavoidable death.  There are checkpoints and the checkpoints are able to be hit multiple times in a row, so collecting an object and then returning to safety allows the player to grab a checkpoint again to save the progress made as a nice touch. \n\nI mentioned collectibles before, they are quite a task for players to tackle.  Each level requires three objects the player has to grab to exit a level.  There are also twenty bubbles and five gold coins per level.  The bubbles and coins are the main collectibles with the bubbles mostly being on the main path most of the time and the coins usually requiring some extra work.\n\nPlayers can spend a lot of time to find them and I collected them all for the first five levels, but then gave up as I heard there is an item after you beat the game that makes it far easier to find all the collectibles, and it does.  Sadly it also requires you to replay all the levels which are fun, but I feel lacks some of the novelty of the first playthrough.\n\nThe grip in the game is a special annoyance for me, half the time it feels like it doesn\u2019t work at all, that I slip a little too much, and half the time, I feel like I\u2019m stuck fast to the object I\u2019m curled around.  Part of it is that it seems to only increase your coefficient of friction, so the more you\u2019re coiled the better it is, but if you need an extra inch or two, it\u2019s hard to get that without losing all your grip.  This is the real challenge of the game, and you have to learn how to deal with grip versus slip.  I just wish it was a little more consistent or at least had a gauge so I knew how much grip I could have.\n\nThere are fifteen levels in the game, and the first 8 levels are pretty easy, but the last half and especially the last four levels are real beasts where all of these features come in to challenge the player.  But it\u2019s a challenge I enjoyed because it took all the skills I had gained in the game and had to combine them to conquer the last few levels.  For those levels, I felt that I actually accomplished something grand when I beat a level.\n\nUltimately, I like Snake Pass.  I think the game design is something special.  It hasn\u2019t perfected the movement but it\u2019s unique enough for me to take notice.  The music, which is not something I normally talk about, was bright and cheery in all the right ways.  Thank you, David Wise, the famous composer of almost everything Donkey Kong and a ton more.\n\nSo yes I recommend Snake Pass, it\u2019s a great game and really charming.  You will have to get used to being a snake, but once you have mastered the feel, the entire game feels really novel and special.  Moving from object to object is fluid and there is just something about this game that makes me smile just from the style alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review or want to see what other games I enjoyed you can find my curator page at this link. http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/ Give me a follow.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1523568716, "timestamp_updated": 1523568716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681496024131774902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41411443": {"recommendationid": "41411443", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998404426", "num_games_owned": 858, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 664, "last_played": 1523427196}, "language": "english", "review": "SNAKE PASS\n\nGame Difficulty: 3/10\nStory Completion: 7-10 hours\nStory Rating: 2/10*\nGameplay Rating: 9/10\nSoundtrack: 8/10\nAchievement Difficulty: 4/10\nEstimated 100% Time: 10-15 hours\nReccomended Play Experience: Play through each level twice (or once if possible) before moving onto the next: One time without dying and another for getting all the collectibles.\nOverall Rating: 8/10\nOverall Impression: A unique and charming take on the stagnant platforming genre. Simple and well designed levels with a focus on fun gameplay above all else. If you like any kind of platformers but have gotten bored with playing the same ones absolutely give this a go.\n\nSTORY\n-------\nYou play as Noodle (the Snake) and Doodle (his Hummigbird companion). One day, Doodle sets upon a disaster. The keystones that allow animals to travel throughout the world using portals have all been scattered around by something! As Noodle you have to traverse his home, finding and placing the keystones back into the portals and find out why the keystones have all been left lying around!\n\n*Note that I didn't factor the story into the review score. The story is nothing more than a reason to go forward. Most of the game the story is forgotten and it's nothing more than a filler.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n----------\nPlaying as a snake obviously means you can't jump, so then how exactly do you play a game as a snake? Using a controller i'll give a rundown of the controls:\n\nLeft Stick: Look\nRight Stick: Camera\nRight Trigger: Go Forward\nA: Raise Head (Go up in water, X is to dive down)\nLT: Grip\nY: Use Doodle To Lift Tail\n\nHolding RT moves you in the direction your head is facing (controlled with LS). However moving in a straight line is VERY slow. In order to move faster you have to move the LS left and right while moving to \"slither\", gradually building speed. Raising your head is used to climb up platforms or as a a way to try and get your head over a pole to coil around. Raising your head and moving forward are generally how you get past every obstacle in the game. \n\nEach level has 3 kinds of collectibles: 3 Keystones, 20 Wisps and 5 Coins. You need to collect the 3 keystones to go to the next level. The 20 Wisps are a standard collectible, scattered throughout the level in either obvious or not super obvious places. The coins are the hard to find collectible in each level and generally are more difficult to get too. These 2 types have no impact on anything other than completion rating.\n\nSnake Pass is very slow paced compared to every other platformer. There are a total of 15 levels, each of them relatively small in comparison to other platformers to make up for general slow movement speed. Each world (4 worlds) will introduce a new gameplay mechanic or obstacle to you. The game does a good job of letting you adapt to it's obstacles before moving you on.\n\nThis game also has an Arcade Mode and Time Trial. Time Trial has you complete each level within a set time limit while Arcade Mode has you eating different kinds of fruit in a level to build up a big score.\n\nDESIGN\n------\nSnake Pass design is outstanding. Noodle is silent but he has more character in him and his expressions than 90% of other main characters in any kind of game do. Doodle is a bit more talkative and is the one to point out things in the levels, always anxious and worrysome. The levels are gorgeous and most of them are really well designed, usually being an open area where you have the freedom to get whatever keystone you want. The soundtrack is great, with each world having its own \"theme\", such as the lava world having deep bongo themes or the cloud world sounding relatively angelic and peaceful.\n\nPROBLEMS\n----------\n- The camera can be a total disaster for alot of obstacles. While you control it with the RS, getting into slightly tight areas or against walls will move the camera into obnoxious positions making obstacles far harder than they should be.\n- Every cutscene is unskippable making replaying the levels that have cutscenes kind of tedious especially if you have to play them quite a bit.\n- Standing on a high ledge or platform overlooking the rest of the level, most of the surrounding areas will be very blurry (by design). This makes looking for missed collectibles VERY difficult by doing what should be the obvious way of looking for them.\n- Continuing the game will always start the level select on the first level instead of your current progress.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n---------------\nSnake Pass achievements are great, especially varied and interesting. You'll get about 1/3 of them just by playing through the game, another 1/3 by 100%ing the game and the last 1/3 by doing a bunch of miscellanious stuff. The hardest achievement is probably to complete the game without dying but you if you just go through the levels getting the keystones most levels are easy and fast to complete without dying. I reccomend the following:\n\n1st Level Play: Focus on getting all the collectibles (3 keystones, 20 Wisps, 5 coins, Touching the Guardian Statue)\n2nd Level Play: Complete level without dying.\n\nPERSONAL THOUGHTS\n----------------------\n- I rarely ever used Grip. It didn't really do anything and I found it better to go through the obstacles fast then gripping and going slowly. As you get used to the game mechanics, certain obstacles will become super easy even if they look difficult.\n- In the same vain, I rarely ever used the Tail Lift apart from when I was barely hanging off a ledge and I need my tail weight lifted to try and climb up. Other than that I didn't see what purpose it had.\n- I liked how most levels were very open and easily memorizeable. Within 10 mins of playing a level I could memorize every area.\n- I think this game is designed to be played in short bursts, possibly doing 1-2 levels a day. It will absolutely wear you down if you try to complete it in one sitting.\n- The discrepancy of the collectibles is strange. I found that some of the wisps were far more difficult to find or collect than some of the coins were in the same level. Most coins sit behind ledges or off a ledge whereas Wisps can be anywhere.\n- I wish there were more unlockable skins for Noodle.\n- I found the final level frustrating and the opposite of what every other level before it was.\n- I'm thankful Arcade Mode and Time Trial have no achievements attached to them, they'd be very unecesarry.\n- Most of the tougher obstacles can be entirely circumvented by climbing the environment around the obstacle rather than doing the obstacle itself which may have lent to the fact as to why the game isn't super difficult.", "timestamp_created": 1523428662, "timestamp_updated": 1530095590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41409582": {"recommendationid": "41409582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010422279", "num_games_owned": 759, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1523416122}, "language": "english", "review": "Some of the most fun i've had learning how to play a game, just don't expect to be able to master the movement in 5 minutes.

Now, I'm gonna list only bad things in this game, and maybe even use explicit language out of frustration, so I guess look away if, I don't know, it offend your religion, or something. Keep in mind that despite all those things that needs to be said, it's a good game.\n\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\n\nThere's a snake and a hummingbird. Usually they are refered as such, but I think their names are like Noodle and Doodle, or some other poodle, I don't know. The problem is, they have no character. It could be something like Banjo and Kazooie, or Yooka and Leylee, if you're into disappointing Kickstarter games. But no, you get empty set of polygons that shoots a bunch of texts on screen.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThough I couldn't care less about the story, because all I wanted is to collect some things and slide on platforms, I wish the story made [i]some[/i] sense. The whole story is that 2 animals are chilling on a bamboo stick, and then oh no, gates are destroyed. What are those gates? Why there are only 2 animals in this world(that contains of a bunch of flying islands)?\n\n[h1]Hummingbird[/h1]\n\nGod is he useless. Normally, both companions are codependent. One can do something, second can do something else, but they mostly corelate together. In this game, there's a snake, that does 99% of the job. The hummingbird can lift your ass of the ground. It may feel like it is useful when you are on the edge trying to climb up, but I think most of the help comes from placebo making you think that you got on the ground using hummingbird's help. Oh yeah, it can also lift you up with those streams of air, but everything about that animations is scripted and they break all laws of physich possible(normally, hummingbird can barely lift your end, but with a help of some wind, it can toss you around across the map[hyperbole, but still]).\n\n[h1]Ending[/h1]\n\nEven though the ending is... is, I'm gonna put it inside the spoiler, because some people may find it a mood-damaging spoiler, so I respect that.\n\n[spoiler]The raven(I don't know the exact specie of that dark bird, and don't care enough to check) seemed like a mean villan, but it was just a rather friendly bird. I liked that \"plot twist\". But how he destroyed the portals, trying to go back to, whatever is he lives in? Why did he do that? If you need to go to ravenland using those 4 stoney things,\n why do some spirits owe them? What are they anyway Why do they give them to hummingbird, if snake collects all blue balls? CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING???[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Vibrations[/h1]\n\nI suppose if you use keyboard there's no problem(unless someone is rich and stupid enough to obtain vibrational keyboard), but if you're using gamepad, you can actually shove is up your ass(or your vagina), since it's vibrating non-stop. I understand that short vibrations are nice when you, perhaps lose some health or something. But this game doesn't understand that maybe if I want to have sex, but I am lonely, I'd rather use a dildo that Wireless Xbox 360 Controller\u00a9.\nYou start level? Get some long-ass vibrations(and at the end get a bit of those slower vibrations, because fuck you)! You've fallen from high ground? Get some vibrations, [b]EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO FALL DAMAGE[/b]? You've collected [u]anything[/u]? Fuck you, get some vibrations? That's not \"immersion\", that's being \"obnoxious\" and \"annoying\".  It feels like devs found a function for vibrations for Unreal Engine in StackOverflow, and apparently it was so hard they wanted to showcase everyone \"look guys, we can google and read!\".\n\n[h1]Cutscenes[/h1]\n\nIt has been said, please let us skip them or showcase them only once. Such a minor thing to do, but so annoying.\n\n[h1]Camera[/h1]\n\nIt's useless. You have to control it yourself, and it still gives you seizure when there's [u]any[/u] object between snake and the camera, because it will zoom so close you will lose the sense of position. Fortunately, you can control camera yourself. If you use gamepad, at least with default key bindings, you have to hold A button with your index finger, which can be unfomfortable, but doable.\nAlso, [b]is it really that fucking hard to write if(object_nearby_camera) object_nearby_camera.opacity = 0.1???? NO I DON'T WANT TO SEE A FUCKING LEAVES ZOOMED SO MUCH YOU COULD COUNT THE PIXELS WHEM I'M TRYING TO GET THAT COIN?[/b]\n\n[h1]Depth perception[/h1]\n\nActually, depth perception is not a problem, because THERE IS NONE. You have to guess, whether you're in line with an object.\n\n[h1]Progression[/h1]\n\nAs above, there's no progression. There are scripted snake tosses and later on you learn, you can grip to bamboo poles(although you could use it from the beginning). I wish there were some power-ups that let you go to parts of maps that you couldn't go previously or something.\n\n[h1]Level choosing UX[/h1]\n\nWhy can't it go to the last level available, instead of going to the first one? Browsing through levels is slow and it is annoing to browse up to your last leve every time you start the game. Also, there are 4 levels in chapter, but you can see only max 3. Why not four? And perhaps all the time? It would be way nicer and clear. And wouldn't be nice if there were like \"no deaths\" tokens that you get when you beat the level without dying, so it's nice when you're an achievment hunter? Why people can't thing of these things?\n\n[h1]15 levels[/h1]\n\nReally? Really? Every chapter has 4 levels, so why the air one has only 3? It would also nicely feel the void of lack of last level. Because you see, the \"last\" level is just like every other. It's not bad, but it feels like there's no ending. 16th level could be like a [b]metaphorical[/b] boss fight, or some other arena shit, so you still beat the lever how you've done so fat, but it feels different and refreshing.\n\n[h1]Saving when touching the stones[/h1] It saves progress when you die, but why it cant when you leave the game? Levels can be long, especially is you want to collect everything, and sometimes, you know. Life happenes. Ever heard of that?\n\nIt's all I can think of right now, as I said it is still a [b]GOOD[/b] game and I had fun playing that.", "timestamp_created": 1523286297, "timestamp_updated": 1523286308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41376812": {"recommendationid": "41376812", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998125061", "num_games_owned": 598, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 524, "last_played": 1586100476}, "language": "english", "review": "What a simple and fun concept. enjoyable level design, lots of lovley details and soothing music to match it all.

The game lacks any real purpose. Collecting the crystals has a purpose, but the orbs and coins? I can take it or leave it. No punishment, no purpose for (not) collecting them.\n\nThe story (or lack thereof) was frustrating/not encouraging. Right at the beginning a bird tells you that you need to open the gate or otherwise you will stuck in that place forever. Noodle (the snake/protagonist) seemed perfectly happy sleeping on his bamboo poles. The ending actually gave the game a meaning. If that message had come earlier I might have been more motivated to keep going.\n\nLast but not least, the camera. I can usually play around bad cameras. Heck, I didn't have any problems with Yooka-Laylee and people really complained there. I have never died as often because of the bad camera than in this game.\n\nI wouldn't mind a sequel, but please give me a purpose to play this game and collect the things that seem frustratingly far out of reach.

On the one hand, I absolutely love the game due to it's innovation, beautiful aesthetic and really enjoyable platforming. On the other, I can't stand the absolutely terrible camera and how the snake's head doesn't go where you tell it to 50% of the time. I think this is because the direction the head moves in is tied to the camera so sometimes when you're switching your camera around to get a better look at a particular route, the head ends up going in a different direction than you intended which causes you to unwravel and fall to your death - or less dramatically just to the bottom of the the thing you're trying to climb - way too often.\n\nOverall I really do love this game and I'm glad I bought it but wow would it ever be nice if the devs tweaked the controls a bit more, and while they're at it, maybe they could write another track or two for the music.

The game is unique amongst platformers in that you do not jump over gaps or obstacles. Instead, as a snake, you must slither and coil around bamboo, lots of them! and get around these obtsacles.\n\n\n[b] The Good [/b]\nGraphically, this game looks absolutely gorgeous. It uses only a simple cartoony style, but it is done with many of the beautiful effects of Unreal 4. The lighting, the shadows, the particle effects, the reflections, the water are all beautiful. Not only that but the animations too are just nice to look at. Noodle's facial expression visibly changes depending if he is happy or scared and there's even a button to manually change his expression!\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it is a fairly simple collect-a-thon platformer, with the twist being you cannot jump or do anything typical platformers do. Instead, each level is designed with your sepentine form in mind. You must coil around obstacles to climb, hang on to, and get across gaps. Because of this unique movement, the game's controls are also unique. Instead of a typical moving forwards, back, left or right and jump, you have an accelerate button, a button to raise Noodle's head, and controls to change the direction his head is facing. It is here were I warn any non-controller players: I do not recommend playing this game without a controller. Having free 360 movement with an analogue stick and the ability to control your how quickly you accelerate with analogue triggers helps a lot in later levels. The controls are very weird at first, and you might struggle a bit in the beginning, but after beating the first world, which is basically a tutorial world, you should have a good enough understanding of how movement works. Everything sort of clicks in once you understand the physics of them. There's great joy to be had in slithering around, wrapping around different objects to get to the top of that complicated bamboo structure.\n\nAs a collect-a-thon, you have to run... I mean slither, around the entire map, looking around every corner and find every collectable, which is usually placed at some obstacle or simple puzzle. You technically don't have to look for everything as you only need to collect three keys to progress to the next level, but then, you'd be missing out on a large portion of the game. Some of these, collectables, like the coins are much more difficult to obtain and placed on far more difficult obstacles. However, with skill and some patience, you can get through.\n\nI have seen some people call this game \"darksouls of platformers\". I can say, is, except for the last two levels. Most of the game is not that hard once you grasp the controls. I'd rank the game about as difficult as a typical 3D Mario game, with the last two being on par with Mario secret levels, like the star world from Super Mario World which if you were a kid in the 90s, you know that world was bs.  That said, if you play with a mouse and keyboard then maybe.... Seriously, don't torture yourself. Use a controller.\n\n\n[b] The Bad [/b]\n\nThe camera is bad. Very bad. It works okay in an open space. The problem is it gets shoved forwards and zooms in at even uneven ground or really short fences. It's especially terrible in small confined spaces and areas where theres a \"window\" and pillars supporting the roof. That means if you are looking at Noodle directly, the camera is fine. But when you rotate it and Noodle starts getting obscured by the \"pillar\", the camera gets shoved into Noodle's body. This is especially annoying when platforming in small confined areas, and also the camera can get \"pushed\" by walls and even obscured by decoration. Developers should have taken the 3D Mario approach to camera in confined spaces; that is to make the camera stay the same distance when the camera gets obscured by \"pillars\" and show Noodle's sillhouette. Having the camera gets shoved forward and back due to some pillar or wall is disorienting and annoying and has caused a few deaths too. \n\nBesides that, the only other thing that's bad about this game is that it is short. There are only 15 levels. It's short and you could probably beat it in a weekend if you just run right through and ignore some of the more difficult collectables. Thus, the game is about 10 hours long to 100% on your first try, you could shave a couple hours off if you go for a lower percent.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\n\nIt's a great game. Worth buying if you like a unique platforming experience. It is on the short side and just be prepared to learn the control scheme. I do not recommend if you do not have a controller.\n\nGraphics - A\nSound - B+\nGameplay - A-\nDifficulty - [strike] BabyMode | Easy |[/strike] [b] Normal [/b] [strike] | Hard | Frustrating[/strike]\nLength - 8-10 hours\n\nOverall - A- \n(Not an average)", "timestamp_created": 1522680985, "timestamp_updated": 1522681047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195110321044922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41216986": {"recommendationid": "41216986", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981557797", "num_games_owned": 5031, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1522627023}, "language": "english", "review": "The controls for this game drive me insane, since it feels like maneuvering the snake is more luck than skill.

I love the concept. The controls are great and very fun to learn. They become surprisingly intuitive very quickly. After that, the game is entirely about figuring out the best path to get your body where you want it to go.

Granted, you absolutely can throw yourself at the various bamboo pipes and wriggle around until you save yourself or fall off, if you'd rather try to go fast.\n\nDying isn't much of a setback, anyway. I found the checkpoints to be more than enough to keep me from getting frustrated. I don't recall a single point where I had to redo more than, say, 5 minutes of lost progress. Every time I saw my snake slowly, helplessly slip off a pipe, the drawn out \"nooooo\"s I uttered and then laughed at myself for saying completely made up for any frustration I had.\n\nGetting most of the bubbles and coins is proving to be very satisfying, since the fun of the game comes entirely from the challenging platforming.

It's a control scheme that initially intimidates but is easily grasped and a pleasure to become competent at. Back this with a jaunty and pleasing soundtrack, a cheery disposition, and a quick-fire level progression, Snake Pass is slight but entertaining dalliance. But dalliance it remains, as Snake Pass suffers from a dearth of gameplay diversity; the manner in which you play the first level is the manner in which you play all levels. Coupled with this simplicity and absence of content, Snake Pass also suffers from a frantic, frenetic camera, which frequently switches position frequently enough, and in the most precarious moments, that you'll constantly be swearing at the most friendly and jovial platformer you've probably ever played. The troublesome camera is a serious grievance, as it greatly sours the experience of the later game, which requires greater finesse and control.     \n\nAs annoying as the camera can frequently be, and acknowledging the lack of diversity within the game, I find myself still adamantly recommending Snake Pass.

It\u2019s one of the most truly original games I have played in a long time.\nIn Snake Pass you control a snake named Noodle. Being a snake, Noodle controls quite unlike any character in any other game.  You can\u2019t simply hold down a direction to move, you have move from side to side to slither like a snake would. Noodle also can\u2019t jump, so to get to higher platforms you need to find something to coil around to climb up. \nDespite being tagged as a puzzle-platformer, this isn\u2019t really a \u201cpuzzle\u201d game in the traditional sense. There is really only one puzzle, namely figuring out how to control Noodle. The controls take a little while to get used to but mastering them is very rewarding. With a bit of practice, you will be breezing through sections that seemed impossible at first.\nThere is also an easy control mode if you want. I advise against using it since mastering the controls is a large part of what makes the game fun, but the option is there if you need it.\nI played with a controller. According to the creator, this is how the game was designed to be played. I did try the mouse and keyboard controls before writing this review just to test them out. I found them to be functional, but the controller feels much more natural and I recommend a controller if you have one. \nContrary to what some other reviews stated, I though the checkpoints were generously placed. And although some of the optional collectibles seem difficult to reach, but there was only one that took me more than a few attempts to collect.\nThat said, there are several valid complaints.\nIt is a little short. If you just collect the required items, you can rush through the whole thing in only a few hours, depending on how quickly you master the controls. There are optional collectables \u2013 20 \u201cwisps\u201d and 5 coins in every level, but even 100%ing the game can be done in less than 10 hours, again depending on how quickly you master the controls.\nThe camera sometimes freaks out in certain areas, especially in confined spaces. This can cause Noodle to move in unexpected ways and occasionally this results in a cheap death.

It sounds weird and it's as fun to learn as it is to do the objectives.\n\nThe best part about this game is that even though it's frustrating by design (being a puzzle platformer and all) the amazing music from the guy who did Donkey Kong Country keeps your head cool throughout the game. The next best thing is that you'll find even though you're moving through the game at a snail's pace it's fun as hell. The controls are difficult for sure but when you finally master them it's kind of creepy to see how snake-like you move even when you're just traversing flat surfaces. Most of the time the game gives you adequate time to plan your approaches and work your way up with strategy.\n\nAnother thing I love about this game is the graphics. They're as beautiful as Yooka-Laylee's with bright, colorful environments that pop out of the screen and make it very easy to see where you can and can't go. Every level has its own flavor and unique style. This is how I want all my platformers to look as it reminds me of the old adventure games.\n\nBut it's not perfect.\n\nA lot of the puzzles rely on camera movement to find secrets or see where to go next. Camera movement is very smooth, and this game would unplayable if it wasn't. But it still felt like the camera was the final boss for me. Underwater it's complete garbage and you'll find that 60% of the time there are plants in your face, 30% of the time it will be forcing itself above the water that you're exploring and the last 10% it will look somewhere useful. Fortunately there aren't many water sections and none of them are challenging, purely for exploration. Above water the camera still suffers a little, Rather than making objects between you and the camera transparent, it will rapidly zoom in and become useless. Since you HAVE to move the camera to find secrets that are hidden off the edges of platforms or behind objects this will happen repeatedly in every level, though it doesn't disturb gameplay until you get to the point where there are lots of moving objects.\n\nSpeaking of moving objects, the last part of the game is not just frustrating, it feels downright lazy. You'll quickly realize that \"wind\" and moving objects are not actually that, they're really just zones where your snake has no friction. Enjoy your garbage ice level posing as a wind level - any time something moves or blows near you you'll suddenly have Looney Toon Wiley Coyote physics where you're stationary in the air for a moment before falling to your death. In a game where you don't have enough fingers to move the camera and move your character simultaneously, these final couple of zones are cheap and boring. Early game you can take your time and plan your movement. But I actually found that flinging my snake at objectives and hoping he landed in a place where I could recover from was far better than climbing across pseudo-ice poles with strategy. An unfortunate end to what was otherwise a very enjoyable game.\n\nOverall it was really fun but super short. If you don't play it then get the SOUNDTRACK because it's a classic that I'll keep going back to when I want to hear game music.\n\nAlso no skippable corporate intro/cutscenes/credits? What is this a D-tier PS1 game? Get out of here with that bullsh*t.\n\nOh one more thing - the little bird is a dirty traitor. For every 1 time he saved me he's dunked me into a pit 3 times.

But the collecting aspect is one I just flat out avoided later on through the game, as the golden coins would get to difficult to collect without spending a huge amount of time getting it and to a save point to not lose your progress, so I eventually just gave up before even finishing the first stage (5 levels) and decided I would just enjoy the game and not focus on collecting every little thing.\n\nAnd it greatly increased the fun aspect of the game for me so I would recommend others to do this as well as getting 100% in this game would require you to gather all the collectibles, finish the game without dying once!!! And doing a few other objectives.

At least its graphics are sssstupendous.\n\nAll its flaws work together to antagonize the player as much as a possible. You have a checkpoint system where falling to your doom means losing progress. In other kinds of platformers, you'd have the solution down and be able to repeat your steps and get right back to business. Here, you're always wrestling with the controls which makes any reattempts not go as quick as you might think despite knowing what to do. Noodle\u2019s head will sometimes suddenly start unraveling your coil around a bamboo in the opposite direction if his head doesn\u2019t wrap around in the way the game wants (nose hitting the bamboo at just the right angle to split off into the unintended direction).\n\nIn addition to having all your fingers busy to control Noodle, sometimes the camera will decide to work against you. The only way to fight back is to set it straight with your thumb using the right stick. This action can interrupt your platforming or slow down traversal until you adjust the camera so that you\u2019re not looking at the floor of an upper level or a wall or having a bird\u2019s eye view. It\u2019s a frequently occurring issue.\n\nI don't even want to explore the levels. To save myself time from lost progress, I'd have to slither back to a checkpoint to gather those golden coins which are usually place in precarious locations around the level. Sometimes the little balls of water will be dangerous to reach too. Anyway, going back to activate a checkpoint to save in-between coin attempts is tedious and ironically also wastes time. I\u2019m wasting my time, especially when after falling off a high platform, it takes another good minute to return to that spot by normal means. Or maybe they wanted to encourage jumping off to respawn quicker which I\u2019ve done when no collectibles were at stake. I also skipped most of the collectibles that weren\u2019t mandatory the more I played. \n\nStill, it\u2019s a beautiful game and tried something different. I can at least give a nod to what they were trying to do. You can occasionally feel well-accomplished too after navigating a difficult environment successfully, but those moments are too few and far between.\n\nYou cannot depend on Snake Pass to provide an enjoyable experience. I can imagine some people digging its control scheme in the same way others can enjoy Surgeon Simulator, I Am Bread, or Getting Over It.

I should take a break and calm down.\"\n\nThe game will inform you, \"If you quit, you will lose all your progress!\" It really means this.

This is unintuitive at first, but is necessary for overcoming the various challenges in the game. You have the ability to lift your head (gravity will lower it on its own, though there is a dedicated dive button for the obligatory water sections), grip more tightly to what you\u2019re clinging to (slowing your movement speed and helping you slither more tightly around the many thin poles strewing the levels), and the ability to have your hummingbird companion lift your tail when it is dangling off inconveniently into space. Being a snake, rather than moving in a straight line on the ground (or in the water), you instead move at the highest rate of speed by slithering your head back and forth.\n\nDespite the novel control scheme, the game itself is pretty straightforward \u2013 it starts out simple in terms of obstacles, but then adds increasingly more complex and dangerous obstacles along the way, ranging from switches and moving platforms to blowing wind and ever more difficult to slither around platforming sections. There are no living enemies in any of the levels; it is only the environment, and the many bottomless pits, pits of coal, and spikes that can \u201ckill\u201d you. However, death is only a minor setback, putting you back at the last checkpoint, which you can manually run over to re-activate \u2013 a handy thing, considering that collectibles grabbed since the last checkpoint go away, to prevent kamikaze runs on collectibles \u2013 you have to collect that coin hanging way out in empty air and *survive* to keep it.\n\nThe primary objective in each level is to collect three colored crystals, which unlock the gate, each of which is located in some prominent but hard-to-reach location, with a convenient colored skybeam indicating what direction you\u2019re supposed to go in. There are also secondary collectibles in each level, in the form of 20 blue orbs (mostly in pretty obvious locations) and 5 much more hidden coins (which are sometimes hard to see, and other times simply very hard to get to safely). Navigating the levels is the lowest level of challenge, with collecting all the collectibles the thing that will really tax your skills.\n\n\n\nIt isn\u2019t a terribly long game \u2013 15 levels in all, with the whole game taking perhaps six hours to beat, or twice that to 100% the game. The core gameplay isn\u2019t hugely difficult at first, but it ramps up over time, with the final level being much, much harder than the first. However, because you are learning the control scheme early on, the early parts will seem harder than they actually are, while the later levels, despite their added difficulty, won\u2019t feel too bad. The biggest hump in the game is mastering the control scheme \u2013 once you understand how to control Noodle, the game becomes much less frustrating, and is much more of a set up for some fairly unique 3D platforming.\n\nAesthetically, this game reminds me very heavily of the N64 era \u2013 while the graphics are much higher fidelity, the characters are cute animals and the levels have music reminiscent of that era. While the background music was passable, it wasn\u2019t anything particularly memorable, and I\u2019d say that about the aesthetics in general \u2013 it feels like many other games Rare made, even though it wasn\u2019t made by Rare. The game\u2019s levels are split up by a level select screen rather than a hubworld, which gives the game a slightly barebones feel \u2013 something reinforced by the very bare bones story, which is essentially nonexistent and anticlimactic. But let\u2019s face it \u2013 your real goal in this game is to collect the shinies, not to care about the plot.\n\nThis is not a game for everyone. But it is a game for people who are interested in 3D platformers, but who would like to see something very different out of one of them. This is a very unique game, and the control scheme is likely unlike anything you\u2019ve ever played before. As such, I\u2019d say this is worth playing if you\u2019re into 3D platformer games, but it isn\u2019t really something that people who aren\u2019t already into that genre are likely to appreciate.\n", "timestamp_created": 1518503203, "timestamp_updated": 1518503203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557093441486358643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40021614": {"recommendationid": "40021614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087802045", "num_games_owned": 493, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 707, "last_played": 1660767293}, "language": "english", "review": "Snake Pass is a wonderful game, though obviously not for everybody.

I've already dabbled in time trial mode a fair bit, it is surprisingly enjoyable and since the game is not immensely well known I've already managed some top 50 ranks. I anticipate that I'll put another ten hours into gathering the remaining collectibles and getting reasonable times on all stages in time trial.\n\n [h1] The Good [/h1] \nGameplay is first in snake pass and it is where the game shines most. I feel it is enjoyable in a similar way that super meat boy or mirror's edge (or maybe ori and the blind forest) might be enjoyable. All the control options are available from the start and the game only teaches you how to use them as you go along. The game starts you off with a body that gets in your way all the time and even moving on flat floor is not trivial, not to speak of climbing. At the end of the game you are a snake deity that is more flying than wiggling through the stages, and all the difference is just learning the controls. Initially you learn how to curl around objects and slowly move from branch to branch, and for a long time there is usually a slow and safe way to go through obstacles. But there is always a fast and unsafe option as well and eventually you will need to learn how to do that too. This is what made the game so much fun for me, because after some initial struggle this is actually easier than expected and it's just so much fun. There is a steep learning curve at the start which might be frustrating, but after that you realize that the game isn't actually that hard. Gathering all the collectibles adds a lot to the challenge, so players can choose their difficulty level.\n\nAs you can guess from the above, this is a game of skill, it is not a game of strategy or puzzle and there is also no story, though it does have a lot of atmosphere. The characters are super cute and the levels are bright and bubbly and atmospheric. It feels polished and the whole design is just so sweet and happy. \n\nThis is where the positive part ends and I'll adress a couple negative points that I feel need to be pointed out. All in all I really enjoyed the game and most of the following classifies as minor and did not make me enjoy the game less.\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\nMost importantly the price is just plain too high and there should be a free demo. I didn't buy it on sale because when I saw the right videos of it I felt I really needed to play it right then. And it worked and I enjoyed it as much as I anticipated and for me the price is justified. But still I feel that it doesn't offer enough content to justify the price, because not everyone will get as much out of time trial as I do nor gather even half the available collectibles. More importantly though, I'm hesitant to recommend this to people who are not experienced with platformers or speedrunning in some way because it might be either very enjoyable or very frustrating depending on how quickly people pick up the game. And I wouldn't want to make anyone spend 20\u20ac on a game which they end up hating after three hours. A free demo of the first chapter would really help.\n\nThe second issue is the camera, which caused a fair share of my deaths because the game is brutal if you see it at a bad angle. The camera is almost completely manually controlled so I strongly recommend finding a setup where you can adjust the camera constantly while you are moving through even intense sections. I found playing it with a controller with two sticks and all relevant buttons bound to the shoulder buttons made the game a lot more enjoyable. An issue here is that the game does not allow rebinding keys which it really should, so I had to use an external software to rebind keys instead. The keyboard and mouse controls are better for controlling the camera and when I tried them for half an hour there weren't any terrible issues compared to the controller, except that I was not used to them. They might make it harder to pick up the controls initially, I can't comment on that.\n\nCheckpoints in my opinion were generally available a tiny bit after when I felt I wanted one, which is how it should be because it keeps things interesting. However in a few key sections checkpoints were really scarce, this happens especially in a some areas that also have a bump in difficulty. I never struggled with a section for more than a few minutes but I did pick up the controls fairly quickly and this might make the game really frustrating if you don't. It did affect my gameplay sometimes in that I would rush forward to a checkpoint and then come back for a collectible; I feel this is how it should be in a way, because it makes the experience matter just a bit more. A thing to note here is that in many sections the game will allow players to pick the difficulty through the choice of which collectibles they will get. Skipping a few collectibles made the game more managable and when you come back later you get to breeze through these levels that you were struggling with, which I found very rewarding.\n\nLastly, the game contains unskippable cutscenes, which is just unnecessary. Plus after you collect everything there is in the stage the game will still offer you the classic mode first instead of having time trial as a default. These are just nuisances but they shouldn't be there.\n\nTo sum up, if you're into platformers or you have some patience with games then this will be very enjoyable. The bright atmosphere is a nice bonus. I think it's important that game developers produce genre-breaking games occasionally and this one really nails it for me.", "timestamp_created": 1517931189, "timestamp_updated": 1517931284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39886265": {"recommendationid": "39886265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024924385", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1517919728}, "language": "english", "review": "absolutely no steam controller support, if I didnt get game via bundle I would refund in an instant.\ncannot recomment at all.\n\ngame set up to use controller ... asks to press enter and numbers ... priceless", "timestamp_created": 1517919903, "timestamp_updated": 1517919903, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39882772": {"recommendationid": "39882772", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994309228", "num_games_owned": 3993, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1517901758}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a lot going for it.  I think the core gameplay of this game is fun.  It's gorgeous.  It's cute.  I don't even mind the controls playing with the keyboard and mouse.  But I do mind a lot of quality of life stuff that's just missing.  It's gone.  It's just not there.  After thinking about it, it honestly feelsjust so weird that it seems like they put a lot of time into inventing puzzles and making it gorgeous, and then didn't care about everything else.\n\nNavigating menus is a chore.  You have to use the keyboard to navigate anything.  To choose a level it starts you at the first level every time and you have to manually move through the worlds one level at a time until you get to the level you're on.  Cutscenes are unskippable and play every time you play a level, which wouldn't be a problem if half the game wasn't gathering up collectibles.  They don't play in time attack, but that has to be unlocked so if you want to get all the collectibles as you go you have to get it on your first shot or deal with the cutscenes.\n\nYou can use the bird to hold your tail up to help keep you in certain positions but on gathering the collectibles needed to advance or putting them on their pedestals the bird will just drop you which can lose you progress just so the game can play an animation of the bird.  You can then have him pick you back up, so it isn't even a design choice.  It's literally just to play the animation.\n\nCertain achievements you get by doing specific things on specific levels are bugged and require going back to the main menu to restart, even though there's a restart button.  Trying to replay a level after you've completed it to get more collectibles resets all the collectibles you got on that playthrough, meaning you not only need to collect the ones you missed but also the ones you obtained.  The restart button does restart the game, but it forgets your progress unless its detrimental to you.  Which means going through the menus, which again, is a chore.  This game shines when it lets you play but so much of this game seems to just want you to not play.\n\nThis is a fun game.  It really is.  But after three and a half hours, I just can't get over these problems.  They keep shoving themself in my face over and over.  There's not a level that's gone by where SOMETHING hasn't come up and just sucked me out of whatever fun I was having  If the menus were just bad that would be fine, but they keep making me go back to it.

And yet nobody shed a tear about the fact that bird craps out stones twice as big as itself like it's as small as kidney stone. For the cause. Now that's real sacrifice.\n\nGraphics in this game are wonderful, although it lacks some optimisation and FPS can sometimes sink (although with Unreal Engine 4, that feels like a given). Greatest part of this game that many reviewers ignored is soundtrack. IT'S AMAZING and it was composed by none other than David Wise. Holy crap those tunes are great.\nAs for the game itself, you're a snake named Noodle and your job is to collect 1-3 stones in each stage, to open the portal to the other. It is mostly physics game, where you try to tie up the snake on bamboo sticks to get higher and avoid obstacles. While most of games this kind are only made for the lulz and for streamer material so 12 yo can have great time (Octodad, Goat Sim, I am Bread, Amazing Frog etc.), but Snake Pass throws in Collect-a-thon into a mix with bubbles and coins.\nAfter reading about this game, I've though it would be really hard or infuriating, but nope. Game is pretty easy and forgiving for the most part, when you want to collect every coin, then it sometimes might get tricky. Well, maybe level 15 is hard, but that's mostly because of bugs and camera. \nIf it wouldn't be for camera problems (sometimes game will give you weird angles and it's hard to judge how you should go or it will get stuck on the wall) and bugs (one time bird threw me off the bridge to my death instead of dropping me on it, snake going through bamboo instead of staying on it, weird invisible walls, sometimes wonky physics straight out of Dark Souls dead bodies), it could've been great.\nIt took me something around 7,5 hours to complete while collecting all bubbles and something like half coins, so lenght of the game is just right.\n\nFor what it is, it's actually pretty cool game to play, that will probably get it's deserved attention and acclaim years later.", "timestamp_created": 1517851785, "timestamp_updated": 1517851984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525748014450073242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39870476": {"recommendationid": "39870476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000609056", "num_games_owned": 1504, "num_reviews": 380, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1522478396}, "language": "english", "review": "hmm.. not my cup o tea but would be fun for kids. this game looks something like spyro the dragon but you control the way the snakes body slithers, its sort of a new gimmick based on the old tried and true childrens action game.

Right off the bat, green flickering screen, which is nauseating to look at. I was able to temporarily fix this by toggling the resolution between full screen and windowed, but alt-tabbing brings the issue right back, and since you are locked out of changing video settings while in a level, you have to quit or complete a level to re-apply the band-aid of a fix. Which is just great considering that all progress is lost unless you beat the level, even if you're returning to a level to grab collectables you missed. In addition to this, while full screen mode supports a reasonable array of resolutions, many standard resolutions are missing from windowed mode, so I can't just play with a full sized window to avoid this complication altogether(or just allow windowed fullscreen, as is standard for most games made this decade).\n\nBeyond this, the gameplay itself has its problems. The immediate and most glaring of these in my opinion, is the fact that cutscenes, which play regardless of if you've beaten a level or not, are drawn out and completely unskippable. Bad design.

It's not so much that the levels are difficult as that the controls are tricky.  They aren't BAD in any way.  Just tricky.\n\nTo explain.  You control the snake.  You control the slither.  There is a button to move forward.  But if you aren't doing that slither you aren't moving very much.  The body pushes toward the head.  The left stick moves the head.  (With buttons to move it up or down.)  Another button \u201cgrips\u201d but I haven\u2019t really figured out what that is supposed to mean exactly.  Nothing is really automated.  So you have to figure out and execute techniques to climb around on a stone and bamboo obstacle course to collect the stuff you need.  (There is supposedly a KB and mouse control scheme but I have not tried it.)  Thus far I have been able to get through this climbing/platform game with persistence and falling down a lot.  But sooner or later the floor is going to disappear, I just know it.  That is the way of platform levels.  And when it inevitably does falling down a lot will be a lot of death.  But sooo worth it.  \n\nI have never seen a game quite like this.  Modern computers handle curves much better than older ones.  But still.  Wow.  Snakes move in curves and this game seems to nail that bit perfectly.  Past that it's pretty basic stuff.  Collect three McGuffins and get to the end of the level.  Lots of climbing around on bamboo and stone architecture.  There's some coins and bubbles to collect but they seem superfluous.  No upgrades to buy so far as I can tell.  One complaint.  No apples!  A snake game with no apples is just....   These people have no sense of tradition!!!!!\n\nAnyway.  I have never played anything quite like this.  It's vaguely similar to 3D platform games but...  Not similar enough to make this a 3D platform game.  \n\nOne bit of warning though.

Snakes have no hands or feet, so you need to think differently than usual navigating from A to B.\nI played with a XBox 360 controller and the controls were tricky and strange at first but after a couple of hours you get the trick.\nThe default mapping is a tad more difficult to get at first but there is an easier control scheme that moves the snake with the analog stick instead only the head.\n\nFor 20\u20ac I expected a bit more for its value. Not much, but I spent 5 hours finishing the game without hunting too many collectibles. The collectibles are placed at hard-to-get places that force one to be more careful and methodical with the movement to get them and back to the checkpoint to save them. I spoiled purposely myself if it was worth the hassle... and it is not. So I have saved myself from a major disappointment.\nI wish the game had more meaningful collectibles that unlock bonus levels or cool stuff along the way making the work collecting all the stuff satisfying beyond overcoming the challenge.\n\nThe 15 levels felt mostly appropriate long on their own. As a whole, the game, was shorter than anticipated. Double the amount of levels, with the inclusion of new environemental threats and gameplay twists, then this game would have faired with me better. In theory you have double of that with the time trial mode but personally I hate these.\n\nThe graphics are pleasantly colourful and bright, with the exception of the fire worlds. I had to re-adjust my settings.\nThe camera worked most of the time but at certain places it became difficult to make it work alongside the movement because the movement direction is camera-dependent. The beams of light for the 3 stones were a big help for navigating through the levels but the camera couldn't be always convinced to look to the sky.\n\nAt the end of all of it shows potential at every corner but I can only recommend it at this price for those who yearn for new gameplay styles that are not yet experienced before. With many, many years of gaming experience it was refreshing to play this.

My only question is, Why use a poisonous Coral snake as the protagonist?", "timestamp_created": 1515372768, "timestamp_updated": 1515372768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39139675": {"recommendationid": "39139675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067707124", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1515296087}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good, but that statement needs to be qualified.\n\nThis is not a game for everyone, far from it. If you're the type that is easily frustrated, then this isn't for you. If you're a person that enjoys seeing novel and innovative design, this is the game for you.\n\nThis is what the game thrives on: novelty. Controlling the snake is not intuitive, but that is not a point against the game. The entire purpose of this game is to learn this weird control scheme, and master it. The first few levels will be clumsy, but over time you will become more and more profficient at it, and you'll be executing moves that took you 15 minutes of trial and error to get right the first time without a second thought.\n\nThat said, I must reinforce that this game is not for everyone, and not just because the controls can be frustrating. That is the good kind of frustration, the kind that means you're gitting gud, but the game has many, many annoyances that will frustrate you in the wrong way\n\nThe bad frustrations:\n-The camera is atrocious, which is unforgivable in a game where being able to see your snake clearly from all angles is crucial. It's slow and it gets stuck in the scenery. This has caused a couple of cheap deaths, but more than that it just makes a few parts a chore.\n-You have to move left and right as you move forward, like a snake. This is neat at first and adds a tiny bit of realism, but it gets old quick and, in my case, left my right thumb feeling quite sore after each level.\n-Some of the hidden coins in the levels are far too well-hidden, and the levels are each large enough that you will get sick and tired of going up and down and left and right throught them. Movement in the game is very slow, even if you're skilled, and this compounds with the previous problem.\n-The cutscenes are all unskippable, they are not super long but they repeat every time you restart a level . This gets very aggravating very fast\n-Perhaps the biggest problem is that the game doesn't save your collected items when you die. This makes sense as, for some collectibles, half the challenge is getting back to solid ground, but with how hard the game is, it is controller-throwingly awful when you die after getting a tough collectible. Checkpoints are very sparse for no good reason. This could be easily fixed by having many more checkpoints or having your snake respawn on the last piece of solid ground touched, but some designers seem to equate frustration with difficulty. Couple this with the fact that you can't save and quit in the middle of a level, even if you've just lost 10 minutes of hard-won progress because of a small mistake and don't want to look at the game right now, but the level still has 30 minutes to go\n\nThese are my main gripes with the game, and in any other game, would be a deal-breaker and would make me not recommend, however, I still recommend this game just for the sheer creativity and innovative design it has, even if the execution is very sloppy.\n\nStray thoughts:\n-The environments look nice, but are quite samey\n-There seems to be little point to the optional collectibles, this might change after beating the final level, but the game does suffer from not giving the player enough incentive to collect the wisps and coins at the start. I hope there is a reward at the end, and if there isn't, I will edit the frustrations list to add that.", "timestamp_created": 1515297215, "timestamp_updated": 1515297215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75763547420501709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39025334": {"recommendationid": "39025334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075350042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 782, "last_played": 1515013085}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd describe it mostly as a puzzle platformer game, focused mainly as a collect-a-thon like Banjo-Kazooie.

It's one of those rare games that is really teaching you a new way to think about yourself in space.\n-Interesting and varied levels\n\n\nCONS:\n-Unskippable cutscenes\n-You may have to re-do entire levels if you're a completionist and missed one thing. In a second playthrough, your previous progress doesn't matter - you must redo and recollect everything to 100%\n-The death mechanic doesn't fit the game well and basically amounts to \"do it all over again\"\n-Many things can be completed in unintended ways. In fact,quickly slithering over pegs instead of wrapping around them in the designer-inteded way ended up often being the best strategy. I'm marking this as a con because many things that were potentially moments of great level design were instead made kind of same-y with lots of other parts of the game.\n-Few \"aha\" moments, or real puzzle elements. I believe there is huge potential for this in future games, but most of your \"aha\" moments in this game come from learning how to snake your snake.\n-On the surface there are three different kinds of thing to collect, but there is no real difference between them other than how obvious they might be to find. The game was mostly just a \"find where we hid all the things\" game. Very reminiscent of \"find all the different colored bananas\" in Donkey Kong 64 in that it creates a lot of tedium.\n-The camera is often not your friend. Some areas are too claustrophic to get a good view, and sometimes the camera simply will not move where you want it. Sometimes the camera forces a certain perspective, which is actually a good thing 90% of that time, but that other 10% is incredibly irritating. I expect that future Snake Pass games will really fine tune the camera, but in this game it can be both frustrating and disorienting to manage the camera.\n\nThat's a lot of cons, so why am I recommending the game?\n\nI cannot understate how unique and cool the core mechanic is, and like anything that pushes the envelope, it's hard to get everything right the first time. This is a relatively short playthrough - it took me about 9 hours - and I highly recommend giving this game a shot for yourself.\n\nTwo things that might help you through it:\n\n1) Expect it to take a bit to get used to the controls\n2) DON'T try to 100% the game until you've completely finished it. 100% can force you to go to cool new places and really fully explore the map, but also can suck some of the fun out of the game as you have to backtrack sometimes looking for the thing you missed. And most importantly, you get an item that will be hugley helpful in 100 percenting AFTER you've completed the game (much to my chagrin, having 100% each level as I played through the first time).", "timestamp_created": 1514022544, "timestamp_updated": 1514022544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67133253812789917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38509244": {"recommendationid": "38509244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047688616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1548003879}, "language": "english", "review": "Love everything about this game <3 its hard to master the controls but when you get used to it its quite fun :D i would give it a 10/10 \\(^_^)/", "timestamp_created": 1513901343, "timestamp_updated": 1513901343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38507709": {"recommendationid": "38507709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263648026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1513810795}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the more fun and unique games I've played.

For starters it would be nice to know what type of anti-aliasing is being used, also \"Low\" which is the lowest setting for anti-aliasing seems to just be \"Off\" instead of the actuall lowest setting. \n\nAnother issue i have is the fact that you can't even change the brightness in the middle of a level. I understand why the other graphical settings may be locked in the middle of a level but brightness? really? \n\nAlso the game has a max framerate of 60fps and wont go any further than (and the game warns you about the use of fraps causing a potential crash when you start the game with fraps loaded). I'm fine with playing the game at 60fps i just would have liked to make as much use of my 144hz monitor as I could.\n\nBut in conclusion I enjoyed the game a lot and i give it an 8/10. it would be nice to see a little more content like some extra levels mostly but for what you get for $20 its pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1507266625, "timestamp_updated": 1507266625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35464041": {"recommendationid": "35464041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140853281", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1610727613}, "language": "english", "review": "Charming and surprisingly difficult.  \nAnd you can change the snake's facial expression.", "timestamp_created": 1507096489, "timestamp_updated": 1507096489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503816783428192139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35387536": {"recommendationid": "35387536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129571872", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1594585319}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego.

I only played the first two levels but the objective was the same on both. Broken gate, missing keys, find the keys. That's it. So there is really no interest in the objectives, meaning you focus more on the gameplay itself.\n- The wild camera. Focusing on the gameplay is not easy when you can't see what you are doing.  While being a common problem in 3D platformers, this is particularly important in this game because of the way your character needs to wrap around objects to climb up them. Having to adjust the camera manually every couple of seconds while trying desperately to cling to something means you should prepare for a lot of deadly falls.\n- The checkpoint system. Aside from the keys, there are numerous other collectables in the level, some more awkwardly placed than others. But anything you collected does not get saved until you pass a checkpoint. So often you collect half a dozen or more difficult to reach items, only to drop off a ledge and lose them all on your way to the checkpoint.\n- Which leads us to the biggest problem of them all. The controls. I appreciate there is not a game controller yet invented that is designed to replicate the movement of snakes and I knew from other reviews this would not be easy, but for me it was way too difficult. I played 45 minutes and only reached level 2. During that time I died more than 20 times, so approximately every 2 minutes, most of which meant I had to go back and collect all of the items I had just lost, again and again and again. Now bear in mind that I have games like Dark Souls in my collection which are incredibly hard, but they make up for it by rewarding you and being entertaining. Snake Pass was unfortunately just very, very frustrating and no fun at all.\n\nAs a result, it pains me to have to say I cannot recommend the game.", "timestamp_created": 1506711441, "timestamp_updated": 1506711441, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451723337173461914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35306795": {"recommendationid": "35306795", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969966543", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 728, "last_played": 1528397995}, "language": "english", "review": "The key locations to open the exits are pretty obvious, the whole gameplay rests around how you are going to pass the obstacles.\n\nAll negatieve reviews relate to bad controls; the controls are fine.

The levels and obstacles are decently designed, and the graphics and music are sufficiently okay for a game of this kind.\n\nAnd then, there are the controls. If you're wondering how on Earth you're supposed to control a snake in a 3D environment with keyboard and mouse, the developers almost got the right idea. You hold the left mouse button to slither forward and use WASD to control the direction. On paper, it seems good enough, but within thirty minutes of playing this, I was convinced that this game NEEDED tank controls. Within one hour, I was dying to quit the game and go play the original Alone in the Dark. Press left to turn left, press right to turn right. What could be more simple? But no, tank controls apparently are the Unholy Spawn of Satan and it should be avoided like the plague (especially where it would make the most sense)(. But I admit, having WASD controls wouldn't necessarily be a bad idea if the camera were good, and he camera is, by far, the worst aspect of this entire game. It gets blocked in places where it physically shouldn't (if there's a pillar between you and the camera, you can't spin the camera on the outside of the pillar to get a good view of the level; instead, the camera will suddenly zoom in and you can't see anything), your sight gets blocked by scenery, the camera moves on its own even though you control it with the mouse, it spazzes out when you're in tight places and forces you to make involuntary U-turns and go back to where you were coming from, and so on. Seriously, the camera is a mess, and the fact that your movement is entirely dependent on the camera angle makes the whole control scheme come crashing down. I'd press the directional button to move the snake in one direction, only to see it spinning like an idiot in the opposite direction and fall of the pole I'm trying to hold on to. And if your answer is \"duh, just adjust the camera!\", you obviously don't know the camera in this game.\n\nOh, and did I mention this game seriously lag? I'm sorry, but I can't admit sub-20FPS precarious in a game that can't possibly be more detailed and complex than Skyrim or Arkham City. The optimisation is terrible, and that makes the camera control even worse.\n\nI suppose I could spend some more hours mastering the finely and precisely SCREWED UP camera control, but honestly, what's the point? It'd be more fun, not to mention easier, to physically transform myself into a snake and beat these levels in the real world, spikes and endless abysses and all. And if I want to struggle against a dysfunctional, uncooperative camera, I can always go back to Super Mario 64. At least the collectibles had a point in that game.\n\nI can't recommend this at all. With controls as broken as these, any notion of fun completely vanishes.

I'm never quite sure if there's a green gem up ahead, or just a large clump of grass.\n\nApart from that, this game is fantastic. It's not your average puzzle type game where it's like 'collect all these pointless things by running around aimlessly for an hour only to discover that they're actually right infront of you, to then move on to the next area to do exactly the same thing.'

The level design is generally good, however some levels get tedious and borderline infuriating towards the end of the game.\n\nControls are simple but extremely difficult to master. Unlike any other platformer I have ever played before.\n\nYou will be frustrated at some point, no doubt. Sometimes Doodle (the snake's little bird friend) will get in front of your camera and cause you to die, but you can't stay mad at him for long. He's just too darn cute. Occasionally your camera will have a mind of its own, shifting where you don't want it to shift, causing you to die. Often times I found myself getting impatient with the snake mechanics, causing me to die. Dying in this game is inexplicably aggravating, so be prepared to take a break every once in a while.\n\nThe main story can be completed in under 5 hours, but there are a ton of optional collectibles if you're a completionist. I would definitely recommend this on a sale, but it may be worth the full price to you if you really, really enjoy being a snake.\n\nI really hope this game gets a sequel at some point, if for no other reason than to tighten up the controls and polish the level design.

On the other hand...\n\nI feel like we've all run into the frustrations of having a fun, relaxing, puzzle-based game be very reliant on the game's physics-based objects working just the way you need them to. Noodle ends up being much of that issue.\n\nI definitely felt like I understood the controls of the game, and I can't say I noticed camera issues the way some other people are reporting. But, even with a solid understanding of the principles, I just couldn't seem to get Noodle to continue doing just as I wanted. The main gap here is, while Noodle's head (or, front) end is highly responsive and can even be directed in some slightly physics-defying manner, his tail end (or, back) often fails to follow through dutifully. Carefully wrapping yourself around one small piece of a branch will grant you some good grip positioning, but then the slightest move forward afterward will cause his entire back end to unwind as though it were a limp piece of rope.\n\nTo Sumo Digital's credit, their physics simulation of snakes seems really dead-on. They definitely paid attention to the actual workings of snake muscles to avoid giving players a game where you can float around based on Snake Magic. Ultimately, I feel like good realism kind of got in the way of giving players a fun, relaxing experience, which is mostly what I had planned for when sitting down with a game with such cartoony style and gentle music.\n\nYou may actually still enjoy this game if you're a bit more patient than me, and don't mind \"hacking the physics\" a bit on occasion to get where you're trying to go, like stretching waay out to touch the ledge rather than actually coiling towards it. It's definitely a unique enough idea, you might want to try it just based on that if you want to try something new. Unlike a lot of \"physics-based challenge games\" its failings aren't totally based on glitchy ragdolls or objects getting stuck or flying off, but simply the limited control of your complex-shaped character.\n\nTo close on a positive note, Sumo Digital also made Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, which is a better cart-racing game than Mario Kart.

Camera is very unfriendly and often gives you really bad angles to work with resulting in cheap deaths\n4. The occasional linear level feels out of place compared to the more broad, exploratory levels; point 1 worsens the impact this has on the level design\n5. The wind mechanic introduced in the last few stages is outright bad. Like genuinely ruins the last three levels outright.\n6. Moving platforms and the snake physics often don't behave well together resulting in really tense and vaguely unfair situations\n7. Unskippable cutscenes at the start or end of some levels, usually going on for over a minute too\n8, Environments are all kind of samey; lots of grass, stone ruins, and bamboo. Bamboo everywhere.\n9. Grip mechanic does, as far as I'm aware, absolutely nothing? I have never seen it work or be useful in any scenario and 100%ed the game without ever really using it\n\nPresentation wise the game looks great and the music is decent though tends to get repetitive with how long some levels can drag on, especially near the end of the game. And there are genuinely a lot of moments of pretty solid level design, aside from the occasional bad moment the real fault of the game is the controls not quite being there. Maybe in a sequel they could refine and improve this idea but I honestly don't know if it would make for a fun game even if they did.\n\nBecause that's just the real failing here... due to the slow pace and frustrating controls, the game just isn't fun.

The horrendous, atrocious camera and controls that have plagued most 3D platformers since the early 32-bit console days are present here, in full glory. And in my case, they're without a doubt, the absolute worst I've come across since the PSX era.\n\nThe camera intentionally obscures what's around you and instead focuses on the ground most of the time. This is to try and make the game \"challenging\" somehow, otherwise they simply would have included a locked camera mode, as an option at least, with an isometric angle when it gets too close to the character or an object. The controls too get in the way, 'grip' for instance doesn't do what it's supposed to and it's a struggle and a chore just to get over a small obstacle or climbing a short pole or stick, this is exacerbated by clipping issues and off course, the drunk, inept, camera sabotaging every move and action.\n\nA big disappointment, a pity really. The game is indeed charming, and the music is great and it makes you happy, at least when you're in the main menu, cause instead of being a relaxing and a chill game like you thought it would be, it ends up being extremely infuriating and exasperating.

Snake Pass is super dedicated to the whole snake thing \u2013 any expectation for remotely conventional controls should be quickly discarded as the bizarre, ungainly physics based controls ARE the game. Rather than jumping or climbing, you have to coil and slither around bamboo poles and fling yourself from platform to platform while managing your clumsy, limbless mass. Even moving along the ground requires a sidewinding motion. The main lesson I\u2019ve learned from Snake Pass is that being a snake is a massive pain in the arse.\n\nThankfully, while this is a game that defies many genre conventions the structure of the game is actually very simple \u2013 every level consists of collecting three thingies and getting to the exit. There are optional other thingies to collect along the way if you\u2019re a completionist. The 15 levels should last you about 5-8 hours depending on how rubbish you are, which means it doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome. This is assuming you get that far and don\u2019t ragequit and set your computer on fire. Don\u2019t let the cutesy, twee art style fool you \u2013 you will either get good at Snake Pass, or you will perish like a dog.\n\nThere are three stages of Snake Pass grief \u2013 fascination, frustration and mastery. How long it takes to get from stage 2 to stage 3 will largely determine whether you enjoy the game or feel constant uncontrollable, incandescent rage. The first four levels are a fairly gentle introduction, but the game expects mastery of its unconventional controls very quickly and level five sees a massive difficulty spike- Snake Pass loves to dangle you above bottomless pits between sparse checkpoints, and it does not take long for this to begin in earnest.

It throws me back to 1998, trying new mascot platformers among Crash, Croc, Banjo-Kazooie and so on. I love it.\n\nAs for the gameplay (at the time of writing I'm about 50% through the game), the levels are relatively easy once you get in sync with the logic of the game, level design and controls. This is a small but noticeable learning curve (as previously stated, I gave up after my first 15 minutes) but once you get through it the levels becomes a series of obstacle courses you explore to find everything. A very relaxing and enjoyable experience. To top it all, it's all done in a beautiful world full of colour and joyful design. \n\nIf you like platformers but want something new with regards to gameplay, if you grew up playing the 90's classics or if you just want a colourful game with less focus on storytelling and more focus on level exploration and puzzles, I highly recommend this game.

No cutscene can be skipped, and with a game this light on story that's inexcusable. The brightness setting the game recommended caused switches in the fire levels to blend into the background. Speaking of the levels, every one looks the same. Just minor differences in lighting and sometimes there's flowers in the grass or hot ashes on the ground.

They feel great! After a few minutes of practice, they allow you to wrap around poles and slither through grass like I imagine a snake would be able to.

Also, it's *not* particularly relaxing; you'll often find yourself tightening your grip on the mouse/controller and cringing as you try not to slip off ledges.\n\nWHAT GENRE IS THIS GAME?\nIt's not quite an adventure in the spirit of Banjo-Kazooie.

Like Mirror's Edge, the game is based entirely around your skills with a particular set of moves/controls.\n\nHOW DIFFICULT IS THIS GAME?\nThere's a steep learning curve at the beginning, but about an hour or two into the game, you'll realize that the game is pretty easy to complete.  However, the game is significantly more difficult if you try to collect all the collectibles and *especially* if you try to collect all the Steam achievements.  This game is good for both casual gamers and \"serious\" gamers alike.\n\nIS THIS GAME WORTHWHILE?\nYes, this game is definitely worthwhile.  The most common complaint among the negative reviews seems to be that people don't like the controls.  Well, mastering the controls is the whole point!

The levels are also designed encourage exploration and to get all possble collectables ( this is a collect a thon game ) But if you don't want to get all collectables, than you don't have too. Its your choice!\n\n+ Time attack. Great for people who love an extra challenge and leaderboards.\n\n+ Likeable characters. ( well, this is based on my opinion )\n\n\nCons:\n\n- This biggest challange for me in this game was not controls, but the camera. It can get very wonky at tight spaces, enough to actually make me feel slightly nauseous, and I never felt that way before playing a game.\n\n- Repititve music. Just a note, the music is not bad, it works well with the game. Only issue is that there is shortage of it. In this game there is 4 worlds. Each world, with the expection of 1, has 4 levels.

Highly recommended you switch to the \"easy\" control settings, and only switch back to default when you need the extra finesse of having a dedicated slither button.

It feels so refreshing in this day and age dominated by grimdark naturalistic titles all around (which I also love, don't get me wrong; it can just feel a bit stifling) to play such a vibrant, innocent game so reminiscent of old-school platformers. The music, too, is super catchy (not gonna lie, I was singing along to the tunes at least half the time). I don't really understand people who say it's difficult; sure, the controls are finicky and very different from what you're used to, but for good reason. I wasn't even playing with a gamepad (which I do believe would have made the experience a lot smoother but alas I don't own one) yet I quickly got used to them and within a few levels was ssslithering around like a true ssssneaky snek.

In a game where the entire challenge is built on delicate movement, things are too unpredictable, and the terrible save system only compounds those issues.\n\nYour body is a physical object that is constantly being pulled down by gravity. This is the core of the challenge in the game - getting around obstacles cleanly enough and quickly enough that you get around them without either falling off or being pulled off by your poorly supported body. This is a very cute in theory but in practice your constantly unspooling body changes how you move throughout an obstacle, rapidly changing how your snake reacts to the controls.  Adding to these are some serious camera issues, particularly with the way the head moves in relation to the camera. Your head will often move in the opposite direction you intended, or at a wildly different speed.  In the key moments of this game - piloting through precarious challenges or attempting to fix mistakes - your body won't behave as you expect and these moments quickly become very frustrating. Essentially this game is hundreds of attempts at threading a needle when the thread doesn't move in a consistent manner.\n\nTo make matters worse, this game has a very poor save system. The game is built around collecting various doodads (blobs, coins and gems) in often precarious situations, but makes no effort to save your progress within the game. You must return to checkpoints continously to update your collection and avoid losing several minutes work to a misjudgement on a cliff face. While the levels aren't very large, your snake doesn't move very quickly (even with enthusiatic speed-boosting slithering) and the checkpoints are somewhat stingy, so journeys too and from checkpoints are quickly tiresome. Especially when travelling back from a checkpoint for the 100th time to reattempt a particularly difficult coin.\n\nTo add to this, you cannot save progress within a level! Exiting a level midway will not only result in all your collectibles progress being lost, but the unskippable cutscenes will all return. It's maddening. One of the key strengths of a game like this is how it enables come-and-go gameplay but the save system completely nullifies that.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, the movement of the snake in the 'meat' of the game - basic movement through the space and defeating the basic obstacles - is very smooth and it's a novel idea, well executed. But things fall apart once you move onto anything that poses real challenge and risk, and those difficult puzzles make up half the game and certainly the most engaging portions of it.\n\nIt's cute and colourful and a really novel idea that is very successful on the surface, but the game falls apart the moment any pressure is placed on those systems.

As far as cons,  I can tell the game is a little less optimized than I had hoped. Very high settings do not run at a constant 60 fps on my GTX 1060 at 1080p, but this can be solved by swapping down to lower settings, which don't even affect visual quality that much.

They're actually quite ingenious/enjoyable, once you get the hang of it. The difficulty lies in the fact that the inherent complexity of even the [b]basic[/b] controls (a stick for direction, a button to \"constrict,\" a button to propel yourself forward, and a button to raise your head up) are, if not [b]as[/b] complicated, certainly in the same ballpark as [i]Surgeon Simulator[/i] and [i]QWOP,[/i] in the sense that they're the equivalent of the proverbial \"walking while chewing gum while patting your head while rubbing your belly.\" There will be times when you'll need four of your fingers to work perfectly in concert together, but instead of skillfully nabbing a shiny gold coin while hanging impressively from a bamboo shoot, you'll find yourself nabbing a gold coin as you fall stupidly to your death. Again.\n\nOf course, as you watch Noodle fall into that endless void, his mouth open in terror, some part of your brain may actually feel relief at the thought that that's one less huge snake in the world. You know, silver linings, and all that! Because for all his cuteness, he's still a big-ass, heavy snake who will, with your help, demonstrate his ability to get absolutely EVERYWHERE.

My only issue is that the game is running a little bit too hot. Optimization issues perhaps?\n\nGameplay: 8/10 - An incredible game, the physics are spot on and its addicting. I sucked at the controls at first but a few hours later and i was spiralling away like a master. My only issues are that there arent many maps to play on, and this brings me onto my final message to the devs.\n\nAny Improvements? :\n**1.** MAP editor and MAP Sharing would make this game a true, 10/10, a game which will stand the test of time and be in our hearts forever as an all-time classic and a definite \"We want Snake Pass 2!\". There's a slight lack of content, and throwing in a Map editor would fix the issue.\n\n**2.** More graphics options to help low-end graphics cards, like the ability to Disable Anti-Aliasing, grass, light shafts, anything else which is intensive, and also a FPS capper (many peopel prefer to play at 30 fps to keep hardware cool or just like it that way). The more computers which can run Snake Pass, means a more happier consumer base! :) currently, the game has a hefty graphical demand.\n\n[b]**OVERALL SCORE : 8.5/10**[/b]\n\nPotential score after improvements: 10/10 - Yes, this game IS capable of a 10 and this is a score i do not give lightly or easily.\n\nI love this game!

DEFINITELY worth that price, it's a very generous price honestly, i think they could have sold it for more.\n\nQ. My computer is starting to get old, should i still get this game?\nA. I run a AMD FX 8150 (8 x 3.6ghz) which runs quite cool on Snake Pass, and a Ati Radeon RX470 which oddly runs hot. My advice is, that you have a decent graphics card to play this game, something around my level or higher.\n\nQ. My controllers arent working, how do i fix this?\nA.

This game is up there with Ubisoft's [i]Grow Home[/i] & its sequel [i]Grow Up[/i] in terms of being fun adventure games with no combat and unique yet satisfying movement mechanics. In Ubisoft's Grow games, climbing was done by alternating hand grips. In Snake Pass, climbing is done by literally slithering around bamboo and using that grip to pull the snake upwards. All three games are definitely worth playing, but enough comparisons.\n\nSnake Pass stars a snake named Noodle who, with the help of his hummingbird friend Doodle, must restore the gates linking the different realms of Haven Tor together. Haven Tor consists of 15 levels spread across 4 realms, each with a different visual theme (and slightly more challenging obstacles than the last) and song. Yes, this means there are only a handful of original music compositions through the entire game, but the ones that are here fit perfectly and never seem repetitive.\n\nThe physics are really solid here, with Noodle mostly reacting the way you would want him to, and Doodle's ability to lift Noodle's tail is pretty well thought out. Use it right and Noodle can scale obstacles easier, but bad timing may send Noodle to his doom. Either way, most of the time spent in Snake Pass is spent climbing up and around bamboo to navigate each level.\n\nEvery level has 3 keystones (the main objective) and side collectibles consisting of 5 coins, 20 wisps, and some of those idols I mentioned earlier. Each level took me around 30 minutes as an average, with some of the later levels taking slightly longer, and there are some achievements that encourage replayability, such as playing every level without dying or finding hidden idols that are otherwise unmentioned. [spoiler]Don't fret if you miss anything; completing every level unlocks Snake Vision, which lets you get any collectibles you missed.[/spoiler]\n\nMy only real criticism of Snake Pass is that sometimes, the camera can get stuck on the scenery, which can make some of the coins a real nuisance to collect. Also, if you die you reset at the last checkpoint and any collectibles you acquired since have to be grabbed again. The latter, in and of itself, isn't a problem really (I kinda like that design decision to be quite honest) but the camera makes this a minor issue. Here's a pro tip to reduce frustration: When you grab something tricky, find the closest checkpoint you can and tag it. Better safe than sorry.\n\n[b]Recommendation:[/b] If you played Yooka-Laylee (which I haven't yet as of writing this review) and found it disappointing, or if you're looking for a modern twist on the old-school collectathons of the N64/PlayStation era, give Snake Pass a shot. As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the best collectathons on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1492474677, "timestamp_updated": 1492562387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31203458": {"recommendationid": "31203458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040551661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1507664362}, "language": "english", "review": "A fresh take in an otherwise, incredibly nostalgia entrenched genre. First I would like to list the features and things Snake Pass does right, and then list some of the issues that come from an extension of playing for a while. The first, and best, feature of this game in comparison to other 3D platforming games is the incredibly unique feeling of control, which I can only compare to games like Octodad, but those games are made in such a way for comedic effect, rather than for intuitively enhancing the challenge. In Snake Pass, as the name implies, you play as a snake named Noodle, and goal is to complete a relatively open ended, but somewhat tightly designed level. You collect 3 objects or so (usually found in difficult to reach vantage points) and then proceed to the end of the level. Pretty basic fundamentals to a game, you will have seen this kind of work in games like Banjo-Kazooie, but what Snake Pass does best is how you CONTROL the game itself.\n\nI have played both with keyboard & mouse, plus using a controller, and both seem to work virtually in both ways efficiently, whether you choose between will typically be preference, and I went with the controller on this one. The game does an amazing job at how well it controls, as you meander around a deep-grass jungle looking environment, attempting to wind up bamboo-looking structures and traverising the environment using simple puzzles. The real meat and challenge of the game comes with mastering the controls, and with this, makes you feel like you are having a truly unique experience with the game, as you become the snake.\nVisually, the game is gorgeous, using the Unreal 4 engine, and really showcasing excellent lighting, and just the right tinge of bloom and an effective colour pallette. You will more than likely get that trademark feeling of \"Rareware\" from playing this, with its cartoony and friendly look. The soundtrack is also very enjoyable, composed by the extremely talented David Wise, known for his works on Rare titles in the past (Battletoads, DK Country) and fits perfectly with the game's aesthetic. \n\nUnfortunately, unlike Snake Pass, this review isn't all sunshine and rainbows, and there is an issue that arises the longer you play the game. One of my biggest complaints would honestly be the somewhat repetitive nature of the game overall; as the objective does not change, and eventually assets from the previous levels will be reused again, and again, and again. Unlike some other 3D platformers which would have suffered from this, they would have broke up the monotony with minigames like in Banjo Kazooie or other titles of similar nature. This game lacks some variety, and it is a shame, considering how much potential there was for variety with their physics engine and how the controls functioned. The novelty runs thins after a while, and this personally, makes me question the price tag at its current level. Currently I have clocked around 6 hours of gameplay, and I am honestly not sure how long this monotony continues throughout, however at this point it does admittedly get tedious.\n\nOverall, if you are not put off the repetitious nature, and instead can focus on the music, aesthetic, challenging controls and FEEL of a classic Rareware title, I would highly recommend the game, though I would still be relatively cautious of its current price tag at \u00a315.

The original game mechanics are really fun and unique, it's fun to climb stuff acting like a real snake, but there is a lot of bad game design that can't be ignored. I have played through the whole game. \n\nPros:\n- Fun\n- Original mechanics \n- Vibrant (yet monotone...) world\n- Length is good for $20 game\n- Snake vision after you complete the game is a good idea in finding the collectables, as a lot of people after finishing the game may have just looked at a guide anyway. \n- Checkpoints mostly fair\n\nCons:\n- IT'S ALWAYS SO DAMN LOUD ON LAUNCH, until you click the A button your sound setting don't kick in. rip headphone users. \n- Camera gets bad in some close-up sections.\n- There is basically no story, and the story that is there is very weak and doesn't add anything to the game.\n- The soundtrack is bad in my opinion, I've seen some reviews on here that say it's good, but for me it was too repetitive and annoying. \n- The environments are all the same, even between different 'worlds'. Just because they changed the lighting and changed spikes to lava, doesn't make it feel unique enough. For example, in the lava world, they use the same grass from all the worlds, where they could of made it a bit more barren or ashy. All world environments feel the same and the slight changes they have made shouldn't justify the different worlds. \n- No enemies, having the addition of enemies in some areas would have given a lot to the game, the ending of the game sucked so bad, having a boss fight or a massive epic challenge to overcome would of been great, but there wasn't any. It's not like having colourful enemies would change the atmosphere of the game as there is already spikes that impale the noodle and kill him. \n- There isn't much aim for the collectables, I haven't 100% the game yet so there might be something after that, but there is no game aspect that motivates you to collect all the collectables. \n- Can't skip the bad cutscenes. \n\nSo, if the developers created a sequel to snake pass, I would suggest working on a story that makes sense, it doesn't have to be long. look at spyro 1 or crash bandicoot for inspiration. I would also suggest working on the camera more and the environments. In addition to a better soundtrack, hopefully unique songs for each level? I'm not even sure how many songs are in the game right now, they were all so similar which made listening to them for hours annoying. MORE UNIQUENESS BETWEEN LEVELS.\n\nIn saying all this bad, it's still great and I would recommend it! 6.5/10~ I hope these developers improve on their next game!\n", "timestamp_created": 1492340002, "timestamp_updated": 1492340002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622249841690063477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31169316": {"recommendationid": "31169316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114906218", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1688402953}, "language": "english", "review": "SO FUN EVERYONE NEEDS TO PLAY THIS!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1492311027, "timestamp_updated": 1492311027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31165213": {"recommendationid": "31165213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041080267", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1492373318}, "language": "english", "review": "My GF likes to play this because it reminds her of my cute little snake named \"Noodle\".", "timestamp_created": 1492291550, "timestamp_updated": 1492291550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449826985597610474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31144285": {"recommendationid": "31144285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163675927", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 135, "last_played": 1492221945}, "language": "english", "review": "i love snakes , i like platforms, and this is diffrent than all the games that have been coming out latley. i love this game its cute and fun and makes me smile. the world isnt such a bad place after all lol", "timestamp_created": 1492206751, "timestamp_updated": 1492206751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492780476808547974", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31124934": {"recommendationid": "31124934", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994471024", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 601, "last_played": 1501702273}, "language": "english", "review": "It's hard to imagine a game where simply moving around can feel so satisfying.

Positives: Noodle is a hilarious name, Doodle adds to the fun, and the art has a nostalgic feel to it like something from the Nintendo 64 era. Sometimes when the camera zooms in you see details like individual scales on Noodle's body, which adds to the beauty of the game as you venture around being a snake. I like the puzzle aspect of figuring out how to work Noodle's mechanics to wrap around and slither up to new platforms or swim into new territories. Thus far, just with a sort of beginning taste, Snake Pass is a fun pastime. Negatives: The camera angle everyone talks about? Yeah, they're not joking. Sometimes I ended up falling off bamboo shoots because I couldn't entirely see where I was going and adjusting the camera proved to be a severe difficulty. Additionally, the controls seem to either stop working or don't go where you want them to go. While wrapping around tricky bamboo shoots above sky, where you fall to your death the second you drop off, Noodle seemed to lose his grip even when I was practically white-knuckleing the steam controller I use to play this game. Other times I would be moving Noodle to continue wrapping around the poles when he began going in the opposite direction as I attempted to keep moving upward, causing the snake to unwrap around sections of the pole I had already made progress on. Worse, when trying to correct the error, Noodle moved too slowly in response, giving precious seconds of time for his body to lose its grip, which would make me fall right back off. This proved to be less of a challenge and more of a frustration as I played the game. When put on the lowest setting for video quality, half of noodles body refused to move from the starting location, which is a strange and game breaking glitch as I tried to move and the upper half of his body went around as usual while his back half and his tail refused to go anywhere. Even trying to uncoil it proved fruitless. Higher settings gave me some frame rate issues, thus I kept downgrading quality to see which worked best on my computer without making the game unplayable. For now, I have it set on medium. While I still recommend Snake Pass as a fun and interesting game unlike others I've played before, I would say NOT to get this game unless you really love snakes or really enjoy the concept of this puzzle platformer. If you are not very into snakes or very into this sort of genre of game, you will grow frustrated with the controllers pretty fast I would guess, and likely end up not wanting to play it again. If you do love snakes and puzzle platformers, I would recommend getting this game. Despite the problems I've encountered, I am overall satisfied with my experience. I might recommend waiting for a price drop before purchasing the game for yourself (I think I might have preffered spending 10 dollars instead of 20 on it, myself), considering this was made by an independent development team, I think that it was very good and worth supporting the people who worked on it by buying it at full price. It is very nice that it is available for 20 dollars and not 40 to 80 like other games coming out today, and though it has its drawbacks, it really is worth having in my opinion and in my collection.

As a player it keeps me tensely focused and happy.

Most areas take planning and skillful movement to reach. Completing the game gives you a special vision mode for tracking down the optional collectibles. Some can be very difficult and require methodical patience. I played with mouse and keyboard, probably trickier than controller but it worked fine for me.\n\nThis is easily my favorite game so far this year, but I\u2019ll throw in a few nitpicks. Your bird companion looks weird and has unskippable cut scenes. The check pointing can be harsh at times.

(I forgot which level I've experienced it from but it did force me to restart my computer & it was around the Fire themed levels)\n\nOverall whether you get this game on Steam, Xbox One, PS4 or Nintendo Switch I highly recommend this game & this is one of the few games where either PC or console is a good choice to play this game on because the Snake Pass team put so much care into this game.", "timestamp_created": 1491735753, "timestamp_updated": 1511394852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563857495784759521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31036852": {"recommendationid": "31036852", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969799976", "num_games_owned": 913, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1674300153}, "language": "english", "review": "Utterly unique controls that are both fun and intuitive yet always challenging, with great depth and subtlety.

Don't be fooled, though--Snake Pass is simultaneously easy to pick up and play and devilishly difficult, especially if you aim to collect every level's optional bubble and coin.\n\nHowever, it's tough for all the right reasons.  The level design is excellent, posing clever challenges at every turn and always finding ways to surprise you.  If you die, it's probably because you weren't skilled enough to make a particular climb.  There aren't any \"upgrades\" or even powerups.  Instead, each level merely relies on pure skill by asking that put into practice everything that you've learned up to that point.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about Snake Pass is its remarkably intuitive control scheme.  You control your body with the left analog stick and move forwards with the right trigger.  To gain momentum, you must slither left and right like an actual snake.  Climbing is done by simply lifting your head with the A button and wrapping your body around the desired object.  As a result, anyone can pick up and play this game in a matter of seconds; but again, mastering it is a different story.\n\nThankfully, the game also looks and sounds great.  Its vibrant graphics really pop, and the soundtrack is composed by none other than David Wise, whose work on classic Rare titles like Donkey Kong Country speaks for itself.\n\nBottom line:\nI can't possibly recommend Snake Pass enough.  It isn't the longest game you'll ever play (a 100% playthrough took me about 10 hours), nor does it have an engrossing story or cast of characters.  What it does offer, however, is a superbly crafted experience that plays unlike any other collectathon to date and offers up a supreme challenge to anyone bold enough to try and conquer each and every level, collectables and all.", "timestamp_created": 1491418584, "timestamp_updated": 1491419942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617597341537475586", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30966409": {"recommendationid": "30966409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049687334", "num_games_owned": 782, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1491337223}, "language": "english", "review": "This Snake gets a Pass ( Pun intended) for being a very intuitive and original Puzzle Platformer.

I want to punch Doodle.\n- The game is SHORT!\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's talk about the PROS:\n- snek.\n- cute snek.\n- I love this snek.\n- BEAUTIFUL graphics.\n- The controls feel SO GOOD and fluid.\n- The levels are designed WONDERFULLY, and are just a wonder to explore.\n- Noodle <3\n- The physics are satisfying to manipulate, and BOY are they consistent. You can exploit them pretty easily!\n- You're gonna wanna learn those exploits because DAMN does the challenge ramp up over the levels.\n- Easy mode is actually hard mode.\n- TIME TRIALS ARE NO-FRILLS.\n- adorable snek\n- Looks very promising for speedrunning, and VERY rewarding feeling when you master it.\n- HOW COULD I FORGET THE MUSIC, THANKS DAVID WISE!\n- Collectibles that DISAPPEAR FOREVER after you collect them! No re-collecting, so long as you finish the level!\n- Checkpoints work MORE THAN ONCE!!!\n- snek\n- Did I mention it's pretty as hell?\n\nNeutral points:\n- Story is just barely there, gets in the way earlier on, and at the end of the game, seems a bit tacked-on.\n- Unlocks are a thing, one is helpful while the others are cosmetic. Not hard to get, and nice if you're a completionist.\n\nSo, I think that sums it up pretty well!

And also, one of the most fun platformers in general, in the last many years. I had no clue about this game until about a week before it came out (thanks to Nerdcubed and Millbee for mentioning it), sounded really unique so I picked it up. Holy crap, it is so incredibly good. In case you don't read the rest of my review, here's one tidbit: [b]This REALLY must be played with a controller. Seriously. The mechanics simply demand it. Has nothing to do with whether it's a good PC version or not. The mechanics just don't lend themselves to kb/mouse, even though there is an option for it.[/b]\n\n[h1]Okay, why it's good: [/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Totally no-frills Snek platforming, there's no arbitrary extra game mechanics glued on. Just get to the things you need to get to, and that's it. Win. The game usually doesn't even show a UI, 'cus you don't need one.\n    [*]Snek movement is [i]amazing[/i]. Every slither is up to you to control. Seriously. It's also quite realistic - like in real life, you can barely move forward unless you slither and wrap around things, it's needed to generate any sort of forward force. The game allows a tiny bit of forward speed even without it, but it's so slow. Small concession to make the [i]game[/i] a little more playable if you get into a weird situation.\n    [*]Levels are basically free-form - there is some natural progression to them, but often it's really up to you how you tackle it. It's common to be able to take \"unconventional\" paths.\n    [*]Looks fantastic! Noodle (the Snake's name) looks adorable, like a cartoon character from some Disney or Pixar film. Honestly.\n    [*]The overall theme and aesthetic of the game is very lighthearted and positive, keeps you excited to play.\n    [*][b]Totally playable by both young and old[/b]. I'm soon 30, and I'm loving the !\"#\u00a4 out of this.\n    [*]Difficulty is up to you - there are 2 flavors of optional collectables in every level, and they provide essentially 2 levels of extra challenge for those who seek it.\nIf not, no big - you can still progress the game just by navigating the level. But honestly, the puzzle of actually getting to the Coin collectibles in particular, and living to tell the tale, is like 50% of the game for me, and it's great.\n    [*]For those who [b]DO[/b] seek all the extras, the game is not even close to \"casual\" or easy. This can be a hard game!\n[/list]\nThis game strikes me as the kind of game that, if it had come out in the early 2000's on Playstation, it would be memorable classic by now. It's completely worth that kind of praise. Brings me the same childish joy that I got from playing the likes of Spyro.\n\n[h1]My few criticisms, or words of caution at least:[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]The game never tells you about the camera button - it's really important! Check the Controls in game.\n    [*]Checkpoint locations can sometimes be pretty ruthless - just remember that they can be re-used (just slither over them and they'll save your progress every time), to keep you from going insane after spending 15 minutes searching for and acquiring a difficult coin, only to fall off the world and lose the progress.. Trigger checkpoints often!\n    [*]Can cause some white-knuckle-controller-gripping-cramps. You are using both triggers, both sticks, and few buttons, pretty much all the time - it's easy to end up squeezing the crap out of your controller just because you're so focused on Snek action.\n    [*]The game is quite light on story - not that it needs one, but your genuinely charming companion feels like he/she could go from charming to genuinely great if there were more interactions other than custcenes.

It's a classic case of being \"easy to learn, difficult to master\" because your main character, Noodle the snake, is not your average videogame character. He/she is, in fact, a snake (albeit a very cute, vegetarian one) with a long, snakey body that is integral to mastering the game. Noodle moves and behaves precisely as you'd expect a snake should, the body beign a long (heavy and slippery) muscle able to coil around objects and push the head forwards. Even the simple act of moving along the ground greatly benefits from moving sinusoidally like... well, a snake. Climbing poles requires you to consider where the weight is distributed so that you don't slide off, when to grip, when to let go and slide fowards, and how to control the head to twist yourself around to get a better grip. If this sounds difficult... well, it is at first. Beyond the initial basic movement, there's a steep learning curve to true master snakery. It can be frustrating until you get it, but once you do the game opens up, and slithering around each level's dense playground becomes a genuine joy.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that Noodle the snake is quite the charmer (sorry, I am trying to avoid snake puns, it's not easy). He doesn't say much, but he oohs, ahhs, and whoas at exactly the right moments. Seeing him shivering with fear and saying \"aaaah!\" as you balance precariously over a drop is not only endearing, but precisely what you'll be doing too. It's quite tense! Fortunately all this vaguely slapstick cartoonery helps to mitigate the difficulty.\n\nIt's not perfect, the main issue being the camera. Most of the time it's fine, but it can also be a pain in the butt. You can control it with the right stick, zoom out a bit, and snap it back into a set position, but doing all this while Noodling can be quite tense as you let go of the controls for a second to adjust the camera. This isn't a fast-paced game so generally this isn't a problem, but occasionally it takes on a mind of its own when you least want it to. When you're clambering around under scenery, it's very easy for the action to get obscured by objects, and underwater it never quite seems to give you the perfect angle. Sessions can be long if you want to try and pick up every last collectible. If you finish the level, anything you collect is saved, so you can come back later to grab the remaining items if you prefer. You have to reach a checkpoint for any collection to be saved, though, which can seem frustrating when you grab a coin and then die, but the point is the challenge is getting there, and then getting back to safety again. Fortunately checkpoints can be used at any time, and they're generally never far away.\n\nOverall this is a beautiful looking game, popping with bright colours and character. Special mention goes to the music by David Wise, which is really top notch stuff reminiscent of Donkey Kong Country.

The devs have said if you spend 15 minutes playing, you'll get the hang of things, but I'd venture to say you don't truly understand things until about and hour or two; this is fortunate, however, due to the length of the game which prevents you from feeling like you've mastered everything.\n\nEach new world is a breath of fresh air with interresting ideas that keep honing your precision/timing. The levels can be short for those who just want to complete the story and challenging for those who want to prove their skills by obtaining all collectibles. The story really isn't anything other than fodder to push things along, but I'd still recommend you play the game without trying to collect everything before going back.\n\nAesthetically, the game looks, sounds, and feels wonderful. \"A\" in each category.\n\nLast point is a small complaint.... I played with a controller as it is definitely built around that control scheme, but this game really hurt my hands.

In an age of endless reboots and sequels, Snake Pass is something new and interesting.  \n\nThe Good:\nThe graphics are stunning.  There were a few areas where I was tempted to stop what I was doing, take a screenshot, and make it my wallpaper.  Attention to detail is pretty heavy.  \nThe concept is also good.  Whoever decided to mix that old snake game on Nokia phones from the 90s with Banjo Kazooie was a genius.  They ought to give whoever it was a raise and a paid vacation to Las Vegas.  \nOptimization was also done fairly well.  The game runs at a stable FPS, even on my dated rig, and that's while I'm also running a second monitor and OBS in the background.  \n\nThe Bad:\nThe controls.  They're not at all intuitive, and it'll take you a while just to figure out how they work, and even longer to get good at using them.  \nPhysics: It's hard to put into words, but it feels like the physics are sometimes too realistic and other times not.  One problem was that in some cases, the snake only moves from the front, as if he was a train being pulled by a locomotive.  However in other locations, the whole snake pushed itself forward.  This caused me to wind my way right off a cliff more times than I can count.  \nPick-up items: This one is also difficult to explain.  There are some points at which you have a lot of trouble telling how far away from an item, or even a ledge you actually are.  A lot of the items feel like they don't exist in space, just sort of as an object on the screen.  \n\nConclusion:  I really like this game, and I want to like it more.  It's charming, challenging, and at some moments will have you sitting in front of your monitor laughing like an idiot.  I do recommend this, if not at full price, then deffinitely during a sale.  I also do hope that we get a sequel, for the sole reason that I want to see the developers take the the game's shortcomings and iron them out.  \n\nAll total, I give it a 7 out of 10.

Not only is it unique in the way you play as a snake but the game also requires you to observe your obstacles rather than just jump in straight away.

There is also no obstuctive UI which I think makes the game much more immersive. You can tell a lot of effort put into making the game's textures, and I also love the hilarious facial expressions Noodle pulls as you're about to fall!\n\nSound-wise the game is great - the music is wonderful and David Wise was a good choice for a game composer. None of the sounds in-game are annoying, too loud or repetitive, which is obviously a bonus.\n\nThe only downside to the game is the lack of checkpoints - in some areas where you are at risk of falling or being killed by spikes the checkpoints are often quite far away, which means if you die you'll often have to do it all over again. Another thing is the fact the game doesn't allow you to restart from your checkpoints, meaning that if Noodle gets stuck (I haven't personally experienced this yet) you'll be forced to start from the beginning.

Replayability isnt the problem, however the fact you have to sit through boring unskippable cutscenes each time, IS. For me the story for this sort of game is negligable and is more an after thought for the developer to gell the game together atleast there is no voice acting of any sort or any real visual flare to grab your attention and make you care about 'Noodle'.\n\nLevel Design:\n\nPlatforming consists of climbing up bamboo scaffolding thats all i have faced so far and i really hope for those of you that manage to get to further stages that there are more mechanics to keep it fresh and interesting. \n\nCheckpoints seem to be rather arbitrarily placed and can make long treks back to puzzle you died at rather frustrating\n\nControls:\n\nyou move by holding down RT direction with left thumbstick (LST) grip with LT raise head with A get help from your bird buddy with Y and control the camera with RTS. unfortunately i found myself butting heads with all these points at some point..\n\nbasic movement RT, LST\n\nSo the idea is since you are a snake to move \"quicker\" you move 'Noodle' left and right like how some snakes move in real life you can move just by holding RT but that wont get you anywhere however the slithering technique felt rather unintuinitive as in I found it hard to determine what was the best wave rythmn for the optimal movement speed it never felt that quick. \n\nGrip LT\n\nThis just doesnt seem to work for my in any consistent way sometimes you can grip on with barely a scale touching and other times your body just slides off like some cheeky devil smeared some lube onto the bamboo.\n\nBird buddy Y\n\nSo if you find yourself needing some help you can call your Bird bud to come hold up your tail (this helps with climbing but also slows your descent acts like a weak glide) which would be grand if the little guy listened to you. i think he has a rather short attention span as sometimes he doesnt bother. USually when you need it most.\n\nCamera RST\n\nthis is my biggest complaint for most 3D platformers your biggest enemy is going to be this camera.\n\n\nI have a feeling the derpy/janky controls are intentional following in the same vain as say octodad QWOP etc however these games were quick as in you fail and start immediately no fannying around with a minute trip back to the section of the level you were stuck at. I wanted to love this game as something to play when im getting fatigued with overwatch but i just couldnt tolerate the controls. so i have requested a refund. \n\nShould you buy?\n\nthats a tough one:\n\nYes - if you dont care about story, like freeform platforming ( as in the levels open and you arent exactly led directly form puzzle to puzzle) and most imprtantly you are more patient and can tolerate sluggish controls.\n \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1491073940, "timestamp_updated": 1491073940, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.316549926996231079", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30877242": {"recommendationid": "30877242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009072563", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1491054360}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Pros[/b] - Gorgeous, original idea, nostalgic feelings about old style platformers, chill music.

I was skeptical of the controls, but this is what compelled me to play it. I found this to be an immediately charming quality; I couldn't get any sense of it by seeing it, I simply had to play it and experience what it's like.\nThe game stars Noodle, a lazy orange striped snake and his energetic hummingbird friend Doodle. It begins with a cutscene setting up a basic premise to motivate the protagonists into action, and within moments has the player going through the first level introducing the game's common tasks and controls.\n\nIt plays more intuitively than I imagined. Noodle's movement is managed by a button for forward movement, a button to point him straight up, and the joystick for lateral steering. The game has no modesty about giving you the complete snake experience through its mechanics, in which Noodle moves most efficiently by winding left and right across surfaces. Unlike other platformers, Noodle has no means to jump. You are expected to make liberal use of the environment and depend upon your traction against the ground, walls, and bamboo shoots which commonly provide Noodle with means to traverse the level. Noodle behaves like a neatly defined ragdoll rope with locomotive power. It is as forgiving as it is unforgiving. Noodle has a lot of leeway in being able to crawl over surfaces. Often if you can get Noodle's head on a platform, he may be able to shimmy the rest of the way up. You can coil him around bamboo to extend your grasp, and gravity is a bit weak giving Noodle greater horizontal air and easier reaction time. However, Noodle can just as easily become a victim of physical forces to the player's misfortune. His body has distributed weight, and one small slip can cause Noodle's body to begin spilling off of a surface and accumulate weight until he's dragged off completely by the merciless force of gravity. While maneuvering Noodle is about as intuitive as it can be, it can be very challenging to juggle his unusual movement actions to get him to behave how you want, from climbing to coiling to just trying not to fall. There are two other actions, which have Noodle gripping a surface and summoning Doodle to lift up Noodle's tail. While the game frequently reminded me of the grip action early on, I found it to be marginally useful and could not tell when was best to use it. The tail lift had more uses, such as allowing Noodle to climb platforms more easily since the rear weight is diminished, but even then it was hard to find many useful situations for it. Regardless, the controls are fairly good and the player can well improve with practice.\n\nThe gameplay does not have exact solutions for most situations, and this is where a lot of the fun comes in. Noodle's loose, quirky, physics based movement and the openness of the environment let the player work out everything their own way. There are many ways to scale even the simplest arrangements, and you're expected to figure out how to maneuver Noodle on your own to get from point A to B. Sometimes you can cheat and scale odd sections of the environment, and the game pays no mind. You're given carefully constructed worlds, and the correct answer for anything you encounter is \"whatever works\".\nLevels are isolated worlds like a classic arcade style 3D game. The goal of each level is to find three keystones that open the end gate. The arrangement of the levels vary from linear courses with the gate at the very end, to nonlinear maps where the gate is central with the keystones scattered around. The levels are composed of floating islets suspended in the abyss, and should Noodle fall off, he must respawn at one of the checkpoints placed around. Naturally, Noodle is often required to navigate perilous arrangements of platforms and bamboo across gaps and traps, which is the game's primary challenge. Each level is filled with secondary collectibles, a couple dozen blue pickups called wisps and five golden coins for the player to gather for completion's sake, and often require the player to, both figuratively and literally, stick their neck out to collect. These can be hard to gather even in the earlier levels, and will truly test your snake savvy. The common wisps are easy to take for granted early on, but as the levels become more elaborate, they become sacred collectibles and intensely demanding of the player's tenacity.\n\nTrying to be hasty and rush through a level is certain failure. This game demands careful steps and patience, and you will become intimate with the most trivial segments, most especially when attempting to collect the extra items. Be prepared for lots of failures and retries, even when you take your time. Just when you think you got Noodle positioned just right, it's easy to make one wrong move and send Noodle plummeting to his doom, or not notice when he uncoils too much and slips off. Even when you've finally nabbed that item you struggled so much for, you discover that getting back to safe land is the second half of the challenge. This game can get very frustrating, and some may see this as a negative. The controls and mechanics aren't perfect. Noodle's collision is sometimes too finicky and his head can clunk around hitting himself and other elements as you're trying to position him, even for a basic coil maneuver. His collision is so good that it can actually be a detriment; being able to push Noodle's body against itself can make Noodle his own obstacle and put him into tricky situations if he's in a small space. Possibly the worst aspect of gameplay I found was the camera. It has scripted positions in parts of levels and usually it works well, but it can also fight against the player's interests. It sometimes has strange behavior and clings to walls. Given Noodle's trifecta movement control scheme versus the arrangement of level elements, you may sometimes find that you need the camera in two places at once, and finding the right angle is difficult. This can lead to difficulty judging Noodle's aim and positioning and making a bad move you didn't intend, sending Noodle to his demise.\n\nThe game's presentation is superb. The art and graphics are lush and beautifully done, and work together with the famous dulcet tones of David Wise to create a cohesive and lovely entrancing atmosphere. It reminds me very much of a late 3D platformer era gem, and I could easily see it having existed as a PS1 or PS2 classic. The game is light on world and story. There are occasional short cutscenes that line the game with a faint narrative. It can be considered one step above an excuse plot. It's mild and merely sets the game's purpose, but there's just enough established that it could be expanded upon for something more interesting (I'd sure like a sequel that goes further with it). Despite his slothful demeanor, Noodle is quite expressive, showing a range of emotions based on his situation. He relishes collecting items and panics upon falling from heights. Impressively, Noodle can sense if he's losing grip on bamboo and expresses fright if he begins to fall, giving the player feedback of Noodle's traction. And of course, he occasionally sticks out his tongue and hisses just as a snake should.\nThere are 15 levels across 4 differently themed worlds. The themes aren't too diverse, but each are very nice in their own way and introduce relevant gimmicks and hazards that add to the game as it progresses. 15 levels might seem small, but given the game's demand of patience and how large and complex they get, you may end up glad that there's only 15 to contend with given all of the highly challenging collectibles in each. Don't feel too obligated to collect everything on the first go either; clearing the main game will give you something to aid your item hunting. The game may suffer in terms of replay value, but a single full completion may keep you busy for quite a while. Overall I've very much enjoyed the game and recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1490972953, "timestamp_updated": 1490972953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30847348": {"recommendationid": "30847348", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995743097", "num_games_owned": 752, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1565895909}, "language": "english", "review": "When I saw this game on my queue, I initially looked at the price tag. $20 for a somewhat goofy looking game about a snake?

I did a complete 180 and bought the game on the spot. I proceeded to play 3 hours of it and showed it to my friends. \n\nDetails:\nSnake Pass is a physics based 3D platformer with a feel not unlike old Nintendo 3d platformers like banjokazooie. The game runs very smoothly, no real hiccups. Controls are (I'm using an Xbox 360 controller) very smooth and responsive, however the camera can get a little wonky at times. \n\nThe game itself is beautiful, thoughtfully crafted stages with many more than just one path that you can take. The visuals are enticing and vibrant, the snake itself while cartoony has a great deal of depth. A highly expressive face makes the snake extremely adorable, he's definitely wrapped himself around my heart already. \n\nThe puzzles themselves are creative, start off easy and ramp up the challenge at a quick but smooth pace. Again there are multiple solutions to most problems. \n\nOverall:\nI absolutely love this game, the $20 price tag is well worth it for this incredible platformer. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1490940475, "timestamp_updated": 1490940475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30847218": {"recommendationid": "30847218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011584164", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 94, "last_played": 1511067712}, "language": "english", "review": "These sorts of games do not come around very often.\n\nI have heard Snake Pass compared to Snake Rattle 'n Roll before, but I'd compare it more to Ecco the Dolphin. You control an animal in the way that you'd expect it to control. Although Noodle is cartoony and cute and the world he inhabits is pastel and saccharine, the puzzles are difficult, the mechanics are complex, and Noodle really feels like controlling a real snake in the same way that Ecco felt like a real dolphin back in the nineties. Here, Noodle himself IS the game; the entire world he explores is constructed to accomodate him. He isn't an anthropomorphized and stripped down avatar with a few skills vaguely resembling how his body is constructed, and I find that really cool.\n\nThe game is simplistic but not to a fault. It almost feels like a tech demo in some aspects in that it exists for one purpose; to celebrate and show off the main mechanic at work. It was hard to choose between this and Yooka Laylee knowing that Yooka will be a far more rhobust game overall, but the charm at play here made it an easy sell due to the uniqueness of gameplay, as basic though it may be.\n\nOverall so far, I am loving it. A few levels in, I love the construction of the stages. It can be difficult early on, especially collecting some of the early coins since you will not understand the mechanics well enough to be successful, but the learning curve is fair and when you finally figure out how Noodle moves, its so joyously satisfying to wrap him around branches, slither to gain speed, and explore the nooks and crannies of the levels (though it might have been nice if there were more variety between levels, especially the music, enjoyable as it is.)\n\nGreat game!", "timestamp_created": 1490939674, "timestamp_updated": 1490939674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509162306785583496", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30847101": {"recommendationid": "30847101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040567795", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 50, "last_played": 1490937807}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this game of what I played of it.

If you're missing the feeling of old 3d platformer games, try this one.\n\n\nI have felt this kind of joy and amazement last as a kid playing videogames like Rayman, Spyro and Crash. The makers have apparently found liquid nostalgia and childlike wonder and poured it into this game. The feeling you get when you finally do some hard climbing part is great and 100% completing the levels is fun. \n\nVisually the game is good looking, I personally do not like the depth of field effect it makes it hard to look into the distances and see if you missed anything. I have a 5 year old PC with GTX 660\nand i5-3350p 3.10 GHz and it runs ok-ish on max settings but I can get it to run well on slightly lower settings.\n\nControl wise, the games is very innovative. You \"have\" to move like an actual snake, if you just go in a straight line you go very slowly, you need to slither to gain speed. Noodle, (Yes the snakes name is Noodle) can feel a bit slippery especially when trying to climb up a bamboo pole or along a straight horizontal pole. But otherwise, wrapping yourself around obstacles and bamboo is very satisfying and at someparts surprisingly challenging.\n\nI have not yet finished the game so I cannot say aything about it's lenght, but I have already gotten 20\u20ac worth in the 2-3 hours that I played. \n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is even the slightest bit curious about the mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1490908580, "timestamp_updated": 1490908580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30841302": {"recommendationid": "30841302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046049551", "num_games_owned": 811, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 81, "last_played": 1596747927}, "language": "english", "review": "What a great game! \nIf you like games like Grow Home and it's sequel Grow Up you'll love this one for sure as this one also has a unique way of moving around the world!", "timestamp_created": 1490907952, "timestamp_updated": 1490907952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30840715": {"recommendationid": "30840715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196925090", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1490995941}, "language": "english", "review": "This is sooo cool!

A game about sneks\u2026 or\u2026 danger noodles - as professional herpetologists say, Yes, that\u2019s exactly what we have. A big glorious loveable noodle and his happy little birdy sidekick. The tag team are off on an adventure to repair the broken gates and save the land from an dark, menacing, evil.\n\nIf I could honestly sum up this entire review in one word and walk away happy knowing I\u2019ve expressly shared my feelings -that word would be joy. But, in taking on this review I have charged myself with the duty to give you at least some sort of critical breakdown.\n\nHopping into the game I had these strange feelings of nostalgia. That\u2019s weird, right? I had never played nor seen this game before and yet.. I was sitting here staring at something that made me feel the familiarity of an old friend. \nThen suddenly it hit me.. this games atmosphere reminded me quite a bit of some of the older Rare titles. For those uninitiated, RARE where the developers behind such games as Banjo Kazooie, Conker\u2019s bad fur day, diddy kong racing, and Donkey Kong 64 \u2013 just to name a few. Mind you, I compare this game loosely with the previously mentioned titles and only really bring up the feeling of similarity as it\u2019s the best way I can start to describe this game.  Beyond the feeling itself this game is like no other I have ever played. \n\nSnake simulator 2018 is a platform puzzler with a very unique mechanic. That mechanic being the ability to hop into the role of a snake. Now you may be asking yourself what exactly that means.. and well it means that you slither, climb, and coil your way through each level.  It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. The controls in this game are the biggest challenge to overcome. jumping into the game and trying to figure out how to control noodle is not as simple as just receiving a tutorial screen and having a breakdown of button mappings. Yes his name really is noodle\u2026 I love you developers\u2026  if for nothing else, your awesome naming.\n\nWith a keyboard, learning to maneuver was a consent battle \u2013 mind you, it was a battle I was determined to overcome.  I couldn\u2019t stop thinking to myself that this game would play so much better  with a controller on a consol.. there\u2019s good reason for that. After doing my research I found out that this game was indeed a multiplatform release. \nIt\u2019s on just about every modern day console.  Wth some relief, I am pleased to report that beyond a seriously lacking options menu and the somewhat awkward controls \u2013 there are few damaging signs of a PC port, rest easy my PC pals. \n\nAs I pushed on I slowly became more accustomed to the weird controls. Happy that I had slain the first obstacle I started looking towards what difficulties I would stumble upon next.  Sadly, I was a little let down. The maps are well put together and do have a few challenging parts \u2013 but as far as overall difficulty goes I must inform that, with ease, I overcame everything thrown at me. This isn\u2019t me trying to brag that I\u2019m a MLG superstar or anything\u2026 it\u2019s just that - the game has a habit of bombarding you with checkpoints left and right.  I bring this up it took me 7 or 8 levels before I finally experienced my first death. Immediately upon feeling some challenge the game promptly spawned me five feet from where noodle was turned into my new wallet. This can be a double-edged sword \u2013 I do feel like this game is geared more towards the casual platformer and puzzler crowd so I guess in some respects it can get away with this. Overall the game does get progressively harder, but, with only 15 levels currently within the game \u2013 the challenge felt like it was only begging to start near the end of the last 3 maps  . \n\nAfter you beat each section of maps you unlock a time trial mode. There\u2019s also blue orbs and coins to collect in each level\u2026 but, beyond that \u2013 that\u2019s the game. It\u2019s really quite a simplistic game, and I don\u2019t mean that in a bad way. The current cost, at least on PC, is $20 which if I was going to buy the game again knowing  everything I know now \u2013 I would.\nIt took me just a little over four hours to work my way through the 15 levels. It was a small little burst of enjoyment and I was really quite sad when I realized that my journey had ended. There is some replayability with the time trials and collectables, but, beyond that I don\u2019t see myself getting anything more than 10 hours out of this\u2026 Unless, they add more levels..  developers.. please? \n\nUltimately, my final thoughts on this game are good. I had an enjoyable run \u2013 as short as it was. And, In the end I didn\u2019t feel like I wasted my time or get uncontrollably frustrated at broken mechanic. There is an overall story. And it did had its charms but in my opinion it ended up being just a small part of the game. I would go into more detail with it, however, I don\u2019t want to spoil anything for those interested. It was what it was on face value \u2013 a budget worthy light hearted-puzzle platformer. This game is sort of like what I\u2019m going for in this review.

Right now I'm neutral. Snake Pass is a brighly colored, physics based platforming collect-a-thon.  The core objective of each level is to find 3 gems to open a portal to the next level of \"Haven\". There is some light puzzle solving involving switches or pressure plates, etc., but the most substatial challenge seems to come from the optional collect-a-thon in each level.  Finding the 20 optional bubble crystal things (I'm just going to call them \"snake charms\") is fairly easy, but collecing the 5 coins can be brutal.\n \nYour enjoyment of the game comes down to how quickly you master the controls.  Although vastly different, this game shares a similarity with Surgeon Simulator, such that most of your frustration will be due to your inability to effectively perform a task you think should be so easily performed.  So far this really only seems to be a major issue If you are trying to collect everything in a given level.   \n\nControl learning curve:\nIt took quite a while for me to get the hang of movement controls. This is because they are based off of the camera position and not the snakes head.  Therefore to climb corkscrew style up bamboo, you can't just hold left or right on the analog stick and slither your way up. You must instead rotate the analog stick clockwise or anti-clockwise as you ascend.  This is generally fine, but if you start to shift the camera as you move, you can quickly become unraveled.

You play as a snake named Noodle. You slither around with the aid of your bird pal trying to repair the destruction to your homeland by fixing all of the gateways. The story is told through text, and there isn\u2019t much else to say about it.\n\nSnake Pass features character control and movement, that looks and feels as if it\u2019s actually simulating a snake. The way you slither by moving side to side along the ground, or how you can coil your entire body around just about everything in the environment is a really great. It\u2019s pretty awesome to have so much interaction within the environment as you scale up and around bamboo poles and other terrain to make your way through the levels. You also have a bird companion to help guide you, and he can also help you out buy lifting up your tail.\n\nAside from the snake simulation, the game has a large focus on exploration and collecting. There are only 3 main items that you have to collect to finish the chapter, but each level is chock-full of items to find. These collectibles are not mandatory, but trying to find and get all of them is meant to be a large portion of the game. Some will be easy to get, while others will likely have you dying several times before you succeed.\n\nDying causes you to lose any progress since the last checkpoint. These checkpoints can be activated as many times as you\u2019d like, but there are times where you\u2019ll probably wish there were a few more checkpoints available.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list][*]fantastic level design, with lots of exploring and climbing to find a multitude of collectibles sprawled over 4 diverse worlds, and 15 different chapters\n[*]slithering your way through the levels is awesome; the movement and controls are extremely responsive and feel precise, but they will take some time to master\n[*]nice visuals, wonderful environments, and the most adorable snake ever; Noodle is such a distinct character, and his animations make him all the more loveable\n[*]gradual increase in difficulty from child\u2019s play to snake-death simulator 2017\n[*]check points, no time limit, and infinite respawns (this may be too casual for some)\n[*]excellent upbeat music, and well done sound effects throughout the game\n[*]keyboard and mouse controls are all customizable, and there is full controller support - using a controller is easier and smoother (but I didn\u2019t realize that until after finishing the game using the mouse and keyboard)[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list][*]the camera angles can be a little problematic, and a bit of a nuisance at times (especially in tight spots)\n[*](nitpick) bird pal doesn't always listen right away when you command him to pick up your tail\n[*](nitpick) there's not much to the story[/list]\n\nIt took me over 8 hours to complete the game while gathering 87% of all the collectibles. The last few levels kicked my butt so hard, and I died so, so much there. After finishing the campaign, you unlock snake vision, and can go back and find any collectibles you missed earlier, or even test out your slithering skills on the timed runs.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nSnake Pass is an endearing platformer with a unique game design that is executed well. Don\u2019t be fooled by the overwhelming cuteness though, because behind the relaxed demeanor, some parts are sure to challenge you. If you\u2019re looking for something with fresh mechanics to try, and enjoy exploring and collecting, you might want to check out Snake Pass.\n\nIf you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curations [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AzralynnReviews#curation]here.[/url]\nYou can also view this review on my website [url=http://www.azralynn.com/review-snake-pass-game/]here.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1490814170, "timestamp_updated": 1491777197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717131376266479492", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30816871": {"recommendationid": "30816871", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970571809", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 118, "last_played": 1490922717}, "language": "english", "review": "Its all in the grip.

Although you might struggle at times, it's part of the game's challenge and you'll be able to retry every obstacle again until you get it right.\n\nThe controls are simple. You have the option to play with a keyboard, but I chose a controller as I found it easier.\nOne of your buttons moves your character forward, while another lifts his head upwards. This allows you to scale small obstacles in front of you. Finally, you have a grip button, which will tighten your body around whatever you are wrapped onto.\n\nWith these basic abilities, you can scale everything in the game. The fun comes in when you need to go up tall scaffoldings. The tricky part is not falling, so you need to make sure you wrap around poles on your way up to fight against gravity. The game really feels unique through its mechanics.\n\nYou have the ability to ask your little hummingbird friend to grab and lift your tail. This is quite situational and can help sometimes to counter the weight of your tail if you feel you're about to fall off a ledge, but I found it can get in the way if you want as much \"snake body\" as possible to wrap around stuff.\n\nLevels are quite large, and are littered with different kinds of collectibles, which incentivises exploration. Although it is all optional, and you can simply go for the main 3 gems needed to complete the level.\n\nThe music is really great, and made me feel super happy. It goes very well with the charming aesthetic of the game. The colours are vibrant, and the animations look cute. It's nice to see a game with these kind of graphics again.\n\nHowever, I have two gripes with the game. The first is the slight lack of checkpoints.\nSometimes you die and might lose 5 minutes of progress, and it's frustrating to have to recollect the stuff you already did. I get not letting you keep the stuff you collected if you die, because it takes away the challenge of some of the collectibles. You could simply slither over a precarious beam, grab the coin, fall to your demise and then respawn, easy. Part of the challenge is coming back alive after collecting it. But it would be nice if the game could somehow checkpoint you as soon as you get to solid and safe ground, or perhaps just have a checkpoint waiting near deadly drops so you dont have to go aaaaall the way back after failing.\n\nMy 2nd problem with the game is you need to move in a sort of zigzag motion to actually gain speed and move forward. It can be quite tiring if you are going long distances. I get that it makes sense, and snakes do that, but I would have honestly prefered just holding forward and moving like that. It's not a huge problem, as it's quite rare to do it so frequently, but it's still an annoyance.\n\nOverall though, I'm having a lot of fun with the game. It's a really charming world ot be in, and the gameplay feels very rewarding!
