No matter which path you try to take in the game, you'll hit a dead-end. Go the Pacifist route, and either Undyne or Asgore will put an end to your run (or Muffet, for that matter). Take the Genocide path and Sans will destroy you.

novelty by this point.  But let's pretend for a moment this game just came out, long before it took the world by storm with its joie de vivre.\n\nWhat begins as a simplistic RPG with strong Earthbound/Mother roots about a child falling into a world of monsters, devolves into either a wondrous fairytale about how Love and Hope can defeat anything, or a horrifying nightmare that brings the end of existence by your own hand.  Undertale is a rare example of a game that is so aware of its mechanics, it encourages you to either succumb to its urge, or defy it entirely.\n\nThrough various lands in a charming retro visual style, you encounter various monsters who you can either give Mercy and befriend them to make their lives better, or Kill and erase their voice from a world that gets ever quieter from your crusade.  The game breathes on its exceptional writing which, much like the original Mother, can be called \"strange, funny and heart-breaking\" depending on your interactions with the various beasties.\n\nThe amount of recognition the game has of one's efforts or atrocities is surprising, even to the point that it will question you, the person sitting behind the screen, if this is the path you wish to take.  Undertale is not afraid to make you feel loved and rewarded for your Mercy, but nor is it afraid to make you feel truly monstrous if all you do is Kill.\n\nIf there are any issues with this game, is that the soundtrack, as wonderful as it is, can be rather inconsistent in its tone.  Some songs are delightful 8-bit melodies, whilst others take a mini-orchestral vibe of the modern age, giving a strange dissonance to things.  That, and you can never play this game again once you finish it, for if you try to after reaching one of the two \"True\" endings, it tries very much to discourage you from replays for the sake of its creations.\n\nIf you are the sort of person who wants to replay this game again and again, you're better off buying it from Toby Fox's own site as a standalone copy, since it's much easier to \"move\" save files on that version rather than Steam's obtuse cloud-based system.  But Undertale is a game you should experience at least once, to understand why it's so beloved, and understand why it became one of the most successful indie games ever made with a wealth of inspiration from Earthbound, Yume Nikki and even OFF, combining into a wondrous stage.", "timestamp_created": 1700448365, "timestamp_updated": 1700448498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150467174": {"recommendationid": "150467174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842574308", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 2327, "last_played": 1700425905}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect game!", "timestamp_created": 1700446138, "timestamp_updated": 1700446138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150465569": {"recommendationid": "150465569", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079678962", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 413, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1700613270}, "language": "english", "review": "sans", "timestamp_created": 1700443701, "timestamp_updated": 1700443701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150465122": {"recommendationid": "150465122", "author": {"steamid": "76561199223931790", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1486, "playtime_at_review": 630, "last_played": 1700750615}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing recommend it to everyone", "timestamp_created": 1700443020, "timestamp_updated": 1700443020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150463622": {"recommendationid": "150463622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053795035", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1042, "last_played": 1653231512}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es mi juego favorito.\nCuando juegues, no te preocupes por nada y c\u00e9ntrate en pas\u00e1rtelo bien jugando.

The story is driven by your choices, and every decision you make has consequences, leading to multiple endings that encourage replayability.\n\nGameplay:\nThe combat system is a unique blend of bullet hell and turn-based mechanics. What sets Undertale apart is the option to spare your enemies rather than defeat them. This moral choice system adds depth to the gameplay, making you think twice before taking a life. The puzzles are cleverly designed, adding an extra layer of engagement.\n\nHumor and Wit:\nUndertale's writing is witty and clever, injecting humor into unexpected moments. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, yet it can hit you with emotional punches that resonate long after you've finished playing.\n\nReplayability:\nUndertale is a game that begs to be replayed. The multiple story paths, secret encounters, and the impact of player choices ensure that each playthrough offers a fresh experience. Discovering the nuances of different routes is a joy, and the game rewards exploration.\n\nCommunity and Modding:\nThe Undertale community on Steam is vibrant, and the game supports mods, adding even more content and creativity to an already rich experience. The passionate fanbase speaks volumes about the impact of this game.\n\nIn conclusion, Undertale is not just a game; it's an emotional rollercoaster that challenges your perceptions of choice and consequence.

Everything from the story and characters, down to the soundtrack makes this game lovely.  At first glance, the pixel-y graphics may turn you off from playing it, but if you somehow haven't yet, PLEASE DO. The characters are full of life, and every time you have to make a decision it feels REALLY important because it feels like you're affecting real life people, with thoughts and feelings. The dialogue manages to find a good balance between being funny and serious, overall making for a good, lighthearted time, with an engaging story. (Papyrus my beloved) \n\n(Slight spoilers in this section) \nNeedless to say, I so deeply wish that I had played this sooner. Aside from the game itself, it's so so nice to finally understand the memes and references after years of not. AND OH MY GOD, THE SOUNDTRACK. I have heard SO SO MANY songs and sound effects that I knew beat by beat, BUT HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE FROM UNDERTALE!! Personally, Bonetrousle is a favourite. I've only owned this game for a week and already have 28 hours on it, and have completed the neutral, and true pacifist routes. Planning on genocide next, then I'm off to Deltarune to see what that's all about!!!!! (With the chapters that are currently out, anyway.) \n\n100% recommend this game, ONLY 10 DOLLARS FOR A BLAST AND A HALF!!!!! (I will now be saying NYEHEHEHE every time I make spaghetti or pasta.)  \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1699994492, "timestamp_updated": 1699994492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

It's a wonderful story, and an awesome adventure I will definitely embark on again. Same route.\n\nPossible spoilers below for mandatory Neutral ending & True Pacifist route:\n\nThis is the first game I've played where I absolutely wanted to backtrack every area before finishing the game. By that point, and thanks to the beautiful soundtrack, I was moved to say goodbye to every single monster person I met along the way. As I did, I reflected on how much I'd fallen in love with the world of the Underground, and everyone in it. I just wanted to spend some more time there before crossing the threshold, but I didn't expect to be rewarded so thoroughly by going back to the very beginning: the flower patch where you wake up on. I left that area teary-eyed just thinking about what was said.\n\nKnowing that there's still more mysteries to ponder or uncover, like that door in Snowdin that looks like it leads to Waterfall, or what Sans' room or Papyrus' coolshed look like, makes me look even more forward to my second True Pacifist run. I've already read up on some details of the other possible routes and endings, and at most, I'll read up on them more in a wiki or watch someone play them on YouTube. I'm a good boy, I don't want to kill anyone. And I don't think I've seen a more rewarding happy ending to a game, even one with some very dark or extreme horror moments in it (it doesn't get more extreme than Flowey). Next I'll want to get more familiar with the \"fun points\" system and figuring out how to find more of the secrets without getting spoiled too much before I start my next run. A lot is said or hinted at about W.D. Gaster, the former Royal Scientist, based on some of the wiki entries I've read, so I'd be especially delighted to find out more about them on a second run.\n\nAnyways, 10/10. Just the right length, could've gone longer but doesn't need to. Amazingly evocative soundtrack and an adorable cast of characters I would love to see more of.

"review": "\"Undertale\" is an extraordinary game that blends unique gameplay, an engaging storyline, and distinctive humor. Instead of following traditional role-playing game conventions, \"Undertale\" gives players the option to interact with enemies and resolve conflicts without resorting to violence.\n\nOne of the game's most remarkable features is its sense of humor. Creator Toby Fox infused the game with witty dialogue, eccentric characters, and absurd situations. Some moments will have you laughing uncontrollably, while others provoke thoughtful reflection.\n\nGameplay-wise, \"Undertale\" offers a unique experience. You can avoid battles by engaging in conversations with enemies and persuading them to let you go. This creates a unique sense of morality and choice, influencing the ultimate progression of the storyline.\n\nThe musical score deserves special mention as well. Composed by Toby Fox himself, the soundtrack adds atmosphere and emotional depth to the game. The melodies are as diverse as the characters and linger in your memory long after completing the game.\n\n\"Undertale\" is not just a game; it's an experience that leaves a lasting impact. Playful, clever, and unpredictable, this world offers a unique adventure and plenty of laughter.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1699816890, "timestamp_updated": 1699816890, "voted_up": true,

It's a very conflicted game. On the one hand, the actual gameplay is great, the battle system is super simple yet innovative and very fun, and the battle music is absolute fire (when the game stops yammering at you with stupid useless sound effects and you can actually hear it). \n\nOn the other hand, the story is basically non-existent and literally every character physically hurt me with how horrible and unappealing they all are. The characters are so bad that it makes the gameplay almost unplayable, since in order to get a good ending you need to not kill enemies, and killing enemies is the only enjoyable activity in the game. And I say that as an avid RPG fan, I love exploring the lore in games and getting to know the characters, but all the characters in Undertale are repulsive in how awful they are, how badly they are developed, and how desperately the game wants you to care about these horrible monsters despite their only motivation being escaping their prison and literally genociding humanity.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is that it sabotages itself. As I said before, the best (and only good part) of the game is the combat system, but the game doesn't want you to use the combat system. EVER. If you're going for the good ending, you need to not kill any enemies, which means running or using Secret of Monkey Island-like text prompts to convince the enemies to not hurt you, which means not enjoying the battle system. If you are going for the bad ending you need to kill ALL of the monsters, including repeatedly grinding on random encounter long past the point that it is enjoyable. Your reward for this? You kill all the bosses in 1 hit, meaning you STILL don't get to enjoy the battle system. The most enjoyable way to play is to just fight enemies like you expect to, then endure literal hours of the game telling you why you are playing the game wrong.\n\nIf someone were to take the battle system and write a real story around it, it would make an amazing game. As it stands the entire game was made by Toby Fox and after playing it, I really think he needs some therapy.\n\nThe single greatest highlight of the game was the Mettaton Opera scene, and I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing that it's a blatant ripoff of the opera scene from Final Fantasy 6.\n\nOverall this is definitely a game that doesn't need to be played. Pick up some tracks from OCRemix and save yourself the pain of trying to enjoy this mess of unlikable garbage.", "timestamp_created": 1698974805, "timestamp_updated": 1699051632, "voted_up": false,

I want to begin by expressing the deepest and most sincere apology for my actions, which resulted in the loss of your brother. There are no words that can adequately convey the remorse and regret I feel, but I hope you can find it in your heart to hear me out and perhaps find a way to forgive me.\n\nWhat I did was not only a grave mistake but an unforgivable act, one that has caused immeasurable pain and suffering to you, your family, and to the entire community. I know that I can never truly make amends for the pain I've caused, but I hope that you will at least consider my apology as a genuine effort to take responsibility for my actions and to seek forgiveness.\n\nI understand the bond between brothers is one of the most profound and unbreakable connections in the world. The loss of your brother is a tragedy that I cannot fathom, and the weight of that responsibility lies squarely on my shoulders. I should never have let my anger and recklessness lead me down a path that could hurt not only him but you and everyone who cared about him.\n\nI want you to know that there is no justification for my actions. I deeply regret the choices I made and the consequences they had. I wish I could turn back time and undo what I've done, but unfortunately, that's not possible. What I can do, however, is promise you that I will do everything in my power to prevent such a tragedy from happening again and to honor the memory of your brother in any way you see fit.\n\nI have been reflecting on my actions ever since that terrible day, and I have come to realize the magnitude of the pain I have caused. I am filled with sorrow and guilt, and I am committed to taking whatever steps necessary to make amends, whether it be through facing the legal consequences or providing any support or assistance that you may need during this difficult time.\n\nI understand that forgiveness may be a long and difficult journey, and I do not expect it to happen overnight, if at all. What I hope for, at the very least, is that you will consider the possibility of someday finding it in your heart to forgive me. I know I don't deserve it, but it would mean the world to me if you could find a way to release yourself from the burden of anger and hatred that my actions have undoubtedly caused.\n\nI also understand if you cannot find it in your heart to forgive me, and if you wish to distance yourself from me completely. I respect your feelings and choices, and I will do my best to support them. I only ask that you allow me the opportunity to express my remorse and offer my help, even if it's not readily accepted.\n\nI want to make amends not only for your sake but for my own growth and self-improvement. I want to learn from my mistakes and ensure that such a tragedy never occurs again, even if it doesn't change the past. Your brother's memory will always be a haunting reminder of the terrible consequences of my actions, and I will carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.\n\nI hope that someday, you might find it within yourself to consider my apology. Until then, I will continue to reflect on my actions and strive to be a better person. I am truly sorry for what I've done, Sans, and I can only hope that you might one day find it in your heart to forgive me, even if it takes a lifetime.\n\nSincerely,\n\ng0rmsy...", "timestamp_created": 1698643978, "timestamp_updated": 1698643978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510959148406982422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149175810": {"recommendationid": "149175810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803726460", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7291, "last_played": 1597678553}, "language": "english", "review": "frick this", "timestamp_created": 1698643681, "timestamp_updated": 1698643681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149175685": {"recommendationid": "149175685", "author": {"steamid": "76561199169282435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1687713356}, "language": "spanish", "review": "00000000000000\n000     0      00000\n00000000000000\n00000000000000\n0    o      o    o    oo\n oooooooooooooo\n", "timestamp_created": 1698643381, "timestamp_updated": 1698643381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149172394": {"recommendationid": "149172394", "author": {"steamid": "76561199130156092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 711, "last_played": 1699127656}, "language": "english", "review": "i used to avoid the hell out of this game after an experience i had in high school with a dude who was genuinely a bad person, and happened to be obsessed with this game (he talked 'like papyrus', or i guess his head cannon of what that would sound like. it was cringe). i def had the \"oh its just a cringe game\" mentality. well this game was gifted to me and i figured i may as well play it, maybe it'll give me a laugh.

"language": "english", "review": "Ok, so going into this I knew that a lot of people had raved about this, and that it had a corny but blatant cult following. My friend got me this game and I was interested enough to try it out, even though at first glance it didnt look like much. \n\nBut now that I've played it, I'm speechless, there are so few games that will fully immerse a player...... Katana Zero, Risk of Rain 2, Deep Rock Galactic, Nova Drift...... (which has an undertale reference)... But ALL of these games look good from the get-go. This one didn't, this one uses the most simplistic, basic looking details.....\n\nSo how do you make a game perfect, how do you make a game so engrossing that it is not only comparable to greats like Katana Zero, Nova Drift, and DRG, but manages to do so without the extra assistance of stunning Nvidia shaders, or flashy explosions, or tons of money.\n\nYou take a cast of characters, lets say about 9 or 10, and you make them so likable that its impossible not to be rooting for them.\n\nYou create a sound track, one so good, that many of the songs are now recognizable from RHYTHM GAMES.\n\nCharge 10$, provide 10 hours worth of content (it is rare to get a dollar to hour ratio from any game, especially ones that manage to entertain you for every single freaking second)\n\nAllow the player to go down TONS of different paths because of their actions.\n\nHave a plot so thick it puts MARVEL to shame\n\nWork on the game until it REEKS with the stench of effort, time, and pride.\n\nThat is what makes undertale so amazing, its nothing short of a masterpiece with a soundtrack that has become synonymous with gaming, a plot that can outwit Black Panther (which got 99% in rotten tomatoes) and a cast of characters so likeable that again, they are all heros. \n\nOnly after playing this game, have I realized what I have been missing for 8 years.\n\nThank you Toby Fox\n\n(I played the true

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son found this game at Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3", "timestamp_created": 1697941480, "timestamp_updated": 1697941480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.405797094106674194", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148640815": {"recommendationid": "148640815", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089656970", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1125, "last_played": 1697943860}, "language": "english", "review": "goats", "timestamp_created": 1697939168, "timestamp_updated": 1697939168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148639113": {"recommendationid": "148639113", "author": {"steamid": "76561199487735527", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 797, "last_played": 1698099568}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is like super duper awesome,", "timestamp_created": 1697936369, "timestamp_updated": 1697936369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148639007": {"recommendationid": "148639007", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229184959", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2000, "last_played": 1698698205}, "language": "english", "review": "sans is stupid \n\nEdit:nvm hes easy froggits imposiible", "timestamp_created": 1697936206, "timestamp_updated": 1697936230, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562256991863250732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148638031": {"recommendationid": "148638031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278393173", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77, "playtime_at_review": 2107, "last_played": 1700281083}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy. Where do I start?\n\nI absolutely love this game. The music is something I'm listening to every day, I absolutely love the storyline and how it's built and it's just a fun game to play overall. \n\nThere is nothing I can imagine for fun than the [spoiler]Asriel[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Photoshop Flowey[/spoiler] fights. It's just so well-done. It's not often I play video games anymore, but this just swept me off my feet. It knows how to convey a story adequately, it handles fights so different from a regular game and... I'm a sucker for pixelated retro graphics.\n\nNow, just because it's an amazing game, it's not without its problems. Specifically the Genocide Route. It feels like a last minute addition. Contrary to the Pacifist Route, it's just \"kill things over and over and one-shot bosses.\" I mean, it's a coherent story, which I give Toby full credit for, but there's no substance. Alright, everyone's left, but the bosses are there. Great. There's three unique bosses in the Genocide Route, [spoiler]Undyne the Undying, Mettaton NEO and Sans[/spoiler]. [spoiler]Sans and Undyne the Undying[/spoiler] are just... way to hard to deal with. and [spoiler]Mettaton NEO? Dude, he can't even attack! [/spoiler] They gave him a nifty little outfit for what? Fashion points? It makes it really clear that Toby designed the game around the Pacifist Route and Genocide was an after-thought. \n\nSo, my TL;DR: It's worth it for the storyline of the Pacifist Route, not so much the Genocide Route.", "timestamp_created": 1697934663, "timestamp_updated": 1697934663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148638030": {"recommendationid": "148638030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881402391", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1698519263}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Historia 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1697934662, "timestamp_updated": 1697934662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148635758": {"recommendationid": "148635758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321097375", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3605, "last_played": 1697932342}, "language": "english", "review": "it is a cool game", "timestamp_created": 1697931134, "timestamp_updated": 1697931134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148634076": {"recommendationid": "148634076", "author": {"steamid": "76561199054440487", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1698602826}, "language": "english", "review": "funny bone man", "timestamp_created": 1697928633, "timestamp_updated": 1697928633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148633258": {"recommendationid": "148633258", "author": {"steamid": "76561199545655761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 354, "last_played": 1698016644}, "language": "english", "review": "SUPER fun game, its incredibly old but its nostalgic and very well made :3\n(if you do genocide, with care, get the hell away from me :>)", "timestamp_created": 1697927397, "timestamp_updated": 1697927397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148632919": {"recommendationid": "148632919", "author": {"steamid": "76561199083107067", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 330, "last_played": 1697926900}, "language": "spanish", "review": "cguig", "timestamp_created": 1697926931, "timestamp_updated": 1697926931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148629188": {"recommendationid": "148629188", "author": {"steamid": "76561199474993520", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 861, "last_played": 1697922072}, "language": "english", "review": "SANS IS SHITTTTTTT", "timestamp_created": 1697922197, "timestamp_updated": 1697922197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148627503": {"recommendationid": "148627503", "author": {"steamid": "76561199246859861", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 161, "playtime_at_review": 2061, "last_played": 1699908881}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played many video games before and I can say with absolute certainty that I've experienced anything like playing UNDERTALE before.

"last_played": 1667491417}, "language": "english", "review": "if you don't want to be spoiled do not read this, everyone knows undertale is a good game, so i still recommend it, but it has issues once i played, Deltarune chapter 1 and 2.\n\nfirst problem Alphys is a god awful character, this character legit spams calls you every 5 seconds about anime, and i do agree undertale is a funny game, the problem is Alphys is not funny, basically taking control away from the player every 5 seconds in hotland, is not fun the other issue i have with Alphys, is the character legit constantly lies to you until near near the end of the game, where Alphys just decided to tell you that, \"you have to kill asgore,\" legit why did you not tell us that, after the spam phone calls, every 5 seconds, would of been way more helpful, another issue is this is what ruins the pacifist run for me, Alphys straight up created flowey for no reason, and locked the Algimates in the true lab for absolutely no reason, i know Alphys did release the Algimates in the pacifist run, but why trap the Algimates in the lab, i mean the Algimates are fused monsters, and that's the only issue with them, aside from that the Algimates are 100% fine, based on what the pacifist run shows, which makes Alphys to me really deserves to suffer, and does not want me to help this character at all, because Alphys is supposed to be a scientist, why is this character making the dumbest moves possible, and creating enemies or antagonists, i'm not joking Alphys made us deal with 3 conflicts, or antagonists so i'm thankful Deltarune improved Alphys massively from what little amount i seen that character in deltarune. \n\nsecond problem the game is way to easy, i honestly think this game would of gotten replay value if the game bothered having the entire game having hard mode, don't get me wrong the first time playing undertale is fantastic due to the great story and characters and good music but if you played it the second time, you find out how easy it is to spare the enemies, and how easy it is to dodge its attacks, which makes the game boring once you know the story and characters, because the gameplay legit don't really offer much. \n\nthird problem why was genocide run even made, i understand the developer wanted me to feel bad for doing it, and make me regret what i did, but the problem is it fails at that, because genocide run is god dam boring, most of what your doing is grinding until you reach 2 of the best boss fights in the game, the problem with genocide run is people do it to fight the best bosses in the game, and wont feel bad what they are doing, because they have a reason to do the genocide run, which fails the whole point of, \"making you feel bad on doing the genocide run,\" and seeing undying the undying and sans boss fight, made me wish undertale had those type of battles, because those 2 bosses are legit the only replay value i can think of, with undertale which is kinda bad, and shows that deltarune improved the gameplay of undertale a lot, where deltarune rewards players with skill to do near misses, also the ending for genocide run, is legit a god dam insult, i don't know why chara would want to bring the entire world back after 10 minutes of waiting, that makes no sense i'm not saying chara is evil, i'm saying the player deserved the world to be erased, if they are willing to murder all of monster kind for no reason, so why did chara give the world back to the player, that destroyed everything that chara cared about, that legit ruins the whole point of genocide, where consequences mean nothing in genocide, and no chara jumpscare in pacifist don't count, because you can always attempt the neutral runs, and chara wont jump scare you there, which means that chara jump scare in pacifist means nothing, and i will get on about the pacifist ending later, i know genocide is not supposed to be fun or enjoyable, but the messaging with genocide run fails, by having 2 of the best boss battles in the game, where you basically given people a reason to do it.\n\nthird problem why even get the secrets in this game, they legit offer nothing this is again where deltarune does it better, because deltarune has secret challenging bosses, which gives deltarune more replay value, because it rewards the player being skilled, but with undertale secrets its basically just there to add mystery in the game, where most people would only play undertale once, because again it has no replay value, \n\nfourth problem if you think hard enough the pacifist ending legit is bad, i know i'm not suppose to take undertale seriously, because its a funny game, but undertale has serious moments and this pacifist ending, basically somehow humanity is 100% perfectly fine, Asgore murdering 6 kids, and toriel somehow owning frisk, when she has no Custody with that kid character, legit is frisk parents dead or alive, because toriel is now living in the human world, how did no one mention to toriel about that, also are we gonna forget sans legit would of killed us or attacked us, if toriel did not promise him, so why is frisk perfectly fine living with, Asgore or sans or undying or metatton, because those people while they do whats best for monster kind, but not for human kind and there is security cameras everywhere in the underground or nearly everywhere, that could possibly recorded the evidence, of those type of things,  this is why i prefer the neutral endings in undertale, because it shows what ending you believed was the best or worst for the characters, and shows the consequences by your decisions, but the pacifist run legit does not sound like a good ending to me at all, i mean yes monsters are finally free and can enjoy the surface, but what human would want monsters in the surface, this basically will cause another human and monster war conflict in the near future, meaning everything frisk would of done, would of been a waste of time, and given monsters, possibly a even worse life, i'm not sure if its just me, but the pacifist ending legit is bad to me the more i think about it.\n\nfifth problem true lab is the worst part of the game for me, legit i'm convinced this part is rushed they basically tried to make the Algimates scary here or creepy, and basically fails massively for me i was basically laughing at how bad they attempted to be scary or creepy with the Algimates, once i found out that in the pacifist run they are peaceful, also the praise i have with undertale is you have a choice on what you decide to do, the true lab straight up removes the fight choice, which means Algimates take no damage, meaning you have no choice but to spare the Algimates, even though they are attacking you, the only good part about true lab is we get more character development with asriel and chara, but how the hell does Alphys have these recordings of 2 kids that are dead, is Asgore and toriel suppose to have them, because they cared about those 2 massively, why does Alphys have it that character clearly don't care about those 2, based on the 5 second spam phone calls in hotland, and that Alphys saw legit 0 issues creating flowey, when the entry numbers shows how much Alphys regrets making the Algimates, legit true lab is a massive downfall on quality, when deltarune with jevil and spamton, is way more scary and creepy, than true lab will ever be. \n\nnow i did say a lot of negatives with this game, the reason why i typed them in, because i clearly like this game, if i did not like this game i would of not searched for issues, and not made this long essay, i don't want to spoil any good parts of this game, because this game only has around 5 problems i can think of, some people say 5 minor problems, but still undertale is a 8/10 game for me, its legit a good game but clearly is flawed to me. \n", "timestamp_created": 1697607450, "timestamp_updated": 1697607450, "voted_up": true,

Picture this: You control a kid who falls into an underground world full of monsters.\n\nP: Alright, underground world, I'm intrigued. So, what's the gameplay like?\n\nS: Oh, it's like a blend of a bullet-hell shooter and a rhythm game. And it's gonna be brutal, like, face-palm-your-keyboard kind of brutal.\n\nP: (raising an eyebrow) Brutal, you say?\n\nS: Yep, brutal. And it's got these monsters with wacky attacks. They're like, \"Hey, I'm a Froggit, and I'm gonna throw flies at you!\" But it's the difficulty that'll get ya.\n\nP: (leaning back) Wow, wow, wow, wow.\n\nS: (nodding) Super easy, barely an inconvenience.\n\nP: (chuckling) Alright, tell me more.\n\nS: There's this character named Muffet, a cute spider lady who's all like, \"Hi there! Would you like to buy a spider donut? It's for a good cause,\" and it's so adorable, you can't help but simp for her.\n\nP: (leaning in) Tell me more about Muffet.\n\nS: She's got these big eyes and this sweet, syrupy voice. But, watch out, if you don't have enough gold, she'll wrap you up in her web and demand payment.\n\nP: (smirking) A spider donut, got it.\n\nS: But here's the kicker - choices matter. Like, really matter. You can choose to spare or fight monsters, and your actions have consequences. You can even spare the final boss!\n\nP: (surprised) Really?\n\nS: Oh yeah, and the story is so unapologetically hard-hitting. It's got insane plot twists, and it'll make you laugh, cry, and question the nature of reality itself.\n\nP: What?\n\nS: (nodding) It's a mind-bender, for sure.\n\nP: So, to summarize, it's brutally difficult, has writing that punches you in the feels, and Muffet's got the world wrapped around her little spider finger?\n\nS: Exactly! You got it. And, remember, choices matter. It's like a video game therapist for your life decisions.\n\nP: (grinning) Alright, let's do this. Bring on \"Undertale!\"\n\n[End of Pitch Meeting]\n\nS: (to camera) And that's how you pitch \"Undertale\" \u2013 where every decision counts, every moment matters, and Muffet's spider donuts are just too cute to resist! \ud83d\udd77\ufe0f\ud83c\udf69\n\n[b] [Title: \"Undertale: Love is War - A Gamer's Ballad\"] [/b]\n\nOh Fight Me\nMuffet Oh Muffet\nLet me hear it, if it isn't a boss fight

I bought Undertale this morning after playing it for about 200 hours through torrents. All the endings, dialogues, and characters are fascinating. I purchased Undertale and its soundtracks solely to support the author, who has been delighting a vast number of people with his games (full Deltarune, we are waiting) since 2015. I'm happy that many years ago I discovered this indie game masterpiece. To this day, it remains the only game I purchased, not received as a gift. I will never regret spending those few pennies on the plethora of emotions and meeting new people who were also enchanted by Undertale and shared in the happiness. The music in the game is perfect; its essence changes every time you play through any of the endings again. The characters sometimes make you feel pity when you get to the 'bad ending,' although I'm far from one of those who 'cry over pixels.' I advise everyone, whether you are a fan of shooters, board games, comedies, horror films, sitcoms, or even fans of mustache stones (yes, there are also stones with mustaches in the game), to go through every ending, because at least one of them will leave you with a long-lasting pleasant aftertaste. This is history, this is memory, and despite the simplicity of the graphics, it's a game you'll want to revisit.\n-_-_-_-", "timestamp_created": 1697198640, "timestamp_updated": 1697241903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148118480": {"recommendationid": "148118480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965964611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1697181028}, "language": "english", "review": "meh", "timestamp_created": 1697181051, "timestamp_updated": 1697181051, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148116559": {"recommendationid": "148116559", "author": {"steamid": "76561199488712645", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 361, "last_played": 1697965381}, "language": "english", "review": "yessir", "timestamp_created": 1697176566, "timestamp_updated": 1697176566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148113367": {"recommendationid": "148113367", "author": {"steamid": "76561199241260630", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1697500634}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Quieres saber el termino de belleza este es el juego correcto undertale tiene chistes malos un eskeleto que hace eeee un perro, a espera son 3...

interested in the game, eventually pirating it in March of that year, I was only 13 at the time, and I managed to finish it doing the Neutral way in March, and the Pacifist way in July of that year, it was such a nice moment, then puberty happened and I became an angsty teen, hating the game because \"waaah fandom cringe therefore game is bad\" and I've held it that way since 2017.\n\nI distanced myself away from the game, as well as others like FNAF, so it's been 4 years, 2021, Covid was still in swing, it was such a fucking great and memorable year, and for once, it was a year that almost leveled 2016 in how great and memorable it was, I had turned 18 recently, and was otherwise enjoying life as it came and went, and then through the greatest friend in my life, it dawned on me, \"if the fandom is cringe, does that REALLY make the game itself bad?\" and now as a grownup, I bought Undertale with my own money, so I replayed the game, and I felt a twinge of hard-hitting nostalgia, like a cinder block to the jaw.\n\nAnd everyone who knows me well, knows I miss 2016 (and now 2020-2021), so at the time I wanted to relive 2016 through Undertale, music, memes, and all the savory stuff I remember of 2016, without knowing, I managed to recapture those feelings a bit too well, that I can't hear \"2021\" without getting bittersweet at how things have turned, and all the great stuff I felt from the beginning of the year until August of that year as well. I managed to complete UT in every way, yes including genocide, as well as finding all the secrets minus So Sorry.\n\nI managed to retain my old save from 2021 to come here today to do the So Sorry fight, just to put this game to rest, it's been such a trip, the things this game did to me in 2021, things so nice I won't ever forget them, now of course it's not the sole reason 2021 was a good year, it was all by luck, but Undertale had a little bump that made the year a little bit better. I know most of you are gonna reply stuff like \"I ain't readin allat\" or \"it's not that deep bro\" but I just wanted to get this out of my system.\n\nAnd thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.", "timestamp_created": 1696950242, "timestamp_updated": 1696950242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442028999328613281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147976965": {"recommendationid": "147976965", "author": {"steamid": "76561199155428380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 810, "last_played": 1690982701}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice", "timestamp_created": 1696947366, "timestamp_updated": 1696947366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147976023": {"recommendationid": "147976023", "author": {"steamid": "76561199445631589", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1700703987}, "language": "english", "review": "Good.

Aunque podr\u00edas elegir enfrentarte a los monstruos, el juego te permite evitar los combates y resolver los encuentros de maneras pac\u00edficas. Esta opci\u00f3n agrega una capa significativa de profundidad moral al juego, ya que cada elecci\u00f3n que tomas tiene consecuencias reales en la historia y en el mundo que te rodea.\n\nEl juego est\u00e1 lleno de personajes memorables, cada uno con su propia personalidad, historia y desaf\u00edos \u00fanicos. Desde el carism\u00e1tico esqueleto Sans hasta la valiente pescadora Undyne, cada encuentro te deja una impresi\u00f3n duradera. Los di\u00e1logos son ingeniosos y llenos de humor, pero tambi\u00e9n pueden volverse incre\u00edblemente emotivos y serios cuando la historia lo requiere.\n\nLa banda sonora de Undertale es otro punto destacado. Cada melod\u00eda est\u00e1 cuidadosamente compuesta para reflejar el estado de \u00e1nimo del juego, y muchas de ellas se han convertido en ic\u00f3nicas para los fan\u00e1ticos del juego. La m\u00fasica ayuda a crear una atm\u00f3sfera inmersiva que te envuelve por completo.\n\nLa verdadera belleza de Undertale radica en su capacidad para generar una conexi\u00f3n emocional con el jugador. A medida que te sumerges m\u00e1s en la historia y las relaciones con los personajes, te encuentras reflexionando sobre tus propias acciones y elecciones. El juego desaf\u00eda tus ideas preconcebidas sobre los juegos de rol y la moralidad en los videojuegos.\n\nEn \u00faltima instancia, Undertale es una experiencia que va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la pantalla. Es una aventura emocionalmente resonante que te hace cuestionar tus decisiones y te deja reflexionando mucho despu\u00e9s de haber terminado el juego. Es un testimonio del poder del medio de los videojuegos para contar historias profundas y conmovedoras. Si alguna vez buscas una experiencia que te haga pensar y sentir de manera \u00fanica, Undertale es una elecci\u00f3n que no olvidar\u00e1s f\u00e1cilmente.", "timestamp_created": 1696638396,
