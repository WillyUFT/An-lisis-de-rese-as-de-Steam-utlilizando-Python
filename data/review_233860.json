The fun comes from learning how things differ between each of the factions and just trying to exist in a brutal world that frequently tries to crush your character. \n\nEvery nation has their own rules and standards, and then the no man's land is survival of the fittest. Learn to pick your battles as you navigate creating a life within the desert. Failure is often your greatest tool - so long as you don't die. \n\nBetween having a unique health system and squad-based combat, death is rarely an outcome for a crafty player. The stories that unravel as you narrowly avoid destruction time and time again will keep you coming back. And you will be richly rewarded for your time. \n\nThis game doesn't let you come back from being an inch away from death for nothing. You will steadily grow stronger, and once you hit a certain point, your progress will grow exponentially. Everything you do is worth it because it will add to your abilities. The progression system works well enough that you can go it alone and still become a god-like figure. \n\nI highly recommend this game.

The sky above you presents with two alien planets visible at all times. This is not Earth. As you traverse the odd, dusty landscapes you quickly find that you are not alone. This world is alive with humans, several humanoid species, and dangerous beasts. Trading in goods of all kinds, even in people is prevalent, and wars wage between bandits, slavers, starving nomads, religious zealots, cannibals, traders and homesteaders. This is the world of Kenshi, a world that asks of you only one question; Who do you want to be? What is your goal?\n\nIndeed, there is no set goal or storyline to follow in the game other than lore books, conversations gleaned in towns, and the relics of a fallen civilization all around you. At first this lack of direction could seem bland or daunting to those expecting the typical experience of an overstated plot to hold your hand and shove you in the 'right' direction. There's no right or wrong in Kenshi, though. If you want to spend your time in game as a trader building up a caravan and selling common goods or weapons to every town you pass through, you can. If you want to be a wandering loner simply exploring each biome as you see fit, go for it. Want to build your own farm, or establish your own town and preside over it as some sort of mayor or king? You can do that too. You can be a thief, a bounty hunter, you can sell your foes into slavery or let your pets (if you have any) feast on their corpses.\n\nThe possibilities are endless. Make no mistake, there is a learning curve to this game but not in the way you might think. You only really understand the way Kenshi works when you realize your character(s) -will- be defeated. A lot. And being defeated is necessary to become more powerful. Even losing a limb in battle has its advantages, as you can eventually replace it with a more powerful mechanical prosthetic. As long as your last remaining character does not die, you can play until your heart's content. And if everyone in your control does die? It doesn't change a thing. No game over screens. The world keeps going around you until you start a new game. \n\nIn other words, Kenshi is a truly unique game in its design. Simultaneously unforgiving but incredibly rewarding. While graphically things may at first appear a bit dated, you can still find beautiful cliff-side vistas, areas of lush green, foreboding and dangerous badlands, the bones of long dead massive creatures or robots and plenty more eye-candy.\n\nIf you're a patient gamer who values a totally unique experience, there's no reason not to buy this one!

That's not a snobby, neck beard, Dark Souls fan-esque, \"This game is too good for most people to appreciate!\" statement. The game is just genuinely unapproachable. The world is hostile, the UI is confusing and unintuitive, there is no real objective to guide you in the right direction right off the bat, no tutorial, no real easy mode, no hand holding. None of that. I must have watched 20 hours of videos describing and explaining various things about the game and I still feel like I'm stumbling in the dark half the time. \n\nAll of that being said, there is one thing this game does better than any game I've ever encountered, and its ultimately the one thing that keeps me coming back every time. The stories you make. The game has \"quests\" technically speaking, they are different from how most games do them. you don't run up and talk to a character and receive a five minute exposition dump, or a cut scene. Instead you are given small tidbits about that character and the world, and the rest is intentionally left for you to infer and speculate. Because of that the world is a little bit different for every player experiencing it. On top of that, the things that happen dynamically to you shape your own unique story on the fly. You might rise from a newly captured slave to a highly sought after bounty hunter, or start out as a wandering trader only to be drawn in to the lucrative profits that smuggling offers, and your story will feel real and personal because you'll be there to experience it every step of the way, rather than a cut scene telling you how much of a bad ass you are or how lowly of a position your character started in. All of this comes together to make me feel more attached to any given Kenshi character I've made over any other scripted RPG.\n\nTo sum it all up, hiding behind Kenshi's VERY rough exterior is perhaps the most immersive and genuine experience I've ever had in a game.

A typical character begins, dirt poor and clad in rags, with essentially no meaningful skills. You're easy pickings for anyone to rob or kill. It seems like the game is setting you up to fail, and you'll quickly find that scraping out a meager profit scavenging corpses and mining copper ore, and retreating to the walls of the nearest city at the first sign of a threat is just about the only thing you can manage. It's hard to see what anyone would enjoy about the experience.\n\nThe key to finding the fun in Kenshi comes with the realization that combat experience is based on how overleveled a given threat is to you, and many of Kenshi's threats will leave you unconscious but not permanently worse off. Once you discover what doesn't kill you (usually) makes you stronger, you'll find yourself eager to jump into impossible fights, knowing that losing is just as valuable as winning.\n\nAnd gradually, you will start to gain ground. You claw your way up to even footing with the packs of emaciated bandits that beat and rob you. You gain a small party of fellow adventurers to even the odds. You replace your rusty blades and wooden sticks with razor sharp masterwork weapons. You establish a base of operations and build up its defenses. Threats that were once insurmountable become frustrating, then fairly mundane, and finally trivially as you advance from a hopelessly outmatched nobody to a legendary swordsman who can single-handedly take on an army.\n\nBeneath Kenshi's hostile exterior is a game about the grueling march towards self improvement, and the satisfying look backwards to find that all your hard work has paid off.", "timestamp_created": 1700338529, "timestamp_updated": 1700338672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150377062": {"recommendationid": "150377062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303506671", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5827, "playtime_at_review": 3993, "last_played": 1700758567}, "language": "english", "review": "Difficult start: I had to look a lot of things up, and watch some videos just to get going.

In a gaming landscape often dominated by linear narratives, Kenshi emerges as a refreshing anomaly, providing an immersive and expansive experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional RPGs.\n\nThe hallmark of Kenshi lies in its unparalleled freedom. From the outset, players are thrust into a vast, desolate world with no predetermined destiny. The absence of a linear storyline liberates the player, allowing them to carve their own path in a dystopian universe. Whether one aspires to be a noble trader traversing perilous landscapes, a cunning thief navigating city streets, or a fearless warlord leading a band of misfits, Kenshi accommodates every playstyle with seamless fluidity.\n\nThe depth of Kenshi's world-building is truly awe-inspiring. Every blade of grass, every ruin, and every character contributes to the game's rich tapestry. The game's lore unfolds not through scripted sequences but through the emergent stories that players create with their choices and actions. It is a living, breathing world where the consequences of decisions ripple across the fabric of the game, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving narrative.\n\nThe squad-based mechanics add an extra layer of complexity and realism. As players recruit and train their band of characters, witnessing them evolve from vulnerable greenhorns to seasoned warriors is a gratifying experience. Each member of the squad possesses a unique backstory and skills, making every playthrough a fresh adventure. The game's AI-driven economy and ecosystem ensure that the world is in constant flux, responding to the player's actions and creating an environment where adaptability is key to survival.\n\nKenshi's visuals may not boast the hyper-realistic graphics of AAA titles, but it compensates with a distinct and immersive art style. The barren landscapes and dilapidated cities evoke a sense of desolation, underscoring the harsh realities of survival in this unforgiving world. The game's soundtrack complements the atmosphere flawlessly, shifting from haunting melodies in desolate wastelands to adrenaline-pumping beats during intense battles.\n\nThe game's modding community deserves a special mention. Lo-Fi Games has fostered an environment where players can shape and enhance their Kenshi experience. From graphical improvements to gameplay overhauls, the modding scene has breathed new life into the game, showcasing the developers' commitment to fostering a community-driven experience.\n\nHowever, Kenshi is not without its challenges. The difficulty curve can be punishing, demanding strategic thinking and careful resource management. Some may find the lack of hand-holding and guidance daunting, but for those willing to invest time and effort, the rewards are boundless.\n\nIn conclusion, Kenshi transcends the conventions of traditional RPGs, delivering an unparalleled sandbox experience. Its expansive world, freedom of choice, and emergent storytelling make it a masterpiece in its genre. Whether you seek the thrill of combat, the intricacies of trade, or the solitude of exploration, Kenshi invites you to forge your own destiny in a world where every decision matters. It's not just a game; it's an epic journey, an odyssey of survival and self-discovery that will leave an indelible mark on the soul of every adventurer who dares to enter its vast and treacherous landscapes.", "timestamp_created": 1700015335, "timestamp_updated": 1700015335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true,

As someone who revels in the challenge of forging my own destiny, Kenshi has become a personal odyssey that marries difficulty with a profound sense of accomplishment.\n\nGraphics and Atmosphere (3.5/5):\nWhile Kenshi may not boast the glossy graphics of mainstream titles, there's an unspoken beauty in the desolation it portrays. The landscapes may seem barren, but they echo the stories of resilience and struggle, adding a layer of immersion that transcends mere visuals.\n\nOpen-World Exploration (4.5/5):\nThe freedom to wander through Kenshi's vast landscapes feels like embarking on a personal quest.

Building my outpost in the harsh desert, managing my squad's skills, and fending off relentless bandit attacks feel like chapters in a gripping saga of resilience and growth.\n\nCharacter Progression (4/5):\nThe character progression system in Kenshi is not just a mechanic; it's a testament to the evolution of my band of survivors. Watching my characters grow, adapt, and overcome challenges adds a personal touch to each member of my squad. It's not just about stats; it's about the stories etched in scars and experience.\n\nDifficulty and Learning Curve (4/5):\nKenshi didn't hand me success; I had to carve it out with sweat and perseverance. The initial struggle and the gradual understanding of the game's intricacies were not just hurdles; they were rites of passage, making every victory taste sweeter and every defeat a lesson learned.\n\nCommunity and Mods (5/5):\nExploring the vast world of Kenshi is made even richer by the vibrant community and the plethora of mods. Each mod isn't just an addition; it's a personalized touch to my Kenshi experience. The collective creativity of the community enhances the game's depth, allowing me to tailor it to my vision.\n\nDevelopment and Updates (4/5):\nSeeing Kenshi's ongoing development is like witnessing a world I love evolve and grow. The regular updates aren't just patches; they're invitations to rediscover the game, to embark on new adventures, and to witness the developers' dedication to their craft.\n\nConclusion (4.5/5):\nKenshi is more than a game on my shelf; it's a personal saga etched in the annals of challenging survival and strategic triumph.

of combat, in spite of that i am playing without mods and the fact you get as for as you want to get in terms of skill leveling is a pro, customization is a con, it lacks of more characters and small

a** kicked.\n\n\nWhy is kenshi so hard ? Because it doesn't give you a story so you don't know who is hostile to who or what zone is dangerous.It also has a few mechanics you need to be careful with mostly food and limb condition.\nThe game is also VERY grindy.Kenshi isn't meant for most people.You have to be either incredibly patient or like pain.\n\nKenshi has bugs is incredibly difficult and has horrible graphics so if you watched a video serie on kenshi and thought to yourself i wanna try my hand at it just be warned you will get your ass kicked a lot before you can have a fair chance at enjoying the game.You can and should look up more informations about the game and the universe itself before buying it.\n\nSo why is my review positive ? Well despite all the crashes the bad path finding and its difficulty kenshi has my attention because it's an open world its difficulty is also a charm it's aesthethic is quite pleasing and it also has mod support to make things a LOT easier.\n\nOverall this game is all about recruiting people give them a fighting style equipement and challenge various bosses or factions.Defeating them and if you want roleplaying your own story in the world.It is pretty fun to see your 40 soldiers charge into a city and spread absolute chaos but it's probably boring for most people.", "timestamp_created": 1699634087, "timestamp_updated": 1699634303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149877141": {"recommendationid": "149877141", "author": {"steamid": "76561199006240992", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 785, "playtime_at_review": 5118, "last_played": 1700622704}, "language": "english", "review": "beep.", "timestamp_created": 1699633919, "timestamp_updated": 1699633919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149867546": {"recommendationid": "149867546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261715164", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 13788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8285, "playtime_at_review": 5558, "last_played": 1700758820}, "language": "english", "review": "fond out that I can be surprisingly patient sometimes. there's still sand in my mount", "timestamp_created": 1699623932, "timestamp_updated": 1699623932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149866918": {"recommendationid": "149866918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048644149", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 20827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5209, "playtime_at_review": 15916, "last_played": 1700420773}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't like this game.

Strap yourselves in for a rollercoaster of limbs flying, dust settling, and laughter echoing in the desolate landscapes of Kenshi.\n\nFrom the moment I stumbled out of character creation (or should I say stumbled over my own feet?), I knew Kenshi wasn't your average stroll through a post-apocalyptic playground. It's like the game developers took a blender, threw in some Mad Max, a dash of Mortal Kombat, and a sprinkle of Monty Python humor for good measure.\n\nLet's talk about the graphics. They're not cutting-edge, but hey, who needs ultra-HD when you're too busy watching your squad of misfits stumble into a pack of beak things while arguing about the proper way to wield a plank?\n\nCharacter development? Oh, it's a masterpiece. My main character went from a one-armed nobody to a limping, crossbow-wielding hero with a penchant for getting knocked unconscious at the worst possible times. The NPCs are just as quirky. I mean, where else can you recruit a one-eyed ex-noble who thinks he's a martial arts master?\n\nAnd the soundtrack! It's like someone handed a synthesizer to a cat on catnip. It shouldn't work, but somehow it adds to the chaotic charm of Kenshi. It's the kind of music that makes you want to charge into battle with a rusty sword and a battle cry that's equal parts bravery and sheer insanity.\n\nLet's not forget the bugs. No, not the creepy-crawly kind (although those are present too). I'm talking about the kind of bugs that make your character's limbs twist like a pretzel or send them sky-high when they touch a pebble. But honestly, who needs a fully functioning game when you can have this much fun with the glitches?\n\nIn conclusion, Kenshi is not just a game; it's an experience. It's the kind of game that makes you question your life choices as you watch your character get pummeled by a band of hungry cannibals. But hey, isn't that what gaming is all about? Embrace the chaos, laugh in the face of adversity, and remember, losing is just another way to say, \"I meant to do that.\"\n\nSo, grab your oversized backpack, recruit a squad of misfits, and dive headfirst into the madness that is Kenshi. Just be prepared to lose a limb or two along the way.

The engine is also quite outdated which also doesnt help much.\nKnowing the game you barely cant die unless you make a stupid mistake but the whole finding out is the best but a short part of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1699498394, "timestamp_updated": 1699498394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149790522": {"recommendationid": "149790522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089603631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24545, "last_played": 1699497203}, "language": "english", "review": "its just fun.

Here's why Kenshi deserves a solid five-star rating:\n\nVast and Unforgiving World: Kenshi's post-apocalyptic, sword-punk world is massive and unforgiving. It doesn't hold your hand, and you're free to carve out your own path, whether it's as a warrior, trader, thief, or farmer. The world is filled with danger, opportunity, and mysteries to discover.\n\nFreedom of Choice: You have the freedom to shape your character and your story. You can recruit companions, build your own base, start a business, become a warlord, or explore the world as a lone wanderer. The game doesn't impose a predefined narrative, allowing you to create your own adventures.\n\nComplex Economy: Kenshi features a deep economic system, where your actions can impact trade routes, faction relations, and the prosperity of settlements. Whether you're a merchant or a raider, your choices have far-reaching consequences.\n\nUnique Characters and Factions: The game is populated by diverse and unique characters and factions, each with its own lore and goals. Interacting with them adds depth to the world and creates dynamic and often challenging relationships.\n\nChallenging Combat: Combat in Kenshi is tough but rewarding. You'll need to train your characters and employ tactics to survive battles. The game's limb damage system adds a layer of strategy and realism.\n\nModding Community: Kenshi has a passionate modding community that has created a wealth of user-generated content, from quality-of-life improvements to total conversion mods. This extends the game's replay value and customization.\n\nOngoing Development: The developer, Lo-Fi Games, has continued to update and improve Kenshi since its release, addressing bugs and adding new content.\n\nWhile Kenshi offers a remarkable gaming experience, it's important to note that its steep learning curve and initially harsh difficulty can be intimidating. However, for players who enjoy challenging and deep sandbox experiences, it's an incredible journey into a unique and harsh world.\n\nIn summary, Kenshi is a masterpiece of emergent storytelling, offering unparalleled freedom and depth in an unforgiving post-apocalyptic world. It's a must-play for those who appreciate the complexity of sandbox RPGs and the thrill of creating your own epic adventure in a brutal and immersive setting.", "timestamp_created": 1699446166, "timestamp_updated": 1699446166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149754633": {"recommendationid": "149754633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803929004", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3406, "playtime_at_review": 961, "last_played": 1700736018}, "language": "english", "review": "limb loss is considered an upgrade, +", "timestamp_created": 1699445536, "timestamp_updated": 1699445536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149752438": {"recommendationid": "149752438", "author": {"steamid": "76561199552524905", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 121, "playtime_at_review": 878, "last_played": 1699914544}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really engaging and fun to play hours on end.

After breaking off from mainstream market games (fps/moba) and heading into more niche games like this, playing Kenshi is way more fun. There is a huge world to engage with and a plethora of mods that expand upon it even more. If you want to play as a solo character and try to take on the world's toughest enemies, it's definitely possible. If you want to micro-manage a squad of 100 people and designate them each an individual job, go for it. This is a great game for people who enjoy Rimworld or The Sims.\n\n     In 2023, the graphics are a bit outdated and it's not as optimized as newer games, so it can take a bit of time to get the settings the way you like. The game, plus 30-40 mods, won't be bigger than 20GB which is nice for lower end PC's.  I'd suggest putting it on an SSD even though it is older. But, nonetheless, I recommend you try it out.

Strip back the shock and awe of modern game flashiness, and embrace a new life in a barren world where the freedom of the world is at your mercy, as the brutality of it leaves you at its own.\n\nWithin the first two hours of gameplay I began to understand what this world is. Mercenaries offering their services for multiples of the money I currently had, leaving me to venture alone. With mining being my only safe option for money, I harvested some copper and made my journey to a second town where I met an ex-warrior who was abandoned by their tribe and was looking for a new purpose within a group. They joined my company and we stocked up on food/water before heading out to gather some more supplies to sell.\n\nDuring this, a gang of bandits walked by and attacked us. My lowly character, with no training whatsoever, was beaten almost to death and left bleeding out in the sand. My new companion? Beaten and broken, both legs completely crippled and useless... but playing dead so that the bandits would leave. Once out of sight, she crawled slowly over to my dying body and used some bandages to cover my wounds as I lay unconscious. Gathering just enough aid from one of the bandits we managed to kill, my companion bandaged up one of their legs enough to limp to their feet; with a single half-working leg and one that was mostly crippled, they hoisted me onto their shoulder and carried me back into town where we were both able to rest and recover from our wounds.\n\nI have currently only played this game for two hours but this experience alone has made me realise how beautiful a game like this truly can be. I quickly learned how unimpressive I am, and how much I have yet to train. I learned how important it is to have companions, if no skill or equipment.

There is so very little talking in Kenshi aside from vendors and recruitable characters, and it makes the world feel kind of lifeless (which may just be the point).

The combat is hands off and mostly made up of movement and equipment. The game is a bit grindy though which is really the only negative I have about the game, that you have to grind before the game even becomes enjoyable. But the game does allow you to play how you want.\n\nCity building whilst fun I feel like the tech-tree is just really going through the motions, yes the more advanced techs require you to go looking for special items, these can be looted easily though if your stealth is high enough so the city building isn't really a challenge and I would in fact urge against doing it too early as it falls into the same annoyances as RimWorld and StarSector fall into where its just wave after wave of annoying enemies which is nearly always mitigated by designing elaborate kill boxes to game the system.\n\nThe world of kenshi is amazing though, its a very unique world and the art for the game is really well done and suits the style.

una sola persona por ver su sue\u00f1o hecho realidad trabajo como un desgraciado por mas de una d\u00e9cada. pasando penurias y SIN LA AYUDA DE NADIE, solo para crear esta hermosa obra de arte llamada Kenshi, Chris Hunt el creador de este bello arte de la industria de los videojuegos se merece todo y aun mas,\n\nque decir sobre esta maldita obra de arte, SE PUEDE HACER DE TODO, ser un maldito asesino, cazarrecompensas, vendedor de drogas, un vagabundo aventurero, un maldito CAN\u00cdBAL asalta ciudades, hasta un genocidio enfermo extinguidor de razas, este juego no es lineal y tu haces lo que te de la maldita GANA, cuando quieras y como lo quieras, \n\n\neste juego tiene tantas mec\u00e1nicas, desde el combate, la construcci\u00f3n de ciudades, la exploraci\u00f3n, el comercio, el farmeo, hasta puedes ponerte a fabricar droga y venderla, HAY UN MOD PARA DESMEMBRAR A PERSONAS Y VENDER SU CARNE, porque si, este hermoso juego tiene miles de mods, la comunidad de esta bella obra de arte que amamos esta llena de muchos mods, este juego tiene desde un mod para combates y animaciones incre\u00edbles, hasta otro donde hay un maldito apocalipsis zombie, y los desarrolladores valoran a su comunidad y el esfuerzo y cari\u00f1o que le tenemos al crear mods solo para el disfrute de otros, que kenshi tiene un soporte al comenzar el juego donde puedes configurar y dem\u00e1s cosas a los mods a\u00f1adidos al juego, \n\na pesar de que este juego no es perfecto, por que no lo es, tiene muchos bugs, errores, los gr\u00e1ficos son poco decentes, y si un mod no es compatible con otro puede da\u00f1ar tu partida, sin embargo y a pesar de todo eso el juego tiene mil y un cosas para ofrecerte, en este juego tu creas tu maldita perra historia, tu decides si te vuelves una maldita potencia capaz de acabar con facciones enteras o solo eres un simple aventurero en busca de aberraciones en los confines del mapa de kenshi, es tan grande el mapa, con tantas cosas por hacer, con tantas historias que tu mismo puedes crear por medio de tus acciones, incluso en el ambito de NPCS el juego es hermoso, hay tantos tan carism\u00e1ticos, graciosos, psic\u00f3patas o locos que hacen llenar de vida a simples characters, desde un insecto hombre con delirios de grandeza hasta una amante de cangrejos desquiciada, \n\n\neste juego sin duda para ser un indie creado por UNA SOLA PERSONA, es MUCH\u00cdSIMO MEJOR, que muchos triple AAA que nunca hacen nada nuevo, solo lo mismo de siempre, grafiquitos, disparitos, historia estupida y nada mas, este juego ofrece MUCHO, MUCH\u00cdSIMO MAS, Y ESTOY SEGURO DE QUE SI ESTE JUEGO HUBIERA SIDO DESARROLLADO POR UNA EMPRESA DE VIDEOJUEGOS GRANDE SERIA EL MALDITO MEJOR JUEGO DE LA HISTORIA, que deleite para mi es haber conocido esta  OBRA DE ARTE, y haber pasado muchos momentos divertidos y hermosos jugando esto\n\n\nSIN DUDA MERECE SER COMPRADO Y JUGADO POR TI, PORQUE TIENE MILES DE COSAS POR OFRECER, AMO ESTE

Everything revolves around weebsticks. \n   There is this rich space age sci-fi setting, with robots, spaceship debris, mechs, alien life both sentient and non sentient, all wrapped up in a dystopian setting; and instead of anything even remotely related to any of that: the focus is mindless non strategic weebstick brawling. \n\n    \"What about the xbows?\" I hear the mouth breathers ask. Well, they are bait, plain and simple. The Ai is so completely fucking stupid that upon any single enemy getting within a half football field, the xbow incest products switch to weebsticks and charge like a bunch of mouth breathing weeaboos after watching japanese cartoons for 2 hours. No, there is no way to give orders related to tactics or strategy. It was made that way by design. The \"stealth\" run animation is really all one needs to see to reach this conclusion. \n  The ENTIRE point is weebsticks, which is a really damn shame. Such a waste of potential and talent.\n\n   \n   The whole premise is that thousands and thousands of years of war have ravaged a once great society..bla bla bla. Therefore, guns dont exist ect ect. Its flimsy at best. Just having the mere knowledge that guns exist/existed, well, read about peter struedinger. guy made a fucking shotgun while in jail and escaped with it. You also mean to tell me that every faction decided it was best to cease all RND and not invent ways to get a tactical edge? The first gun recorded was used in the year 1364. I'll let you do the math as far as how long modern civilization has been around.    \n\n  So..the game. By itself, I wouldn't bother with this shit cake on a plate if it was for free.\n  But what about mods? Can mods save it? Make it the way it should have been on release? Not entirely, but by the gods does it help. \n   For instance, gun mods, and proper stealth animation mods, and mods that allow the use of ranged weapons while hidden...yes it actually takes a mod to implement that. pathetic.\n   I've personally been having a blast micro managing one character with a shotgun. Google JonTron shotgun vs sword, should be a 51 second clip. Pretty fun. as for the other npcs that decide to use guns? well, lets just say that an armed society is a polite society.\n", "timestamp_created": 1698003085, "timestamp_updated": 1698003085, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421186983585357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148691691": {"recommendationid": "148691691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009678348", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7143, "last_played": 1698070366}, "language": "english", "review": "A propper sandbox where you make your own adventure", "timestamp_created": 1698001839, "timestamp_updated": 1698001839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148681763": {"recommendationid": "148681763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210009044", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 746, "playtime_at_review": 697, "last_played": 1700654260}, "language": "spanish", "review": "MAGISTRAL!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1697991650, "timestamp_updated": 1697991650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148679660": {"recommendationid": "148679660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198959007663", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6096, "last_played": 1698049267}, "language": "english", "review": "Really wish this game had an implemented Mod Manager.....", "timestamp_created": 1697989541, "timestamp_updated": 1698045389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148679328": {"recommendationid": "148679328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422534435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 178397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 99, "playtime_at_review": 174343, "last_played": 1699755865}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

When you start, you are a complete nobody, with no direction, and virtually no means of defense, attack, or money.\n\nVirtually everything will want to kill you and take your stuff. However, as long as you are not eaten alive by an animal, most of the time, when you are KO'd, the AI will attempt to loot you of food, and leave you to recover your wounds. This increases your toughness and other stats, which will help you for the next fight. Really, you want to keep getting into these skirmishes, and lose them, just to get stronger.\n\nIf you want a guide on this, there are plenty out there. In terms of an actual review of the game:\nYou need patience. You are able to live in this world and do, virtually, anything you want. Your actions shape this world. You can steal anything. You can take over entire cities. You recruit followers. Base building is probably the highlight of the game (and making it more and more efficient).\n\nI had the urge to play it as a solo character, and you can, ideally with mods to improve this style of gameplay, but the game shines as a squad based RPG and colony/base builder.\n\nIt has a lot of qualities of Star Wars: Galaxies, the long-defunct MMO. You are on a desert world (reminiscent of Tatooine). The crafting system is quite in-depth, not to SWG levels, but still similar. There is a prospecting menu similar to SWG. The game isn't centered around ranged combat and certainly not centered around futuristic combat (most combat is fought with katanas, nearly everything has an Asian style to it). For anyone that misses SWG, I would try it just for that nostalgia alone.\n\nThere's so much to say about this game and I am doing a very poor job of making a concise review, but it is on my top 10 of all time video games list. If you pick this game up, you will lose hours upon hours and go down a rabbit hole of fun for a couple weeks/months. If you are on the fence about it, get it. The hardest part is simply sticking through the early learning curve and seemingly broken difficulty (accept that you will be KO'd and possibly imprisoned, but this is a good thing for your character, embrace it like a story-generator),\n\nPlease enjoy it with all your heart.", "timestamp_created": 1697938266, "timestamp_updated": 1697938523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

this game with the line \"This game doesn't care about you\" as the basic premise and it sticks to me to this day. Years later I realize how wrong they were about Kenshi. Not only does this game care about you, it wants to protect you from yourself and keep pushing you forward to success. Dying is actually kind of difficult unless you tweak the settings or act like a complete idiot. Yes, in fact, this game cares about you so much that you are REWARDED for failing. You grow stronger with each battle and even earn more xp for losing. Even with all the settings cranked up to be the most brutal, bandits will never steal your equipped items if they beat you unconscious and rob you, and even if you get imprisoned, the stuff they take is locked away in a chest and never despawns. This game does care about you, in fact, it wants you to succeed, like a stoic parent that knows you need to grow up to be strong so you are prepared for the brutal world ahead of you. It will punish you for stupid mistakes, and reward you for clever strategies, and even if you get beaten nearly to death, you will come out of that experience stronger than ever. In fact, the best way to get stronger early on is to let bandits repeatedly beat the piss out of you. There are so many ways to make money and so many safety nets to pull you back from the brink of losing it all. Even being maimed and losing a limb isn't the end, because you can buy or steal robotic limbs that are as good if not better than what you had before. \n\nI held off for years from buying this game because I believed the top review at the time telling me \"this game doesn't care about you\" and I took that as \"you can lose everything in an instant because this game isn't fair\" but that just isn't true. Even if you lose a limb, even if you nearly starve to death, even if you get robbed or enslaved you will almost always come out stronger than ever. This game wants to make you a god by beating you down and refining you under massive pressure to be the diamond it knows you can be. \n\nDon't make the mistake I did, get this game and know that no matter how bad things get or how grim things appear to be, you will almost always have a way out that will end with you tougher than before.

I hope it helps for your troubles:\n\n\ud83d\udd38At the beginning the world is far stronger than you. Your character just sucks as you start from very bottom (You will die a lot). \n\ud83d\udd38Play cautiously. Hit spacebar for pause. You will have time to think. Don't try to be a brave guy. \n\ud83d\udd38Save scum. You may find yourself in the middle of the fight suddenly or you might be attacked by neutral factions for something that you have triggered (in towns expecially).\n\ud83d\udd38This game is buggy af. Expect crashes, weird things etc. You can import your save file for the last resort.\n\ud83d\udd38Border Zone is probably best location for beginners since it has less dangerous bandits and creatures and also it is close to two major factions.\n\ud83d\udd38Well you may think that buying a fine weapon and a shining armor set should make stronger you. Remember that actually in Kenshi, literally everything is about your characters' SKILL. Even a decent sabre will do fine job with your op character.\n\ud83d\udd38Travel and discover as much as you can. Kenshi is a rpg game that has tons of things to discover. Don't miss the content.\n\ud83d\udd38The world Kenshi is unforgiving and brutal. Don't trust anyone.\n\ud83d\udd38LOOT, LOOT, LOOT!\n\ud83d\udd38There are major factions and they have some kind of set of rules. Learn them and obey their rules if you are penniless weak mfker. And they are waging wars. In fact, in every corner of the world, people kill each other. \n\ud83d\udd38You can set up a base but don't do that at early. It is mid-game content and when you do, you will have to defend your place.\n\ud83d\udd38Weapons and gears have pros and cons. You should be saying which one is the best, which one is good for x? Well, it is the learning curve of the game. Search about it and get the overall idea.\n\ud83d\udd38You should want to use some backpack for carrying extra stuff. Kenshi offers wide range of backpacks (also for your domesticated animals). If you need huge carrying capacity, then forget about fighting. A small backpack is also usable for \"I want carry stuff and also fight\". Btw, the more you carry, the less speed you'll have while running, and running is everything.\n\ud83d\udd38You can find different shops in towns that you can distinguish them by their sign hanged. Night time they are closed. Don't disturb them or else you will be attacked by town guards and then get arrested.\n\ud83d\udd38Bars are the places that can you find people for your gang. They will be weak too. Some unique recruits Low-mid range of skills tho.\n\ud83d\udd38Food. You will need much food. Buying is easiest way but gathering meat from animals is cost effective (you are not killing them, they will be hunted by who knows. You will just loot the meat).\n\ud83d\udd38And finally, prepare a long time-consuming game!", "timestamp_created": 1697727538, "timestamp_updated": 1697730421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820242404937744141", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148489762": {"recommendationid": "148489762", "author": {"steamid": "76561199389661790", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 322, "last_played": 1698105932}, "language": "spanish", "review": "tremendo", "timestamp_created": 1697726458, "timestamp_updated": 1697726458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148481170": {"recommendationid": "148481170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085276826", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 23021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23021, "last_played": 1690283155}, "language": "english", "review": "Beep.", "timestamp_created": 1697713948, "timestamp_updated": 1697713948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148478224": {"recommendationid": "148478224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178447829", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 17414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2367, "playtime_at_review": 12954, "last_played": 1700790415}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 \nVery addicting and rewarding.\nThere's nothing else like it.\nIt might confuse you or suck at first but that's part of the experience bc it doesn't play like anything else on the market.

It was a pretty rough start since my first try I got instantly attacked by a bandit while on 4x speed. Needless to say I barely got away with my life.\n\nEventually things started going my way. I got a few hundred cats worth of iron, sold them at the shop, and started getting some gear. My plan was to become a bounty hunter, mainly because I held a grudge against that bandit that attacked me and his entire kind.\n\nThings were going well. The area around the city was relatively safe and explorable and the city was always a safe haven if I ever got into trouble. Then, one fateful day, an entire army of bandits walked straight into it. I decided this was a great way to get loot for free, so I incited a fight that eventually turned into a large battle. There were at least 2 dozen bandits, and the only dedicated guards the city had were 3 ninjas, so I was somewhat worried it wouldn't work out.\n\nHowever, despite being outnumbered more than 5 to 1, the ninjas absolutely decimated the gang of bandits. It was admittedly pretty cool to watch them hack and slash through the hoard, fighting while surrounded on all sides on a flight of stairs.\n\nAt the end of the battle, the ninjas sent the bandits packing, having only lost one of their own. I got a ton of great loot from the bandits, but I made a big mistake when I looted the ninjas' dead companion. Apparently people in this game don't take kindly to you when they see you wearing their dead friends clothes. This wouldn't have been too much of an issue, there aren't too many problems in the early game that you can't outrun.\n\nHowever, after the battle, by some bug or feature (probably a bug) the ninjas seemed to have completely taken over the town. There was a ninja standing where the old shopkeep used to be, and another one always watching outside the bar. The city was unsafe, and more importantly, unprofitable. I had to leave.\n\nThe main issue with this is that this city was the only one really that was marked on the map. To find another city I had to go somewhere else, but I didn't know where. I wasn't gonna look it up; I'm no dirty cheater. Unfortunately I probably should have. I went north, the wrong direction apparently,\n\nI wandered through the desert, becoming more and more desperate in my search for another city as I began to run out of resources. I came across a few outposts, but none of them had a place to sell my loot (I was overburdened btw) or buy any food. \n\nI was forced to become an outlaw, causing chaos and stealing food while guards weren't looking just to stay alive. I had become the very thing I had swore to destroy. \n\nThings only got worse. I was now a wanted man by the massive empire of religious zealots that I was apparently in the middle of. This became the least of my worries as I was jumped by a group of hungry bandits in the middle of the desert. I managed to escape relatively unharmed (thank whatever gods there are in Kenshi that I was sensible enough to buy some first aid kits at the first town before things fell apart), but my left leg was critically injured.\n\nEventually I was no longer able to walk, and had to crawl my way through the desert while I began to starve. I realized that my only hope was to find some civilization in this wasteland. They were probably going to lock me up on sight, but at least they would feed me. Hopefully...\n\nThings seemed hopeless as I continued to crawl north, but just as I was about to give up I saw a weird looking outpost on the horizon. I was saved! I crawled towards it with the tiny bit of strength I had left in me. Guards rushed out of the gates, beat me up a little, then immediately hauled me to their prison. Things were looking up.\n\nNot only did the guards save me, they even healed me and put me in some weird hunger stasis spell so that I wouldn't starve to death. This was so kind that I decided that I would wait out my entire sentence without trying to escape. I decided I would try to start a new life and try to become a soldier for the kingdom. Maybe one day I could become a lord or something.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n(the following part of the review pertains to a bug that I was somewhat able to fix and is no longer relevant)\n\nUnfortunately, this is where my cool Kenshi story ends. Because, once my sentence ended, no one came. I waited another 20 minutes on top of the 30 I had already spent to serve my time (at max speed btw) and no guards came to free me. Apparently this is a long lasting and relatively common bug in the game, which is WILD considering getting locked up seems to be the most common thing that can happen to you in the world of Kenshi right behind dying. Escaping isn't really an option either, my leg is still completely busted and even if it wasn't the outpost is apparently a unique outpost filled with a type of guards that are even stronger than normal, making sneaking past them impossible and fighting them even more impossible with my low level character. Oh, and on top of that there is near constant acid rain around the outpost which I have no protection against and will very quickly injure me even if I do manage to make it outside. It's a perfect prison.\n\nSo I'm basically softlocked. I really wanted to like this game, and believe me Im going to try to like it whether it wants me to or not. I'm not giving up yet; I'll try a couple ideas to try to break out of the prison, the most extreme being dropping basically all of my possessions just to get a little extra stealth and sneaking out during a brief period of no rain. Feel free to help me out in the comments if you want. As soon as I get out of this I will update my review but as of now I'm leaving the game as a thumbs down because this situation is ludicrous even for a game that is supposed to be buggy.\n[hr][/hr]\n\nI found the only good way to fix this softlock was by soft resetting the world basically. Something kenshi lets you do with the click of a button which is nice. I believe that the infinite jail time bug occurs most commonly at outposts, so pro tip avoid any outposts where you are wanted at all costs unless you are confident you can escape. Unfortunately though, since my character was dropped back at the world spawn the entire story from above is...non canon I guess? The review has been changed to a positive but would definitely be a mixed review if possible, since its a perfect example of how some problems in this game can seriously ruin the immersion it creates. Still a recommend if you can put up with high amounts of jank and potentially frustrating issues, since its a really unique game.\n\nAnyway this review is way too long already so thanks for coming to my story time Ted Talk.", "timestamp_created": 1697600867, "timestamp_updated": 1697871903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148414723": {"recommendationid": "148414723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058654553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 20141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1502, "playtime_at_review": 18296, "last_played": 1699854104}, "language": "english", "review": "beep and the gang find themselves in Turkey and get into fights and stuff until they find out there's no escape. do not get into the journalism business until your skills are at 60+", "timestamp_created": 1697591577, "timestamp_updated": 1697591577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148412999": {"recommendationid": "148412999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062610440", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 6517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6517, "last_played": 1680756748}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome squad game. you can play how you want. there is no right or wrong. it took me a bit to get used to the game but ended up having so much fun with it. its rewarding when your main starts slaying it up. worth full price for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1697588428, "timestamp_updated": 1697588428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148408812": {"recommendationid": "148408812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001765256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 27906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23609, "last_played": 1699319679}, "language": "english", "review": "getting your butt kicked repeatedly was never so frustrating yet so fun, and rewarding later on when u survive long enough to become Jackie Chan incarnate.", "timestamp_created": 1697580326, "timestamp_updated": 1697580326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148400326": {"recommendationid": "148400326", "author": {"steamid": "76561199389227921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1431, "last_played": 1695429578}, "language": "english", "review": "Who knew getting beat to near death could actually benefit you!

I don't know of another game quite like it.\n\nI remember seeing the proof-of-concept wandering-sword-squad demo videos ages and ages ago, then forgot about it, then saw it actually released, so I tried it out. It wasn't until my second install that I really got a good game going. Had a few good runs at it. \n\nThere are tons of mods for Kenshi, if you're into that. I only played vanilla, apart from one custom starting character I made just to see what maxed-out martial arts looked like. If you just want to max out a character without \"really playing the game,\" you might as well do a custom start instead of kidnapping someone so you can beat them up for weeks on end, or whatever cheesy training mechanic you might learn can be abused.\n\nThe weird and creepy stuff in Kenshi is genuinely weird and creepy. Don't spoil too much for yourself, if you haven't already.\n\nThe camera, at times, completely stinks. It's neat to have a town in the middle of a canyon, except for the camera POV bouncing all over the place anytime you try to look around.\n\nLoad-times can be a problem if you have multiple squads in different parts of the map.

vida en latam que este XD, en kenshi encontraras peligro en cada esquina del mapa desde bandidos hambrientos y esclavistas errantes hasta un leviathan que no dudara en aplastarte si te metes con el, la moderada historia que te ofrece el juego es bastante interesante ya que puede ir desde un enjambre que quiere convertirse en el espadach\u00edn mas fuerte hasta robots con piel  humana, si quieres un juego con mec\u00e1nicas de leveo que requieran bastante entrenamiento, donde puedas luchar contra imperios esclavistas, religiosos narcisistas y can\u00edbales deformes kenshi es tu juego , que no te interesa la luche y quieres se un simple comerciante  o fundar tu propio reino kenshi es tu juego ya que puedes ser lo que quieras ser, en mi opini\u00f3n personal es un juego bastante bueno para jugarlo con el desafi\u00f3 de una sola vida ya que inicias desde lo mas bajo en un mundo en que hasta una cabra te puede matar, pero una vez aprendes sus mec\u00e1nicas y te vuelves un poco mas fuerte notaras una facilidad al movilizarte por el mundo eso no quiere decir que no te vayan a matar por si algo aprend\u00ed de kenshi es que todo lo que puede pasar va pasar igual o peor de lo que te puedes esperar, en cuanto aspectos malas de juegos es que consume bastantes recursos de la pc y aunque hay mods que ayudan a solucionarlo un poco si no tienes una pc nimiamente decente puede que tengas fallos o que el propio juego se cierre sin avisos, tambi\u00e9n de que tiene  una inmensa cantidad de mods que le agregan contenido algunos siguen en desarrollo o ya fueron olvidados lo que hace que aveces causen errores en texturas del juego tengo entendido que el juego fue echo por unas pocas personas lo que me parece impresionante para el desarrollo que tiene, aun as\u00ed le echo en falta contenido por desarrollar o incluso que completen algunas mec\u00e1nicas como la toma de decisiones en cuanto a que facciones te alias o incluso si asedias un sentamiento y matas a todos sus lideres aun asi iras encontrando asentamientos de esa misma facci\u00f3n o incluso se llegan a destruir del todo y pierden utilidad estar\u00eda bueno que los pudieras reclamar para tu reino si es que lo tienes o se lo otorgues la facci\u00f3n a la que te aliaste y te de beneficios de comercio, otra cosa que debo criticar son los modelos de los personajes aunque aveces es divertido crear personajes toscos y vi sarros creo que hizo falta un poco mas de personalizaci\u00f3n en ese aspecto aun que por su parte el tema de que cada raza tenga sus propias estad\u00edsticas y mejoras me parece bastante bueno y es algo que se debe conservar si se piensa hacer una segunda entrega, algo que estar\u00eda incre\u00edble seria que agregaran un modo online abrir\u00eda las puertas a un mont\u00f3n de contenido y mec\u00e1nicas como el roleo y comercio se volver\u00eda bastente interesantes tal vez para una siguiente entrega. en fin recomiendo el juego y le doy un 7/10", "timestamp_created":

tough one, and when i wrote this review i also took into account the cost of the game. \n\nIts borderline for me to recommend because the game is really hard work. But hard work in a good way if you stick with it.\n\nIts taken me 20 hours to actually click with it. Multiple restarts, giving up early on and not playing then the other day i decided to give it another try. I started as the enslaved guy and for some reason this gave me a purpose and got me playing, trying to escape.\n\nThe game is really unique in how hard it is, giving you little to no help and zero direction so you have to make your own adventures. But once you figure it you can have a cool experience. \n\nSo far in my  new game ive recruited a good band of 4 (plus me) and tried to set up a base, this was captured and taken over and i had to run for my life. Had near death with beak things, luckily ran into some beserkers who killed them for me, and as i went to heal their leader as thanks the jumped on me, so time to run again all the way back to the city. \n\nThe game works best if you tentatively explore but be ready to run, take some fights nearer the cities but keep a man in reserve dont commit everyone, because if you all get ko and badly, no one will wake. \n\nSo far this seems to work well for me and im loving the game. Just raided an old cache of old tech and got \"rich\" in my terms of over 20,000 gold (To mine a day you will  make about 3 k with 2 or 3 people to put that in context. My guys are secure with food in their bellies, semi decent gear and learning new skills.\n\nThe downsides to this game are really hidden storytelling and world building. There are small books which give really limited info in pubs. Some people give you one or two lines of conversation but its really limited. At first this is cool but later it becomes frustrating as you dont know why anything is as it is or who is doing what. They should have put more books into the world for you to read and made the characters in town have longer conversation lines and such, the system is capable of doing it. Just something simple like a guy who describes whats going on in that faction or a guy who you can ask questions but there is very little of that.\n\nAs an example in one town you can ask \"you want an alliance\" to which they say why would i ally with a guy with a rusty sword? And then you can say well what if i kill blah blah for you? But who even is this blah blah? I dont know who im offering to kill or where they are?  This side of the game is severly lacking and would be really really simple to remedy... If i  knew how to make mods and a bit about the lore i could even do it. \n\nOther than that the radiant events that happen are what make the game great, and watching the computer create moments. These ultimately save the game if you are willing to keep trying and get through the early stages.\n\nAnother great gameplay moment I had for example was seeing a group of guys in an outpost, Kralls Chosen. The guys are tough for me but i noticed a big fight between them and some traders. The fight was so close and i ran in to try to help the traders, backing back out when it was going badly. The traders won and i managed to get the leader of Kralls chosen who had a 30k bounty!!! This is insane early game. I grabbed him and my other team mate who had her leg wrecked and so my team of 3 (this was early game) headed to the nearest city to turn in the bounty. 2 running with one friend one enemy on their backs. Then when i was almost there a group of wolves attacked me. I had to drop the body and fight for my life. The whole team were downed and as this fight went on the bad guy got up an limped off lol!! I managed to get one companion up, and he dragged one of the others back to town and then came back for my main companion who was comatose but the enemy was nowhere to be seen just blood, so wether the dogs got him or he escaped who knows. \n\nBut thats an example of the \"radiant\" kind of events that can happen and what makes me give the game a positive review despite its flaws.

Base building meets squad management meets dynamic world state! Non-linear storytelling with no level scaling! These are big, exciting features, and with people comparing it to giants like [i]Runescape[/i] and [i]Dwarf Fortress[/i], my interest was piqued.\n\nThe incredibly strong aesthetic helped grab the attention, too. Kenshi presents a wholly original vision, a post-post apocalypse setting chock full of poignant scenery and surprising dangers. The environments and music are simply stunning, and the sheer scope of the setting gives the game an eerie vibe that ratchets up the immersion nicely.\n\nSadly, being pretty and ambitious isn\u2019t enough.\n\nThough it delivers on many of its promises, Kenshi is held back by a pacing problem. For some, the incredibly slow pace of the game is an attraction. The argument goes that being a hero is more rewarding if you spend lots of time as a zero first. Though I appreciate the logic, getting anywhere and accomplishing anything takes [i]forever[/i], and attempting to speed the process is a great way to get yourself killed and sent back to square one.\n\nThis laborious, raise-stats-over-days style of RPG has largely fallen out of vogue, except among people with a huge amount of spare time. They\u2019re just too much effort for most people when there are better returns on their time investment to be found elsewhere. If I want to fantasize about being a post-apocalyptic warlord, there are games that will let me do that without 80+ hours of grind.\n\nBeyond the pacing issue, Kenshi\u2019s systems suffer from a bad case of \u2018video game logic\u2019, and are often poorly explained or implemented. For example, base building is a mid-game activity - do it too early, and you\u2019re dead. Trying to run a shop only works under very specific circumstances, and is absolutely not a good way to make money. Despite offering a non-linear, player-directed story, Kenshi has pretty specific expectations of you, and until you learn to write within the lines, it\u2019ll kill you a lot.\n\nFinally - and this is simply a matter of personal taste - the ultraviolence of the setting failed to capture me. Kenshi\u2019s world is a canvas of human misery, hacked off limbs, slavery, and subsistence farming. The chaotic sandbox is designed to encourage and reward a tribalist mentality. Props for setting a vibe, but I found it too unrelentingly grim.\n\nIf you\u2019re gaming on limited hardware, have a compatible kind of neurodivergency, and/or have unlimited free time, Kenshi could be the game of your dreams.

Also, the squad management tools/design is sorely outdated and very buggy - you spend a ton of time fighting the actions of individual minions. \n\nAnyway, total recommend but your mileage will vary.

It's the only one I have for Steam actually - I've fallen down the MMO hole before and this is a nice RTS inspired RPG sandbox. There are a lot of things I hope they're improving for the sequel. Many of the systems seem well executed but ultimately need fine tuning and further exploration. What I would hope for, but is not coming, is an alteration of the Ogre Engine to update the reliance on a single processor (which I think was what it was doing) to multiple processors so that everything would run like a modern game. The only things to be desired are the before mentioned expansion of features and a graphics upgrade for sure - is that a bandit in the distance? Sure looks like a speck of pixels dancing in the distance... haha. Kenshi is my favorite - actually it's the type of game I've imagined could exist, as far back as my first time playing Starcraft as a kid. I think the way forward is to turn Kenshi's world and game experience into a Elder Scrolls type of game, in the sense of depth, graphics, interaction, lore and freedom - without  losing the RTS controls. I also wish for a Kenshi experience that incorporates online play, but maybe only local online gameplay with friends. I don't think Kenshi should have a heavy RTS competition mode, but it would be an interesting thing to experiment with. RTS was more or less a sport in the past - I think the RPG approach is better - however the things that Kenshi may lack is the feeling of being truly threatened by a thinking, strategizing opponent, whether that be another person or a machine. I could nitpick on all sorts of details of the gameplay/systems/features right now, but the game is amazing for something a single human being has developed on their own from an indie perspective.

I came across a myconid named Paras that could only... well, say Paras. Paras had no ability to trade with store owners, talk to NPC;s, or interact with them in anyway except physical. This made Paras a prime candidate to be my first martial artist. \n\nStanding at about 1m Paras was quiet, deadly, and would yell \"KYAAAAAAH!\" whenever he got a good blow in. The little guy was a boxing, break dancing fiend.\n\nBut even with him and my massive Skeleton marksman it wasn't enough as Kenshi often proves. I picked up a few skeleton hirelings, got them trained up on a myriad of combat and non-combat abilities, and began heading north. Much of the playthrough consisted of raiding labs, getting clapped, and having to heal my boys between running away. But then I met Rabbit, and my game changed forever.\n\nI had never messed with prosthetics in previous playthroughs, and decided Rabbit, a spindly skeleton with skill in martial arts, was going to be the Logan to my weapon X project. After successfully removing all of Rabbits limbs (making sure to have medici bots on standby with a bed) I attached two masterwork sword legs I had pillaged, and two chainsaw arms. Rabbit became a beyblade dervish of death, and the little bugger saved my salvage crew multiple times including beating the ever loving frack out of a leviathan. \n\nI had a massive skeleton named Brick that was trained to take no damage single-handedly wipe out two Okranite raiding parties. He still stands guard, occasionally beating the living daylights out of dismembered foes with his trademark spiked bat. \n\nI made drugs, sold drugs, and built a large facility as an outpost where I intend to make the worlds best weapons and sell them at large across the world. I intend to wipe out all the Okranites and supply the enemy forces with top grade weapons and armor to do so. \n\nLong live Blade Baron Works. Long live Kenshi.\n\nBuy this fucking game. Make stories, become CRAB.

Like how Star Wars Battlefront or Kingdom Come Deliverance was fun because you get to be a single lil guy in a larger conflict and can become a force on your own that same feeling exists here but WAY better. If you\u2019re a beast you earned it, if you get fucked you earned it. \n\nMod community goes hard, base game is good but the community really elevates the experience for everyone. Idk what else to say the game is fucking cool dude give it a try. \n\nI may be drunk writing this, but it\u2019s like drunk gushing to your homies abt how much you love and appreciate them. The creator and team deserve a firm handshake and props I already gave em my money I can only try and convince others to do the same.

I tried giving it a chance but the game boils down to this:\n\nThere is no direction or narrative, you're supposed to create your own. But the world is too empty and you cant interact with it enough to make said narrative. You need events to influence narratives in the first place, otherwise they're just an imaginary story in your head with zero backing. Dwarf Fortress is a great example of a game with zero direction, no quests, yet tons of player created narrative. Dwarf Fortress has complex systems that allow for literally anything to happen, and that's what makes it so great at creating player driven stories. Kenshi has none of that. It has the same randomness a bethesda game does. Once you've played it once, you've seen all there is and all that can happen. \n\nHow am I supposed to make a narrative out of nothing but walking across a barren map, getting constantly attacked by the same starving bandit/ninja/whatever generic enemy variant, moving from city to city only to find that every city plays almost identically outside of some minor exceptions? The most \"exciting\" thing that can happen is being enslaved. But unless you purposely go out of your way to make it happen, it rarely happens. Even then they just throw you in a cage for awhile then make you mine a rock indefinitely, that's it. There's no randomness to spice things up so you end up having to force your own narrative. Why can't I befriend certain factions or influence diplomacy between them? Why can't I become renowned and feared by the occasional NPC? Why cant I create my own faction and claim territory? Or become a leader in a pre existing one? Death isn't even an issue, you have to go out of your way to die in this game. \n\nThe only thing you will find in cities is the same type of stores/buildings, with a bar that will have generic person 1 and 2 who you can recruit for money. With the rare unique NPC. \n\nThe ways of making money in the game are all boring. They're either no action grinds such as running drugs from one city to the next one over, or mining a rock, or looting dead corpses.  Or they're combat focused but unless you wanna grind your character up for literal hours, you're not gonna succeed at those.\n\nI get that you're supposed to be a nobody and that you're not special. But then what is the point!? If I wanted to play a game where I haul rocks back and fourth doing nothing, then I'd go play an MMO or something.  You can become \"special\" but the intended means of doing so are ass backwards and ridiculously slow.  It's one of those games were you can only level up via doing the activity in a real situation. Like Skyrim, or Project Zomboid so if you wanted to level up your toughness for example, instead of training/sparring or whatever to give you abit of starting experience, you have to go get beaten up by real bandits over and over. Atleast Skyrim has trainers and Zomboid has books, this game has none of that.\n\nWanna level up you're strength? Throw a bunch of rocks in your bag, hold a corpse and AFK walking simulator accross the map back and fourth for hours.\n\nWanna grind dexterity? Pick up an unconscious animal, throw it on a bed and hit it over and over.\n\nWanna grind toughness? Throw yourself into a group of 40 bandits and spam right click while getting knocked out over and over. \n\nBORING. The skills should not go up so ridiculously slow that the average player feels the need to go out of their way to min-max it, I should be able to gain strength and dexterity by fighting naturally, not purposely putting myself in losing battles. Speaking of that. How the hell are you even meant to get your stats up high enough to take on the stronger enemies?? Once you hit a certain point, the easy enemies give no XP, yet the hard ones are impossible to beat because it will be a 1v40 and they either match your stats or have better ones. The player should not be encouraged to go get all of their limbs chopped off to replace them with low quality robotic ones just to level up their stat faster. I shouldn't have to train my sword skill using a rusty sword when I have a legendary one in my possession. \n\nWhat's that? You grinded your toughness and strength to 90? Well fuck you, your \"\"\"masterwork\"\"\" armor is gonna slice your stats in half. Either wear some overglorified robes or get screwed, loser.\n\nI'm assuming you're supposed to recruit more people? But you have to manually feed each one, and manually grind all of their skills too. So unless you enjoy wasting your free time doing a pointless grind on each character and manually feeding each character. Then that's not an enjoyable alternative.\n\nThis game is more of a walking simulator than DayZ standalone is. It unironically has made me deppressed when I look at the clock and realized I just wasted 30minutes of my free time watching my character run from point A to B with no interesting stuff between. \n\nOverall, boring, predictable, the grind isn't fun/not rewarding, and there just ain't anything in the game to aid the player in forming a dynamic narrative. It's a running simulator with a loading screen sprinkled in every 45 seconds and your occasional pack of bandits. You must be on drugs to consider this game a masterpiece in dynamic story telling. There's absolutely nothing dynamic about the game. It's as dynamic as Skyrim. I enjoyed grinding my stats up and making a cool samurai but I quickly realized there's no point unless I wanna exploit the crap out of my skills or micromanage 10 nobodies I don't care about. The only thing this game has going for it story wise is the starting scenerios. \n\nDon't fall for the youtube videos. This game is literally a waste of time in all aspects. It's Runescape but you cant show off your cool gear or stats to any real person.

I have a pretty high tolerance for jank/bugs but I've considered dropping Kenshi multiple times for the sheer frequency of characters bugging out and getting stuck in walls. The game is also very unbalanced and several systems appear to be semi-broken or pointless. At the same time, the variety of environments and the extremely interesting world kept me coming back. Even though some parts of it don't make sense, this is very different from other \"management\" games I've played like Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, etc. Overall Kenshi is like the Alpha version of the greatest RPG ever made. It's inconsistent, buggy, frustrating, and extremely interesting.\n\nEdit:\nAfter my characters became stuck in a wall for the 500th time and I had to recall everyone back to my base I decided to change my review to a not recommend. There's a lot to love here but the lack of polish is so extreme that it just is not worth fighting the game to see what it has to offer. It's really disappointing because I really enjoyed parts of my experience, but the game is just borderline broken. \n\nThere really is a fantastic game under all this mess but it is just so clunky that 2/3 of game time will be spent wrestling with poorly designed mechanics, engaging in tedious micromanagement (For your own sake use the bed healing speed up mod), or finding workarounds to bugs. I really wish the game would get out of its own way and let me explore this weird and fascinating setting.

Not my words but I agree and like how it rolls out.\n\nI do not want to criticize Chris too much since he did not have a $220m budget. I do give him credit for hard work and good effort, 10/10. \n\nI do not approve of the decision that has been made, unpopular opinion, of dropping this game to work on Kenshi 2 rather than finishing (improving) this game and porting it to another engine. \n\nI feel like the gaming industry nowadays trends in unfinished, unpolished games and always move on to the next new project which gives you that spark and excitement. I just hope that LoFi/ Chris doesn't follow that same pattern because despite how good Kenshi really is, bugs and glitches have ruined countless of my games and the experience just isn't smooth enough for me to recommend it to someone else.\n\nEDIT: I am editing this review so that my review doesn't off-throw anyone from trying the game. Because in all honesty; it is a great game and if you don't try this you'll miss out on an innovative master piece (IMO).I paid $20 and still have fun (mostly) playing 12 hours a day without pulling my hair out knowing that the company had a $220M budget and brought out such oversold overhyped bulls***, TODD.\n\nI have clocked in 880 hours in the first 3 months I played it and another 300 in the past month after I took a break from it (gonna be more). Unlike modern games this game actually has replay value because you can do everything different without the game breaking (probably not breaking because there are bugs, there are mods that fix some things in the workshop.)\n\nMy first review spoke truth and I still think Chris should have ported the game, improved it and made it better by adding all the things that he initially wanted (engine restrictions for some things, PORT IT ALREADY).\n\nWhich brings me to my next point. This game was made by 1 sole developer (at first) whom in my opinion put his heart and soul into a game where more just isn't possible because the engine struggles.   Unlike people saying Bethesdas games can't handle stuff because \"engine issues\". I wanted to make that comparison real quick to express how truly amazing this game is. Bethesda can't even pull something like this out of their arse with a $220m budget and a team of 500 people because they are too busy focusing on making money, bringing up the hype, marketing stupid watches which nobody gives a F*** about except a few hardcore no expectation fan boys who will gobble up any s*** that is fed to them. Verbally speaking, not literally. OH AND A HEADSET OMFG NEVER SEEN ONE OF THOSE BEFORE TODD.\n\nBig gaming companies lack passion and innovation for games because the people in charge are afraid of taking risks so they stick to the same boring formula, except that if you spend $200 more you get a watch. So congratulations TODD.\n\nThis game was made through passion/innovation is all i'm trying to say in many words and many examples. Despite the duct tape analogy and the many other issues that it does in fact have.. Recognise specilisation, who tf. It's like they replaced all the words which are supposed to have Z's in them with S's and reverse vice versa...\n\nObviously this type of game isn't made for everyone; ezpecially the grammar police. \n\nThe learning curve is steep and to truly have the Kenshi experience I feel that the player needs the knowledge to fully play this sandbox game how they see fit. With that being said, the learning curve is extremely fun but also infuriating at times.\n\nP.S Dear Chris,\n\nNo offense but I just cannot recommend this game. Your baby, Kenshi, is abandoned and so many mechanics just feel unfinished and deep down I know that more was planned (some of these listed down below I found on your old forum but others, I as the player can tell are unfinished considering the creativity that went into this game and then there being parts that just feel slapped on top so that it works). If only you ported that what was already there and completed the mechanics that were left in the dust. E.G) Assassination, enemies can't break free, the player can't break free (when being carried). Why do the mercenary A.I s just run away from their squad when they had enough of fighting and just stand glitching in the middle of the town/cities without repercussions from the captains. Where are the thievez, the azzazzinz that should come after the player. Skeleton eyes that the player can equip when his eyes get shot with a bolt, WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN AND MY HEIR!? Anyway, I can go on but I wont.\n\nAll in all 10/10 game just sad to see it's been left in the dust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB", "timestamp_created": 1695925536, "timestamp_updated": 1696876749,

Set up an outpost (don't do this early-game though, my mistake) and was constantly attacked by roving bands of bandits whom I could down, but you can't execute enemies in this game for some fucking reason??? which led to a literal horde of unconscious bandits that piled up quicker than I could remove from my outpost. This led to them constantly waking up and just beating the shit out of my characters over, and over, and over, and we were too hurt to run away fast enough from the first few fights. Then, again, with a completely new save and character I was just chilling in a shop and got murked by the entire town guard for NO REASON. \n\nMe being murdered in those two situations was obviously a bug and completely unintended, but I was just using the game's systems (selling slaves and items) and got punished for it. I also find it completely ridiculous that a game renowned for being brutal does not allow you to execute downed enemies, yet my characters are constantly left bleeding out for 20 minutes of REAL TIME at max game speed after every fight.

an open world game with absolutely NO missions, quests, or point whatsoever?  Here you go!  Definition of sandbox done HORRIBLY wrong.  \n\nWould you like to set up a base? Go * Yourself.  You will be raided non-stop until you go download 19 mods to make the game playable since the SLIDERS IN THE OPTIONS TO SELECT NEVER DOES NOT WORK!  No matter how you set the raid and attack options, it makes no difference whatsoever.\n\nWould you like to wander the wastes after super power leveling the crap out of your character to all 90+ stats? Go for it!  We'll just have you miss 19 dodges in a row and be \"rarely\" decapitated by a STARVING WEAKLING with a strength of 4, a death that was decided BEFORE the starving waste of life was even spawned in! (Tested, had a save before anyone was spawned in, around the corner was one single starving bandit that was already injured, killed me every time I loaded no matter what I did, gameplay tested!)\n\nWould you like to clean up your base?  Haha, go choke on someone else's cares, you dumb *.  Because another group of Dust Bandits are spawning just outside your vision and are going to attack while you are still trying to remove the corpses from the last attack.  We dont even give a * that you killed our King and claimed the bounty and now the Demands cannot happen, these are WANDERING spawns, so we get to cheat because our single person dev doesn't give a crap about you.\n\nWould you like to properly defend your base with common sense things like patrol routes or guard positions, the way the AI already does it anyway so why would it be a big deal?  Why are you still trying to have fun?  No Sir, you need to download 3 MORE mods to add this functionality because the dev is too lazy to do it.\n\nNot to worry, though!  The dev did build in one super handy tool that they \"claim\" fixes everything!  Just Import your save.  What does it do? Deletes all your stuff on the ground!  Tired of all those messy materials or backpacks you dropped or those weapons you removed from the 300 dead bodies piling up ready to crash your game?  Just Import your save!  It's so easy, all you have to do it exit the freaking game completely and re-launch it because the option to import is on the main menu and we hate you so we did not allow you to get there from inside a game, neat huh?  Careful not to hit the Continue button by accident, because then you have to re-launch it again, you stupid * piece of....\n\nSo that's it.  If you are into ridiculous levels of modding in order to make a game even marginally playable, Kenshi is your game!  Otherwise, go * yourself.\n\nTLDR: Terrible planning, execution, support, development, and coding.  Only play if you are very proficient at modding.

Outpost building is subpar when building on diverse terrain and topology (which makes up most of the Kenshi map), even compared to games like Age of Empires. Pathing is abysmal and requires meticulous intent compounded on by the frustrating micromanagement required once your party size grows.\n\nThe remarkable thing, however, is how amazing this game is and what potential it has/had. The game was made by one person over the span of ~5 years, but has since been able to garner a handful of dedicated developers. \n\nThere aren't really any meaningful developments/patches/updates/hot-fixes being made as I presume headcount and manpower is being placed on Kenshi 2, which is in development and set to be GA sometime soon (optimistically Q4 2023 or realistically sometime in 2024), while leveraging Unreal Engine.\n\nThe workshop is lacking as far as 'quality of life' content goes, through no fault of the community or modders, but purely from modding tools and access to certain content.\n\nThat said, it's single-handedly the best buggy game I've ever played. Where the game excels in is with its story-telling, true RPG nature, and openness that allows you to get to \"end-game\" loot, events, and areas straight from the beginning. You really can do whatever you want (within the limitations of the actual game itself).\n\nIs it worth $30? In my opinion, no, but given the pure passion and dedication that went into realizing its existence, which is outright admirable, one could make the case. The bugs are too apparent and game-altering to validate the claim in my arguments, however, and so I would not pay the full retail price tag on it. \n\nI got this game for $8, but I would've settled for ~$15-20 given its current state.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll be actively anticipating Kenshi 2.", "timestamp_created": 1695173688, "timestamp_updated": 1695174894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506172835826873779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146621985": {"recommendationid": "146621985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103750654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 113869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2237, "playtime_at_review": 103054, "last_played": 1700789765}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah I mean its alright I guess.", "timestamp_created": 1695172972, "timestamp_updated": 1695172972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746393680572509766", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146618739": {"recommendationid": "146618739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147083364", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 18905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11444, "last_played": 1698229666}, "language": "spanish", "review": "casi 200 horas jugando y voy por mas lo unico malo es que se devora mi tiempo y ni me doy cuenta.\n\nno puedo esperar por Kenshi 2.", "timestamp_created": 1695167555, "timestamp_updated": 1695167555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146616100": {"recommendationid": "146616100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025080341", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 3292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 463, "last_played": 1697186839}, "language": "english", "review": "Unlike so many other tittles that boast that \"You can make your own story.\" Kenshi does not rely on you to pick up the slack and fill in the void left by devs never implrementing features and mechanics for you to actually make your own story.\n\nKenshi is a brutal, open world, squad management, base building, farming, action roleplaying game where you are plopped out into a world that does not care if you live or die.

Within just a brief hour of gameplay, this game effortlessly shattered my expectations and swiftly claimed the throne as a temporary favorite. It is an absolute masterpiece, albeit not without a few inherent drawbacks that can easily be rectified by mods.\n\nI wholeheartedly endorse Kenshi as a game that deserves recognition from everyone. However, I advise players to equip themselves with mods before embarking on their journey. These modifications effectively address and resolve most, if not all, of the game's limitations, propelling the experience to unprecedented heights. Kenshi serves as a beacon, an exemplar of what open-world games should aspire to be, catering to a diverse and enthusiastic audience.\n\nThe game resonated with me on such a profound level that I am compelled to bestow upon it a rating of 9 out of 10. This stands as a testament to the developers' unwavering dedication and boundless creativity. I eagerly await their future endeavors, eager to see what they have in store for us next.

from prison in the first run:\n> Start in crappy run down town\n> Mine copper for profit\n> Decide I will be a miner and sell my ores for profit\n> Farm copper and iron\n> Make fat stacks\n> Hire companion to bodyguard and help mine copper\n> Make tons of money\n> Decide to buy cow to help carry more copper\n> Search in a wasteland for an hour to find someone who sells a cow\n> Finally find farmstead in a holy land and buy a cow\n> On the way back to my mining camp\n> Like 8 bandits sprinting at me on the horizon\n> Realize cow is high value target\n> Send cow to run away\n> Prepare my men to fight\n> Accidentally select cow when pressing attack\n> Almost scream out loud, scared of losing my nine thousand dollar investment \n> Cow immediately plows through like 4 bandits, tearing off a leg and an arm and leaving a massive pool of blood\n> Other guys fight off bandits as cow absolutely destroys the bandits trying to escape\n> Cow is insane\n> Travel with band of mercenaries and nomads until we reach some town\n> Pack of wolves attacks and breaks one of my guys legs\n> Guards come from town, a few die to the wolves\n> Try to take opportunity to get some sweet guard armor\n> Immediately get caught because guy I tried to loot was bleeding out not dead\n> Guards attack stealing guy, broken leg guy tries to attack guards and defend teammate, immediately gets rocked\n> Both in jail\n> Broken leg is super good at lock picking and stealing guy has super high athleticism meaning he can run super fast\n> Broken leg unlocks cage and breaks fast guy out\n> Fast guy sprints out screaming obscenities, bringing the cow with him\n> All guards in town immediately go after him\n> Broken leg guy slips out of cage during all the commotion\n> Regroup and head back to camp to lay low\n> Finally make it back to mining camp\n> Start mining\n> Group of bandits sneak up and knock my guys out, breaking another leg on the same guy as before in the process\n> Bandits immediately devour cow \n> Slavers pull up to see my guys bleeding out on the street with a half eaten cow\n> Slavers pick up guy with no broken bones and start to pick up guy with broken leg\n> Pack of wolves come out of nowhere and attack slavers\n> Slavers barely survive and leave, forgetting my guy with a broken bone on the ground\n> Broken bone guy stops playing dead and slowly crawls to nearby town\n> Broken bone guy starts healing while enslaved guy plots escape\n> While travelling to camp slavers get distracted by giant ostrich beast\n> Sprint away with my enslaved athletics 40 guy who runs at 20km/h\n> Regroup and lay low until slavers stop looking for escaped slave\n> Have existential crisis after realizing all the ore farming I was doing was essentially the same as what they would have me do as a slave\n> Cope by rescuing random slave girl who wants to be a fighter\n> Train her up by having her carry backpacks of iron\n> Adopt a dog while this is going on\n> Decide to check out new spot on the map with newfound family\n> Find cool robot explorer\n> Travel around for a while living with no cash because mining is for nerds\n> Group of slavers pull up\n> Battle goes on for about thirty IRL minutes as I'm pausing and trying to figure out how I can win\n> Barely survive with beaten and dying men and dying robot\n> One survives, heals others\n> Goes to heal robot, realizes he doesnt have a repair kit\n> Repair kits cost like 5000 dollars\n> Do not have that kind of cash (around 1000)\n> Realize what I must do\n> Frantically mine copper with all three of my guys as soon as they recover while the dog guards the dying robot\n> Make barely enough\n> Buy repair kit\n> Sprint to repair robot\n> Robot is seriously dying\n> Finally get there and start repairing\n> The damage is too great, robot dies in the arms of my family of misfits\n> Jaw drops to the floor\n\nAll of this happened in about 13 hours of gameplay, with no story, no quests, just me playing, with my own goals, in a massive world, meeting random characters. I should say that this game is an amalgam of things I dislike: I don't like slower stat based rpgs, I don't like real time strategy, I don't like survival games, and I find apocalypse games such as fallout to have extremely drab and ugly environments. Yet despite being all these things and more rolled into a giant meat taco, kenshi has me utterly captivated in its gameplay. Everything happens in a fairly non scripted open world/sandbox environment where a lot of the fun is simply experiencing and living in the world. \n\nNo game has ever had me so connected to my character (And ironically, there is no given story to your character) as the only way for your character to improve in something is to experience it for themselves, want to get better at fighting? Go fight then. Want to get tougher? Get beat up more and survive. Want to do anything? Keep failing until you get it right. Whatever doesn't kill you will make you stronger and that is how you progress in this game, the high difficulty comes not from the actual enemies in the world (though they are quite tough) but instead knowing what fights you can and cannot take, all of those stat points mean nothing if your character is dead in the wasteland, and this raw feeling of survival gives you such a will to live and a want to grow to be the strongest, no other game has ever come as close to the feeling of intensity for me as kenshi has. \n\nSteam says I've only played about 13 hours of this game so far but those 13 hours were so special I felt the uncontrollable urge to post a review. While reading the reviews for this game I was highly skeptical of the freedom it claimed to have as I am used to having controlled freedom such as in a bethesda or rockstar open world game; in games like that there is a huge, lush open world to explore but the story or side quests are only happening in one little dot on the map. This is not that, this is a true open world experience with unbridled freedom where you make your own story, interactions and personal experiences. Not that there is no dialogue, there is some written for interactions in towns that are often deadbeat ironic statements that I find extremely hilarious, and depending on the race/gender of characters in your party they have special things to say to each other about places they visit and things they do in passing that can be an informative or comedic reprieve from the desolate and violent wasteland that surrounds them. \n\nDespite the world of kenshi being very run down and barren from an outside view, the game still feels full of life and action, even though all that surrounds you is an ancient, utterly destroyed world. While I dislike drab environments with little in them where simply walking around makes me want to throw up, kenshis world is so captivating and deeply atmospheric that I've actually come to like the visuals for the most part. About 99% of the music is also amazing. There is one track (Or maybe its some sort of sound effect) that I find incredibly irritating and loud, but other than that outlier; the simple, haunting melodies which sound like exploring a ghost town perfectly match the atmosphere of wandering and surviving a wasteland alien world. I've only spent a few hours in the world of kenshi so far, but its left more of an impression on me than most games I've put a hundred hours into have. I look forward to exploring more of this world in its vastness; until then, see you space cowboy.\n\nEdit: I've played 30 more hours since this review, my opinion has not changed on this game overall, but there is so much more I could say as I've gotten into it.

As someone who thought they were a seasoned gamer, let me tell you, Kenshi humbled me. From getting my butt kicked by a gang of bandits, to being chased by creatures that looked like they escaped from Avatar, Kenshi kept me on my toes - well, until those toes eventually got hacked off by a sword or something. But that's not the worst part. The real challenge was trying to micromanage a group of characters with the attention span of a goldfish.

It is a grind, that is certain, but as someone who doesn't generally like grindy games, this one actually struck home for me, for some reason. It feels rewarding, watching a character's stat increase by even a single point, especially with how easily that character could be maimed, slaughtered, cannibalized or forcefully amputated. By the time I had my first proper base established, I was feeling pretty high up, my squad even defended their home from one of the big factions that we upset, with aid from the allies we'd made. \nYet, Kenshi didn't let me ride the high for very long, and soon it humbled me by cutting off my main man's left arm, to remind me of my place in the natural order. BUT, now he sports a mechanical prosthetic in its place, and it's made him even more dangerous than before, despite being one of the lower end arms. \nMake the best out of a bad situation, failure is only failure if you crumble to it. \nHighly recommend to anyone who enjoys games like Darkest Dungeon or Dark Souls (no, I am not calling this a \"Souls-Like\") who take joy in overcoming difficult

But, I have played this over the years and I always come back to it. While there isn't much direct story, and mostly in the background for the setting, learning as you go.

I do recommend any new player put themselves in the proper mindset to push through that part.\n\nHowever, throughout that process, I discovered one of my favorite games of all time. Kenshi is a game that can be enjoyed in elaborately different ways.\n\n-Do you want to play a single-character focused RPG? \n-Do you want to play a settlement simulator similar to Rimworld? \n-Do you want to play a real-time CRPG focusing on a single party/squad?\n-Do you want to play a squad management focused game, managing resources and different objectives you create for yourself?\n\nAll of these things in this glorious sandbox, are various ways you can enjoy and play the game. To make the story yourself and play it in anyway you want. Not to mention, the elaborate Mod Community. A personal favorite of mine is the Star Wars conversion mod. \n\nPlease give this game a chance, and you'll enjoy an incredible experience unique to this game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1694383478, "timestamp_updated": 1694383478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146082397": {"recommendationid": "146082397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117884918", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1279, "last_played": 1694380531}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Obra Maestra", "timestamp_created": 1694380670, "timestamp_updated": 1694380670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146079369": {"recommendationid": "146079369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198979062539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 64655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1546, "playtime_at_review": 61676, "last_played": 1700784252}, "language": "english", "review": "Kenshi is a game about great contradictions. On surface, Kenshi seems to check off everything a bad game has: bad graphics, shoddy optimization, confusing lore, and grindy gameplay. But at it's core, it embodies what a good game or piece of media should be. It follows the most basic yet important of story-telling: show, not tell, and it achieves a level of depth in gameplay seldom seen before in any other video game with astonishingly simple mechanics. Good games focus on being a master of one instead of jack of all trades, but the greatest games are able to be the master of all trades. Kenshi is one of these.\n\nRoguelike, RTS, RPG, Sandbox, Squad-Based Combat, Post-Apocalyptic Survival, City Builder. Never has a game been so numerous and diverse in it's genre. You can play as a merchant, a lone wandering swordsman, a farmer, or an outlaw. You can forge factions and empires of your own, or you could destroy the ones already in place. No playthrough of Kenshi is ever the same, and even with more than the 1,000 hours I put into the game, I still discover new thing about the game day by day, despite the map of the game being a mere fraction compared to other games with the same amount of depth. The game has little to no audio, yet it has some of the most illustrative and emotional OSTs I've listened to. It has graphics that are decades old, and yet it possesses scenery so unique and beautiful you'd hang them up on your wall like some kind of avant-garde painting. The combat is simple, you click on an enemy and order your character to attack. But despite such simplicity, I watch each battle with bated breath and suspense.\n\nKenshi is a byproduct of a much simpler and greater era of video games. Developed by one man over the span of 12 years, it contains the passion, energy, and soul of the games from 2006. It came from a time where success was achieved through honest hard work and relentless drive, a far cry from today where games are mass-produced and sterilized for pure profit. It's one of the few games I would genuinely define as art. Art is one's ability to put their emotions and abilities onto a medium, and the game's developer Chris Hunt did exactly that. \n\nReading about the game's development, you hear of the many challenges and limitations Hunt had to face, such as the constant toiling at a security job to secure enough funding to just develop the game part time. At times it would seem that the future is bleak and not worth the effort, but Hunt pulled through, and created the masterpiece we have now. This is mirrored in the game. The game's world seemed so harsh and full of suffering, and the player would face constant challenges and limitations.

[If you can't walk on walls you can't man crossbows, which are literally the only counter you have against the huge bandit waves that pop up from day 1 and attack your settlement].\n#4 Can't build stuff too close to eachother. If you could build ramps more freely it would be fine for the aforementioned as you could just patch up the symptom instead of addressing the problem, but even the tiniest clip will prevent you from placing things.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a great game but I will change my review to positive when the game improves the building system so it doesn't literally give me depression. This whole game is about dealing with setbacks and improving on them but I can't  deal with the trash bugs and flaws in the building system on top of that.\nIf you decide to build in this game, I recommend you only pick a site with everything you need close together [good luck finding that lol] And on completely flat ground. Note that you will likely never find an aforementioned site as stated previously that would circumvent some of the pain I feel with this game.\nAlso a brightness setting would be good as it's hard to see at night if you have windows open.\n\nEdit: I got a jester emoji for pointing out the bad building interface?

A living, expansive, dynamic, beautiful and brutal world keeps gameplay fresh with plenty of replay value. While Kenshi has some obvious limitations the variety of stories which can be told within this framework is just amazing! I've played a righteous Crusader of the Holy Nation; a band of would-be freedom fighters desperately looking for a way to bring down the racist bigots of the Holy Nation; a lone martial artist experiencing his personal evolution while fighting slavers; a no-hive intent on carving a safe haven for other Hivers with no home... Every time I enter Kenshi's world there are new characters, challenges and adventures just waiting around the corner! Graphics are good, though maybe a little dated, and the sound direction really adds to the dangerous atmosphere of the world: sombre silence interspersed with exotic and varied musical pieces.\n\nAs mentioned, there are some limitations to the game: The UI and navigation can feel a little clunky at first. Moreover endgame content seems a little spartan after a few playthroughs. Good news is that if vanilla content is not enough for you there is a very active modding community offering a smorgasbord of mods ranging from quality-of-life updates to new areas, quests, characters and whatever else you may be looking for.\n\nMy time in Kenshi's deserts and desolate places has been truly breathtaking and addictive so far and I can't encourage you enough to make your own way into this unforgiving world.", "timestamp_created": 1694186692, "timestamp_updated": 1698689008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145902788": {"recommendationid": "145902788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333340471", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7370, "last_played": 1692003767}, "language": "english", "review": "its quite powerful", "timestamp_created": 1694166490, "timestamp_updated": 1694166490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145902686": {"recommendationid": "145902686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080682918", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 7243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7085, "last_played": 1694528007}, "language": "english", "review": "Beep is the strongest!

Su mundo abierto post-apocal\u00edptico, desolado y vasto, invita a los jugadores a sumergirse en un entorno donde la supervivencia es clave, y cada elecci\u00f3n tiene un peso y consecuencia.\n\nUna de las caracter\u00edsticas m\u00e1s destacables de Kenshi es la libertad que otorga al jugador. No hay un gui\u00f3n estricto que seguir ni misiones lineales; eres t\u00fa contra el mundo, y c\u00f3mo enfrentes sus desaf\u00edos depende enteramente de tus decisiones. \u00bfQuieres ser un comerciante n\u00f3mada? \u00bfUn bandido? \u00bfQuiz\u00e1s liderar una ciudad o convertirte en un cazador de recompensas? En Kenshi, todo es posible.\n\nLa mec\u00e1nica de construcci\u00f3n y gesti\u00f3n es particularmente impresionante. Los jugadores pueden construir sus propias bases, gestionar recursos, y enfrentarse a las amenazas de facciones rivales y criaturas del desierto. Esto aporta un nivel estrat\u00e9gico y profundo al juego, donde la planificaci\u00f3n y anticipaci\u00f3n son esenciales para la supervivencia y el \u00e9xito.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente, aunque Kenshi no compite con los triple A m\u00e1s pulidos en detalles, tiene un estilo distintivo que se adapta perfectamente a su ambiente post-apocal\u00edptico. Las vastas llanuras, monta\u00f1as rocosas y desiertos dan una sensaci\u00f3n genuina de un mundo desolado. Adem\u00e1s, su banda sonora es sutil pero inmersiva, llev\u00e1ndonos a trav\u00e9s de las desafiantes tierras con una mezcla de melancol\u00eda y tensi\u00f3n.\n\nQuiz\u00e1s lo m\u00e1s atractivo de Kenshi es su dificultad. No es un juego para aquellos que buscan un paseo tranquilo. Es brutal, implacable y a veces frustrante, pero eso es precisamente lo que lo hace tan gratificante. Cuando logras avanzar, cuando superas los desaf\u00edos, sientes un genuino sentido de logro que pocos juegos pueden igualar.\n\nEn resumen, Kenshi es una joya en el mundo de los videojuegos de sandbox y RPG. Su profunda mec\u00e1nica, su mundo vasto y desolado, y la libertad que otorga al jugador, lo convierten en una experiencia \u00fanica y obligatoria para aquellos que buscan un reto y una aventura aut\u00e9ntica. Es una prueba de resistencia, ingenio y estrategia que te mantendr\u00e1 enganchado durante horas y horas.", "timestamp_created": 1693697589, "timestamp_updated": 1693697589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145534422": {"recommendationid": "145534422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058400055", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3478, "last_played": 1693779452}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't let the fact that this is a video game fool you, this is an insanely accurate experience on what it feels like to be human.", "timestamp_created": 1693672151, "timestamp_updated": 1693672151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145527540": {"recommendationid": "145527540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249782530", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2487, "last_played": 1693794952}, "language": "english", "review": "very awesome", "timestamp_created": 1693666764, "timestamp_updated": 1693666764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145523294": {"recommendationid": "145523294", "author": {"steamid": "76561199165581070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2894, "last_played": 1697249756}, "language": "english", "review": "Vastly open world and unforgiving.

Whacked around wherever I go.\nJust a lazy way of telling you \"the game is hardcore\"\n\n- The lore in the game? Yeah, it's not as interesting as people portray it to be ... I can tolerate mundane lore but kenshi in my eyes seems to lack any depth to it. Once again, don't get the hype.\n\n- User interface/Controls or Learning the game? I swear I had an easier time learning Everquest project 1999 as a newbie.\n\n- The world environment? Vast emptiness that's got nothing interesting to offer other than a load of mobs/factions trying to maul you. (Except the swamps, the swamps were cool to discover so thumbs up to that)\n\n- Quests? Pffft yeah, virtually none existent in my short time of playing this game.\n\n- Combat is trash. Simply put trash. I understand the aspect of trying to portray your character as being worth nothing and be an absolute good for nothing nobody but at least give me a fair chance of deciding my own worth in combat for god's sake. (Out come the fan boys telling me that if I micro manage my positioning and my block/attack ratio about 1000 times per each combat session + grind my combat/toughness skill I'll be able to take on an entire squad of 16 people or some sh*t)\n\n- The grind. I've played enough RPGs/MMOs/Survival games, can we please stop normalizing grinding in games? This is yet another piss poor excuse of prolonging 'gameplay'. There is nothing fun/engaging about it and usually the satisfaction time you get out of it is minimal at best.\n\n- Graphics? I personally do like them, just a shame that there is very little sight seeing in game to enjoy them. (Unless as previously mentioned, you're in the swamps)\n\nI get it. It's a sandbox game. There is not meant to be any goal within the game other than to 'survive' really but at least make the game SOMEWHAT interesting other than throwing in cannibals and skin stealers to entertain the empty void that this game provides.

With its vast open world, intricate mechanics, and endless possibilities, it's a title that deserves every bit of its 5-star rating.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped foot into the harsh landscapes of Kenshi, I was utterly captivated. The depth of the world-building is simply astounding. Whether you're a lone wanderer or a leader of a thriving faction, the immersive storytelling keeps you engaged at every turn.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects is the freedom of choice. You're not tied to a linear narrative; instead, you forge your own path. Want to be a wandering trader? Or perhaps a fearsome warrior? The game accommodates every playstyle seamlessly. The intricacies of the economy, survival mechanics, and base building offer a level of depth that's both rewarding and challenging.\n\nThe characters you encounter are richly detailed, each with their own motivations and stories. Whether it's forming alliances, recruiting companions, or facing off against foes, every interaction feels authentic and meaningful.\n\nGraphically, Kenshi's distinct art style paints a post-apocalyptic world that's both bleak and beautiful. The attention to detail in every nook and cranny speaks volumes about the dedication of the developers.\n\nWhile Kenshi's learning curve can be steep, the journey is undeniably worth it. The sense of accomplishment as you overcome hurdles and grow stronger is unmatched.\n\nIn conclusion, Kenshi is a masterpiece that offers an unparalleled sandbox experience. It's a world where you're not just playing a game, but creating your own saga.

I am not really a fan of RTS games.\". However, after talking about the game for so long with a close friend of mine, I decided \"Heck it, I'll give it a try.\". Little did I know how quickly this game will challenge me. Being dropped into the middle of nowhere. Choosing what is considered the worst race to start with (Not knowing that at the time). Feeling completely helpless and lost in the already intimidating and desolate landscape right smack dab in the middle between the United Cities and Holy Nation warring area. Needless to say, yikes!\n\nIn my honest opinion, it took me quite a bit of time to get adjusted to how this game played. It is unforgiving, relentless and punishing for anyone new to the game. Having to be very careful with your fragile character(s). Stealthing around, gauging your attacks and knowing when to flee (or play dead, if unfortunate to run away and you miraculously survive). This game single-handedly gave me an amazing experience that I am pleasantly surprised to have. It has a lot of depth, working mechanical parts. Everything feels like it has meaning. The landscape, the combat, the interactions \u2014 pretty much *everything*. This game has a lot of downtime and you will park your rear just healing a lot of time until you become more familiar with the land, more geared up, more experienced and tougher. Oddly enough, it's not discouraging. If anything, it encouraged me more to press forward in this \"survival of the fittest\" landscape that also has some of the most dangerous endemic life or even simply the people who run any town(s). \n\nI really can not express the level of detail this game has. It has really become one of my favorite games. It is very odd considering it is an RTS but hey, when a game is good, a game is good.

I decide to mine and sell as much as I can so I can afford food.\n> Manage to make enough money to buy a good load of food rations. I  go to the tavern outside of town to trade the fruits of my labour when it is suddenly ransacked by a group of bandits. They mercilessly slaughter the shopkeep and his guards. I managed to make it out in time but they gash up my leg. It's a good thing I bought a first-aid kit.\n> Continue to mine every day to earn as much money as I can. After I've bought up a good portion of food, I set out for Squin, a Shek settlement a few miles away. As I approach the gate, I come across the rotting corpse of a starved bandit, his hand reaching towards the gate in desparation. Poor devil. Feeling a bit guilty, but in need of good clothes to protect me from the elements, I take his shirt and pants. He won't be needing them anyway.\n> On my way towards Squin, I am harrassed by more bandits who knick me in the head with a bolt, but I manage to outrun them and make it into town.

She was once a proud warrior, but her horns were cut off as punishment for faultering in battle. She was now nothing more than a servant. We quickly became friends and she agreed to stick by my side.\n> After a little more copper mining, I'm able to save up enough money to buy me some new clothes, a sturdy pair of boots, and a decent sword.  I also hire another Shek companion, a female by the name of Meow. As part of her induction, I clip her horns and name our squad \"The Short Horn Hoodlums\".\n> I decide to take a break from mining and explore the surrounding areas with my posse. After some travelling, we come across the reeking Swamps south of Squin. We venture into the swamps to see if there is anything of value.\n> During our expedition, we are ambushed by a gang of swamp bandits.

"language": "english", "review": "This game is some kind of bizarre mad max flavored crack. That's the only explanation I have for it. \n\nThere's a lot working against this game. I bought it well over a decade ago, wrote it off, only to find out the madman making it had worked on it for the entire time it took me to graduate college, work in my industry, realize I hate it, and go back to school, and finally they released it in 2018. It's full of jank, built on ancient technology and after all that development time pieces still feel like they are obviously missing. It refuses to explain itself beyond the bare essentials and does not respect your time. It's incredibly easy to make a decision that will take you hours to implement and then hours more to realize has doomed you. It's simultaneously punishingly difficult and incredibly exploitable if you are so disposed. It's unapologetically dark and full of cannibals, slavery, drugs, and murder. It's a workshop heavy game, with all the stress that comes with that. It is NOT for everyone. \n\nBut dagnabbit if you are the type of person to persist past all of that does this game suck you in. It has the open world and oblique world building of an elder scrolls game combined with a degree of freedom and self-determination that I can't think of seeing anywhere else. It feels like a fully realized world that is having a conversation with you. It tells you you are weak by throwing hordes of starving bandits at you who pummel you into the ground but the very act of standing up again makes your people stronger. It tells you that you are inconsequential, sends taxmen to shake you down, runs you out of town, until one day you come back trained and armed and kill the leader of a faction and throw the entire world into chaos. It smites you with acid rain and orbital lasers and raids by bloodthirsty slavers even as you slowly build up a city of your own construction into one that rivals any of the established communities on the continent. It has crab tournaments!\n\nI have simultaneously loved and hated this game at times, but I haven't been able to get it out of my head, and probably won't until I have asserted my dominance over this weird, slow, complicated game world. I sit at work thinking about my little team and what on earth I should do with them. Are they strong enough to make a pilgrimage north to defend some depressed fisherman from their resigned fate slowly being whittled down by the privations of cannibals? Should I send them into the fog to cut their teeth fighting endless masses of crazed queen-less insectoid cults? If I set up a base are they strong enough to defend it? Where would I even want to settle? What is my 10 step plan to getting strong enough to overthrow Holy Lord Phoenix and his racist misogynist army of zealot slavers? AND HOW DO I BEAT THE CRABS?\n\nI appreciate that this game exists and I think it stands alone and unique, such as it is. It is a flawed masterpiece. Look before you buy to make sure it's the kind of thing you'll be into. \n\nFinally, long live Beep.", "timestamp_created": 1691812879, "timestamp_updated": 1691813217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

You're actually thinking about diving headfirst into the festering cesspool that goes by the name of Kenshi? Well, grab your shit snorkel, because you're about to drown in a tsunami of unadulterated frustration and misery.\n\nImagine this: you fork over your hard-earned cash for what's touted as an \"open-world RPG masterpiece.\" But what you end up with is a colossal dumpster fire of broken mechanics, half-baked ideas, and enough bugs to rival a termite infestation. Congrats, you've just been royally fucked over by Kenshi.\n\nOh, and let's chat about combat, shall we? Get ready to witness your so-called skilled warriors flailing around like stupid morons in the middle of battles. Bandits? They'll make mincemeat out of you. Wild animals? They'll maul you into submission before you can even say \"Why the fuck am I playing this?\"\n\nBut oh, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: the AI. Your party members will showcase a level of idiocy that defies the laws of nature. They'll charge headfirst into danger, get stuck in the most fucking ridiculous places, and come up with innovative ways to off themselves, all while you're left swearing up a storm and contemplating launching your computer out the fucking window.\n\nAnd don't think for a fucking second that the world of Kenshi is any better. It's like traversing through a shit wasteland of monotony, where the highlight of your day is probably counting the grains of sand that make up the shitty desert.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Brace yourself for crashes and bugs that could only be the result of a %@&@ developer's twisted sense of humor. You'll be lucky if you can go  minutes without the game crashing and shattering whatever thread of sanity you had left.\n\nSo, go ahead, be my fucking guest. Dive headlong into the abyss that is Kenshi. Bask in the glory of its broken dreams, its shattered promises, and its relentless assault on your patience.

It can have a slightly steep learning curve if you just try to figure it out for yourself. However, I was always drawn back to it's bleak, lonely, dystopian atmosphere, and now I have to say this is one of my all time favorite games to play. Mods keep it continually interesting, and if you enjoy a challenge, this game is for you. It can feel very, very, very difficult at first while later on you may find yourself to be a complete bad-ass, but there always seems to be someone, or something out there, whether it be new NPCs or factions or simply bad situations you can get yourself into to keep the thrill of being alive... well alive! After multiple play throughs, I have to say the journey from weakling to formidable influencer is extremely rewarding. Best part is, even after you have been established you can continue to recruit weaklings and start the cycle over again of leveling up characters if that's what you enjoy doing.\n\nIn my opinion this game is fairly unique in it's styling. I've seen people describe it as simply a base building game. It does have that aspect, but that is only one. You can choose to play it however you want. Whether it be more a role play style or base / army and faction building. You can choose to be good, or bad, or both (I mean in reality isn't good and bad really full of mostly grey areas). It's basically a shite world, and you start with basically nothing, and try to make a go of it. You can even choose to start with a big fat smelly shite sandwich if you want to make it extra fun. If you don't know what to do when you start, you'll likely get a beating and stain the sand with your blood as you slowly lose your last breath with a mouth full of dirt.

tutorial pero en muy poco tiempo esta se torna agobiante y es muy f\u00e1cil pasar de esta, puede que esto sea un problema a la hora de conservar el inter\u00e9s del jugador, pero eso no significa que el juego sea \"dif\u00edcil\" de jugar, pues a pesar de todo la  jugabilidad es intuitiva y desde un primer momento logra atraparte, la posibilidad de elegir tu inicio en este mundo y no exactamente tus estad\u00edsticas o tus roles lo considero un total acierto, es increible el como con tan solo unos minutos jugando mis personajes ya estaban teniendo mini-historias cada uno a pesar de estar en el mismo lugar y grupo, dando la sensaci\u00f3n de que mi partida tiene vida propia y que cada personaje tiene car\u00e1cter de personalidad distinto, da pie a la construcci\u00f3n de narrativa como nunca antes hab\u00eda experimentado, me vi a mi mismo dando roles como el chico malo del grupo o el pacifico a diferentes personajes tan solo por los eventos que hab\u00edan llegado a suceder alrededor de ellos.\n\nFue solo a unas horas de juego que encontr\u00e9 uno de los mayores fallos y es que a veces el juego peca de una optimizaci\u00f3n lenta y que aunque teniendo en cuenta que es un sandbox totalmente abierto y con mil mec\u00e1nicas sucediendo al tiempo hab\u00eda momentos donde sent\u00eda que viajar entre zonas era agotador por la cantidad de tiempo que tomaba el cargar el

ambas cosas van de la mano para avanzar en el agresivo entorno que no te dejara las cosas f\u00e1ciles, lo cual me lleva a darle importancia a algo que ha sido el gancho final para atraparme por tantas horas y es su historia, su mundo org\u00e1nico y sus maravillosos eventos que cambian seg\u00fan la zona del mapa, me apasiona explorar tanto como me gusta recibir visitas en mi ciudad y

aftermath of an apocalyptic event that shattered the world, Atritiusoinus was born into a life of hardship and despair. The land was a wasteland, where the remnants of civilization clung to survival amidst the ruins of what once was. Born to parents who had known nothing but suffering and struggle, Atritiusoinus was destined to carve his own path in this unforgiving world.\n\nAtritiusoinus had been a slave in his early years, shackled by the chains of oppression, forced to toil under the rule of a brutal warlord known as The Phoenix. But as time passed, a spark of defiance ignited within him. Atritiusoinus saw others around him, those who had managed to break free from their chains, eking out a dangerous existence as thieves and outlaws. He yearned for his own taste of freedom, no matter the cost.\n\nOne fateful night, Atritiusoinus managed to escape from The Phoenix's grasp, slipping through the shadows like a phantom. He knew the wasteland like the back of his hand, having observed it while toiling away in the warlord's encampment. His newfound freedom fueled a desire for revenge against the tyrant who had held him captive for so long.\n\nWith a small band of like-minded individuals, Atritiusoinus set out on a path of crime and rebellion. They became skilled scavengers, plundering the remnants of the old world for valuable artifacts and supplies. They learned to navigate the treacherous landscape, avoiding mutant creatures and rival factions that sought to claim their spoils. Atritiusoinus quickly became a charismatic leader, inspiring loyalty and courage in his comrades.\n\nAs their reputation grew, Atritiusoinus and his crew began to challenge The Phoenix's rule directly. They launched daring raids on his outposts, disrupting his operations and striking fear into his heart. Atritiusoinus used his knowledge of the terrain to outwit The Phoenix's enforcers, leading them into traps and ambushes.\n\nBut the life of crime was not without its sacrifices. Atritiusoinus faced moral dilemmas and internal conflicts. He saw the impact of his actions on the innocent survivors caught in the crossfire between his band and The Phoenix's forces. The wasteland had turned him into a hardened outlaw, but he still held a glimmer of compassion within him.\n\nAmidst the chaos and danger, Atritiusoinus forged unlikely alliances. He encountered a skilled gunner named Truth, who had her own vendetta against The Phoenix. The two formed a bond born of shared goals and mutual respect. Together, they hatched a plan to bring down the warlord once and for all.\n\nTheir plan was audacious and dangerous, requiring every ounce of their cunning and bravery. Atritiusoinus and Truth orchestrated a massive uprising, rallying the oppressed survivors across the wasteland to stand against The Phoenix's tyranny. The final battle was a fierce and brutal struggle, with lives lost on both sides.\n\nIn the end, Atritiusoinus faced The Phoenix in a one-on-one confrontation that would determine the fate of the wasteland. It was a grueling battle of wills and strength, with Atritiusoinus tapping into reserves of determination he never knew he had. In a climactic moment, he emerged victorious, ending The Phoenix's reign of terror and bringing a semblance of justice to the shattered world.\n\nWith The Phoenix defeated, Atritiusoinus faced a new challenge: rebuilding and restoring hope to the wasteland. He and Truth, now his partner, worked tirelessly to establish a semblance of order, forming alliances with other factions and providing aid to those in need. Atritiusoinus had come a long way from his days as a slave, transforming from a symbol of defiance to a beacon of hope in a world desperately seeking redemption.\n\nAnd so, in the midst of a desolate wasteland, Atritiusoinus's life of crime and rebellion evolved into a noble quest to bring light to the darkness, proving that even in the bleakest of times, the human spirit could rise above and forge a new future.\n\nAnd then he got killed by bonedogs \n0/10", "timestamp_created": 1691640271, "timestamp_updated": 1691640271, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486111104488372803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143757527": {"recommendationid": "143757527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198963329767", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1513, "last_played": 1696477537}, "language": "english", "review": "made me have a stroke", "timestamp_created": 1691640139, "timestamp_updated": 1699216939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486111104488372803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143751155": {"recommendationid": "143751155", "author": {"steamid": "76561199186274912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2773, "playtime_at_review": 6052, "last_played": 1700764651}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1691629365, "timestamp_updated": 1691629365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143746869": {"recommendationid": "143746869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397007894", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3995, "last_played": 1692073380}, "language": "spanish", "review": "weno", "timestamp_created": 1691622443, "timestamp_updated": 1691622443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143746097": {"recommendationid": "143746097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044636453", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 48680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31446, "last_played": 1695278195}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game and its freedom of choice and arsenal of mods. 10/10!!! cant wait for Kenshi 2 but I just got Genesis mod so I have something to hold me over!", "timestamp_created": 1691621272, "timestamp_updated": 1691621272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143745117": {"recommendationid": "143745117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026412066", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 17513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16176, "last_played": 1692477453}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of my favorites.

I'm sure there are some things to do once you get going, but the journey there is super boring. All you do is click on a town on the map, and sit for 10 minutes in 3x speed while your character runs to it. Good luck if you actually try to loot anything because you'll be moving half speed. Once you actually make it to a town, every type of trader sells the same 10 items. There is no real crafting system from what I could tell, the only crafting is base building which is essentially impossible. This means that you can't improvise any sort of medical items or tools.
