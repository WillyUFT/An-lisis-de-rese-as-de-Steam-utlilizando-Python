life, then \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" is your Holy Grail. Here's why:\n\nRealism at Its Finest: This isn't your typical RPG where you start off as a chosen hero. You're Henry, a blacksmith's son, and trust me, the game makes sure you feel every bit the commoner you are. The attention to historical accuracy and detail is mind-blowing. From the architecture to the costumes, every aspect feels like a time machine to 15th-century Bohemia.\n\nLearning Curve Steeper Than a Castle Wall: This game doesn\u2019t hold your hand. Combat is tough, survival is tougher. You'll have to learn to read, fight, and even haggle like a true medieval peasant. It's frustrating at first, but incredibly rewarding once you get the hang of it.\n\nGraphics That'll Make You Weep Medieval Tears: The landscapes are gorgeous. Sunsets in this game make you want to grab a lute and compose a ballad. Character models, lighting, and the overall environment are stunningly realistic.\n\nBugs? More Like Authentic Medieval Pests: Yes, there are bugs. Some hilarious, some annoying, but it is not that much that would ruin your gameplay.\n\nDeep and Engaging Story-line: The narrative is compelling. You're not just on a quest; you're living a life in a turbulent and fascinating period.

But if you approach it with an open mind and some determination, you are bound to fall in love with this game. Henry, the character you play as, is a blacksmith's boy. He doesn't really have any skills when you start out. It's up to you to decide what he should focus on to improve. You have to keep working at it to ensure that Henry learns and improves, and I frankly LOVE that aspect of this game. I love the power fantasies of Skyrim and other games, but being a little peasant boy who works up the ranks and becomes a hardened knight is so ungodly satisfying.\n\nIf you are a medieval history buff like me, you'll find that Kingdom Come Deliverance scratches that itch for an enjoyable singleplayer medieval experience. And hell, you'll learn stuff about real world history, too! KCD is rooted in the very real events of 1400's Bohemia and the work Warhorse has done to bring it to life really shows.\n\nThis game does have its issues. It can be buggy. It's not the best optimized game out there. Some mechanics can be frustrating. But these are all issues that can be dealt with, and in my experience, rarely ever take away from the game. I'd say it's similar to Oblivion in its charming janky-ness. The DLCs can be a bit underwhelming, but I am begging you, PLEASE play A Woman's Lot. That shit hurted. That DLC is heartwrenching and just so well done. \n\nOver all, I'd say give this game a shot. Don't let the high barrier of entry at the beginning discourage you. Take a moment to watch a few videos about this game if you're on the fence. But I assure you, if you give this game a chance, it will be well worth it. I've played this game a total of three times between PC and Xbox, and it has to be one of my favorite gaming experiences in recent memory.\n\nOh, and lastly, the soundtrack slaps.

This reflects on the gameplay, especially in combat. And it makes it really hard and time consuming. Just to be able to, not die instantly you have to train for multiple in game weeks, with a trainer, to learn to fight with both swords. You need to raise both your and your character's skill level this way. But unlike in other games, the level of realism makes it fun and challangeing. You have access to a wide range of weapons, each with their stregnhts and weaknesses. My biggest beef here though, that we can't use halbeards and spears, even though they would be perfect weapons for this game. And the vision limit.\nSince GOT, we know, that you should wear a helmet, right? The problem is, in rela life it limits your vision. And in this game. I mean, i understand they added it for realism, but it takes away a big part of the enjoyment of the game, actually seeing the combat.\nAnd no, stealth archer is not as viable here as in other games. Archery is hard as f#&@ and you have no crosshairs. And stealth, well, it is as realistic as possible here too.\nBut, i mean, medieval life is suffering, so the game should be like that too.\n[b]Jesus Christ be praised![/b]\n[b]10/8[/b]\n\n[b]-- GRAPHICS --[/b]\nFor a 2018 game, it looks really great.

It's not just a game; it's a portal to another universe, one that meticulously reconstructs the medieval era with an immersive authenticity.\n\nThe combat system is a standout feature. With some basic understanding of historical swordsmanship, I was thrilled to see how the game attempts to replicate these techniques. It's not just about swinging a sword; it's about the art and skill of medieval combat, making every encounter both challenging and rewarding.\n\nThe narrative is another aspect where Kingdom Come truly shines. The storyline is gripping, weaving the personal journey of our hero with the intricate politics of nobility in a way that is both engaging and enlightening. It captures the essence of the medieval period, not just in grand battles but in the nuanced struggles of daily life.\n\nOne element I appreciated particularly is the game's portrayal of the difficulties of medieval life, integrated into its survival mechanics.

After numerous playthroughs, the soundtrack remains a poignant companion, underscoring the historical authenticity of the game. Whether galloping through vast landscapes or engaging in intense battles, the music consistently adds a layer of emotional depth, breathing life into every moment.\n\nThe game's ability to transport players to 15th-century Bohemia extends beyond the auditory experience. With each playthrough, I continue to be enthralled by the attention to detail in the environment. Every stone in the cobblestone streets, every building, and every piece of attire contributes to a world that feels not just historically accurate but lived-in and authentic. The dedication to realism not only educates players about the past but also allows them to actively participate in a meticulously recreated medieval realm.\n\nHaving traversed the landscapes multiple times, the realism in Kingdom Come: Deliverance remains unparalleled. The combat system, challenging and nuanced, demands a mastery of swordplay, archery, and strategic thinking. With each encounter, the consequences of my decisions echo through the game world, shaping the destiny of my character in profound ways. It's a level of immersion that keeps me returning, eager to experience the consequences of different choices and strategies.\n\nIn summary, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is not just a game but a timeless classic that has stood the test of time since its release. Having played through it numerous times, the enchanting music and the unparalleled sense of realism in its environment continue to make each playthrough a fresh and captivating experience.

You're playing out the defined character's typical rags to richest story instead of your own. There's some flavor choices you can make along the way, but mostly it just changes a few lines of dialogue, and the story plays out the same way no matter what you do.\n\nThe combat is also straight up a**. Like alot of people have said, the main problem is target lock on + the parry system. \n\nLock on makes fighting multiple enemies a chore, since the whole game is mandatory first person, which means your field of view is really narrow. Your character automatically tunnels onto one enemy, meanwhile two others are wailing on you from behind and the camera is shaky and janky and hard to figure out what's going on or who's where, as you constantly get stuck in forced animations. \n\nThe parry system is timed blocks, which sometimes result in RNG \"master strikes.\" The problem is everyone can do them, and the enemy master strike RNG is 100%. Low level enemies can master strike. High level enemies can master strike. Bathhouse wenches can master strike. So...you'll be a plate armor wearing knight, armed to the teeth with a heavy warhammer and shield, highly skilled in a variety of weapons, max warfare and strength stats, riding proud on your warhorse, that's also armored to the teeth and looking fabulous in noble finery... then get taken down by two Jedi peasants dressed in rags wielding sticks. \n\nYou can win those fights, but the cheese for combat is literally kiting in a backwards circle, the whole time spamming block and waiting for master strike RNG. As long as you never actually attack you can win pretty much every fight no matter the odds, which as soon as you figure that out makes combat really tedious and dumb. It would take alot of attacks to defeat a armored knight...or just one face stab master strike. That's all there is to it.\n\nSo why recommend it? Mainly because the world is interesting enough that I put 70 hours into it, which is worth the cost. I didn't finish the main quest but who cares, it's pretty boring and turns into fast travel across the whole map fetch quests by the end anyways. The scenery is also great to just roam around the countryside exploring, and by far the side quests and DLCs were way more interesting than the main quest and are the only content with actual consequences.\n\nThere's just not many games out there nowadays that take creative risks.

Literally just going hunting can be cool, or making potions, interacting with NPCs. The story isnt that awful, the main issue is that the game has a humongous flaw in one of its main systems - Combat.\n\nThe main issue with combat in KC:D is the introduction of the \"Master Strike\" system, aka parrying. The issue, mainly, is that every single enemy in the game can do it. Peasants, bandits, farmers, man-at-arms, everyone. For being a \"master\" skill, its very ubiquitous. Why is parrying an issue, and enemies being able to do it an issue, you might ask? Because they can, and will, master strike/parry every single attack you throw. Doesn't matter what direction, whats happening, they hit the input and now you're put into an animation where you loser all player agency and are forced to receive damage because the game said you had to.\n\nThe secondary issue of this, it completely removes any amount of \"skill\" from the combat, or tactics, because an enemy can literally be facing away from you, but if you attack them and theyre aware, theyll master strike, stab you in the gut and send you falling forward. So how do we handle this? The main way is to ONLY master strike your opponent. So you sit there, staring at one another, waiting. Occasionally your enemy will \"clinch\" you, think boxers hugging. 9 times out of 10 they win and push you around and open you up to an attack and since you're in an animation of falling around, you cant parry. Glorious.\n\nIf youre determined to participate in the rock paper scissors match of combat this game has, I recommend wearing no armor and just using a shield and warhammer. Hit them in the head, warhammers have a chance to automatically knock someone out if you hit them in the head, and theres a perk that increases this chance.\n\nGood luck, have fun, but i really cant recommend a game that constantly breaks up its somewhat interesting story with some of the most frustrating combat ive ever experienced.", "timestamp_created": 1700282761, "timestamp_updated": 1700282761, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489811599254608154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150327984": {"recommendationid": "150327984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200127482", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5004, "last_played": 1583029526}, "language": "english", "review": "Bit of a learning curve with the fight mechanics, but gets easier.", "timestamp_created": 1700275336, "timestamp_updated": 1700275336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150322662": {"recommendationid": "150322662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282594549", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2159, "playtime_at_review": 1471, "last_played": 1700789697}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego, muy completo solo falta mejorar los bugs que molestan mucho a veces y no dejan disfrutar plenamente.", "timestamp_created": 1700267432, "timestamp_updated": 1700267432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150303397": {"recommendationid": "150303397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058303577", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 741, "playtime_at_review": 2031, "last_played": 1700497363}, "language": "english", "review": "Henry", "timestamp_created": 1700255139, "timestamp_updated": 1700255139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150296292": {"recommendationid": "150296292", "author": {"steamid": "76561199466865432", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1700249617}, "language": "spanish", "review": "una reverenda poronga, termina la primera cinematica, hago 2 pasos y se cierra, joder esto es cine, menos mal q estaba gratis", "timestamp_created": 1700247021, "timestamp_updated": 1700247021, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150295333": {"recommendationid": "150295333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427487810", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7359, "last_played": 1699514310}, "language": "english", "review": ">I see game that makes out the Hungarians as being evil\n>I buy\nIt's just that simple.", "timestamp_created": 1700245948, "timestamp_updated": 1700245948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150290061": {"recommendationid": "150290061", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988780210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 31931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2251, "playtime_at_review": 31931, "last_played": 1700240983}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La verdad que es un juego que me ha dado pena acabarlo porque lo he disfrutado much\u00edsimo.

I really enjoyed exploring the world and going on random sidequests and trying to find the best outcome etc. The story is really fun, and the DLC ones too, I highly recommend them. Graphics are beautiful. Inventory UI isn't the best i've seen, feels really old, but it still works. The atmosphere is nice and feels alive.\nThis makes me recommend the game.\n\nHOWEVER\nThe combat system is complete jank. Like i've never been more frustrated in a combat system in my life. I genuinely have more fun going around doing fetch quests than fighting someone. A lot of it is due to the bad stats system, which in fairness does make some sense, but like even when you're near max level with some of the best gear, some random bandit will still block like all your attacks. Half the time, your attacks just miss (especially on uneven terrain) while theirs connect. The other half of the time where you are lucky to connect, you barely do damage, like why. The combos are stupidly hard to pull off because the enemy needs to stand still for all the attacks. A single dodge and F you lmao start again (also lining up that middle one, fuck that). You can actually spend like a full minute or two trading perfect parry and riposte over and over. And that doesn't even touch fighting when outnumbered, my god. The targeting system is awful. When facing multiple opponents, it just keeps changing, making focusing a single target really hard. You can also only really properly defend against the guy you're locked onto, even with a shield. \nTbh it may just be a skill issue, but when i swing like 8 times at a guy for him to block/dodge them only for him to hit me with an unblockable counter/animation that only they can do, then hit me through my shield, it gets frustrating fast.\n", "timestamp_created": 1700226935, "timestamp_updated": 1700226935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150272649": {"recommendationid": "150272649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450320812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5641, "playtime_at_review": 6266, "last_played": 1700219228}, "language": "english", "review": "After suffering through 103 hours of this train wreck, the game decided that Bernard and everyone at the main quest location wanted to kill me.

Mechanics are for the truly self loathing and masochistic, complete garbage gameplay every step of the way. The eating sounds in my headphones alone should warrant me a refund, but I did enjoy my time as Henry, from a character standpoint. Difficulty in this game is not based on how skilled you are, how well timed your parry and riposte is, or how high you raise any of your weapon skills.

Any fight you find yourself in without your weapon already drawn and fully ready for combat is a near guaranteed loss.\n\nDo not put yourself through this like I did.

Unfortunately, the story doesn't conclude in this installment, leaving me eager for KC2. Despite this, what the game offers is thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nThere are some downsides, like demanding hardware optimization, occasional bugs, (some) clunky combat moments, some side quests that drag out, and occasional stiff animations.

I wish I had purchased it earlier though because it stands as the best rpg I have ever played. So I'll start with some pros/cons and if you don't understand what makes the game special you can scroll below.\nPros:\n-Very Unique Systems (not just combat, but potion brewing, gambling, hunting, repairing, ext)\n-Very Realistic in Both How it Plays and its World\n-Unique Setting\n-Good story (believable enough to be real, but epic enough to be interesting)\n-Interesting Characters\n-Constant Sense of Growth\n~100 Hours of Gameplay\n-Immersive\n-Skill System Similar to Elder Scrolls\n- Great Saving System\n-Choices affect the world\n\nCons\n-Extremely Difficult Early On\n-Combat System Clunky with Multiple Opponents\n-Ends on Cliffhanger\n-Mediocre DLC\n\nSo to give a brief synopsis you play Henry a black smith's son in the Holy Roman Empire the country is on the verge of civil war and as a consequence your village is burned and you must go on a quest to avenge your family and reclaim your father's sword. The game is a very realistic depiction of medieval times and is very realistic in how it plays. The sword play is very in depth and requires a good deal of skill, but makes every fight interesting. What sets KCD apart from its competition is the uniqueness of every single system.  For instance brewing potions is not a matter of getting ingrediants and pressing a brew button. No, instead you have to actually get a recipe and go through the process of making the potion in the correct order and time to produce your product. The gambling mini game isn't raw luck, but also skill and the ability to use weighted dice, which was super enjoyable. Overall every part of the game felt both realistic, immersive, and enjoyable. I will warn because the game is so realistic it comes off as kind of life simmy (you need to get food, keep yourself clean, ext.) so if you don't like those mechanics it may not be for you. Also it is extremely difficult early on you are poor with no skills and almost no save potions (you can still save at beds and the beginning of missions). This is exacerbated by the fact the game has you do more difficult tasks as a tutorial like hunting rabbits to learn to use a bow (which are the hardest animal to hunt including people) and fight cumans who are a decent bit better than your basic bandit. However, if you can get through that initial hurdle the games difficulty drops to a manageable level where everything still has challenge, but not spine shatteringly so. I will also throw out there the DLC are okay-ish. None were bad, but they are very compartmentalized and didn't add a lot. Also their rewards vary from useless garbage to the best items in the game which render all other equipment pointless and there's no real in between. In the end if you love historical dramas and are tired of bland flavorless rpgs where you walk up to enemies and press the one key to hit them slightly harder then KCD is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1699903519, "timestamp_updated": 1699903519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597035229206085205", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150064999": {"recommendationid": "150064999", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027092465", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 234, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1700650516}, "language": "english", "review": "slightly janky combat but very beautifully crafted with good narrative and lively world, definitely recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1699887465, "timestamp_updated": 1699887465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529569864273071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150057927": {"recommendationid": "150057927", "author": {"steamid": "76561199508851602", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 663, "playtime_at_review": 3176, "last_played": 1700176211}, "language": "english", "review": "Bug-frequent games", "timestamp_created": 1699877021, "timestamp_updated": 1699997243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432197421789169312", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150048021": {"recommendationid": "150048021", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991157647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1694511214}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: Highly immersive and realistic medieval world.\nCons: The combat system is jarring to me.\n\nI plan to revisit the game I didn't stop at 4 hours cuz of the combat system, life just getting in the way.

Line\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKingdom Come is a game that would be in my personal top 5 games, and it's hard to imagine that it's a game released in 2018, which was a year full of all sorts of great games,  God Tier like Red Dead Redemption 2, God of War 4, and good stuff such as Dark Souls 1 remake, Celeste, Detroit: Become Human, Assassin's Creed, and more, but what's even more amazing to me is that Kingdom Come was released in February 2018, nearly half a year earlier than Red Dead Redemption 2's October, and the gameplay experience of Kingdom Come and Red Dead Redemption 2 has such a similar feel to it, such as realistic setting of the gameplay experience, content presentation with a sense of life, and a wealth of interesting and detailed content, it\u2019s really surprised me that Kingdom Come appeared before Red Dead Redemption 2, while Kingdom Come has unfortunately become a foil to these great games in 2018.\n\nAlso Kingdom Come shares the same criticisms as Red Dead Redemption 2, with very long early stage, complex interaction content, repetitive content filled with a lot of daily routines based on the design for realism, and Kingdom Come\u2019s the unique and difficult to learn combat. For my opinion on these issues, I personally feel that the core experience of an RPG with a realistic setting inevitably requires the player to invest a significant amount of time (and this time standard varies from player to player, and preferably consecutively) in order to adequately allow the player to actively feel where their own growth and points of interest lie, as well as gain their own familiarity with the people and objects of the world, as well as develop enough emotion for the protagonist's encounters and experiences, and then of course there's also the most important premise of whether or not the game can do all that, and for me Kingdom Come did, and did it well.\n\nHere's a look at how Kingdom Come's realistic, fun and very difficult combat was able to change the experience from the edge of giving up to enjoyment for me.\n\n[i]2 hours of play time, I just met Henry, a hothead young feller, and we raised the longsword together, both strange and exciting, than we half-assed our way to combat tutorials, immediately in the village looking for guards to fight, MY DEAR GOD, not that I blame you, Henry, you are afraid of a congenital handicap, the sword can't even be swung sharply, and what is wrong with your stamina bar, instantly exhausted, and the guards left swing, right stab, game over.[/i]\n[i]20 hours of play time, encountered a group of bandits infighting on the way, I let Henry immediately took out the bow, 2 out of 8 with such shaky hands, NICE JOB Henry. Nearly half an hour of hard fighting, defeated all bandits, after a short rest, ride our horse and leave.[/i]\n[i]40 hours of play time, Rattay tourney, the final, I keep a close eye on my opponent's shifting UI icons, and after pressing the Q button several times in a row flawlessly under my opponent's harsh attack, Henry returned the favor with a perfect parry and then counterattacked in the right direction.[/i]\n[i]60 hours of play time, though I am the champion of the Rattay tournament, and Henry is armed with plate armor, how unfair it is to be swarmed with a bunch of peasants, so don't blame me for sneaky play.[/i]\n\nThe overall experience of Kingdom Come can be simply summarized as a budget version of Red Dead Redemption 2's first-person RPG, where budget version refers more just to the size of the game, the graphic performance and the narrative approach to the content, but Kingdom Come's depth of gameplay content and replayability is definitely more than Red Dead Redemption 2's linear, chapter-based gameplay experience, and can even be compared to The Elder Scrolls, while applying the map fog design to make Kingdom Come's exploration less Ubisoft-like.\n\nIn addition, what I admire most about Kingdom Come is the pursuit of realistic design concepts, which has the most realistic medieval castles and towns, rather than those overly flashy Disney-style castles or Castlevania-style castles in video game, directly and vividly expresses the turbulent European society and Bohemian folklife in Late Medieval Period in a vivid and colorful way, coupled with the excellent story presented in the main and side quests to show a piece of history (both good and bad) to the player to enjoy, as well as a variety of interesting activities (like dice games), which greatly enriched the player's experience.\n\nIn the end, the two songs in the game, [b]Till Our Heads Turn White[/b] and [b]Poverty and Famine[/b], are such a wonderful and lovely expression of medieval European masculinity that made my Kingdom Come\u2019s adventure with Henry even more unforgettable.", "timestamp_created": 1699627783, "timestamp_updated": 1699628566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517647087574005127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149860326": {"recommendationid": "149860326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191307354", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3614, "last_played": 1699032551}, "language": "english", "review": "This game provides such a beautiful experience and immersion.\nAll the mechanics in game are so well crafted.\nThis game was on par with Red dead redemption 2 on immersion factor.", "timestamp_created": 1699613432, "timestamp_updated": 1699613432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149857906": {"recommendationid": "149857906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013371940", "num_games_owned": 690, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 6161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 510, "playtime_at_review": 5795, "last_played": 1699908385}, "language": "english", "review": "Janky but fun.", "timestamp_created": 1699608735, "timestamp_updated": 1699608735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149855170": {"recommendationid": "149855170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142607640", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2953, "last_played": 1643524052}, "language": "english", "review": "This is THE most immersive game I have ever played.

It is not a typical fantasy RPG with magic, dragons, and elves, but rather a historical simulation with a rich story, immersive gameplay, and stunning graphics. The game is set in the year 1403, during a civil war between the half-brothers King Wenceslas IV and King Sigismund of Hungary. You play as Henry, a young blacksmith who survives a brutal attack on his village and joins the resistance against Sigismund\u2019s army. Along the way, you will meet many interesting characters, face moral dilemmas, and shape the course of history.\n\nThe game\u2019s main strength is its attention to detail and authenticity. The game world is huge and full of life, with realistic landscapes, architecture, clothing, weapons, and combat. The game also features a complex system of skills, perks, reputation, and dialogue choices that affect your interactions with the world and its inhabitants. The game does not hold your hand or guide you through a linear path, but rather lets you explore and discover things at your own pace. You can choose to follow the main story, or branch out into various side quests, activities, and mini-games. You can also customize your character\u2019s appearance, equipment, and playstyle, whether you want to be a noble knight, a cunning rogue, or a charismatic bard.\n\nThe game\u2019s main weakness is its technical issues and bugs. The game is very demanding on your hardware, and may suffer from performance problems, crashes, glitches, and save corruption. The game also has a steep learning curve, and may frustrate some players with its realistic and challenging mechanics, such as hunger, thirst, sleep, injuries, diseases, and limited saves. The game\u2019s combat system is also very complex and realistic, requiring you to master different weapons, stances, strikes, blocks, and counters. The game does not have a difficulty setting, and some enemies may be too hard or too easy for you depending on your level and equipment. The game also has a lot of historical and cultural references, and some players may find it hard to follow or understand the story and the characters without some prior knowledge or research.\n\nOverall, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a game that offers a unique and immersive experience for those who love history, realism, and role-playing. It is not a game for everyone, and it may require a lot of patience, dedication, and tolerance for its flaws.

Here's what I take away from the game.  Note I am not using any mods.\n\n1st  Hardcore mode:  I recommend this mode for a more real/immersive feel.  From the start you have to pick at least two \"negative perks\" for your play thru.  Depending on what you pick, will depend on when and how they'll activate.  Cool concept.  I went with Nightmares and Sleep walking.  So randomly when I sleep, I wake up scared sheetless and sometimes I have absolutely no clue where I am when this happens.  It sucks and it's fun at the same time.  Nothing is guaranteed in this game it seems.  No compass so I have to rely on landmarks, rivers, roads, stars, the sun to find my way around, compare to map.  It\u2019s not a big deal, after a while, you learn the roads.  I really enjoy this game with no compass even when in a vast forested area searching for something at night time.  I'm not being sarcastic, it's a blast cause you know immersion.  No fast travel is no big deal.  Things cost more, and sell for less, but money becomes a non issue after a while.\n2nd Combat:  It\u2019s a bish.  Again nothings guaranteed it seems.  I fought against 4 guys at the same time and won, and I\u2019ve gone against 3 guys and lost.  Some ppl will not like the combat.  It\u2019s a dance in this game and not a mash attack button and receive loot.  It\u2019s hard, but if you approach it with caution, take your time, use terrain to aid you, you\u2019ll have a better chance.  In normal mode they have this icon on the enemy, not in HC mode.  You just have to watch the enemies\u2019 attacks and react.  The target lock can suck with multiple enemies, there\u2019s a mod for it I understand.  I recommend using all the weapon types as well.  The bow really sucks till you\u2019re like around I want to say lvl 7 in it.  Combat is a game breaker for some.  Dogs are OP, fear the dogs.  You can't outrun them either so don't try.  Just let them gnaw on your arm, get beat down by 4 others, and cry, then reload.   Hopefully they're not still there when you come back.\n3rd Graphics:  I have to run it on the third to highest setting for a avg of 50fps.  My computer is like 2018 that I built.  It's starting to get dated I see from this game.  Ryzen 5 2600X, GTX 1660 Ti running Gforce thru monitor to get the 140hz refresh rate.  It's nice but yeah dated.  If I choose the second to highest graphics setting my FPS is 35-40.  Even still on the 3rd to highest graphics settings I picked, I get sometimes 5fps cutscene hiccups.  I bare thru it, voice is fine but graphics lag.  I'll just mention here that I did have a few game breaking bugs.  One where I was just crouching thru the forest on a slope and clipped thru the ground, broke both my ankles, like an invisible hole and no way to get out.  Other was Closing a door, and game crash.  Sometimes alt tabbing too much does this too.  Gotta be checking that wiki sometimes.  Game breaking bugs wouldn't be so bad, but playing hardcore mode I can only save by finding a bed that allows me to sleep and save, not just sleep, and/or potion.  Potions are freaking heavy and I don't save often via pot unless absolutely necessary cause I only carry 3 on me at a given time.  \n4th.  Gameplay.  Doesn't matter who you're fighting, what weapon they have (if any), it's always intense.  I had a bandit, unarmed, almost beat me down.   Dueled a guy in the woods for 5 min straight, both of us with short sword and shield, and it was epic.  I won that battle. Most epic moment was, go into woods, wolf charges at me, I pull back on bow, release arrow right as wolf is at my feet, I missed, then my dog attacks the wolf, I draw back on bow, give myself 6 feet of distance, the dogs are rolling on the ground, I released the arrow right as my dog got off the wolf, and I shot that poor bastard wolf right in the head, and it slumped over and died.  Amazing.  The game doesn\u2019t hold your hand, well not really.  You\u2019ll be given a task but it\u2019s up to you on how you pull it off.  That\u2019s not always the case.  Often there\u2019s a quest perimeter that you\u2019ll need to be in to find what you\u2019re looking for.  \n\n5th My complaints:  1. Mutt!!!  Howls too much, bumps into me too much, I\u2019ve beaten that dog a few times cause he aggravated me so much.  I\u2019ve learned to tell him to stay if I\u2019m doing anything important.  2. Stolen items.  I can steal whatever I want, and as soon as I do, I can move it to my horse\u2019s inventory and now I don\u2019t have to worry about getting caught.  It\u2019s broken imo.  Horse can be across the map too and you\u2019ll still have access to its inventory.  3. Lockpicking.  My only complaint is the difficulty gap between hard and very hard locks.  Currently, majority of very hard locks I can\u2019t even attempt to open.  What\u2019s the point of going back to these chests anyway?  By the time I do, I won\u2019t need to for money.  I\u2019ll just go jump some bandits and take everything they have.  4. Perks.  I hate perks.  At least in this game, in HC mode, I feel many are too OP.  The game is so much better not taking some of these perks.  There\u2019s a lot of perk points I have just sitting there that I won\u2019t apply, ever.  I like getting better using a weapon sure, unlocking combos is cool.  Some are just broken like, Master Strike for example.  5. Armor.  Yes!  Why use anything other than Dark stuff.  Also, it doesn\u2019t take long to get the best armor set, so everything else is just vendor candy.  6.  You get dirty way too quickly.  There\u2019s a mod for this though.  7. Fighting like more than two ppl is most certainly going to mean you\u2019re going to die.  That\u2019s okay cause feels that\u2019s what would happen in RL.  It\u2019s that darn target lock.  I think there\u2019s a mod for this too.  I\u2019m making the case for some mods.  8. This double sided.  The Rain at night time.  When this happens, I just crouch in the forest and cry cause I can\u2019t see a thing.  I have to wait for it to stop.  Slows me down, but ehh I just look at it as more realism.  9. When a perk activates at night time.  I don't ever usually use a torch unless I'm playing this game in the day time in RL.  10. Time. Hurry up you stupid tailor of Rattay and open the shop already OMG!!!\n\n6th My Praises:  1. Henry.  Dude is a trip.  I did a fetch quest, went to turn it in, and Henry was like.. I got all the F\u2019n stuff!!  I died laughing cause that\u2019s how I felt too.  2. The story.  That\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say about that.  3. The dialogues are great and some of these quests are not how I expected things to go.  4. The world map.  This is a really good map.  There\u2019s no zones.  It can be dangerous anywhere.  5. I\u2019m going to say combat cause it\u2019s so intense and not guaranteed I\u2019m going to win.  6.  Multiple ways to complete most quests.  How you do it is up to you.  7. How they did their best to make this based on real history.  I'm looking forward to see what other titles this developer comes out with.  8. The game is pretty and music is great too.   I give this game a 7/10,  Game crashing bugs, the feeling like I'm becoming a god over the world doesn't make sense for a realism game.  It has a lot going for it though which is why I'll be beating this game.

It's an ode to meticulous storytelling, forging a profound connection between the player and the game. The landscapes are like paintings come to life, with every meadow, forest, and village crafted by the developers' hands to create a world that breathes and beats.\n\nEmotionality flows from every aspect of the game, whether through the poignant fates of its characters or the dramatic twists of its main story. The player is not just an observer but a living part of the narrative, with choices that carry weight and consequences that can alter the course of history.\n\nThe graphics are a feast for the eyes, capturing medieval Bohemia with stunning attention to detail. The changing times of day and weather conditions do more than beautify\u2014they affect gameplay and interactions.\n\nHowever, the control scheme can be a challenge; it's complex and requires acclimatization. The combat system, though deep and rewarding strategic thinking, can initially be off-putting, especially for those expecting an easily accessible action RPG.\n\nThe dialogues in the game are carefully crafted, full of historical references and a language usage faithful to the 15th century. They're not just informative but also emotionally charged, contributing significantly to the atmosphere and immersion.\n\nYet, \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" is not without fault. Its ambitious nature leads to technical issues, from bugs to occasional performance dips. The save system, which relies on \"Saviour Schnapps,\" is an innovative but controversial design choice that can make the game unnecessarily punishing. These flaws can break immersion and test patience.\n\nOverall, \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" is an emotionally stirring, visually stunning, and narratively deep game that carves a unique niche in the world of role-playing games. It's not just a game, but a time machine that transports one to a bygone world, and despite its faults, remains a gem for those willing to engage with its demanding yet rewarding experience.\n", "timestamp_created": 1699283162, "timestamp_updated": 1699283162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149644873": {"recommendationid": "149644873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063766845", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4226, "last_played": 1696990986}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente rpg, un poco tosca la modalidad de combate, pero te acostumbras, muy buena historia, lleno de horas de diversi\u00f3n y drama... excelentes graficos, usa cryengine, esta dentro de todo bien optimizado... si te gusto skyrim... este tambien....", "timestamp_created": 1699272847, "timestamp_updated": 1699272847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149644589": {"recommendationid": "149644589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187050293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4136, "last_played": 1693855112}, "language": "english", "review": "Henry of Skalitz going on a murder rampage in the shit ridden streets of Rattay", "timestamp_created": 1699272404, "timestamp_updated": 1699272404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149643413": {"recommendationid": "149643413", "author": {"steamid": "76561199251503258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 758, "last_played": 1678437418}, "language": "english", "review": "My head hurts", "timestamp_created": 1699270470, "timestamp_updated": 1699270470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149633579": {"recommendationid": "149633579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345126091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13331, "last_played": 1699243830}, "language": "english", "review": "6/5\nA good fucking game", "timestamp_created": 1699250289, "timestamp_updated": 1699250289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149628973": {"recommendationid": "149628973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167155465", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 4027, "last_played": 1700368472}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game with an immersive feel as you start with a clunky dumbass and mold him into your own person, your choices reflect what you end up with.

You won't find dragons, or fantastical creatures here. Instead, you play as Henry, a blacksmith's son caught in a whirlwind of political intrigue, war, and personal growth. The game's melee combat system is perhaps its most notable feature. It eschews traditional hack-and-slash mechanics for a more methodical, skill-based approach that demands precision and timing. While it can be frustrating to learn, once mastered, it's deeply satisfying and rewarding.\n\nThe game also excels in its quest design and world-building. The story is well-written and engaging, with morally gray choices that impact the outcome. The open-world nature of the game allows you to approach quests in multiple ways, making each playthrough feel unique.  However, there are some minor bugs and inconsistencies, which can occasionally disrupt the immersion. Additionally, the save system, which relies on checkpoints and a limited-use save potion, can be frustrating for players.\n\nImmersion and Realism (10/10):\nThe level of realism in Kingdom Come: Deliverance is truly remarkable. The game pays meticulous attention to historical details, from clothing and architecture to the way people spoke and behaved in the 15th century. This commitment to authenticity contributes to a deep sense of immersion, making you feel like you've stepped into a time machine.\n\nThe day-night cycle, dynamic weather, and the need to eat, sleep, and maintain personal hygiene add to the realism. Combat injuries and weapon degradation are also a constant reminder of the harsh realities of the period.\n\nOverall (9/10):\nKingdom Come: Deliverance is a unique and captivating experience for those seeking a historically accurate, immersive RPG set in a beautifully realized medieval world. While it has its share of technical hiccups, its deep storytelling, challenging combat, and commitment to realism make it a must-play for fans of open-world RPGs and history buffs.

No, it's not literary gold, but it's a rollicking adventure that really put me in the place of someone going back in time to medieval France. When I read there was a video game based on it I was excited, but couldn't get my hands on a copy. \n\nTen years later I built a gaming PC and wanted the first game I played as an adult to be something awesome, and this game delivered beyond my expectations. I know it's nothing about time travel, so the connection with Timeline is really just that it gave me the same feeling of adventure and immersion. \n\nI know the combat turns people off, but for me it was one of the best parts. Combat is FRUSTRATING, and you suck at it, mug like a blacksmiths son would in real life without training. And even after being decently well trained multi-person combat is rough. You don't walk through enemies, you learn how to poison, sneak, and bide your time. \n\nI can't describe everything that made this game great for me, but I hope anyone who yearns for that adventure in a time and land apart from our own will give it a try. That being said, two hours (the cutoff for a noquestionsasked refund I think) isn't enough to decide. I was 12ish hours in before I knew I was hooked. The lock picking and haggling really really confused me, when a buddy told me those mechanics are common in games I figured I was just being an idiot and redoubled my efforts. \n\nAlso the time on here is wrong for reasons.

No it isn't. It is a game that has conceptually amazing systems that only seem to have been half-baked. Despite this, I still think it is worth picking up when it is on sale because there are many gems hidden in the pile of bugs, crashes, jank, and design problems.\n\nI have a big love/hate relationship with this game. Having followed its development since 2012, you can imagine my disappointment with the game's buggy launch. I had to refund the game because I couldn't get past the first few quests in Skalitz without either crashing or encountering a game breaking bug that would prevent me from progressing at all. I bought the game again about a year later and had almost the exact same experience I had before, so I refunded the game once again. About another year after that, I decided to give the game another shot because it was on sale for $15. I played it again and actually made it a little bit through the story, only to have my save get corrupted. It sat in my steam library for another year until one of my friends started to play it, so I decided to give it another shot.\n\nI'm glad that I kept trying to play this game after all these years because when it shines, its very bright. There are so many cool and unique concepts and moments in this game that are well worth your time investment if you can make it past all of the garbage. The story is generally pretty good and it weaves in actual history pretty well. Most of the quests and NPC interactions are fantastic, and I really enjoyed a lot of the characters. How could you not like discovering that the local pastor is actually a former soldier, only to get shit-faced drunk with him and raise hell in the town, just to get dragged into having to give his morning sermon for him because he was too hungover? Interactions like that are what make this game worth playing despite all of its faults.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are done fairly well, but I believe the game could have benefited much from having a much larger perk selection. Towards higher levels I found that after taking all of the perks I wanted for my play-style that the only perks I could choose from anymore were actually just worse than if I didn't take them at all. Certain skills like hunting feel absolutely pointless, while skills like speech are almost essential. Alchemy is very cool and I would like to see more games implement this system in the future, but it has a very big problem: you don't have to use it, at all. Why would I brew my own potions when every bandit I come across has 2-3 of the really good potions on them?\n\nCombat skills suffer from the combat system itself. At first glance you might think this game has in depth combat, but you would be mistaken. You start the game as a peasant that can hardly hold a sword, but you can quickly gain more strength/agility/warfare/defense/weapon skills and perks that add more depth to fighting. The progression feels really good to start because there is a noticeable difference after only a couple of hours of playing with how you can dominate fights that earlier would have killed you. Then you notice that the enemies are scaling with you. Those cool combos that you unlocked for your weapon of choice no longer work because the enemy just master strikes or perfect blocks you every other hit. Then you start waiting for enemies to attack you so that you can master strike and it just turns into a waiting game. Or you can just clinch an enemy to death in a corner. The combat starts out feeling really good, but then just devolves into every bandit you fight being a master combatant in plate armor. Some people in this game's community will try to say that different weapon types perform different jobs such as swords being very good against unarmored targets while maces are only good against armor. I would like to disagree very much, seeing as how I could 1-3 shot most enemies wearing plate armor with my longsword from halfway through the game till the end. If you want to breeze through the game's combat even more easy, just use a bow. Archery is so mind-boggingly easy and overpowered that if you are in any way accurate, you can 1 shot any enemy in the game from the very beginning. I think the combat in this game has a lot of potential, but it just doesn't fully deliver on any aspect and I can only assume was rushed in production.\n\nSneaking and thieving are very under powered, until they aren't. For some reason there is a weird wall right at the beginning of level up sneaking where you can't hide from anybody, and then you level up a couple of times and all of a sudden you are Batman. Some missions that require sneaking or stealing are made completely trivial by having a decently leveled sneaking and lockpicking skill because for some reason after a certain level, people can't see you at all anymore when you are crouched. Many times I was able to knock out/stealth kill/pickpocket NPCs right in front of others and they wouldn't react or would just walk away. Combine this with having near infinite wealth from lockpicking stores and you can break the game's economy very early and easily. That being said, you can break this game's economy just by walking on the road right outside of town and killing the 6 bandits wearing full Milanese plate, put their gear on your horse and then go back to town and selling it for more groschen than the lords make in a year.\n\nMy next point is mostly just a nitpick, but sometimes it really frustrated the hell out of me. Why can Henry take a bath and get his clothes laundered, just to walk 20 feet down the street and be absolutely covered in dirt? Take a bath, immediately get on your horse after you leave the time skip screen so you don't have to touch the ground and ride directly to the spot you need to go and dismount so you can interact or talk with someone. Did you touch the dirt on the side of the road when you got off the horse? Instantly covered in shit, piss, and blood. Everyone comments on how much you stink and look like you got the piss beat out of you. With that being said, the layered clothing/armor system in this game is a really good system I hope carries over into more games. Being able to wear a gambeson underneath mail which is in turn underneath plate is cool and I've always been a big fan of games that implement it.\n\nThis all leads me to the biggest problem I have with this game: constant crashing and game breaking bugs. They still exist, and they still suck. I finished my first and last playthrough with 102.2 hours recorded on steam. In game my save only has 72.8 hours on it. I'll admit that I save scummed a little bit in this game, so we'll be generous and say that I lost 8 hours of game time due to restarting when things went wrong. That still leaves a whopping 21.4 hours of game time that I lost completely due to the game crashing or bugging out before I could save again. This wouldn't be a problem in most other games because of things like auto-saving or just being able to save on the fly, but the only way you can do that in this game is by using an in-game item called Savior Schnapps, or by exiting the game completely which will save it. Alternatively, you can save the game by sleeping in certain beds.

I\u2019d been mentally tuning it out since first hearing about it because someone complained about the lack of American-style skin-colour diversity in 1400s Bohemia and the gamergate-loving lead designer, instead of responding with the appropriate \u201clol\u201d, went full toxic ape and as a result the alt-reich gaming crew took up this game as one of their champions in racial purity. I\u2019ve no idea if they continued to love and pedestal this game \u2013 I\u2019ve tuned it and, by extension, them  :)\n\nBut then I saw an interesting map, so looked up some youtube videos (Sawman UK, Neon Knight, Knight Arcade), and boy was I INTERESTED. Looking around, it turns out to be highly praised and constantly recommended. I would say it\u2019s a shame I didn\u2019t pay attention to this on release, but it seems like it was full of game breaking bugs and didn't even have the ability to save on exit on release, so I\u2019m kind of glad I\u2019ve only just encountered it and only had mildly annoying bugs. (Plus, my PC back then would have melted when playing it)\n\nSince September I've spent 181 hours completing this game, and aside from a bit of a sag and lull at the end, it was well worth it. I think the devs should definitely have cut some fat and concentrated on the main quest line, and I don't think it really needs the DLCs. \n\n181 hours is how long it took me to fully complete the game, including all the side quests, in a single non-hardcore run. I almost never used fast-travel, because it wastes times and galloping around the countryside is fun. I would occasionally reload to try different conversation options or ways of solving quests etc. I also hoarded way too many bits of enemies kit and amassed a fortune I didn't need. But not-doing that might only shave a few hours off. The rest of the time was spent mauling bandits and interrogating filthy peasants, as the  game intended.\n\nAfter 181 hours it's surprisingly hard to write a review of the game. Infact, due to the sheer amount of content, it's easy to have a massive list of bugs, jank, problems etc. The game is full of eastern european B-grade game dev jank, so it's impossible to avoid any when playing. You just have to skim over it to get to the amazing game underneath. It's very easy to ignore when the game is as entertaining as this. So I'll start with the positives:\n\n* Playing as a bumbling teenage son of a blacksmith who can barely hold a sword, can't read, can't hold his booze, and doesn't know what to usefully say to anyone is a great place to start the game. Then watching/controlling Henry as he starts to piece his life together and grow in skill and aptitude is very satisfying. It wears a tiny bit thin by the end, as it's a game after all and you end up godlike, but at the start it's a very interesting situation to be in.\n\n* The music is amazing and extremely moving, even when divorced of the context in the game. I rarely listen to game soundtracks outside of a game, but KCD's has made it into my rotation. \n\n* The save system is annoying at first (especially after a crash!) but after a while you begin to see its genius. Especially that the non-bed saves making you slightly drunk, as being drunk messes up a lot of the stealth capabilities (ignoring the late game skill), so saving RIGHT before doing something risky can actually make it worse. They're really trying to force you to \"live with your actions\" etc. Eventually though the RPG part catches up and saving becomes easy and often, breaking the tension.\n\n* The game has some beautiful vista and landscapes. I think the last time I enjoyed stopping and looking out to the distance was Far Cry 2. And once you know the lay of the land there's something magical about spotting the town in the distance and knowing that's where you're heading. Traversing the landscape isn't a chore in this game (except near the end, where you have to ping pong about the place) and so it's very easy to ignore the fast travel and just take it all in, navigating down the roads. \n\n* The exploration of the map works really well. It's not just that they have the fog-of-war on the paper map, but also that they stage early encounters to make it seem like exploration is as dangerous as it \"should be\".\n\n* If you let the main story line drag you along in its course then it's quite the thrill ride, and it's very engaging. The writing and plotting is done very well and it's on par with some TV series, despite most game narratives being absolute babified nonsense.\n\n* The voice acting for most of the major characters is great. The supporting cast is pretty good, if not clearly the same few actors. There are some real stinkers though. \n\nThen onto my most major and important gripe: They messed the start up.\n\nThere's an amazing open world RPG awaiting you here, but you'll be hard pressed to find it because the game tries its hardest to scare you off. I know that there's only so much time to go around, but pro-tip for Warhorse studios: POLISH THE FUCK OUT OF THE START OF THE GAME.\n\nThe first NPC you talk to -- it's literally forced on you by the game -- is Henry's mother. She's the worst voiced character in the game, and she's the most poorly animated. I had to pause the first conversation and go into the settings to figure out if my game is broken, because her face wasn't even moving when she was speaking. After numerous attempts I just watched a few Let's Plays and nope, everyone's game is like this. Now, after playing the entire game it turns out that almost all of lip syncing and cinematic animation is terrible at times. It goes way beyond uncanny valley into Team American levels of puppet flapping. Frankly, I learnt to read the subtitles and ignore the wobbly faces. But this is the VERY FIRST INTERACTION. Polish it! Hardcode it. Make it GOOD.\n\nAnd then, after a very, very long introduction / tutorial chapter (literally hours long), you're tasked with running away from trouble, first on foot, then on horse. This is an emergent, time-sensitive situation. It's desperate. The mechanics of the game make YOU feel as desperate s Henry is. So how does this jank fest deal with that situation? In the worst way possible: stupid pop-up boxes full of text that you have to read, whilst learning the controls and mechanics, and trying to avoid getting your head caved in. And then when it makes you get a horse in a desperate escape more text text text is there to tell you how a horse works, WHILST THE GAME IS RUNNING. You're far too busy trying to make this stupid horse gallop properly or figure out why it's tired to read this text properly, assuming you read it in time. And then it gets worse: As you're escaping there's all these spam pop up boxes about camps and conciliatory crosses and town names and other pure nonsense that has no place being in a life-or-death horse-chase. The game trains you to read these boxes because they're vital, and then immediately punishes you by spamming that area with irrelevant, distracting noise. They should have deactivated that system until the introduction finishes. It diminishes the thrill-ride that the story is trying to show you.\n\nThe solution is obvious: Just introduce whistling and horses before you need them. There's plenty in the village, task Henry with taking one for a joyride or something.\n\nI thought it might just be me, playing this years after release, with DLC installed etc so I hit up youtube and nope, once again not only is it everyone but it's like this on release. Agonisingly stupid. I can understand why a lot of people never get past the intro. Had I not watched those youtube videos I never would have carried on.\n\nSo honestly, stick with the game until you get the first intro chapter done. That's when the main game starts and it really opens up and you're left with a beautiful pearl of a game.\n\n\nI had a large list of minor gripes, but this Steam review can only be so-long!", "timestamp_created": 1698444782, "timestamp_updated": 1698444782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712690234184265137", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148999134": {"recommendationid": "148999134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820913841", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5377, "last_played": 1580815873}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've ever played.

Su sistema de combate es \"interesante\", pero solo en un combate 1 vs 1 contra un enemigo mas d\u00e9bil que tu, en cualquier otro caso, es aburrido y frustrante, aburrido por que no te da ning\u00fan tipo satisfacci\u00f3n y frustrante por que por mucho que lleves una armadura de buen nivel y un arma de mucho da\u00f1o, si te hacen un sangrado antes de terminar el combate, se acab\u00f3, o te mueres durante la pelea o te mueres a lo poco. Adem\u00e1s, de que es un sistema que no funciona, he tenido este juego en consola y recuerdo no poder luchar, por que pasaba de un lado al otro del cursor en cuanto se te mov\u00eda el joystick un segundo, pero es que en pc lo que ocurre es que tienes que estar pendiente del click derecho, del izquierdo, de la q y del alt, a la vez que tienes que recordar los combos, los cuales dudo que alguien pueda hacer contra un verdadero enemigo, por que la realidad es que por muy bien que te vaya en el combate, en cuanto tu enemigo te haga un agarre parece que se tira un dado para ver quien empuja a quien.

En definitiva, es un quiero y no puedo de campeonato, sinceramente, para la mierda que han acabado haciendo, que hubiesen metido un motor para la workshop y as\u00ed al menos podr\u00edamos ver un juego interesante cuando los modders le metieran mano, pero como este juego ya tiene mas a\u00f1os que la tos y parece que los developpers tienen una visi\u00f3n tan purista de su juego que ni siquiera tienes acceso total a la consola de comandos, dudo que estuviese en sus planes.", "timestamp_created": 1698355576, "timestamp_updated": 1698355576, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47554585337638855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148937934": {"recommendationid": "148937934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198430891052", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 54459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54459, "last_played": 1568457430}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game!", "timestamp_created": 1698354072, "timestamp_updated": 1698354072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148937191": {"recommendationid": "148937191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170409590", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3924, "last_played": 1698887819}, "language": "english", "review": "fun combat", "timestamp_created": 1698353203, "timestamp_updated": 1698353203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148936195": {"recommendationid": "148936195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167066034", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6208, "last_played": 1698351780}, "language": "english", "review": "Humans, what a wonderful bunch.

Este es el ejemplo mas acertado para definir a este juego, si es que se lo puede llamar as\u00ed. \n\nEntiendo y aplaudo la idea de los creadores de hacer que el juego fuese \"realista\", sin embargo, esta forma de hacer video juegos que ya muchos conocemos en otros t\u00edtulos como RDR2, puede convertirse en un arma de doble filo cuando en pos de querer demostrar \"lo realista\", se vuelve algo soso y aburrido. \n\nEl sistema de combate es por lejos \"lo mejor y lo peor\" que he jugado jam\u00e1s. Lo mejor porque cuando tienes un duelo 1vs1 contra un NPC la experiencia es absolutamente magistral. Sientes la adrenalina y la necesidad de planear una estrategia en tiempo real para vencerlo y aunque la dificultad es grande con el tiempo te acostumbras a enfrentar el desaf\u00edo. El problema es que el juego constantemente intenta ser \"REALISTA\", y en cierto punto te embarcas en una quest gastando 40 minutos de tu tiempo para que de manera random te embosquen 6 soldados de nivel much\u00edsimo mas alto que el tuyo y terminen acabando contigo sin que puedas hacer nada, mandando esos 40 minutos de tiempo invertido a la basura, porque el juego no cuenta con autoguardado, dado que para hacer eso lo tienes que pagar. \n\nDejen que me explaye a\u00fan mas sobre el punto anterior. Cuando te enfrentas a uno o a dos NPCS enemigos, siendo nivel bajo, el juego se vuelve dificil, pero con la estrategia adecuada puedes salir victorioso. El problema es cuando te emboscan 4 arqueros, 2 lanceros y 2 espadachines de nivel superior. Agrega eso que te atacan por puntos ciegos los cuales el sistema de combate no te permite detectar, haciendo que mueras sin siquiera tener chance de reaccionar. Es una dificultad artificial e injusta al punto que deja de ser disfrutable. No es como en los soulslike donde mueres mil veces pero en cierta forma reconoces que fue tu culpa por no saber encarar al boss. Aqu\u00ed la curva de aprendizaje es inexistente, vas a morir porque si y ya, haci\u00e9ndote perder el tiempo invertido sin siquiera aprender nada, porque injustamente, nada puedes hacer.\n\nY quiero aclarar algo para finalizar, porque de seguro muchos fanboys del juego te dir\u00e1n que el t\u00edtulo no te gusta porque no sabes jugar. Me fascinan los juegos dif\u00edciles, he vivido horas maravillosa con la saga Dark Souls e incluso con la saga God of War en dificultad superior, justamente porque son juegos que entienden que tanto la curva de aprendizaje, como el reconocimiento al tiempo invertido son importantes. Pero aqu\u00ed con esta auto felada de pene que hacen los desarrolladores para mostrarte, \"LO REALISTA\" que es el juego, echan por la borda las ganas de recorrerlo. \n\nPor todo \u00e9sto y mas, si sos una persona que gusta de probar simuladores de lo que sea y no te molesta echarte horas haciendo una quest para que de la nada el juego te ponga un desaf\u00edo cuasi imposible que te haga empezar de cero sin que ni siquiera entiendas que hiciste mal, avent\u00farate y juzgalo en base a tu experiencia. Pero si eres como yo, una persona que luego de trabajar/estudiar solo quieres sentarte a vivir una experiencia entretenida y sentir que te escapas del mundo un rato, no te lo recomiendo para nada. Mejor dale una oportunidad a los Souls o a Mount & Blade y huye de la tentaci\u00f3n de jugarlo. No vale la pena sabiendo la cantidad de otros t\u00edtulos del mismo estilo con los que la vas a pasar mucho mejor.\n", "timestamp_created": 1698289162, "timestamp_updated": 1698289162, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49562305212020874", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148880515": {"recommendationid": "148880515", "author": {"steamid": "76561199529675675", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 140, "playtime_at_review": 1313, "last_played": 1700153507}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most immersive games EVER.

ALL the DLCs ARE GARBAGE, BORING, TERRIBLY DESIGNED.\n\nThe base game is amazing, in a very unique way. This game has the most frustrating first 10 hours i've seen in any video game in my life and mastering that frustration requires immense patience and skill.\n\n You also need a bunch of mods, google \"kingdom come deliverance must use mods and use all of them, trust me, this game does not allow you to save anywhere you want without mods and if you cant save anywhere you want you are going to suffer. Also get the brown wooden inventory mod because the base game one is flashy and terrible.\n\nAll that aside, this game begins you as a literal peasant who cant do anything, LITERALLY, you HAVE TO LEARN EVERYTHING. From sword fighting to all the way to READING. It's really satisfying towards the end of the game when you've done all that and see a super overpowered knight on your screen.\n\nThis game has the most realistic medieval settings, armor, world design and weapons i've seen in like ever. The best and the worst thing about this game is the amount of freedom it gives you as a player. You can do anything, you can also get into super frustrating situations if you don't do as the game wanted you to do, and the game barely tells you what to do so it's very easy to end in frustrating situations. This is why the unlimited saves mod is necessary. The game will also randomly decide to spawn 6 enemies on you while your fast travelling, which you can avoid or end up not avoiding and die. This is also why the mod is necessary.\n\nThe most fun i've had in this game wasn't the gameplay or the story, it was the messing around with the mechanics of the game to do the most goofiest things possible, what's that? you have to play medieval dice with this one guy and win to get the quest item? SCREW THAT, KILL EVERYONE, SURVIVE WITH 1 HP? YEAHH\n\nThe base game was amazing, and the story was actually pretty good, the world was beautiful, one of the best medieval games ever made. It REALLY needs a sequel, because the story ended on a to be continued.\n\nRemember, if you get easily frustrated, want to play a game that works really well and doesn't break every 10 minutes, do NOT play this. You will regret your hours, if you do enjoy beating the frustration and figuring out the games engine yourself for hours on end and then be satisfied, because watching broken stuff work makes you happy, buy it on sale, You'll have a great time, figuring out how the game works is really rewarding.\n\n9/10, Best medieval RPG out there, Needs a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1697891717, "timestamp_updated": 1697891817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506849288940429688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148599239": {"recommendationid": "148599239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281033690", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 661, "last_played": 1698125019}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe Im too late to give a review of this game, honestly this game is good but I feel a pain in my back when there are too few places that can be used to teleport", "timestamp_created": 1697890475, "timestamp_updated": 1697890475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148597598": {"recommendationid": "148597598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264707573", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 61285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60581, "last_played": 1698434163}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the game, finished multiple playthorughs, both in normal and hardcore mode. Below are some things I find annoying:\n\n- economy on hardcore mode - feel like this one should be a bit harder, the mechanics of merchants building up massive amounts of wealth from trading with them makes it posssible to get 100k+ grochen in a few IRL hours of poaching, or in later game, armor hauls from Skalitz\n\n- bows are waaaay too powerful - 3 center of mass shots on an enemy wearing top quality cuirass takes him from full hp to dead (one shot if using bane poisoned arrows). Combine that with the fact that enemy never gives chase on a horse and you remove all challenge from any fight. I don't think it should be possible to penetrate good quality plate armour with arrows.\n\n- master strikes take all tactics and finesse out of fighting - they are too easy to pull of both by the player and the AI. This heavily promotes a passive approach to combat where player only waits for the ai to make a move to masterstrike them. \n\n-no good mechanics for melee combating  groups of enemies - fighting groups of enemies is very clunky, with the game only allowing  swings at the enemies you are currently soft locked on and them masterstriking the hell out of you - which can very easily lead to very quick player death. This makes meta of melee with these groups of constantly backtracking and masterstriking all incoming attacks.

You get into a fight early on that you just can't win, because you have no idea how to fight properly. Later on, you face this same opponent and, while they're a challenge, you're able to emerge victorious.\n\nDespite this, combat is *not* the main focus of this game. It's diplomacy and investigation. I've spent more time running around between local towns figuring out where a pack of baddies are, trying to decipher the ramblings of a madman, and having fun with the local lords, negotiating alliances and gathering allies, trying to root out a bandit hiding in a monastery, than I did actually fighting enemies.

After 6.6 hours spent wandering through the unforgiving medieval world of Bohemia, it's clear that this game is a labor of love for history enthusiasts and fans of deep, complex RPGs.\n\nAt the heart of Kingdom Come: Deliverance is its commitment to historical realism. The game transports players to 15th-century Bohemia, and it does so with meticulous attention to detail. The world feels lived-in, with realistic depictions of architecture, clothing, and daily life, immersing you in a time and place rarely explored in the gaming world.\n\nThe game's narrative centers around the tale of Henry, a blacksmith's son whose world is upended by war and political intrigue. The story unfolds with a sense of authenticity, eschewing fantasy elements in favor of a more grounded and historically plausible plot. While it may not be as grandiose or fantastical as some other RPGs, it succeeds in bringing a genuine sense of medieval life to the player.\n\nGameplay in Kingdom Come: Deliverance is similarly rooted in reality. Combat, for instance, is challenging and skill-based, eschewing the superhuman abilities often found in fantasy RPGs. It can be daunting at first, but as you hone your skills, it becomes deeply satisfying and rewarding. The same goes for other aspects of gameplay, such as hunting, lockpicking, and alchemy, which require patience and practice.\n\nThe game's attention to detail extends to the character interactions and choices you make. The reputation system can influence how NPCs react to you, and your dialogue choices carry weight, leading to meaningful consequences. The world feels dynamic and reactive, which adds a layer of complexity and authenticity to the experience.\n\nWhile Kingdom Come: Deliverance excels in historical realism, this very feature can be a double-edged sword. Some players may find the game's steep learning curve and lack of hand-holding frustrating. The slow start and the initial difficulty curve in combat and other mechanics can be intimidating, requiring a certain degree of patience and perseverance.\n\nGraphically, the game is impressive, especially considering its indie roots. The landscapes and environments are beautifully rendered, with attention to lighting and atmospheric effects. The character models, while not as impressive as some AAA titles, are nevertheless quite convincing.\n\nIn conclusion, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a refreshingly unique take on the RPG genre, offering a meticulously crafted historical world and gameplay that demands skill and dedication. With 6.6 hours played, you've had a glimpse into the game's immersive world and complex mechanics. While its steep learning curve and the realism might not be for everyone, those willing to invest time and effort will find a rich, rewarding experience that stands as a testament to the potential for historical authenticity in video games. It's a must-try for history buffs and RPG aficionados looking for something different.", "timestamp_created": 1697716067, "timestamp_updated": 1697716067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148479488": {"recommendationid": "148479488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283468977", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 572, "last_played": 1671816840}, "language": "english", "review": "My experience boiled down to travelling around for an hour, hitting a guy couple times before chasing all of his fleeing allies, and then trying to get to a bed so I can finally save", "timestamp_created": 1697710435, "timestamp_updated": 1697710484, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148475315": {"recommendationid": "148475315", "author": {"steamid": "76561199537787909", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1375, "last_played": 1697941171}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game\n", "timestamp_created": 1697701315, "timestamp_updated": 1697701315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148473370": {"recommendationid": "148473370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115331206", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3988, "last_played": 1698870132}, "language": "english", "review": "please, a sequel, i'll pay a million dollars", "timestamp_created": 1697696435, "timestamp_updated": 1697696435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148468318": {"recommendationid": "148468318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198845937139", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 4502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4502, "last_played": 1697684940}, "language": "english", "review": "Great, can't wait for the second game.

Having read some of the negative reviews the combat system seems to be peoples main gripe, and whilst I admit it does take effort to learn even the basics, it is something you can master with a bit of patience and practice (Don't worry, after you finish the prologue you get some proper training)\n\nThe combat is another thing that they have made quite realistic, if you are in a fight and its 1v2, you are at a proper disadvantage, no matter how good your gear or skills are, if its 1v3 or 1v4 then you are forced to use the environment to your advantage, get good with a bow or be sneaky. Even when you are in the best armor with the best weapons the game has to offer.

Aunque ganes acabar\u00e1s con la ropa hecha jirones, parte del equipo destruido y lesiones que tardar\u00e1n d\u00edas en curarse. Eso si no tienes una hemorragia y no tienes nada a mano para hacerte un torniquete. Tienes que valorar qu\u00e9 combates merece la pena librar.\n\nHay que comer, beber y dormir con frecuencia. No hacerlo tiene consecuencias graduales cuanto m\u00e1s tiempo lleves sin hacerlo. Adem\u00e1s, la comida se pudre, por lo que tienes que cuadrar los tiempos para no quedarte sin comida.\n\nEl guardado de partida est\u00e1 limitado. Solo puedes guardar partida durmiendo en una cama o utilzando una poci\u00f3n espec\u00edfica que no es muy abundante. Esto significa que tendr\u00e1s repetir cosas si te matan, a no ser que hayas utilizado una poci\u00f3n.\n\nEl sistema de combate puede llegar a desesperar. La idea es buena, est\u00e1 inspirada en el sistema de FOR HONOR. Puedes lanzar ataques en diferentes direcciones, pero la ejecuci\u00f3n no est\u00e1 muy pulida. El sistema parece estar roto, aunque impactes no sabes muy bien cuando haces da\u00f1o y cuando no.\n\nEl sistema de aprendizaje de habilidades es similar a Skyrim, pero llevado un paso m\u00e1s all\u00e1. Al principio eres un completo inutil y tendr\u00e1s que practicar mucho para ser competente en combate, sobretodo con el arco, que no tiene punto de mira.\n\nAunque el juego te de opciones para resolver las cosas por la via diplom\u00e1tica o el sigilo, hay partes donde tendr\u00e1s que ganar un combate para avanzar en la historia principal, as\u00ed que no puedes descuidar tus habilidades de combate.\n\n\n\nQU\u00c9 ME HA GUSTADO:\n\nLas decisiones importan. No solo influyen tus decisiones en la historia, si no que adem\u00e1s hay ciertas misiones que debes cumplirlas en un tiempo determinado o ya no podr\u00e1s hacerlas.\n\nEl inventario y las estats son complejas. Hay varias capas de ropa y armadura y estas influyen en tu carisma y en tu capacidad de sigilo.\n\nGeneralmente el juego te da diferentes v\u00edas para hacer una misi\u00f3n en funci\u00f3n de tus habilidades. \n\n\n\nLO QUE NO ME HA GUSTADO:\n\nTiene bugs importantes.\n\nEl control del caballo es terrible, sobre todo cuando va despacio.\n\nEl sistema de combate hace aguas cuando luchas contra m\u00e1s de un oponente. \n\nEl combate no est\u00e1 muy pulido.\n\nLa necesidad de comer, beber y dormir se te puede hacer pesada.", "timestamp_created": 1697399782, "timestamp_updated": 1697400596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148297394": {"recommendationid": "148297394", "author": {"steamid": "76561199525298069", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8319, "last_played": 1697558574}, "language": "english", "review": "immersive, realistic. piece of art \ud83d\udc4c", "timestamp_created": 1697396289, "timestamp_updated": 1697396289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148296393": {"recommendationid": "148296393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072590578", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1698519337}, "language": "english", "review": "I paid 30 euro, let me pet the damn sheep.\n\n9/10, could use more sheep petting.", "timestamp_created": 1697395147, "timestamp_updated": 1697395147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148295596": {"recommendationid": "148295596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161286746", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8251, "last_played": 1699221269}, "language": "english", "review": "Jesus Christ be praised!", "timestamp_created": 1697394278, "timestamp_updated": 1697394278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148292479": {"recommendationid": "148292479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159130618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "playtime_at_review": 1737, "last_played": 1700092188}, "language": "english", "review": "TOO REALISTIC, which is nice.", "timestamp_created": 1697391048, "timestamp_updated": 1697391048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148290369": {"recommendationid": "148290369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097591237", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 3787, "last_played": 1700222392}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this game on sale.

The issue I had with it is regardless of how good Henry was with defense or a particular weapon if you the player sucked at the combat system Henry also sucked at combat. I hope they improve this for the second game\n\nQuests: \nIn general the quests were good with indicators of where you needed to go next, however some times they were a bit vague. The main quest was better though.\n\nStory:\nI really enjoyed the story, it was pretty well done and I found myself caring for the characters as \"people\" and wanted them to thrive. Without spoiling anything there was one character in particular that I got a rather unhappy ending for in their quest and actually redid a large portion of the quest to try and get a better result\n\nRomance:\nThis seemed to be tossed in as an after thought without is really amounting to anything other than a single tumble in the hay and the occasional gift when talking to them after. It would have been really nice if the relationship could have continued to grow or even if current events could be discussed later in the game instead of the same old ones each time\n\nDice Mini Game:\nLoved it, enough said. It was fun to take all of someone's money in dice and I enjoyed stealing the special dice from people after I saw them use.\n\nSave System:\nUnique in that you had to drink a special drink to perform a Hard Save along with sleeping in an \"owned\" bed as kind of a \"Quick Save\". It would have been nice to have a few more save points. Such as after completing a fast travel having the game save because there is nothing worth than accomplishing a lot and then suddenly die because you run into a couple bandits and suck at the combat system.\n\nI would rate this game a 7 out of 10 and cant wait for the second one to continue the story", "timestamp_created": 1697076619, "timestamp_updated": 1697076852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148053040": {"recommendationid": "148053040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359998442", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1698904411}, "language": "english", "review": "its like skyrim so its good", "timestamp_created": 1697070875, "timestamp_updated": 1697070875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148047403": {"recommendationid": "148047403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015864823", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7072, "last_played": 1697030629}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best medieval RPGs made, i expected something generic, and it turns out a small studio made a legendary game.

This game has truly redefined my expectations for open-world RPGs, and I'm delighted to share my positive thoughts about it.\n\nFirst and foremost, the attention to historical detail is nothing short of astonishing. From the meticulously recreated landscapes of 15th century Bohemia to the period-accurate clothing and architecture, \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" immerses you in a bygone era like no other game before. The dedication of the developers to recreate a historically accurate world is truly commendable.\n\nOne of the standout features of this game is its realism. The combat system, in particular, is a refreshing departure from the typical hack-and-slash approach seen in many RPGs. You truly feel like a medieval warrior, with each swing of your sword requiring precision and timing. The depth of the combat mechanics adds a layer of immersion that few games can match.\n\nThe story of \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" is equally engrossing. It's a tale of revenge, intrigue, and personal growth that keeps you invested from start to finish. The well-written characters and the moral choices you must make along the way add depth and complexity to the narrative, making it one of the most engaging RPG stories I've experienced.\n\nThe game's open-world design is a joy to explore. The lush forests, bustling towns, and sprawling countryside are teeming with life and detail. Whether you're hunting in the woods, engaging in medieval combat, or simply conversing with the locals, every aspect of the world feels alive and authentic.\n\nFurthermore, the dedication of the development team to improving the game post-launch is admirable. They've actively listened to player feedback and released patches and updates that have enhanced the overall experience, demonstrating a commitment to their fanbase.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" is a triumph of historical accuracy, storytelling, and gameplay. It's a game that transports you to a fascinating period in history and allows you to experience it like never before. If you're a fan of RPGs and are looking for a truly unique and immersive gaming experience, do yourself a favor and dive into this medieval masterpiece.

There is no timed autosave.\n\nThat's a problem.  I like to spend a lot of time just exploring the world.  At one point I lost 2 hours worth of skilling up and farming because I got killed in an ambush.  \n\nI quit for a while.  \n\nWhen I came back I went to skill up archery doing the contests.  After about 30 minutes the game froze and I lost all my progress.\n\nIt's the only time the game has frozen or crashed on me.  But it happened when I was already pissed that there was no 10 minute autosave feature.\n\nI don't really give a fuck what the developer thought they were doing by restricting saves.  I don't have time for this shit.  This game is aimed at adults with jobs and families.  I strongly suspect most of them don't.\n\nEdit:  The save system in this game is absolutely shit.  I just lost 4 hours of playtime because of a crash.  I hadn't saved because I was just skilling up with the guard.  Four hours of progress gone in an instant...\n\nSeriously.  Any Developer that thinks not having an autosave system is a good idea is a fucking moron that should spend the rest of their lives working for McDonalds.\n\nEdit 2:  I've been running into more CTDs and have also been having trouble launching the game.  I often have to kill the process using the task manager because the process is hanging and unresponsive.  It usually launches the second time.\n\nI would guess that I have lost 10+ hours of progress now due to the combination of CTDs and no autosave.  The largest chunck of that was a single 4 hour session that I had spent skilling up with the captain of the guard...  I hadn't saved because I had not yet run into many CTDs and wasn't going anywhere I might run into a lethal enemy.", "timestamp_created": 1696527671, "timestamp_updated": 1696846662, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147684146": {"recommendationid": "147684146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211496363", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "playtime_at_review": 565, "last_played": 1700183989}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't even advance through the story because i'm crashing in missions when I load cut-scenes, I maybe had 3-4 hours of semi functional gameplay some stutter in Fattay mostly average 60-75fps little to no lag, cut-scenes go in 29-30 fps idk some reason, and 5 hours of crashing.I paid near for 42 dollars Royal Edition, I was stuck on the mission when you return to Skalitz and bury someone (no spoilers)for a hour because I kept crashing between the moment the bandits stole your sword cut-scene constantly, it was so hard to get past this point and I was over playtime to refund at this point,I kept trying to hold esc to skip and cinematic cutscenes for widescreen are blurry kind of.                                                                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                                                          \n  I am in Fattay now, before patrolling i'm at a scene where I crash shortly after ringing the bell for your Lord in the cutscene after fist fighting that whiny drunk prepubescent Lord.

When it comes to DLC's I've only played one extensively, which is called Ashes I think? It's been a while... It is the one where you get to rebuild Pribyslavitz. I've recently installed the game to see if they had finally fixed the merchant bug, and I'm not shocked to find it unresolved as issues such as not being able to shop at your own town (Pribyslavitz) while being labeled a trespasser after HOURS of getting it up and running still happens. With that said, due to the lack of quality in that DLC, I have been reluctant to try any others. I'm not sure what else to say about it, it is an incomplete game that can be fun for about the first 400 hours or so but afterwards you will get bored of collecting loot, finding random skirmishes, sneaking around into peoples homes, playing the criminal, playing the hero, playing the inconsiderate a-hole lol... So if at all, buy this game if it is on sale, and make sure it is approximately at least 1/2 off the original price.

I'm also not really a historian so take my words with a grain of salt.\n\nMore importantly, is this game good at all? Yea.\n\nIt's not for everyone though, the combat is difficult and the needs/save system can be considered tedious if you're not into hardcore roleplaying like some are.

The saving system is kinda weird and will be sure to make you either stop playing (temporarily or not) or download mods to save at will.

Aside from those major gripes,  it's a cool game. The immersion/RP possibilities (i.e.: feeling like you're living in medieval times) is sublime, the dialogue and side-stories are rich, the skills/stats are fun to progress, the weather is well-done and the views you can see in some parts of the map are just breathtakingly immersive. I also love the zero-to-hero approach they took, you can sorta feel Henry get smarter and stronger as you level up.

It goes even as far as to have the typical Rockstar games' flaws of forcing you to do very specific things in only one way or face a Mission Failed. You'll groan as you fail side objectives for no reason, are forced into nonsensically paced missions with strict time and behavior requirements, and you may find yourself getting frustrated with how you may be tossed around.\n\nStill, KCD delivers on its promise wholeheartedly. And you'll truly feel immersed in its detailed and lovely crafted world. Don't let the jank and the inconsistencies get to you, this is a fine and dandy medieval simulator with a less generic, more traditional, story told in a believable yet still engaging way.\n\nPs: if you tend to get sick playing first person games because of the character's height and all the bobbing, you will get so playing this one, and I don't think there's enough configuration settings to make it better.

I did get the royal version or whatever it's called, the one with all DLC, so that probably added quite a lot of content to the base game, but still, one of the best RPGs I have played in recent memory. \nI really didn't expect such immersion, I do like some roleplaying myself, but this game really made me act as if I was there. Currently I have a thief/ rogue kinda play style, but I am excited for a future playthrough as a righteous knight. Most of the buildings look so good, beautifully painted insides, the church frescos especially made me wanna visit different churches and chapels  in-game, like Henry might have wanted to do when seeing them I suppose. Long story short, it's beautiful where it needs to be.  \nA lot of the quests do not hold your hand, they give you clues on where, who, or what to investigate, maybe a very wide area on the map is marked, but no exact waypoints most of the time, which I really like. What you do, if you steal, get caught, lie, or if the NPCs are suspicious of you actually matters.  Armour and weapons again, look really nice, and you feel a sense of progression, learning how to fight better and how to approach different enemies based on their own outfits. I do feel that fighting more than, let's say, 3 enemies at once, is a real struggle. Not necessarily because of the combat difficulty, because based on how you choose to play, you can take quite a beating based on your armour, but because of the lock-on camera. Also the dogs, hate the armour-ignoring dogs that stun you for a few seconds. I chose to be more stealthy, so I didn't have to fight that much face-to-face let's say, but pulling out a combo or just an normal hit seems impossible sometimes. I suppose it's trying to replicate enemy skill levels, but being able to hit opponents with master strokes or counters only  transforms some of the encounters into a game of waiting, staring at each other until one of you attacks first and is inevitably countered. Again, might just be my inexperience in heads-on fights, but it did feel that way.\n\nAll-in-all, EXCEPTIONAL game,  I was so surprised after I bought it, I knew it was highly regarded, but I didn't expect to like it this much. With the exception of some little things, I do think it is a good play for any RPG enjoyers, and if you like medieval  stuff, then it becomes a must.

Like \"interesting sites\" are not interesting at all sometimes is just a bunch of rocks on top of each other.\n\nWhat I did like:\n-people say that combat is bad but to me its alright\n-story is good but as I said quests at the start are boring\n-aesthetic and music kick ass they rly made me feel like yes this are the middle ages\n\nSo things that I would change:\n1. Not all main stroy is fun so I would make it more fun/cut some stuff that is boring and time consuming\n2. Make better side qusts\n3. Make better DLCs\n4. Make skills easier to train so they are not time consuming\n", "timestamp_created": 1695844952, "timestamp_updated": 1695844952, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147150028": {"recommendationid": "147150028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035505712", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 9470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 237, "playtime_at_review": 8251, "last_played": 1700723712}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute masterpiece.

Most singleplayer, open-world, RPGs are extremely easy, hold your hand, type of games that offer no depth or challenge.

You won't be forced to fight difficult enemies all on your own, but typically in this game you've got 2 choices.  Either fight enemies that you'll probably die to, or find a creative solution to your problem.  The combat may be clunky sometimes, but that improves the experience of struggling to improve your combat skills.  The RPG element to this game is also insanely in-depth, well made, and understandable once you give it time.  Lastly, I'd like to comment on just how good the sound design and music is.  I found myself really enjoying traveling as pleasant music played and I could hear every little thing happening around me whether it's my footsteps, the clanging from my armor, the chirping of birds, the muttering of bandits in camps, or the water rushing by me.  This is an insanely immersive game.  As for the story, while I have not completed the main quest yet, I'm really enjoying it as this is not your typical underdog bestowed with great powers or mighty knight with innate abilities.

Also, manual saves are a consumable in this game for some god awful reason, so if you want to save before going into a fight or making an important decision, then you better hope you were able to get your hands on a saving potion. From what I've seen of the character writing and dialogue so far, I am also bored out of my whits, but I don't know, maybe it gets good.\n\nMaybe some day I'll install a mod that fixes the god-awful combat camera lock system and finally save Theresa from those 3 Cumans, but until then, she'll just have to experience what combat in this game feels like.", "timestamp_created": 1695717386, "timestamp_updated": 1695772459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147048265": {"recommendationid": "147048265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094873295", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6888, "last_played": 1695714888}, "language": "english", "review": "Over all it is a decent game.  but, do you want to grind for hours getting some cool plate armor?  wear it once in combat then spend double the time to get enough money to repair it.  do you like pulling off combos in combat?  well you won't here.

I recently watched the documentary about how they consulted with master fencers and swordsmen to make sure the combat was realistic and playable, and as someone who fences, it was fascinating and awesome! The way combat is approached in KC:D is ingenious, and I've never played anything like it before. But fear not, it's not incredibly difficult either, which is something I worried about upon first learning of this game. Even as someone who is relatively new to playing video games and usually stresses out about combat, the mechanics of KC:D were easy to learn. And again, they managed to make playing the game really feel like wielding a sword. I was very impressed and reminded of fencing techniques I'd forgotten about since being out of practice. \nThe sheer amount of research the developers put into this game is worthy of praise. Combat aside, the game includes a historical \"Codex,\" which has probably taught me more about medieval Bohemia than any history class I've ever taken or will ever take. Real locations, real people, and real events are included in this codex. Information about life in this era and all the details about any curiosities you may have while playing are presented in such a captivating and convenient fashion. So if you're a fan of learning history, this game has tons to offer! Honestly I feel like I was provided access to a graduate level textbook that just so happened to come in a game! Of course, if you're not too into reading or learning history, you can also just completely ignore the codex, and you aren't forced to read a bunch or learn anything you're not interested in.\nMy final point is that the story itself is amazingly well-written. I loved all of the DLCs too! I've seldom felt as emotionally moved by any form of media as this game has made me feel. It wasn't hard to grow attached to the protagonist, Henry, and before I knew it I was fully invested in his character and his story. I'm sure most people would feel the same as they follow him through this adventurous and touching tale of loss, hope, overcoming adversity, and finding redemption. There are also some wild plot twists that left me speechless, all while still seeming plausible and overall piecing everything together so well! \nI've gone on far too long already, but I'll finish by saying this: My only gripe with this game is that the sequel hasn't been released yet! I can hardly wait.

Wandering around town or going about on different quests always feels good. Even some jobs that are pretty tedious in other games like hunting are very fun, It's always a good sign when you can spend 1 hour IRL playing medieval hunting simulator and not notice how much time has gone by.\n\nCombat: Combat is at its core a great idea with SOME pretty good mechanics BUT (read \"the bad).\n\n\nThe bad:\nDirection: This game is REALLY bad at telling you what's going on or what you SHOULD be doing. You have to do a lot of wiki/guide reading to have an enjoyable experience. You know in Elden Ring how there are no real quest markers and the like? Well it works in Elden Ring because the Devs knew how to drip feed you info on what you needed to know. In KCD you can game ruin without even knowing it by advancing to fast in the main story without doing certain side quests/training first. Also some mechanics are straight up hidden from you until you grind certain skills enough (particularly combat skills) \n\nBugs/broken quests: It's very easy to break quest lines by picking the wrong dialogue option when talking to NPC's (i'm not talking about failing a quest btw) I currently cannot do the millers quest because I accidentally started a section of the quest that I already completed, so now I can't do anything since the quest giver wants me to pick up an item I already gave him. \n\nMovement: This game makes moving around ANY obstacle an absolute disaster, A dog standing in front of a door will act as an invisible wall, bushes in the wilderness will trap your horse forever...... Ok lets address the horse in detail, on one of the first missions in the game you need to get on a horse and run away. I found\n a horse but it was on a SLIGHT incline, however because the terrain was bad enough my horse refused to turn or do anything but run straight into a cliff until it got stuck and I got killed. I was about to return the game at 110 minutes because I just died on a tutorial 8 times because if your horse touches a rock or a bush or a tree they'll not just stop but get stuck on said object. Actually this applies to movement on foot also so basically you have to stay on the straight and narrow path at all times or you're fucked.\n\nCombat: Alright this is the main sticking point in the game. From doing some reading the devs made the combat system a lot worse a few years back so I have no context for how it was originally.\nThe basics of combat work for the most part, strike/block your standard fare directional melee combat ala granddaddy M&B/age of chivalry. The intermediate options consist of timing elements for \"perfect blocks' and ripostes which make it easier (read 'possible') to land strikes. Then advanced items are called \"master strikes\" and your generic fight move combos (left, right, stab = better hit ect.).\nAlright now for the problems.\nMASTER STRIKES: unless you talk to the 2nd guy to teach you sword training AGAIN you will be unaware of the existence of master strikes, they're mentioned briefly in the advanced tutorial page but you have to grind weapon skill to learn them. Also pretty much every bandit knows at least 1 master strike so it would probably help the player to be taught how they work by the game, as it was extremely frustrating to get bopped in the head constantly with no option to block and thinking it was a bug.\nCOMBAT SKILLS: 1/2 the combat system doesn't work, this is not a bug, Henry (the MC) is not skilled enough to use these combat features, the game doesn't tell you this so when you're waiting for an option to parry a strike and it seems impossible this isn't a bug its you not grinding your skills enough. \nMULTIPLE ENEMIES: One of the realistic aspects of the game is that fighting 2+ people at the same time is damn hard, like 2 unarmed dudes in their pajamas will almost take you down. Which would be fine if the game didn't make you fight 2-6 enemies ALL THE FUCKING TIME, fast travelling down a road? Here's 6 bandits to fight. Just wandering in the woods with your boss? Well he's useless so defeat these 2 armored bandits by yourself, BTW one of them can master strike so you had best kill the other one before he chops you to ribbons (man having done the stealth tutorial in game would have been nice for that mission too bad its part of a sidequest). The solution to multi-fights is to not use the lock-on system and run in circles stabbing the cluster of opponents, basically you have to exploit the combat AI to win.\nPERSPECTIVE: This is all done from first person perspective which is fine, but the game loses sync between combatants all the time so that you can't tell if you're hitting or parrying or connecting with hits at all. I've had several times where I can see my sword mid swing clipping through my opponent while I am at the same time parrying their stab, then my sword teleports above me for the overhand swing I was asking for to follow up the parry. This happens to my opponents also where the audible sound of me deflecting a hit does not match with the visual of their sword clipping into my screen which implies I just got hit in the face.\n\nI had to come back and explain combos because I forgot they existed.\nCOMBOS: They're useless the AI will always block/parry in the middle of one, in 17 hours I never landed a combo outside the tutorial.", "timestamp_created": 1695570374, "timestamp_updated": 1695570869, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146942350": {"recommendationid": "146942350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185548982", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4450, "last_played": 1685997912}, "language": "english", "review": "In complete and utter honesty, KCD is one of the best RPGs I've ever played, and the only things that hold it down is the jank of a few mechanics and the overall slow burn of the game.\n\nKCD is like a coconut, you have to crack through the hard shell to get to the good milky medieval goodness.

Oh almost forgot to mention, THERE IS NOT A AIMING RETICLE FOR ARCHERY, which makes it ungodly difficult and almost useless most of the time. The A.I. also can see fine in the dark, where the player can't see at all, as there isn't even a brightness setting. Enemies have unlimited stamina it seems like in combat, skills that mention they affect opponent's stamina do nothing.\nThe world is nice, it does look great at times, but still has issues. If you have played this game you know that it can be difficult moving around areas, and I won't even talk about stairs...\nOverall the A.I. is just a pain. When trying to do stealth they will often auto detect you from a while away, or constantly follow you around making sure you can't do anything.\nWhen I first saw this game, and what I mainly bought it for, was a crafting system. There is none, you can cook and brew alchemy and that is it. Everything else is just a inventory item, or trying to use a grindstone.\n\nEdit after beating this game again.\nPlaying through it once again, and doing as much as the game had to offer, I still stand by my complaints. To make the game \"Somewhat\" more enjoyable I had to download several mods, I even HAD to download the cheat mod just to do the main quest since I got stuck in a black loading screen. This issue was reported and talked about nearly FIVE years ago, and is still in the game.\nI have most of the DLCs, other then Woman's lot and the Hans one, and man. I think they were a bit of a let down. Ashes was okay, it isn't as broken as the main game, but I feel like it could use more. The fact that you are building a town, but then you don't even get to build half of the trades in your village. The DLC adds some new things that are really good, BUT you have to choose what you would have instead, so you completely lock out the other. One thing that really upset me about this is during one of the final quests you have to get supplies for Talmberg, you can choose to have a brewery in your village but then you can't use that for Talmberg. You can't use your garrison if you built a guards house. Bandits still camp right outside. A big note about this DLC, if you completed it and asked Divish to finish the building process it breaks a quest, the bug I mentioned earlier that i HAD to get a Cheat mod for.\nNow for Band of Bastards... This one is just... Wow. It is bad. It is mainly just go here, kill that. However then you get \"Choices\" that mean nothing, even if you have that stats for it. The only good thing I got from this was a Armor set, most of which isn't good enough to be a late game set. Other then the arms for some reason.\nA smaller note, there are several special items, but they are not marked at all. So if you are mass selling gear, like I do a lot at least, you can easily sell the wrong thing and if you didn't realize fast enough welp, hope you didn't want it.\n\nI have had this game since it launched, I made the mistake of pre-ordering this even.

6866, "last_played": 1693791995}, "language": "spanish", "review": "A nivel general, es un buen juego, inmersivo, me agrad\u00f3 ese contexto medieval que vimos en much\u00edsimos juegos (Dark Souls, Draon Age, Shadow of Mordor, etc) pero sin monstruos, magia, milagros, hechizos, etc, hace todo mucho m\u00e1s real y, por ende, m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil.\nLa verdad que uno empieza el juego siendo lo m\u00e1s in\u00fatil que existe, no puede encarar una pelea ni con un ni\u00f1o, no sabe usar armas, no tiene una moneda en el bolsillo, y a corto plazo no hay manera de mejorar eso, hay que avanzar bastante en el juego para que las cosas empiecen a \"facilitarte\", pero casi siempre es cuesta arriba.\n\nLos bueno:\n- Juego hecho con amor por los desarrolladores.\n- Muchas manera de pelear contra alguien (ir de bruto, arco y flecha sobre el caballo, sigilo, etc).\n- Si uno le pone ganas, puede puede subir r\u00e1pido de nivel e ir consiguiendo dinero, pero hay que \"trabajar mucho\".\n- Historia fiel a los acontecimientos que los libros cuentan lo ocurrido a principios del siglo XV.\n- Muchas side quest para hacer.\n\nLo malo:\n- Los gr\u00e1ficos y las animaciones son un poco toscas (personalmente no me import\u00f3)\n- Si peleas con espada, este juego tiene uno de los peores sistema de lucha que vi en mi vida.\n- Quiz\u00e1s se extiende m\u00e1s de lo necesario en lo largo que es el juego.\n- La historia del personaje no es muy \u00e9pica que digamos, y muchas veces se vuelve confuso cuando los personajes secundarios tratan de explicar el contexto.\n- Algunos bugs menores, pero lo grave es el mal dise\u00f1o de side quest e incluso el DLC completo \"Band of Bastards, en los cuales algunos personajes que interfieren para avanzar, a determinado momento del juego principal, ya no se tiene acceso, por lo tanto dichas misiones quedan abiertas y sin posibilidad de continuar.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n: Si te interesa experimentar un contexto medieval en el cual

This game has the worst combat system I have ever seen in a game. The combat slings more bullshit at the player than any other game I have played, and I have 500+ hours on Escape From Tarkov. I'll try to split up my problems with it into categories.\n\n\n[u] The Jank: [/u]\nI'll put it plainly first: shit just doesn't work half of the time. It's not an uncommon occurrence for you to get a hit, combo, or clinch off on an enemy just for the game to have a fucking aneurysm for a second.\n\nThe combat UI will unlock from the enemy you're targeting and any inputs you make regarding an attack will only trigger the animation and depletion of stamina, but the attack will not register and will not affect the enemy at all, giving them a perfect opportunity to completely ass-fuck you while you flail about and your sword phases right through them.\n\n\n[u] 1v2+ Combat: [/u]\nThis shit isn't even jank because it was designed like this on purpose for some reason. The targeting system is completely incapable of handling more than one opponent at a time. I personally have had a problem where my \"switch target enemy\" inputs do not work at all, so maybe this isn't as much of a problem for other people if it does work for them, but for me I have to resort to trying other methods to target the enemy I want to.\n\nThe problem is that there is no other method. You can have target lock turned off but still get hard locked on that enemy. You could crank your DPI up to the maximum and swing your mouse across the table and you'd only have a 50/50% chance of actually changing your targeting focus to a different enemy.\n\nOn the flip-side, the game will decide seemingly at random that you told it to change targets - whether or not you actually tried to or even wanted to. All these things, the punishing nature of the combat, and the camera tracking your target even when not locked onto them creates an incredibly disorienting experience where you literally cannot tell what the hell is happening a [b] majority [/b] of the time.\n\nOverall, being forced to target someone out of your range of melee while you're getting ganked by 3 of his friends at the same time is infuriating to say the least.\n\n\n[u] It's Actually Unfair: [/u]\nDon't get me wrong, I'm perfectly fine with punishing combat most of the time, and even like it if it's implemented well. When I say this game is unfair, I mean the game actively places a bias in favor of the AI when doing anything combat related. Anything and everything you attempt will be overruled by whatever bullshit the AI decides to pull.\n\nFor instance, you get a clinch off on Captain Bernard and he gets \"stunned\". You go in to strike him while he's [strike] stunned [/strike] prepared to perfectly riposte and stun you and then he ripostes your attack and stuns you.\n\nThe character you play is heavily restricted in what he can do by what position he is in, his momentum, what he's preparing to do, etc.. If you're trying to block an attack and you miss that perfect block opportunity indicated by a green shield at the center of your combat reticle you're going to be completely fucked if you aren't lucky enough for the game to decide that your shield is, indeed, in the correct position to block a strike (regardless of if it actually is or not). However, this does not apply to the AI at all. You clinched your enemy and now their weapon and shield are only protecting one half of the available areas to attack them, with their back being completely exposed? Well, unbeknownst to you, these AI are Super Saiyans that can change their posture faster than light and put themselves in the perfect position to block you and do one of those special counters that stuns you on top of that. This is a long-winded way of saying that posture is a major factor in combat for the player, but the AI doesn't need it at all and just ignores any restrictions imposed by various game mechanics surrounding posture.\n\nCombos are almost completely pointless, as they can easily be interrupted by the enemy before you get them off and essentially puts you at the mercy of whatever the AI decides to do to you. But, as is the theme in this section, there is a double standard. If an AI lands a strike on you, there's extremely little you can do to stop the AI from having their way with you. Sure, you might get lucky and land a perfect block during their flurry of attacks or at the end of it; but as previously stated, any time you stun the enemy, it's essentially worth the amount of stamina you can get back in the time you aren't spending getting hit, because the enemy can simply decide to ignore the stun effect.\n\n\n[u] Conclusion: [/u]\nAm I currently angry at the game for doing these things to me just before writing this review? Yes, I am. The thing is that it's occurred often enough that it has severely tarnished my experience with this otherwise amazing game. On multiple occasions these problems were so prevalent that I was on the verge of going rabid. It's not like facing these problems is a rare occurrence - in fact it's almost guaranteed that you will face at least one of these problems at any given moment you find yourself in combat or even just practicing combat. Sure, most of the times it's tolerable to a degree, but when the game has its moments, it is infuriating to the Nth degree. It is also not helped that you have to have a special resource that's somewhat expensive for a good portion of the game in order to save your game manually, and that's in normal mode.

From a game design perspective, Warhorse Studios has managed to craft an intricately detailed and expansive world that truly feels alive.\n\nThe characters in this game are not just mere NPCs standing idly in a corner, waiting for the player's interaction. Instead, they have their own lifecycles\u2014working, eating, sleeping, and engaging with the environment and the people around them. This kind of depth and attention to detail allows the world to feel incredibly organic and dynamic. You're not just wandering through a static medieval playground; you're in a living, breathing, medieval society.\n\nGraphically, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a visual treat. The sweeping landscapes, the meticulous designs of the settlements, and the nuanced character models all stand testament to the capabilities of modern gaming tech combined with passionate artistry. Yes, the game can be a tad buggy at times, but these minor glitches are far overshadowed by the immersive experience it offers.\n\nOne of the standout features is the palpable weight of decision-making. It's thrilling to see the tangible effects your choices bring to the game world, lending a sense of realism and gravity to every action, every word spoken. This isn't just a story you're told; it's a story you shape.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the heart of Bohemia, I couldn't help but feel completely enraptured by the world around me, genuinely caring for its inhabitants and eager to witness the next twist in the tale.

Including the flow of time, different things happen at different times in a day. I'd buy it for that alone. \n\nThe story itself is done nicely, pulls you in. Has some immersion-breaking 3rd-person cut-scenes (the worst one with picking herbs) some of which however help you get a feel for the character, like in movies.\n\nIn terms of game mechanics, the progression feels to be done quite well, nice pacing. Some of the mini-games are extremely difficult, especially in the beginning with no skills and perks.\n\nAnd for all other game-developers: If you ever do a game set in the middle ages: This is the new baseline.

Why attack or kill anyone when everyone is not only useful, but better than you in some way or another?\n\nNext, a squire. You start understanding what you're doing. You're taking less hits, you're actually landing some. You're getting smart. Every bruise is a lesson. People are starting to talk.\n\nFinally, you get the hang of it.

Lastly I get this is a period piece and not everyone was intelligent and the ones who were were also completely mental with Jesus. so just a thought but why does every npc i come across have to open a dialogue with \"Christ be praised\". Absolute nonsense. I'm an Atheist if you couldn't tell already but Im also a History nerd, and i know for a fact not everyone on Bohemia was a Religious nut job, their should be some npcs who can open a dialogue with \"Christ, bah who needs that rubbish. but anyway that's my two cents for 21 hours played so far.", "timestamp_created": 1695029175, "timestamp_updated": 1695029175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146521179": {"recommendationid": "146521179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967888189", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 162, "playtime_forever": 8599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8599, "last_played": 1694975452}, "language": "english", "review": "Henry is doing well. His life is not heavy with the burden of responsibility. Although he would like to look beyond the threshing floor one day, he is currently a blacksmith's son under his father's apprenticeship. He hangs around the bar in the pub, performs alotrium with his friends, helps with the blacksmith's bellows and secretly tries to learn swordsmanship from the mercenaries. But then the banners of Sigismund's troops bloom on the horizon. It's nothing personal, the Hungarian king just needs the silver from the Skalitz mines to keep paying the army, but Henry's life will change once and for all under the boots of the invaders.\n\nThe skeleton of the story could be called, with a not too ecstatic expression, a strongly classic tale of revenge with a twist, which you will guess after about thirteen seconds of the game - that is, if you haven't already read it somewhere before. In the end, unfortunately, the plot does not avoid even a bit of pathos, which was not needed. However, even an average story can be entertaining if it is skillfully presented. Here, on the other hand, Kingdom Come saves itself, because the writing skill is evident in the dialogues and excellently designed cutscenes.\nRelatively soon, period power schemes are added to the banal point, which improves the overall impression of the story. One of the greatest advantages of the entire game can already be recognized here, i.e. the disarming enthusiasm and zeal for the theme. The game is not afraid to explain the relations between the nobility, the motivations of the lords for their actions and the like. Everything down to the smallest detail. If you are also interested in history, you will also find an extensive encyclopedia of several hundred pages with records of medieval customs, notable figures, events and places. An enthusiast can spend several pleasant hours reading it.\n\nKingdom Come is definitely not a perfect experience. But at the same time he is exceptional. Its calm onset and slow gradation allow you to immerse yourself in a breathtaking and incredibly authentic atmosphere in a way that one would not expect from a more dynamic title. You have to adapt to the game, adhere to its rules, because it will not make concessions to you. But if you succeed, you'll see and experience one of the best renderings of the Middle Ages you'll ever play.

Second is the reverse tackling (at least I THINK that's what the fuck keeps happening to me) This is the part where I said you can't run, half the time I try and escape enemies, my camera starts tweakin and I do fifteen summersaults and a cartwheel then I'm back to getting gangbanged by a bunch of Turkish turd heads, and don't even get me started on dogs biting your hands with their solid steel jaws that never budge, it's seriously like your character is trying to pull his hand out from under a hydraulic press.\n\nLittle crying baby section\n* First boss fight- the first (possible) boss fight was supposed to feel cool and redeeming, instead I was screaming for an hour trying to figure out how to beat him without cheese, since the 30 thousand archers and Turkey turds you have to fight through left me on a tenth of my health, it took half an hour to realize I had the ability to check my inventory and heal before the fight began, also to finally put on a houndskull helmet I yoinked, which helped me to avoid getting absolutely destroyed by his master attacks, since every swing no longer resulted in me losing half my health, courtesy of a pommel in my eye socket.\n\nAnyways good game get used to the combat have fun.", "timestamp_created": 1695008025, "timestamp_updated": 1695008025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146507834": {"recommendationid": "146507834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051992008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 4725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4725, "last_played": 1694975610}, "language": "english", "review": "Played for 60 hours which included finishing the main questline before realizing I literally didn't know how to fight because I didn't talk to some old boomer.", "timestamp_created": 1694997428, "timestamp_updated": 1694997428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146502089": {"recommendationid": "146502089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187749979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2212, "last_played": 1697753600}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1694988678, "timestamp_updated": 1694988678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146499073": {"recommendationid": "146499073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385691368", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 5484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5484, "last_played": 1677008628}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is incredibly detailed, from little things for realism, to complete accuracy for history, buildings, and medieval combat. \n\nThe combat system is detailed as well, though not well suited for 1vX due to lack of options for AOE and zoning, which is most fights in this game. Combat can be janky and repetitive at times due to every enemy having the same movesets depending on weapon type, constant pushing, and how strong pushing and masterstrikes are compared to everything else. There are a lot of quests and activities, many of them can end in different ways depending on the player's choice, though some side quests are very basic like kill 3 boars or collect flowers.\n\nWorld building is incredible, the world and npcs feels consistent, npcs feels more alive than other games due to them having their own routine, personality, and memory instead of just being background characters. The map is vast and travelling the world actually feels like travelling due to how stamina and day night cycles are handled. It's very interesting to see a world based so much off of real life history with some changes by the devs, not as in WWII fps games or most other history based games, where historical events happens while you're there, kingdom come deliverance feels like you're actually partaking in the event, and you wouldn't know exactly what will happen next either due to some alterations from the devs.\n\nWithout spoilers, plot pacing for the main story does feel kind of rushed, and the ending was somewhat anti-climatic, the main story battles doesn't feel as epic as it was expected to be either due to the game hyping up some of the antagonist just for the fight to either be average, or it just doesn't happen at all. majority of my hours were spent on side quests and other activities.\n\nThere are a lot of content, but there are also a lot of cut content, thus despite the game being detailed, some parts of the game will still feel incomplete. For example, there's houndmaster skills in the stats, but houndmaster skills aren't actually a thing in the game, and you'll never get a dog companion.\n\nBasically, the game has a lot of features, very realistic, and great world building, combat system is ok, and level design is subpar, 6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1694984659, "timestamp_updated": 1694984659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146495932": {"recommendationid": "146495932", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125181707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 15853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 719, "playtime_at_review": 13592, "last_played": 1700764330}, "language": "english", "review": "September 1st, 2023 was the day I completed all achievements.

The graphics, artwork, and music in this game are fascinating. This game offers hours of gameplay with over 100 quests and many things to do such as gambling and horse riding.

It takes time to learn and even more to master. This level of difficulty adds depth to the game but requires patience.\n\nIn summary, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is highly recommended for those who love immersive stories and deep worlds.

I got slightly disappointed then I got totally disappointed with the tutorial. Even more disappointing, manually saving a game needs whatever that schnapps, which is an alcohol, to save the game. Even saving needs schnapps. An alcohol item that is limited.\n\nThis is the first game that this company/studio developed isn't it? I hope they consider patching the schnapps an item and just let us save. I don't understand why this company has to develop a game with this feature not allowing players to save? What is the reason? I already hated almost all mobile games, they are all trying to make sales with the micro-transactions with on the go devices. Almost every single game (except older ones, or some Nokia games that can be played with an emulator) on the play store, needs micro-transactions.\n\nI don't know whether this is an AA or whatever development game.\n\n\nUpon Googling just simple information, I found its a blend of indie and AAA development game. The combat system is okay, it may be realistic, but I even struggled on the tutorial. I'm slightly disappointed when I cannot become a good person when I'm an introvert temporarily having issues (maybe that will change recently if that Singaporean reads this. I dunno whether you will read this what I dun think you will look at my reviews, and they are not like... pseudo communitcation dun need to scroll and read (optional)), wanting to be a good person in the game despite having anger issues that maybe had stopped recently. I can't avoid fighting Kudesh? Can I skip time by pressing/holding(?) T? No. Evening? Wait until that time? I can't I guess. Just wait there until evening? TTTTTTTTTTT?\n\nI don't even want to watch guides on YouTube or search up how. Even the tutorial is a fat ironic thumbs up. ( = down + 50% bonus to leveling up lolz) Players are having a good time with it. But me? The tutorial lacks some options like dialogue and Kudesh seems to have a special defense??? I almost got hit until I got knocked out for the first time. Is that button even Q to block? Why I didn't even notice I can get schnapps, after I deleted my locked with no saves, save, I tried again. Noticed I can enter the tavern, talk to her, notice selling Kudesh's hammer is sooooo cheap like WT flip? I'd rather just sell all my schnapps...\n\nI'm just a beginner with HTML, I stopped for a long time, I'm not a developer? But why? I did see a negative review that someone dislikes the save feature. I had never developed a game before, but I know how developers used Unity or Godot or any other game engine to develop games. Patching is not my job. But why would I want to limit saving, maybe I will if my development team brought it up, but I thought about that Call Of Duty review, an old release, asking the developers to play it themselves. That guy also didn't like the game. My reputation starts at 100. I started right at the beginning after I talked to father (ingame), at first try. I was trying to be a good person. But no.\n\nI didn't even want to check the community page for anything or discuss about this. \n\nI just- slightly regret purchasing this game. Maybe I'll just come back and play it after I recovered from the disappointment or after a patch. Its not under my development, but whatever.\n\nI even thought in my thoughts, maybe I will leave this as a temporary rating. But hopefully not.\n\nUpdate:\nEven worse after I hacked the game with cheat engine, and after I became so angry, thrown the fucking chair and a metal cup, I cannot believe how I am supposed to keep watch at the battlements. This is the worst game I've ever played.\n\nUpdate 2 lol:\nI already reqeusted a refund for this game. Too terrible. Skyrim should even be better lol. Even its old and I don't really like it, maybe I will get back to Skyrim bcuz of this terrible game.", "timestamp_created": 1694878703, "timestamp_updated": 1694942624, "voted_up": false, "votes_up":

"review": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance presents a grounded setting that charmed me with its historical accuracy and perfectly sized open world. The story, and especially a few selected quests, are quite delightful and unique, proving that exciting stories can be told in a mundane environment. I never got overly enthusiastic about Henry, but there are some interesting side characters that fit in very well with the believable and coherent world.\n\nCombat is a bit too slow-paced for me, but did feel visceral in certain 1 on 1 situations. The skill system isn\u2019t overly complex or intriguing, but I still always enjoyed assigning my next perk point. The game gives you a considerable amount of freedom regarding your approach to the resolution of quests, but doesn\u2019t always provide an option to follow through with your unique ideas.\n\nImmersion comes by very quickly through the need to feed yourself and sleep regularly as well as following both local and historical customs. I maintain my assertion that this is as much of a simulation as it is an RPG. Aesthetically, the world passes as realistic to my eyes and has its moments where it manages to please visually, especially when the lighting falls just right.\n\nIts shortcomings in game design manage to drag down a promising foundation into an often frustrating experience that doesn\u2019t cease to annoy with an unfathomably stupid saving mechanic and the feeling of being set up to fail instead of to succeed. Its technical bugs are still glaring and frequent, but the worst part is that the game sometimes feels so broken that you\u2019re left unsure whether something is bugged or intended, essentially making you unable to play the game the way it was meant to.\n\nThis game can polarize like few others. If you\u2019re looking for an authentic medieval experience and bring the necessary patience to truly immerse yourself in it, as well as a leniency towards technical issues, this could well become your favourite game of all time. As more of a variety gamer myself, I could not see past its bugs and cumbersome design, and therefore got frustrated more often than I got delighted. I like the idea behind this game, but ultimately cannot recommend it.\n\n[b]Rating: 51/100[/b]\n\n[b]Video Review:[/b]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03bTN5JQywk&t", "timestamp_created": 1694812900, "timestamp_updated": 1694812900, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146358024": {"recommendationid": "146358024", "author": {"steamid": "76561199124414938", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1694736706}, "language": "english", "review": "Nobody will read my review, so I'll just say I'm gay\n", "timestamp_created": 1694810461, "timestamp_updated": 1694810461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481637567281723022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146355490": {"recommendationid": "146355490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844383341", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1698317736}, "language": "english", "review": "well if you like witcher 3, buy this game!", "timestamp_created": 1694807468, "timestamp_updated": 1694807468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146354712": {"recommendationid": "146354712", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997614312", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 16607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15907, "last_played": 1698705823}, "language": "english", "review": "Really immersive medieval rpg, these kinds of games are few and far between.", "timestamp_created": 1694806592, "timestamp_updated": 1694806592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146352067": {"recommendationid": "146352067", "author": {"steamid": "76561199267295684", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1697935270}, "language": "spanish", "review": "BUENISIMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO", "timestamp_created": 1694803515, "timestamp_updated": 1694803515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146351716": {"recommendationid": "146351716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030894452", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1534, "last_played": 1694804982}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply terms, this game sucks.

I've had it in my library for a year and never touched it, I can't believe how much I've enjoyed it so far. However, this game is like marmite, you either love it or hate it, and you will experience both when playing it. The combat is brutal in all sense of its meaning. It will mess you up and won't apologise for it, fighting one person is difficult let alone four bandits ambushing you at once in the forest. You really cant treat this game like any other, you're not invincible. Dying is increadibly harsh and consequential, the save system will take out back 20 minutes of progress if you mess up, which is great as it adds weight to your decisions and choices. The controls are clunky and what others have said regarding it is true; it will test your patience. Overall the game is a slow burner that requires thought and decision making. I'm amazed with the multiple ended options and possibilities for each quest. Some quests are even time dependent, meaning certain things happen in different ways depending on when you get to the person or mission.

The story is interesting enough but the main story line game play is soooooooooooo dry. Combat is interesting but feels clunky and I find it hard to have fun when I basically have to run away from 90% of fights because I have to press 1 a hundred times for Henry to pull his god damn sword out, Meanwhile the olympic sprinter with an axe of an enemy chased me down somehow even though I was full sprinting on my horse away from him for 3 minutes and 4 hits me despite having 4 arrows in his head and being hit by me 10+ times. I understand that it is probably a level and item gap but after 9 hours these are 90% of the enemies I run into still and there is no way of knowing how vast the gap is between you and your enemy until you try fight them, at which point you usually cant get away because they literally mow you down. I want to battle enemies not constantly run away from them because Its such a grind to get the smallest gain in terms of levels, money or gear to fight back with.

The combat isn't that great. There are some other annoying aspects and some parts are a bit janky. But there's nothing else really like it.\n\nAt the moment it's on sale for $7.50, which represents incredible value for money. Normally, I would say that the DLC for this game isn't all that appealing and that maybe you should skip it and stick to the main game. But on the other hand you can currently buy it with all DLC for $10, and at that price you might as well get it, since you might like one of the DLCs. At the current price, basically anyone should try it and see if they like it.\n\nThis game has several parts which are very special. For example, there's a quest (I don't want to spoil anything, but it's called \"A Needle in a Haystack\") which is the most interesting story contextualization for a stealth section that I've ever seen in any game. On the other hand, the section itself is also a little buggy and can be frustrating, so it's not perfect. But almost every modern game has bits that are buggy and frustrating. Almost no games have a section which is as interesting as this quest. The ways this game is good are special and unique.

Freeing in the sense that the game doesn't always railroad you into solutions of various quests. In fact, it's important to not focus too much on markers, as sometimes the solution lies in the dialogue, surroundings or texts that you find, and not just \"go there, do that\". I love most of the quests that this game presents.\n\nThe combat in this game suffers from a players' overfixation on UI, in my opinion. If you find the combat boring or slow, try either installing a mod that speeds up the animations or disable the UI. In that way, you'll find yourself less fixated on that green shield and be able to focus more on your opponents' actions. When I did so, it made me much better at one vs many situations, and I've enjoyed beating camps by proudly striding up to them rather than poisoning their food or using a bow. But beating the main mission camps is still very fun in stealth too.\n\nThe story, while basic, is good and in my opinion fits the style and theme of the game well. The intrigue and pretty good character development are what makes it fairly enjoyable for me.\n\nThe DLCs are great, as long as you treat them as just extra side quests rather than full-on expansions (save for one of them), and it wasn't much of an issue for me as I bought the game together with them pretty cheaply.\n\nI am going to replay the game again now on hardcore, with those super difficult combat mods, and make use of alchemy and poisons a lot more :p", "timestamp_created": 1694449698, "timestamp_updated": 1694449698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522727251052856445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146123170": {"recommendationid": "146123170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198861684611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2005, "last_played": 1694505845}, "language": "english", "review": "this game has a pretty good story, fun facts and cool looking Armour\n\nhowever, the locking mechanic is so bad, it makes fights against more than 1 enemy painful, I understand is is meant to be hard-core, but it's not hard-core if its just bad\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1694448759, "timestamp_updated": 1694448759, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634155035018920898", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146117154": {"recommendationid": "146117154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119287988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 1415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_at_review": 1407, "last_played": 1700393609}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't dislike this game, but I don't think I can recommend it to most people.

I don't know if they didn't test it or just couldn't be bothered to fix it.\nI am not using mods and have run 2 playthroughs - the second was better than the first but the combat is horrible - yes, the pundits can scream 'realism' - yeah, that's just janky for bad mechanics. I've played with mace and shield and then longsword - all levelled to max and it's still wickedly bad when you are faced with more than one foe, and yes, I had the proper perks.\nThe bows are horrible, here's a hint, just go kill sheep at the top gate of Rattay at night, once you have free roam there - rinse and repeat, I think this took maybe 4?nights work. Do this pretty much before you do anything else, cook the stolen meat and sell it each day. When you can finally get your hands on the Yew Longbow, it actually does some damage- the rest are as useful as a sunroof in a submarine.\nThe story in and of itself is not bad with some surprising twists; and getting Henry to grow in stature and learn to read etc wasn't too bad.\nNote on Nighthawk potions - if it's raining you can't see a damned thing.\nWorst quest imo - The Monastery; but if you don't do it right it affects rep stats.\nA really major quest - scouting the cuman/bandit camp - oh man, save save save - it's sooooooo buggy.\nThe map, the markers are unreliable - if you turn your head, stoop to pick herbs - you need to pull the map up again, you can be waaaay off course.\nThe save system - well frankly, it's garbage. The game autosaves, I can assure you, not anywhere you want it to - save potions are expensive, so try and find a 'sleep and save'; in some areas where those are not available and you can't use your inventory I had to use 'save and quit'. There are very few save files, you need to delete them as you go otherwise you are overwriting all the time - too bad if you need to go back a couple of hours.\nThe DLC's are 'meh' at best, the first part of \"A Woman's Lot' - quite interesting storywise, a bit too long in the dark...never played part 2 as I simply don't care what happens to Johanka.\nDid I care about the characters? Some of them sure, the bad guys ARE bad guys, that was amusing.\nThe ending is very weak, but I guess they did that so there's a Part 2 - I did not want to be forced however, into a silly dlc 2 minutes before you can ride off.\nOh and the dog - it's a nuisance most of the time - always in the doorways, here's a hint - tell it to 'stay' whenever you have to stop at an Inn or go inside a building, it's permanently standing in the doorway so you can't exit, that also stops the nightly howling. Trying to full stealth a bandit camp? Dog's howling/barking whatever......if I play thru for a 3rd run for some extra achievements, I doubt I'd pick it up, or make it stay at the mill permanently.\nOne last thing; I filled the chest in my parents home in Skalitz during the prologue - this is supposed to be a global chest - it is NOT - I had to sneak back something like 10 times to empty it and place the stuff at Rattay Mill.\n6/10 - bugs, bad combat, some very tedious 'activities'; don't buy the dlc's unless it comes in a sale as a package", "timestamp_created": 1694437603, "timestamp_updated": 1696289892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146111944": {"recommendationid": "146111944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296801158", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 22006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22006, "last_played": 1624526564}, "language": "english", "review": "Spent all my time robbing every village blind, killing monks, and seducing my lord's wife, and avoid getting caught because Im in a secret mission for Radzig.

It helps to be a huge nerd, but this game is genuinely great. I'm hesitant to give anything a 10/10, because nothing's perfect, but Kingdom Come gets really close.\n\nPros, and this is by no means an exhaustive list:\n\n- Very immersive.\n\n- Your character doesn't feel like he's the main character right off the bat, and you will have to put in a good amount of work to make him strong enough to take on particularly powerful enemies and/or multiple enemies.\n\n- You don't need the best gear if you're decent with the combat system, which does have a few shortcomings.\n\n- There's a decent amount of quality of life mods, and also some that restore cut systems (polearm skills, unarmed skills) or add a fair amount of perks (perkaholic).\n\nCons, also certainly not exhaustive, and these are gonna be wordy than the pros:\n\n- A lot of people say the combat system is awkward or janky, and I really can't fault them for it. It's good, in my opinion, but it's definitely a little clunky. Leg armor is not necessary because NPCs can't target your legs and will almost never hit them. You also can't target the legs of your enemies. Combos are good, but also totally unnecessary if you just wait for a master stroke which can one-tap or seriously injure enemies with exposed faces, because a common master stroke with one-handed weapons is just an uppercut directly to the face.\n\n- The saving system is pretty immersive, but I feel the schnapps/sleeping and quest autosaves should be reserved for hardcore where you're already playing it very safe and making sure to save. You can, and I have, lost hours of progress due to being mobbed and obliterated by 4 heavily armed and armored bandits early in your run. Thankfully, there is a mod to let you save anywhere, anytime if you're not into the vanilla game's system.\n\n- Texture LOD issues are common sometimes, but there's a modded config to fix it. Still, you might see ugly low-res textures or textures that pop out when they shouldn't.\n\nOverall, I think the game is great and there's not really a system that just outright has no use. Here's to hoping the sequel fixes at least most of the game's problems, because I'd love to see what could really be done with this setting.", "timestamp_created": 1694352622, "timestamp_updated": 1694352622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146052977": {"recommendationid": "146052977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077569926", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1888, "last_played": 1585687911}, "language": "english", "review": "It is an interesting concept, a game in a medieval setting that strives to be as realistic as possible for a video game and happily, it largely succeeds but it has a few downsides.

The soundtrack is nice and pleasant for the ear, too. Combat is controversial but once mastered it feels impactful and really rewarding when the course of battle is in your favour.

I didnt like  that it feels unfinished theres plenty of glitches , game crashes for  which i didnt found a solution. Or going to bed and getting a fine so your not using a torch ( you need to carry  lit  torch at nigh ) ive heard you shouldnt smoke in a bed but i guess you need a lit torch when your sleeping in  hay :D. Get ready to be stuck  in the bushes sticks walls fences with your horse or where you cant even finish a quest properly or simple wisual bugs like npc going thru walls or beying stuck mid air, or shooting your arrows thru someones arm pit and missing the target . Combat is terible and hard, at first your going to hate it or even hate it to the very end, btw bow at  first controls teribly but when your reach lvl 10ish it becomes very good.  Game doesnt tell you much  about  any of the stuff so you need to find out everything on your own . So you start a game  as a simple  peasant who cant do anything right and you need to put allot of hours   YES HOURS to learn something  like  fighting  brewing potions  horse riding etc. Whole story is long and intresting quests dont feel  repeatable so your constantly having fun . That beying said if you save allot because you can die easily and lose allot of your progress. This game took a diferent direction  from saving  not like other games you need to use saviour snaps to save game ( its expensive) or sleep in a bed, you cant just save anywhere you want . So the game takes around 110h to do a completionist run  doing all the  quests and stuff, well it takes allot less but since you cant save where you want to , you lose allot of progress and the hours rank up.For the achievement hunters out there take a special note on  CLERICS PET and FULL HOUSE SINNER achievements . i did a mistake and it  cost me about 15 hours. Hardcore run is around 30 hrs  long not going to get in much details of it iam sure your going to find out everything you need. Whole game took me 144hours . Trully fun good game just sadly a bad decition on saving function on it atleast thats my opinion .

The immersion is off the scale. This game will genuinely make you feel like you ARE Henry of Skalitz in 1403 Bohemia. There are some minor things about game I don't like though:\n- You cannot walk through small bushes... (this can be fixed with the bushes collision remover mod)\n- You cannot smith in the game even though you are the son of a blacksmith\n- The ending is a massive cliff hanger\n- No crosshair when using a bow makes aiming at a target more than 20 yards away very difficult (this can be fixed with the console command I have memorized at this point: wh_pl_showfirecursor 1)\n\nOther than those things, I love everything about the game... yes, even the combat. When you start this game you have to understand that you suck at everything. You're the son of a blacksmith. You don't know how to use a weapon, you don't know how to ride a horse, you don't know how to read, you don't know any of these things. You have to learn and get better. You cannot expect to just walk into a bandit camp and kill 5+ bandits when you first start the game. This isn't Skyrim, it's real. Even late in the game it is very difficult to fight more than 3 people at once, which makes sense because, again, this game is real. It doesn't matter how good you are, if you get surrounded by 3+ people who at least vaguely know what they're doing, you are going to get your ass handed to you. It is definitely possible to fight 3+ people at once, but you are going to be beat up afterwards.\n\nIf you are having trouble with the combat, you have to just git gud. In other words, play through the main story until you meet a man named Captain Bernard and keep playing until you are able to train with him. You will be able to train with him after completing the quest \"Ginger in a Pickle\" (I can't remember exactly, but I think you'll finish this quest about 4 hours into the game if you just focus on the main quests). Exhaust all the dialog options with this man until he teaches you everything he knows. Once you know how to master strike, feint, clinch, and perform combos, the combat will be MUCH easier than at the beginning of the game. Before you are able to train with Bernard, do not even attempt to fight more than 2 people, especially if they are armored. Just run. Remember: you start the game off sucking at everything.\n\nIn addition to learning to fight with Bernard, you need to be more creative about clearing out bandit camps other than just running in there like a dumbass. Kill as many as you can from a distance with a bow. Stealth kill some of them. Lure some away from the camp. Attack at night when most of them are sleeping. Do anything to reduce their numbers before you pull out your sword/mace/axe. Even killing just 1 bandit before the fight begins will make the fight much easier.\n\nAnother common complaint about this game is the save system. You can't save whenever you want, the game only saves when you complete a quest or sleep in an owned bed, or drink a savior schnapps (which is hard to get early on). There is a mod that allows you to save whenever you want, but I strongly suggest not getting this mod. I hated the saving system at first, but I grew to love it. It forces you to really think about the choices you make and forces you to be very careful when you try something risky or illegal. When you pull off that risky thing, it is so much more satisfying than in other games where you can just quicksave 1 second before you go on a killing spree or thieving spree.\n\nTL;DR: train with Captain Bernard and git gud.", "timestamp_created": 1694314852, "timestamp_updated": 1694314852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146023186": {"recommendationid": "146023186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167655533", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 386, "last_played": 1694861649}, "language": "english", "review": ":O", "timestamp_created": 1694311083, "timestamp_updated": 1694311083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146022419": {"recommendationid": "146022419", "author": {"steamid": "76561199012049856", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3458, "last_played": 1694481410}, "language": "english", "review": "Very hard, won't hold your hand at all.

It's really the best product for that purpose. The world and the buildings are incredibly believable and no other game has ever had that much effort put into its assets and level design.\n\nHowever, this alone doesn't qualify as a game in my book. \n\nThe character progression, one of, if not the core element of rpgs, has absolutely misguided pacing and is easily exploitable. Even without trying it takes only 10 to 20 hours to max out combat stats and equipment, while the game itself is said to last 100+ hours. Personally it took less than 10 hours to max my melee stats and get some plate armor, as well as some high quality weapon, but I meta- and powergame anyway, while spending the first few hours looking for way to break the systems. You can become a master fighter without ever having had a single lesson or real fight, as killing farm animals is plenty of training. Now I am just looking at the assets in the game, which are great, but also not flawless. The rest of the game doesn't really do anything either to compel the player to continue playing for that long. It's definitely one of the worst possible progression systems, just one step above the atrocity called Elex. Even the most basic progression systems that you can see in browser or flash games are more entertaining.\n\nThe combat system controls very poorly, has too many random, non skill based elements and fights tend to be either almost impossible to win with regular, non cheese attacks or a walk in the park. Most of the time, results in combat aren't the result of the player doing the rights things with the right timing in the right location, but simply the result of a calculation, whether your stats allow you to actually land an attack after the RNG rolled through the chance to evade, the chance of the npc to parry, the chance to do no damage, the chance of the npcs to do some special move etc. You can't even aim stab attacks and they will just hit a random part. If you get hit, you get the most ridiculous hit stun and camera shake imagineable and completely lose control for a second, likely getting comboed to death. On the other hand, the player can already one or twoshot most enemies in plate armor while only being halfway through the lackluster character progression. Towards the end, it's almost exclusively walking up to enemies and then oneshotting them. No need to bypass the enemies defences, as that is solved by RNG and the probability of them being able to defend is close to 0 when your stats are maxed out. \nAt not point does it feel that you win or lose a fight because of your ability. Compared to other games, like mount & blade or dark souls, the combat in kingdom come really has no redeeming qualities at all. \nThere is not enough space to explain everything in detail here, but there are videos that show everything that is wrong with the combat, which is especially noticeable when you compare it to the other games I have mentioned. Mount & Blade combat is just working way better in every regard and it's 100 % skill based. \nThe mount & blade single player loop is just repeating the same thing for dozens and hundreds of hours, but both the progression and the combat are so much fun it's a joy to do that. If you would replace that with the kingdom come progression and combat, I would quit the game after a couple of hours.\nThe solutions in kingdom come are inacceptable. \nAlso, combat is definitely not the focus in this product. It can take one to two hours between finding encounters, even while actively searching for fights. That's very polarizing by itself. \n\nThe exploration of the huge but effectivly empty world is tedious and unrewarding. The poor progression system also doesn't incite any wish to explore further. As stated before, visually it looks great and it's enjoyable to look at the castles, villages and all the other, believable assets they have created with great detail - but that is not exactly a game and more of a walkable model then.\n\nThe story is an overbearing prison of cutscenes with very little player agency and the plot is just your typical \"chosen ones hometown destroyed by evil\" trope. But that is highly subjective, as some people either have never seen that before, or enjoy the handholding and predictable plot. There are even some nice touches, allowing you to solve quests in different ways, but that also gets overshadowed by the quest pop ups and map marker gameplay that always tries to push the player in a certain direction, despite other options being possible. This lazy and uninspired system quest system sabotaged their own quest creators creative work. The story prison can be broken with some searching, which is punished by the game's save system and ultimately is of no consequence, because the plot is still on rails with no meaningful deviation.\nOutside of all the logic errors and the constant ludonarrative dissonance, it's possible to enjoy this as a cute interactive story. Again, not exactly a game. so another fail here. \n\nEverything you do in the game is slow and tedious. Picking plants takes forever. Entering dialogues has a black loading screen. Saving the game takes up resources and you will end up losing anywhere between 15 minutes to 2 or 3 hours of progress, simply because you were not allowed to save more often and the devs think it's okay to waste, in sum, hours of your time. The carry limit is sensible for this type of game, but effectively all it does is make you waste hours sifting through containers that are 95% pointless, yet might contain something you need. At least you can stop doing that after around 20 hours, because by then you almost don't need anything outside of quest items. But that is also one of the major reasons, why the exploration in this game is so unrewarding. \nAt the time of writing this, I have about 25 hours of actual gameplay in this playthrough. Spent quite a few hours looking at the architecture, but also lost a lot of hours to the save/load system in the beginning and also many many hours of trying to explore but finding nothing of value. My character is set for the rest of the game. Maybe there are some slightly better plate armors or so down the road and a weapon that oneshots enemies even harder, but really all that is left is a marathon of overly long conversations, cutscenes and handholding quests to ultimately take revenge for a bunch of npcs I have known for a few minutes and don't care about, yet are forced to play as if I do. \n\nThere are many more minor issues, but those are hardly worth mentioning in light of the fact, that in summary kingdom come fails thoroughly in all of the major aspects of an rpg: progression, combat, story and exploration.",

I got it for free on Epic and played through it once and then bought the royal edition again here on steam and am currently halfway through my second playthrough.\n\nPros:\n- Believable and immersive world. You are the son of a smith, so you are not skilled in combat and such. You even have to learn to read. \n- Interesting and accurate historical setting\n- Great and challenging combat, if it is a 1v1\n- Great characters (Hans & Peshek are my favourites, Pater Godwin, Hanush and Theresa are also all amazing)\n- Survival Elements that are immersive and don't force you to watch your vitals every couple of minutes, it is simply a tool to enhance immersion (needing food, rest, etc.)\n- Fun mini games like playing dice or tournaments\n- Good voice acting (both in german & english)\n- Mostly good story (I'll expand on that below)\n\nCons:\n- Combat against more than 1 opponent. You either have to resort to cheesing the fight or simply legging it. This is mainly due to the lock on camera, which doesn't work particularly well in this game\n- Combat Dogs are annoying as hell. Okay, great you manage to actually have the upper hand against 4 bandits, which is a challenge already. How about we throw a dog in a mix that completely stuns you for several seconds while fully depleting your stamina leaving you open to attacks from said bandits? Sounds fun, right? Oh you are wearing plate armour? Well, no problem for terminator dog over here.\n- Animations in dialogues are stiff, you basically see the same 4 to 5 animations all the time, lip sync is also often out of sync.\n- The saving system is not great. The game is already challenging and that is good! But having to drink a potion to save is just bad game design imo and doesn't add a fun challenge. I gain nothing by having to skip through dialogue again and rushing back to the same spot I was in, just because I didn't have enough saving potions. Fortunately, there is a mod that gives you unlimited saving.\n- The game has some jank like getting stuck in trees or your horse getting stuck on a tiny ledge\n- The story ends rather abruptly and the last 25% or so leave a lot to be desired\n\nAlthough the cons are a nuisance, they can either be fixed with some mods or aren't too gamebreaking that they take away too much from my enjoyment of the game. I appreciate the vision warhorse had and am looking forward to KC: D 2. I also hope that more developers will take the \"risk\" to develop a realistic RPG that isn't a fantasy RPG.

Nevertheless, there\u2019s a significant amount of jank that you need to accept to really enjoy it. I did not experience any game-breaking bugs, only minor inconveniences.\t\n\t\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\t\n[i]Rating:[/i]\tCasual\nThe combat system is unique and innovative. It takes some getting used to and can be brutally punishing at times. Very likely it could be a make or break dichotomy for you.\t\n\t\n[b]Audience[/b]\t\n[i]Rating:[/i]\tMature (Graphic & Sexual)\n\t\n[b]Story[/b]\t\n[i]Rating:[/i]\tMemorable\nSet in medieval Bohemia it mixes an original story with historical settings and characters. There is an absolute wealth of information and historical accuracy that will delight anyone with an interest in such things but also has a lot to offer for the casual player.\t\n\t\n[b]Replay Value[/b]\t\n[i]Rating:[/i]\tLow\nYou could sink quite a lot of time in to a single playthrough, and/or simply enjoy the medieval sandbox but one playthough is satisfying. I had little desire to do it all over again attempting a different build. There are only limited deviations possible from the main storyline.\t\n\t\n[b]Aesthetics[/b]\t\n[i]Rating:[/i]\tBeautiful\nThis game has possibly the most beautiful forest and countryside depictions of any game ever. Coupled with historically accurate town and castle designs there was never a point that I couldn\u2019t stop and stare in awe.\t\n\t\n[b]Audio Design[/b]\t\n[i]Rating:[/i]\tStrong\nI would only criticise the lack of diversity in the combat music.

A pesar de los combos que se introducen, es demasiado tosco y lo cierto es que hubiese preferido un combate similar al de Skyrim que, aunque no sea lo m\u00e1s realista del mundo, no se asemeja tanto a un juego de ventajas como antes he comentado. Ha habido combates en los que he tardado media hora en derrotar a un oponente que no se debilitaba a penas dado que iba bien pertrechado con una generosa armadura. \n- El excesivo realismo a la hora de ir de un punto A a un punto B hacen que se convierta en un juego de progresi\u00f3n muy lenta. Est\u00e1 bien apostar por el realismo pero no por ello hay que aburrir al jugador. En relaci\u00f3n a esto, est\u00e1 muy bien que haya que comer (vigilando el estado de la comida), beber, dormir, etc\u00e9tera; pero, por muy realista que aparente ser este juego, y por mucha carne seca que he comido, no he contra\u00eddo la enfermedad de la gota. \n- La historia me parece insulsa y con un final abrupto: parece que se quedaron sin presupuesto para plantear un mejor final. Adem\u00e1s, aunque el trasfondo hist\u00f3rico es bueno, no deja de ser la historia de siempre: gobernantes est\u00fapidos toman decisiones est\u00fapidas que desembocan en guerras est\u00fapidas. \n- Los DLCs no aportan nada al conjunto global y hubiese sido mejor que Warhorse hubiese dedicado el presupuesto de estas expansiones a pulir los detalles anteriormente citados. \n- El downgrade que se aprecia respecto a la beta del juego. \n\nPor estas cuestiones no puedo recomendar este juego a todo el mundo. \n", "timestamp_created": 1693866892, "timestamp_updated": 1693866892, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145679425": {"recommendationid": "145679425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198871491110", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4541, "last_played": 1694658965}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Podes sexo 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1693866459, "timestamp_updated": 1693866459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145675987": {"recommendationid": "145675987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036931863", "num_games_owned": 687, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1695876360}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed the game for a while.

"review": "This is a game FOR those who want to: \nHave a life changing experience that is not afraid to throw the weight of the world onto you and your emotions. \nImmerse yourself in the world of medieval Bohemia. \nUnderstand that you are the equivalent of any side character or even NPC - until you make yourself the main character.\nEmbrace your character and take full responsibility for training every bit of him and sculpting to your play style. \nPractice skills and obtain satisfaction in working your way up from nothing. \nWant to navigate combat in a complicated manner that involves more than just brainless left clicking.\nGet lost in another world and another time where life was simpler... yet still just as complex. \nNotice small details and world building that is true to real life - whether it is geographical location or medieval living. \nFor those who can suspend their disbelief regarding some of janky nature of NPC's that come with a developers first game. (Although I must say they did an amazing job nonetheless). \nFor those who enjoy the world for what it is, rather than just speeding through the main story as fast as possible. \nFor those who can take a look at the layout of a village and see everything from the layout of the village, distribution of classes, all the way to the strategically placed compost piles. \nFor those who want to choose whether they are a respectful and honorable character, or an absolute psychopath (with many grey lines in between). \nFor those who appreciate nature (the woods) and also appreciate historical accuracy regarding buildings, they depth of wilderness in terms of elevation changes and vast distances. \nFor those who would rather travel the world and journey on foot or by horse and experience the world firsthand and all of the benefits that come with it.  \nFor those who do not mind the welcome embrace of living life through a set of medieval eyes - not special in any regard - only as special as you are and you make it to be. No superpowers, no advantages upon other characters other than those that you choose to earn while you play. \nFor those who enjoy and find comedy and humor in Life. \nFor those who like to see hidden subtle references to other great games. \n\nThis game is NOT for those who: \nAre not strong-willed and determined. \nHave a weak heart. \nLike to fast travel around the world every three seconds - missing all the beauty within it. (although fast travel is an option). \nWant to immediately be all powerful and twirl the world around their finger. \nWant to have everything handed to them on a silver platter without earning it. \nWant a short and shallow storytelling movie. \nWant a short high action packed match (like COD match or similar). \nWant a far fetched fantasy experience (unrealistic magic... creatures, blah blah blah). \n\n\nIn summary: \nYou may obtain this masterpiece, play a little bit, and put it down. You may be hooked for good right away. \nEither way - WHEN you come back to it - you will have accepted that you are choosing to go back to a time and place - an escape - where you can ensure to be lost in a beautiful yet unrelenting world. A world that does not go to great fantastical lengths to overemphasize the horrors of war and what it brings - it just hits the nail on the head. The bloodiest battle can rage on the most beautiful fields and forests you have ever seen. You will not escape the feeling of horror and awe watching thousands of flame bound torches leeching over the hills as towns burn and people scream. \n\nAll in all - definitely recommend this one to anyone who does not mind getting lost in another world for hours - not even considering the many side quests, main story quests, world activities, and DLC quests and activities.  \n\nSupport these devs - hopefully they make another one just like this one. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1693739507, "timestamp_updated": 1693739507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145582758": {"recommendationid": "145582758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160780905", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 10439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7098, "last_played": 1696908280}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate Jews", "timestamp_created": 1693735770, "timestamp_updated": 1693735770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925341129302979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145582731": {"recommendationid": "145582731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028128758", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6838, "last_played": 1693731826}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of the best rpg's out there", "timestamp_created": 1693735733, "timestamp_updated": 1693735733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145573080": {"recommendationid": "145573080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027743541", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7215, "last_played": 1696878039}, "language": "english", "review": "KCD is one the best realistic medieval games in my opinion.

Next time you remember not to rush it, and after fierce combat that's more than just clicking a mouse, you emerge victorious! Alchemy is done by hand, literally, and requires you to follow instructions. Your actions do have some effect on certain things. Also you can kill a lot of folks that are important for some quests, automatically forfeitting those quests. That's not always a bad thing, for example, you can kill certain person and save yourself a lot of time that you would have to spend on detective work. \n\nMy 159 hours have 3 playthroughs: \nFirst time I tried to be nice and played almost all additional quests, it was probably the longest and took what 80 hours.\nSecond time I had watched Helical's playthrough and left Skalitz as a level 12 murdering maniac. \nThird was Hardcore Henry run (with all negative perks) and it was easily the best run.

As someone with diverse hobbies like gaming, manga, anime, and 3D modelling, my expectations for an engaging and immersive experience were not met.\n\nOne of the most notable drawbacks of Kingdom Come: Deliverance is its length and tedium. The game's extensive game-play can easily become overwhelming, making it difficult to stay engaged. Furthermore, the limited saving mechanics, which require the use of Savior schnapps, add an unnecessary layer of frustration. This restriction on saving progress seems counter-intuitive, often leading to undue stress and repetitive tasks.\n\nAiming the bow is another aspect that detracts from the enjoyment of the game. As someone who appreciates the intricacies of digital worlds, I found the bow mechanics to be needlessly challenging. This design choice can easily deter players from fully enjoying the archery aspect of the game.\n\nIn comparison to titles like Elder Scrolls Online, Kingdom Come: Deliverance falls short in delivering a captivating and immersive experience. Elder Scrolls Online manages to strike a better balance between engaging game-play and a rich open-world environment.\n\nIn conclusion, Kingdom Come: Deliverance might not be the ideal choice for gamers seeking an enjoyable and immersive experience. The game's length, limited saving mechanics, including the use of Savior schnapps, and challenging bow aiming mechanics contribute to a less-than-stellar gaming experience. Players searching for a more satisfying and well-rounded adventure might find alternatives such as Elder Scrolls Online to be a more suitable choice.", "timestamp_created": 1693324987, "timestamp_updated": 1693325311, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428410142660140991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145266018": {"recommendationid": "145266018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288792646", "num_games_owned": 1291, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 4061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4061, "last_played": 1693238662}, "language": "english", "review": "Immersive & clunky", "timestamp_created": 1693322875, "timestamp_updated": 1693322875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702062129974365234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145265911": {"recommendationid": "145265911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389307018", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 788, "last_played": 1694329709}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to have some of realistic Medieval experiences, Try this game FR!", "timestamp_created": 1693322773, "timestamp_updated": 1693322773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145259356": {"recommendationid": "145259356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059340758", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 37078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 500, "playtime_at_review": 15770, "last_played": 1700591901}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent role-playing game, strong all around\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n- Excellent graphics\n- Nice cinematics\n- Good ambient and sounds\n- Good questing\n- Good leveling\n- Many objects of each kind (weapons, clothes, food, ...)\n- Very immersive and rather addictive\n- A few bugs here and there\n\n[b]Bads[/b]\n- Fight mechanics not that funny and may feel difficult to master\n- Can be a bit repetitive at times\n\nThis game is really awesome, especially if you love medieval times and rpg.

It's not perfect but I find the discrepancies to be minor. My first play through was a disaster because I fell for the impression everything is time dependant and rushed from one quest to the next. The save system, needing to drink an expensive potion, coupled with the number of bugs was also an issue.\n\nMy second play through has been a joy so far due to two key changes on my part. First, I grabbed a list of quest names that actually do have a timed component so I know when I can take a break and just explore. Right after the prologue I ended up leaving Radzig hanging and just did some side quests, poaching, herb gathering, alchemy and cow tipping (just punch cows when nobody is looking to level up strength). Practice makes perfect and Henry's stats are really bad at the outset. Getting him skilled up and making some Groshen at the same time makes a world of difference. Of course combat is nigh on impossible in the beginning so get your strength up and murder bandits in their sleep or run away. Combat gets easier with good stats and gear, train with Robard!\n\nThe second thing was alchemy. I knew the recipe for Saviour Schnapps (the save potion) from my first play through and you don't need to be able to read to make it. Add the components from your inventory and make it. There is a great patch of Belladonna west of the mill, over the river near a bandit camp. Good hunting too. Get your strength up and sneak into the camp at 1am, stealth take downs and finish them off. Don't forget the chest. You now have a little poachers camp. Making a stack of potions is profitable, ranks up herbalism, alchemy and, if you have the \"leg day\" perk, strength.

So I'm bidding KC:D farewell for now.\n\nThe sentiment I just expressed in that first paragraph really encapsulates my overall thoughts on the game as a whole. At times it's brilliant, and there really isn't anything quite like it if you want to fully immerse yourself in a medieval world. Without a doubt, to fully experience everything, including the DLC, this is hundreds of hours of gameplay, and probably at least two or three different character styles. There are so many things this game does well, and that's worth something. But it's also exhausting, both in its sometimes accidental difficulty and its commitment to realism, and at a certain point the quest formulas become very repetitive. By the end, I found myself barreling through forests on my horse at top speed, not caring if it was the right route per se, but because it was the direction I needed to go and all I could think about was getting there and being done.\n\nI stand by my recommendation. You should definitely play this game if you enjoy open world RPGs of any kind, or if you have a fondness for medieval history. If you fall in both categories, you may have one of your very favorite games of all time here. For me, it's good but falls short of greatness.

I rarely give up on a game, but this is it for me.\n\nA lot of people mention combat. It's a mess, but it's also original and rewarding if you get it right. But it is an absolute mess and should be reworked. But really, the main issue is that the game just gets incredibly boring and that it does not respect your time. There are loading screens everywhere, half of the gameplay is just staring at the fast travel or sleep screen.\n\nI have very high hopes for a sequel however. It's clear that Warhorse did something interesting, novel, and special here. It's just that they failed at making the core gameplay good, engaging and rewarding as the story and character progress.

It pulled me away from Elden Ring and Witcher (still great games mind you). You start as a worthless good for nothing punk kid named Henry who can't fight his way out of a paper bag. Deal with it and learn to get better. Sort of like real life.\n\nCombat matches Dark Souls so train or run away. BTW, that is 40% of the game. The rest is exploring amazing landscapes, investigations, talking, etc.\n\nThe cut scene of debauchery with the priest and two women gives a realistic take about the good parts of medieval life. Most stories make it seem that it was depressing 100% of the time.\n\nGreat focus on History with learning documentation that you can skip if you don't care. \n\nGritty examples of why I love this game: \n\n(1) I casually went up and down a ladder and fell because I wasn't paying attention. I was bleeding and didn't have enough bandages. I spent an hour trying to buy/find bandages and was lacking in just one more bandage to plug it all up. After 15 minutes of gaming I bled out and died lol \n\n(2) After some training I figured I could beat the Captain of the Guard. In most games I would have beaten him. In this game he beat me down to a crying whelp\n\n(3) You have to be careful where you sell stolen goods or you get called on it and even jailed.\n\n(4) Speaking of jail I spent a week in jail and all of  my fresh food spoiled. When did that last happen in a video game?\nOh, and to further punch me in the face something bad happened and then a fire started in the jailhouse and I died. I mean, once was awesome to see that grittiness so I'm okay with dying like that.\n\n(5) Saving is possible but not easy like in most games. They want you to live with your choices which I appreciate.\n\n(6) Murder hobos will flip the table. Button mashers will weep in frustration.\n\n(7) You need patience and perseverance for this game. Unlike most games victories are huge highs in this game especially for combat.\n\n(8) The narrative and characters in this game are good to amazing. Minority of mediocre characters and cut scenes.\n\n(9) There are achievements for becoming a drunk, staying a virgin and becoming a monk. \n\n(10) Some homes are private and people kick you out. They might even attack you. Reminds me of Gothic 1 and 2.

You will, even with experience, get absolutely dunked on if you misjudge your opponent.\n-Some things are a little bit... janky. Lots of clipping, broken animations, ragdolls bugging out or models exploding is rare but definitely present, weird NPC behaviours... People in cutscenes have very bland emotional range in their faces and animations, however *most* of the voice acting is genuinely pretty good with some exceptions. Good few weird glitches that broke quests, but the quest itself was still fixable by reaching waypoint so no fuss there. Nothing game-breaking as of yet.\n-The game has guards like in Oblivion that run up and start shouting at you outta nowhere because you punched a chicken in a farm in the middle of absolutely nowhere a month ago and you returned to the area. \n-Historical accuracy is pretty good, but there are a few creative liberties with that accuracy here and there, which is acceptable but I would have liked to have a little more of a hardcore history simulator.\n-Bows are absolutely awful to use, which is great actually for realism, but REALLY bad for gameplay.\n-You can't buy or store polearms like a Halberd.\n\nIts a 9/10. The cons don't detract much from the experience, and some of the glitches are pretty damn funny. If you wanna go for a walk in a European forest, accidentally get into an immesive 1v6 swordfight with Cuman mercenaries, and get your balls fed to you while they scream at you in a language you don't understand, this is the game for you.\n\nSave system sucks donkey balls though.

You have 4 weapon types, sword, axes, maces and bow. Clearly only the sword was favored since the mace/axe only has 3 skills compared to it. But in the end those skills are useless because mid game the enemies will block/parry you or get gangbanged before you can even finish a skill most of the time and the best weapon is the bow anyway [spoiler] and mace because midlate game are weak to blunt [/spoiler]\n\nGraphics is good no doubt, and I would have enjoyed travelling more if not for the bushes and trees, god I hate the bushes and trees\n\nThis game is also littered with bugs here and there but nothing game-breaking fortunately, some are funny at best.

Sadly I can only recommend this game to people who are fans of the medieval times because as simulators are: it's not for everybody. \n\nOverall 7/10\n\npros:\n+gorgeous landscapes\n+extremely well researched and detailed world. Be it history, culture, combat, politics: gamers who are into medieval history will have everything they wanted\n+interesting story and good quests\n+a very good \"medieval life\" simulator, you'll have to eat, sleep, repair your armor and wash yourself regulary (so people don't think that you're a bandit)\n\nneutral:\no VERY realistic and unforgiving combatwise. When you start the game, you are nothing and you will just like that die in almost all combats. You will have to train and get better gear to survive and, at least in the first few hours, try to avoid ambushs\n\ncons:\n- the player dives deep into the life of that time, which means there's plenty of complex politics involved. For people who don't know anything about that era it may become confusing and boring pretty fast\n- you can only save by sleeping, finishing an important quest, drinking an expensive beverage or quitting the game, which will sooner or later force you to replay bigger chunks of a mission because you forgot to save or simply couldnt\n- the beginning is pretty slow and can be tedious for some\n\nand now to the biggest flaw: the combat. THE COMBAT IS AWFUL, thanks to two absolutely terrible mechanics:\n- Fights against crowds are hell. You can always only focus one enemy and fight against him and that's okay in a duel, but a nightmare once you fight against multiple enemies. Keep in mind that this game strives for realism, that means that enemies wont attack you one by one, they will instead always try to gank you and that will often be your death. \"But that's alright, its realistic!\" you might say, but even in real life you can handle multiple enemies WAY better than here because if somebody attacks you from the side you can look to the side and block. In the game though, youll have to focus him first and then act, which is pretty much always too late already. Games like f.e. Mount&Blade or Mordhau handle this way better\n- Master Strikes. Why the hell did they implement Master Strikes. It's basically a countermove, you block an incoming strike completely and at the same time strike back. But the thing is: IT'S UNBLOCKABLE.\nSo no matter how good you are, npc enemies will always here and there land hits on you that you can't block, ever. The more often you hit them, the more often they get the chance to master strike you. And you know what? The game WANTS you to hit them often because there's a combo system! Yes, there's different attack directions and if you manage to land a combo, you get a special attack! Sounds cool right? Well bad luck, these combos only work like 20% of the time because enemies can either a) perfect block (doesnt make you loose stamina) them and interrupt the combo or b) master strike you and interrupt the combo. So whats left to do? Master Strikes. That's right. Once you've found out how they work that's all you do for the rest of the game: wait until the enemy strikes, master strike him with your unblockable attack, repeat. This way you kill him and since you never attack he'll never get a chance to master strike you. Good job Warhorse, you built a complex combat system based on true, historical sword fight with a dodge, counter and combo system and you destroy it with one ridiculously op mechanic.\n\nSo can I recommend this game? \nTo people who are absolute fans of the medieval era or medieval history: yes. \nTo everybody else who just wants some cool medieval game: no.\n\nGreat game, but only something for dark age enthusiasts", "timestamp_created": 1692731909, "timestamp_updated": 1692731909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144809739": {"recommendationid": "144809739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289623076", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6016, "last_played": 1694135016}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible game.

It is quite long and there is one quest in particular where you are in a monastery and it could very easily scare off people from finishing the game with how tedious it can feel. However, there is a ton of side quest content to be found and most of it is high quality and interesting. There is however a clear quality over quantity approach, as the world is not particularly huge but it does feel full and fleshed out in spite of that. It is also a purely historical setting, so being able to get a view back into the late middle ages is great for those who love history. There is also a relatively small set of main characters, but they all feel like they get the appropriate screen time and none of them feel unnecessary or uninteresting. \n\nThere are some flaws. It is very performance intensive even on high end hardware and FPS also noticeably drops as you play, requiring periodic restarts. The skill tree also has a lot of useless skill point picks, and some skills, such as speech, lockpicking, warfare, maintenance and herbalism, take absurd amounts of time to level. Other skills like hunting and drinking have little practical use. There are also some timed quests that lack any real indication they are time limited. In terms of bugs, I have never encountered anything gamebreaking, but there are some small immersion breaking things like armor clipping through clothes. The animations and dialogue system can also feel very janky and unpolished at times, and voice lines from the same character are often clearly recorded on different microphones, with audio levels all over the place.\n\nOf course you can't mention this game without talking about the combat system. When I first played KCD I had a tough time with it, as it really requires you to put in time to train up your skills with Captain Bernard before you go off into the world to slay bandits and Cumans. You absolutely need to learn the perfect block and master strike or you will have a bad time. However, it is not without flaw, as group fights tend to be a nightmare, and not in the sense of \"this is difficult\", which would be realistic, but rather the combat system just isn't designed for group fights. Switching between targets is clunky and trying to get away just ends up with you getting vacuumed into the enemy group by janky grab animations. You can absolutely win every group fight, but it is frustrating and worth avoiding when possible. You will inevitably end up stun locked out of making your own attacks, as getting hit cancels swings, so the only way to win is by backing up and repeatedly master striking for minutes until victory, all while your armor durability evaporates. Another issue is peasants wearing rags tend to somehow be master swordsmen who can parry and master strike even a max level Henry. However, in one on one fights, such as tournaments, the combat system shines really well.\n\nI'd strongly recommend grabbing the game on sale, but not setting your expectations amazingly high.

that killed my hype for any game release, first game ever I had to use cheat engine to fix broken quests and other issues, the game I hated and wanted to totally abandon and forgot at some point... only to come back after years having one of best \"openworld\" medieval RPG experience ever.\n\nSince first trailer I was totally hyped, as long years Warband and RPG player that is interested in medieval history (in particular of my own country and this era) this game was clear choice so i bought it at release with little hesitation.. which was.. bad. \n\nI swear this had to be one of most broken releases ever (only F:NV or Gothic 3 comes to mind as comparable). Many technical issues and bugs, broken physics like falling through world (or in opposite fly  above), being stuck in arenas or doors, not spawned quest items, quest NPC that can not be interacted... First time I was really forced find and use cheat console to try fix something  as possible, but together with limited save system i kept losing progress and constant repeating of whole game days (and real hours) exhausted me totally.. Came back at Woman lot release and it was similar experience.. alltogether I had like 150 hours in the game I could mark as \"wasted\" and if there would be any chance for refund I would use it. All Game director boasting that hugely criticized Skyrim for bugs (and many game small issues that btw Kingdom come repeat and the same) sounded to me like arrogant joke and bubbling (and frankly it is to some degree but nvm)\n\nLuckily I tend to forget the bad things so now in 2023 I gave the game another chance... and so glad I did. Is the game totally bugfree? Hell no. But everything major was polished enough it is like different game completely. Sure there are still some bugs and glitches but if blocking progress I always googled sufficient  workaround in short time. Only things that troubled me were FPS drops and few crashes - guessing the game  optimalization is still not perfect and cant be fixed now.\n\nSo beside technical shape what the game has to offer, what is good and bad in it?\n\nI start with the good points. Game has unprecedented amount of historical accuracy and immersion for an  PC game. I was slightly annoyed it take very nationalist description of events (in particular in Sigismund person), but you can not force anyone to take one historian over other and the dedication dev team made is astonishing. This include various game activities, people behaviour and location reconstruction. I have wandered  the land and visited all castles (or their ruins) in real and it is really amazing how close they came, really can imagine things were like this (or close to it)\n\nThe writing of the quests and story is among top in RPG genre. I already praise very high good written stories but the difference here is it dont exactly make deep philosophical speeches or Ideas, complicated plot and twists or major decisions... but instead all stay more real, \"human\", sometime simple, sometime hilarious but above all it has sense of realism, things people would really say, how they act, what was their interest and issues at the time.\n\nI like most game mechanics, like thievery/crime, picklock, or stealing, hunt, alchemy, reading, overall the skill and character progress and learning curve... I have some caveat with economy and combination with random encounters - those spawn at predefined spots all over the map and if you dont rely on fast travel (i almsot ignored it - it take like 3x more game time to reach the destination this way) you will recognize those spots by heart in time (not to mention bandit groups tend to put some obstacle in the way which make it more clear) - what is bad those spots are reseted immediately without any timer so more than once you find new encounter at place you fought different few mins ago - I and even situation where I rode horse bit far away from pursuing bandits, step down with the bow and decision to come back - only to found the cell reseted and they were gone, but new different group on their place. Often there are group fights eg. between bandits and guardsmen too. This system work pretty much against the rest of the game - sole amount of encounters and enemies I killed this way is nonsense (it would make more than real population of game villages together) and their spawning and disappearing from/into void dont make any good. Connected with loot it make whole game economy irrelevant though - you get top tier equipment like nothing and have abundant things to sell, with actually very little to use the profit (as you can ignore buying any gear - either get it from encounters or quest rewards). Similar one has to ask why people in game are begging for few groschen if traders pay good money for ordinary flowers like nettles that can be found everywhere. Also hunted animals are quite overvalued with one boar meat worth like plate armor piece if not more (in theory it is illegal in game but there are not any active huntsmens to stop you and meat lose mark of stolen goods in no time)\n \nWhat stay probably worst as game mechanic goes is melee combat. In my eyes it has very little with realism beside very accurate animations. The problem is that all combos and tactic comes into vain due perfect block/master strike mechanic which is simple QTE that is vastly abused by most enemies and player alike. So one has to ask where those looters that took weapons to hand for first time  learn such things? Basically it means regular attacks and combos are punished because of this as it make very easy defensive damage and kill any opponents (or the player.. so if you go against enemies with swings and combos you are punished for that and eg. in arena the right way is stay on passive defense and just succeed in master strikers.. or keep running into enemy for clinch following by free attack). It is simply bad and break any immersion one have initially from combat.\n\nGroup combat making most of the game is even worse with terrible messy camera focus, target locks, enemies coming over each other.. it feels very junky and glitchy. \n\nAlso armor is quite irrelvant in stamina system - out of stamina = you take major damage from any weapon (hence that few villagers quickly beats you with their blunt home made because every hit take you stamina and once you are at zero you lose all health in short time too).\n\nActually I had no issue deal with most groups in the game after a while but I am far away from consider the combat system any good. I enjoyed some duels until all came down to master strikes from both sides but overall it failed to be fun - quite sad in game that has combat as major part of gameplay.\n\nLuckily the rest of game stands for it and I enjoyed it a lot, even considering hardcore replay. \n\nSolid 8/10 game in 2023 but I will be way more careful prior rush buy KCD2 (that will be hopefully announced soon) - though if the devs took their lessons it can be nice surprise.\n", "timestamp_created": 1692441057, "timestamp_updated": 1692454509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144553702": {"recommendationid": "144553702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077299112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3878, "last_played": 1692440685}, "language": "english", "review": "What to say?

a lot of details and features that i really like, for example you have a higher chance of persuading a noble if you are wearing fancy clothes and a lower chance of persuading a peasant with the same clothes. and unlike other games, speech is a very useful skill you will use alot. i also really like the leveling system, none of the skills are useless and it takes some time and effort to level them up so its very rewarding when you get a skill point. almost all the perks you can unlock have a lot of use so none of them are a waste of a skill point. they also dont have a skill tree so you dont need to unlock one perk to get another. the story is also very detailed and makes you feel for the characters.\n\nthis game does have a good sum of downsides that i must mention\nthe combat system is very difficult and if your fighting multiple people it seems impossible. but the combat system also isnt impossible, and luckily there is training very early on in the game so you can eventually get used to it and have a chance of fighting enemies. there is also very little rewards for completing quests, and if there is a reward its usually just some coin. theres no special armor you get or cool weapon like in other medieval games, which i guess adds realism but it also makes quests a lot less rewarding and really impacts the will to complete more quests. speaking of quests, there is a lot where you go to a town and just talk to people which can be boring sometimes. there is a lack of customization aswell, a lot of the armor and clothing cannot be bought and you have to murder some random town guard if you want a simple helmet to complete your look. the manual saving system also kind of sucks in my opinion, you have to buy a drink to save your game witch also makes you drunk, the drink is also very expensive so if you want to save your game manually you have to spend half of your earnings from a quest to purchase a drink.\n\ni know i said a lot of negatives but this game still is very good and even if the combat system is hard it still is rewarding when you get your kill. get this game if you like challenging objectives and rpg's.", "timestamp_created": 1692223756,

It's very detailed and I have found myself playing it for hours may times. (I have played it on PS4 and logged thousands of hours there playing since release)\nCombat: this can take some getting use to because YOU the player need to practice as much as the protagonist does. Particularly if doing hardcore mode. This game uses a format I have not encountered before and can take some getting use to. Use Bernard! And pick off foes until you have one left to mess with and work on your combat as you get better you can push it more.  I do like this format though.\nStealth/ crime: This is easy enough to level and there are several perks to assist with stealth effectiveness but not to the level of crouching in combat to hide. Stealth tactics will necessitate you to plan some of your heists or other covert activities.  If you are caught there is a chance to surrender and penalties vary based on the crime - you also can flee and return when the law forgets. However the guy you mugged is likely to hate you and either run from you or attack you going forward\nPlayer choice: I feel there is a lot of choice for this game,  and that the choices matter (see above). You can impact you relationship with NPCs / if a vendor will talk to you and if you pay attention to the clues or NPC lines in a quest you can find a new path in the quest not marked by a quest marker. \n\nIs there anything I would change ask for?  Yes. The sequel please!  I look forward to seeing the next chapter with all the time they've had to refine their work and build on what they made with KCD. I also want to continue with Henry's story\n\nForm a more critical point I would like the sort-of-quest with Antonia's spouse to be finished! It feels like there should have been another option or at least dialogue line... Also there are no quest markers for it. You need to do it. I would also like Henry to be a little less obsessed with the sword at the end of the game.  \n\nI would also say the game in general runs much better on PC than console.

It would be one thing if it were just sneaking around, no problem, but \"god's holy hat\" there is so much inane WAITING. Waiting mixed with bugs, so if you're a minute late to Mass, IT'S THE JAIL FOR YOU. \n\nThe rest of the game is build up build up build up.... for..... nothing. I did quite a few of the side quests, not all, so maybe I'm missing something. But going through the Main quest line was like pulling glass shards out of my arsehole, hoping one day I could fight the big baddie, reclaim my sword, marry whatsherface, and become a lord or something. {game laughs in main quest}\n\nIt's an RPG, with some open world elements.

Some would not complete, others jump across steps, others yet have you stuck until you randomly stumble upon a misplaced clue. We are not talking one or two bugged side quests here - a good quarter of quests are bugged to at least a noticeable degree, including two chapters of the main quest.\n\nThe second reason not to play this is the amount of anti-game mechanisms forced down the player's throat. Open doors that lead to restricted areas withotu the player knowing, and subsequently getting slapped by guards. Your dog getting in the way of every herb you want to pick up, already a painful task without the stupid dog because of how small herb hitboxes are. Inaccurate bows, no matter how much you level archery. People noticing your crimes when nobody could physically notice them (on the other hand, the crime system can be exploited to Morrowind-levels of ridiculousness if you are into free money). Limited saves materialized by potions that take up space in your limited inventory. Impractical fast travel. And the worst of all, random encounters where half a dozen bandits suddenly jump you, during impractical fast travel, when your last save potion was already spent one hour ago.\n\nThere are of course qualities to the game, such as its historical setting, some side quests that dig quite deep in life at that period of time, and the primary quest that is quite well thought out when it does not lose itself in bugs.

If you are fighting with more than 1 opponent, which is ALWAYS, switching between them is a nightmare. It is so garbage that when you try to turn around and run, the game twists your neck, breaking your spine, forcing you to face them again leading to absolute chaos made worse by the aforementioned camera nonsense.\n\nAs usual with such RPG's, there's a plethora of \"what the fuck are you doing?\" NPC moments, usually revolving around guards who attack you for no reason, because for example you were in a private space, then left it, but the NPC's brain didn't register that. One time I got locked inside of a room by the guy I went to talk to... I had to wait for him to wake up because they say \"fuck off, let me sleep!\" if you try to interact with them... And then I had to glitch through the door as he was going through it because otherwise he'd lock me there with no way out for another day.\n\nThe \"savior schnaps\" ninkompup nonsense is one of the many reasons why mods are absolutely vital to fix essential issues with the intentional game design. Not only is it disrespectful to the player, it also does a lot to ruin the immersion to find \"save\" potions littered around, or having to buy them.\n\nI recommend getting unlimited inventory mod while you are at it. It is a far more pleasant, seamless experience - something that Gothic did right. If a game wants a \"realistic\" mechanic, it better make damn sure it's realistic enough to justify it, as in give me a squire with a wagon that I can send off on an errand to sell all the junk I just looted from that bandit camp.\n\nThe game also features the most infuriating archery imaginable. Even as a total newb irl you'd NEVER shoot this poorly, and this infuriatingly slowly, with this atrocious horizontal slide. The arrow should point at the target the moment you nook it, and stay straight until you release it, which should take the least amount of time necessary, not this slow, labored actions that feels like you are ripping a tendon out of the entire length of your arm.\n\nOverall, it is entirely too slow and junky to really enjoy it. For patient history enthusiasts only.\n\nI really liked The Woman's Lot DLC though. I wish someone made a game where you play as a woman in a medieval society with all of what that entails.\n\nThe dog is also infuriating, btw. Constantly gets in the way. Every time you loot or pick herbs he jumps at your feet, and since his hitbox is so huge you'll enjoy unintentionally opening and then closing dialog with your dog hundreds of times.\nReally wish the dog's actions were tied to keybinds with no dialog, and that he only did what you told him to, that there was a whistle to make him go to where you point, that he could distract people to help with thieving or to lure them away from a camp.\n\nAlso, make sure to get the 'first person herb picking' mod. For a game that irrationaly disallows third person camera despite literally having the entire model in first person, it is realy annoying how they've done the herb picking animation.\n\nIt's also a little disappointing how many things that should have been animated are just black screens, and also how some characters that are named in spoken dialogue and quest descriptions... do not have names given in the game.

This is a superb story peppered with detailed and intriguing history. They managed to balance perfectly all the facets of great storytelling: action, humor, romance and more.\n\nThe combat feels a bit clunky at first. There is a steep learning curve with becoming a great warrior and the developer chose to make it feel real with this intentionally difficult combat early on. Stick with it, and once you and your character learn and practice (I recommend the Rattay Tourney and talking to Bernard), your investment will pay off and combat becomes incredibly fun. This game has created the ultimate combat system, my favorite of any game I've played. \n\nDialogue is engaging, well-acted, and concise enough to keep me interested. I often find myself impatiently skipping dialogue in games but not this one. I loved the writing and its delivery all the way through and actually became invested in the characters and story which is pretty rare for me in a video game.\n\nThe quests are plentiful, diverse, and unpredictable. The music is just right. There is a ton to do in this open world of Bohemia. The list of pros really goes on an on.\n\nThe only cons for me were occasional extra-long load times and some of the dialogue scenes weren't cued up with the audio which was hard to watch time to time. However, that may have been an issue with my PC because I played this game previously on XBOX and it was fine. Either way, the pros of this game are so vast that these minor issues are greatly overshadowed. \n\nI highly recommend this beautiful masterpiece and strongly feel that those who choose not to play it are missing out on what I believe to be one of the greatest games of all time.

Often they are voiced by Americans, or Americans trying (and failing) to do an English accent. Why the devs didn't just have an all-British voice cast is beyond me, American accents in a medieval game really kill the immersion for me.\n- There are bugs, I fortunately didn't encounter anything too severe but there were quite a few bizarre cases of characters disappearing in cutscenes.\n- The pace at which you progress in the game seems all over the place.

It's not uncommon that you'll try to run away from an unwinnable encounter only to have the camera aggressively whip around 180* because it locked on to an enemy who's chasing you.

Apparently these tutorials stretch through mission seven, and there are only 16 missions in the game. From what I can tell and have read, most of my remaining time in the game would be spent grinding through side-quests to up my skills in order to complete those remaining non-tutorial main missions.\n\nWhich would be fine, but I haven't really done anything of note in these first four hours. All I've *really* done so far is:\n\n- Walked around a town and grabbed some stuff from people\n- I took a horse and rode it somewhere\n- I've slept and ate things a few times\n- I attempted to dig a hole\n- I dug up a hole\n- I watched a lot of cutscenes\n- I opened some boxes and found things such as pretzels and cloth, as well as some gear (though the game would only tell me I wasn't skilled enough to use said gear until two hours later)\n- I had two sword fights with bandits that lasted all of 10 seconds\n- I did a heck of a lot of walking\n\nI'm not really *doing* anything. I'm just sort of wandering here and there, as the story dictates me to, and the world is this very empty and very barren place. I walk to a place, a cutscene plays out....and off I go to walk to the next place and cutscene. Nothing's compelling me to explore, and because of the grounded nature of the game, I know I'm likely not going to find anything remarkably interesting in the world.\n\nEven then, the grounded nature is this weird half-step. I need to do realistic things like eat and sleep, or else I'll presumably die. I can't save all the time for...reasons? I haven't found it to be an issue, but it is what it is. \n\nBut, even though the game is grounded in these specific ways, I have a magical chest next to every bed that contains all the items I've ever dumped into it and I can always access said chest and items in any inn in the world. And the twon guards magically possess the ability to identify stolen goods I carry, even though I stole those goods far far away in a different castle that would take days to walk to.\n\nIt's not a bad game.

[spoiler] Poder jugar un par de misiones con otros guerreros para cortar con la soledad de cabalgar solo con Mutt (el perro) al lado est\u00e1 bueno.

Unfortunately, the devs lacked the skill or character to follow through on those promises, leaving the game unfinished and unpolished with loads of missing and removed content. They focused more on removing exploits and player-discovered cheats than actually finishing the story.\n\nHenry begins as a peasant and is pretty useless at everything, so player skill actually does not matter until Henry\"s skill levels rise, making combat rather annoying until it becomes really easy. Glitches in combat can result in Henry freezing or not landing a hit, which leaves him vulnerable to attack. Common bandits are formally trained experts who take on bizarre stances that only the extremely wealthy who had master trainers would ever use, and even then they were for duels and not open combat.\n\nIt is a shame that the game had such promise but is filled with game-breaking bugs. For example, a current runthrough of mine had a character going to bed as a quest started, so rather than him ever head to the quest area, he just sleeps. I had to fail the first part of the quest so he would leave the area, but now he has never arrived at the second location even though I am supposed to meet him there. Bugs like this are common and lots of saving is required, though saving in the game is its own annoyance because you cannot just save a lot. You need to use an item and your amount of slave slots is limited.\n\nMods are vital to fix certain issues, which is lazy on the part of the devs and annoying at the best of times.\n\nThe story is incomplete and not what was promised. Originally on their Kickstarter, Warhorse promised multiple acts, plus some DLC. While the DLC materialized, these were things that should have been in the base game. The second act of the game never happens, so Henry's personal quest is NEVER resolved, though it was clearly supposed to. Now, Warhorse has been bought out and the devs keep teasing that a sequel is on the way. Instead of them ever finishing the first game, they want more money to sell a new game that just finishes the plot of a game that should have been done in 2018.

[/b] \n\n[b][u] Game Design [/u] [/b]\nFirst off, the design of the game save function and implementation is very obnoxious and can ruin your progression.  The game is designed to use multiple save files such as auto-saves, permanent saves, exit saves, and manual saves. It automatically performs these at different times while you are playing the game. It does not overwrite the previous save per type, but continually adds new save files to the game save folder which can grow the number of save files on your hard drive to a maximum of 300 separate files. When the max number is reached the game fails to save any further progress unless you manually open the save folder and delete prior save files. This becomes a micro-management task in order to avoid losing game progression. If you do not manually babysit the save file, you can lose many hours of game progression. \n\ud83d\udc4e\n\n[b][u] Graphics [/u] [/b]\nI played the game on Ultra video settings. It looks and performed great without any problems. This is a very strong point for game immersion and realism despite the awkward combat mechanics..  \ud83d\udc4d\n\n[b][u] Difficulty [/u] [/b]\nNominal. Nothing to remark on except for the ever-increasing numbers of enemies against you as you progress through the game. Combat can become a real hardship if you don't put in many hours to learn the basics. \n\n[b][u] Game Bugs / Oddities, etc.   [/u] [/b]\nThere is existing collision detection with some shrubs in-game which can be break game immersion and become annoying especially when during combat. The only way around it is to use a game modification script to remove the collision.  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n\n[b][u] Price / Worth Buying  [/u] [/b]  \nI paid a total of 8.3 Euros for the game and all DLC combined which equates to an investment of 0.08 Euros per game hour spent. If you can find a similar sales discount offer for the game at 85% off or higher from its standard sales price and you know for certain that  you\u2019d enjoy it, then by all means buy it. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nI do NOT recommend buying the game or its DLC at regular price \u2013 but ONLY BUY AT A DEEP DISCOUNT PRICE because its  well quite old at the time of writing this review.  Its no longer being updated or patched, so if you have a problem that needs fixed, then your only recourse for fix the problem is through using a modification file script from sites like Nexus mods, etc.    I rate the game as mediocre quality due to the severity in grinding.

It is only tailored to fight one person at a time, which would be fine if you werent encountering 3+ most of the time any combat happens, especially in the main story.

You're a blacksmith's boy who doesn't know anything about anything beyond your home village, you start with zero experience on almost everything and you must practice to get good at anything. Yes, I get that. But when the combat system punishes you for trying to combat people, you know it's gonna be bad. \n\nTo elaborate, if you try to attack an enemy and 80% of the time you're rewarded with a perfect counter on your face, there's no point in being an active participant. Just wait for your enemy to attack you, press Q at the right time and perform a counter on them instead. That's what the combat boils down to on higher levels. Or if you're against an enemy that's basically as useless as you are at the start of the game, they're probably gonna die in one or two hits. Fun.\n\nUsing stealth is also a bit of a pain at the start as you're not actually as stealthy as you think. If you sneak up on a couple of sleeping people and stealth kill one of them while your stealth skill is relatively low, you're 100% gonna wake up everyone around you. Come back later with maxed out stealth and would you look at that, the exact same animations with the exact same sounds at the exact same volumes play but now you're completely fine.\n\nDiplomacy is also an option but the best it can do is skip a few combat sections, you're still stuck on the narrative train tracks laid before you but that's understandable in a game where your decisions have no actual impact on the story.\n\nThe graphics are great though quite resource intensive. But boy howdy did I appreciate being able to see the light of a bandit's torch through a tent's fabric as I was trying to sneak through and away from said bandits.\n\nThe DLCs offer some extra spice but not much new to what you'll see in the base game, except for rebuilding a certain town. Some of the cutscenes and interactions quests in general were hilarious as well. But I still want to punch Capon in the face myself.\n\nYeah, I did enjoy some of my time with this game, about 30%, but most of the time was more about farming for XP and doing what to me felt more like a chore, 50% and the rest of the time was just frustration. Sure was fun to lose 5 hours of progress on Hardcore mode because I died from fall damage as I got off my horse while I didn't expect to die anytime soon as I didn't want to sleep in a bed half a map away, get nightmares (stat debuff on Hardcore mode), wait around for it to go away and then ride back to a mission while also not being able to use Savior Schnapps (yes, an actual consumable item you need to have in order to save without a bed) because I didn't want to level up my drinking skill too much in order to get sh*tfaced in one single quest I didn't essentially fail in my previous playthroughs. If that sentence feels like a chore to go through then you are [b]not [/b] prepared to complete Kingdom Come.\n\nI'm sorry, there's some really good stuff like history, graphics, even actual real places (Warhorse even got the actual river by Rattay right) but man, half of what I can remember of this game are just all the grinding for levels but not the actual rewards.", "timestamp_created": 1691505955, "timestamp_updated": 1691505955, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519063830375671387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143652053": {"recommendationid": "143652053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101675457", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3373, "last_played": 1694501076}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is something else.

No matter how staggered they are, even a lowly peasant can master strike you out of any combo. Not only that, they will often get 3-5 hits on you that you can't block, but when you master strike that does not happen. People cope that Henry was a peasant not a knight so he starts off as a bad fighter, but since even the dumbest, weakest enemies can perfectly master strike you, that's a moot point.\n\nThe \"realism\" part of the game is, as with most games that attempt to be \"\"realistic\"\", purely an inconvenience and is not done in an interesting way. A mod for manual saving is a necessity given how jank and unstable the game can get. In general this game is hard to make bearable even with mods that try to combat the fake realism the game is selling.\n\nIt's hard to point out many positives in this game. The graphics can look quite nice at times, but they are glitchy and the game is extremely unoptimised, so even with tweaks and mods you tend to sacrifice a lot of the graphics to make the game playable. The random lag can make the already horrendous combat even worse. The dialogues can be good, although in some cases I wanted to reach through the screen and knock some sense into Henry after he said some dumb shit.\n\nOverall, wouldn't recommend the game. There is a lot of people coping that the fighting system is realistic and Henry is meant to start off week, but as someone who maxed out all stats and also tried some anti-master strike mods afterwards (they don't really work), the combat never gets better. It's not hard, but it's tedious. You can cheese the game with a bow, or spend 10 minutes waiting to master strike the enemy 50 times or walk away while preparing a feint.

But it's historically based, and other than alchemy, doesn't have any of the common RPG elements.  There aren't any mages or orcs - there is a lot of real-world history though.\n\nI got fair warning from one review that the first 7 hours of the game is very linear - you really cannot stray from the path the game holds you in at first.  So I'm still in this sort of \"tutorial\" or \"cinematic\" mode, which can also be very challenging and cliff-hanger in places.  I have no regrets, I've enjoyed the ride thus far.\n\nI'm hoping to get far enough in the plot to say \"okay I think I get it\" and then switch the whole game into German, to give my ear some good exercise at hearing German again.  The game is historically not so accurate - but as I am and never have been much of a student of history, I'm happy just to learn about some historical figures, even if the game doesn't get things completely right.  As far as the day-to-day medieval lifestyle depiction, this does a good job, as far as I can tell.\n\nBut is it fun?  Well so far, yes.  It was very satisfying to, after getting my ass kicked by one of the first people I had to fight, to replay the game and first raise some money playing Farkle, and then buy a butchers knife with which I was able to go back and give him quite the lashing until he begged for mercy.  Yeah... I think I could enjoy this!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3016242267\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the camera does tend to make me feel sick, especially if I try picking herbs and the animation jerks the camera around, or just walking or running.  I think they attached the camera to the player's head and the head is bobbing around - which is a bit TOO realistic, because that little extra camera bobbing just gives me a headache.  This even happens if I watch videos of other people playing.  So I find myself closing the game often because I can't stand getting a headache.  I've tried slowing down the mouse sensitivity to a very low setting, and widening the FOV as wide as it goes, and turning the motion blur off, but still this is a problem for me.\n\nI have also noticed the game does introduce occasional drops in frame-rate regardless how low I set the screen resolution.  At 640x480 I still see these drops, and I attribute them to the game loading different map areas inefficiently.  Admittedly I don't have a screaming fast system, and I'm running from a relatively slow physical media hard-drive, so your mileage may vary.\n\nA lot of time is spent in cut-scenes, and the game starts very slowly, which can create a bit of a drag.  There are also tons of Easter eggs which motivates me to try to talk to everybody as much as possible.  If you're in a big hurry, this game is probably not for you.  If you're very picky that everything be \"just so\" - nope, not for you.  But I get the feeling that if you, like me, are open to letting the game tell its own story, there is something here that is going to pay off.  As I spend more time and let the story unfold in front of me, I'm willing to give the game this chance.", "timestamp_created": 1691372516, "timestamp_updated": 1692470104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143561523": {"recommendationid": "143561523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320631416", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 15606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11863, "last_played": 1694994949}, "language": "english", "review": "kickstarter syndrome\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691372329, "timestamp_updated": 1691372329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143561158": {"recommendationid": "143561158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044455099", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 693, "last_played": 1691616252}, "language": "english", "review": "lost track of real time", "timestamp_created": 1691371780, "timestamp_updated": 1691371780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143558590": {"recommendationid": "143558590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348265229", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 947, "last_played": 1691812336}, "language": "english", "review": "The combat in this game is God awful.

Let me start out by saying this game is good. I enjoyed it. BUT! It has so, so many problems. Some of them can be alleviated but maaaan this game is really rough around the edges. I wouldn't say it is cyberpunk bad, but it is pretty bad.\n\nMost of the game's problems come down to game design. They have attached saving to a consumable item. Once you get late in the game this becomes a non-issue, but for the ENTIRE first half of the game it (probably) is a huuuuge issue. The hard-core community of this game defends this mechanic TO THE DEATH. To which I can only respond: This game sold 5 million copies, and 1.1 million people downloaded the mod to remove that mechanic off of Nexusmods. 20% of the players of this game disagree with those people. It is a horrible mechanic and when I downloaded the mod it became a lot easier.\n\nThe other problem this game suffers from is NPCs that are too difficult. If anyone has played For Honor against the hardest difficulty enemies knows exactly what I'm talking about. Doesn't matter how fast you are, or if you feint attacks, the enemies can read your button inputs and react accordingly. The same problem exists in this game. The game has feints, and tells you to use them. But they're completely useless and should never be used. Primarily because blocking attacks is a radius and feinting does literally nothing. \n\nThe game also has another issue: It tries to make the game realistic in the worst way possible. You need to eat and sleep, which is fine. Not really an issue, but you have fast travel. It tries to make archery realistic by removing your damn crosshair. This is a stupid mechanic and I recommend using the console command wh_pl_showfirecursor 1 to enable it. Makes the game 10,000,000 times less frustrating. If the enemies can hit their shots every time, I should be able to as well. F*ck you. \n\nOverall, the game is fun, the story is good, and it gives real historical facts about the area and period. It's amazing! And handles it well! When the game goes on sale, buy it. It's good. But be ready for a lot of issues, and don't forget to download the mod which removes the consumable saving mechanic. There's a reason why only 10% of people have actually beaten the game. \n\n\nTLDR; Game is good, mechanics range from bad to frustrating. Download the mod to remove consumable-tied saving and use the wh_pl_showfirecursor 1 command to make archery usable.

Recently got back to the game and after a thorough read up I have no more problems. What is missing here is a game manual. No, not this incomplete ingame frustration. If you come up with something completely new, then maybe you should let the target group know about it? Even if I win every fight, it is still not clear what this or that push of a button or multiple pushes of a button does. Precisely because there is so much animation taking place in which you have an influence with the press - or not - I don't know! Time windows for a targeted press simply cannot be found and a wild clicker ensues. Intention? No idea! The combat system is still shit.\n\nFor people who depend on a controller, hardcore should be unplayable. In normal mode, for example, it is still displayed when an opponent attacks outside of the field of view and you have to block. That's not the case in hardcore. Switching opponents in a targeted manner to keep track of things is impossible with the controller.\n\nIt only gets more terrible later with main quest bugs, variables in texts that are not assigned, triggered quests that you didn't even start but someone who was relevant to the quest addressed.

The game is very grounded, and I mean VERY grounded in realism. If you are looking for a realistic immersive story told in medieval times then this game is perfect for you, but if you're just looking for a fun medieval rpg this game can be infuriating.\n\nAs the son of a blacksmith you aren't exactly the strength of a witcher, dragonslayer, or even a basic knight and the game makes sure you feel that. Combat, like the rest of the game, is entirely in first person and enemies can easily spin you around which can feel disorienting. All of your skills combat and otherwise need to be developed through usage similar to games like Skyrim. Which because of the grounded combat, you can expect to get your butt handed to you at the beginning of the game. And you'll need to care for those injuries asap because the less health you have the less stamina you can use making it so as you get injured in combat it becomes increasingly harder to fight back and stay alive.\n\nYou need to sleep, eat, and bathe in this game in order to survive (not bathing won't kill you but it does effect how others treat you). But be careful: if you eat too much it will negatively effect you. In terms of immersive mechanics the game even goes as far as to require you to teach Henry to read if you want to actually read whats in books in this game. The game has no crosshair when aiming a bow, which is ironic considering there is one when you're not using a bow. And the only way to save the game is through drinking saviour schnapps or sleeping (this choice felt odd to me because while it makes sense as a difficulty option, there is no such thing as a realistic save system apart from permadeath I guess. And forcing this save system means that even on the easiest difficulty you could get set back 30+ minutes because a bandit attacked you on your way to a bathhouse).\n\nHowever, as you build up Henry's skills, it does get easier. Hell by the end of the game you're a nearly unstoppable force in heavy armor. Or at least that's what I've heard, I have yet to get that far. I've heard that one of the easiest ways to get op fast is by repeatedly training with Bernard but I found that rather tedious and I personally do enjoy the grounded realistic struggle Henry is facing. The world has plenty of side quests but also infinitely repeatable side activities that are randomized. While its open world isn't anything special it does compliment the game's overall themes and general vibe really well. The world is pretty empty, not that it is devoid of life but rather in a way that is realistic. Just like real life a hike in the woods isn't going to guarantee that you see anything of interest, but there are just enough things scattered around the world that makes exploration worth it.\n\nSo is this game a good game? Yes. Is this game fun? Yes. Would I recommend it to the general audience? Hell no.", "timestamp_created": 1691099317, "timestamp_updated": 1691421496, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 122, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685708463191986084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143346005": {"recommendationid": "143346005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065800494", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4078, "last_played": 1679371619}, "language": "english", "review": "*Not a controller game*\n\nThis game was really fun for the first 10 or 20 hours however the more I played it with a controller, the more I realized this game is not meant for controller and the controller support or design is really subpar.\n\nThe good: The world itself seems very full of life with many NPCs offering unique quests or just in general being very fun to explore as there are many hidden treasures afoot. The weapon repairing system seems a little strange at first but becomes quite fun and satisfying once you get the hang of it and even becomes a fun way to make some extra money. The alchemy system is fun to do for maybe the first 5 hours and then gets a little tedious after that however I still enjoyed it past that as long as I spaced out when I did it.    \n\nThe bad:  The trading system is a little awkward but not too bad however needing to do it constantly when you don't need the money just for relationships/ better prices in the future gets annoying after a little while. The lock picking controls for *controller* are super awkward at best and really obnoxious at worst compared to mouse and keyboard where its simple and enjoyable. Take this with a grain of salt because I never finished it but, the main story has a lot of bumps and its writing is honestly just awkward a lot of the time. I had to take a lot of breaks from the main story because of how bland it felt. A lot of the characters just weren't redeemable or enjoyable to interact with from what I played. The dialogue just felt bland and it wasn't really compelling for me to continue the story it however it wasn't the reason I dropped the game or had to mod it just to try and enjoy it.\n\nThe ugly: The combat goes from awkward to just extremely tedious and it feels like there is somewhat of an input lag or something when trying to do combos on controller compared to mouse and keyboard. The scaling from early to \"late\" game doesn't help that at all. When fighting more than one person on controller you have to up your sensitivity super high or else any time an enemy tries to run around you your camera wont be able to keep up because of how the camera will snap back to targets. There is no easy way to switch targets with controller. You also cannot run away with controller because your camera will constantly do 180 degree spins to re-engage which keeps slowing you down so the enemy can tackle you or just get in free pot shots so you simply have to reload however far back and just avoid any fights with more than 2 people who are armored or difficult for you to fight. I tried to mod the combat to make it more enjoyable by removing some aspects that just don't work on controller like the master strikes but with how much frustration I experienced when I didn't want to constantly be doing combat but would get forced into so often made it harder to go back and test things out to see how they were re-balanced with the mods I installed to make things more enjoyable. The master strikes definitely killed the game for me as when enemies got more armored the fights got dragged out more and then you could constantly get master strike'd so you couldn't even do any fun combos anymore and for some reason (I'm unsure if this is a controller only issue but it seems like it possibly is) half the time a prompt came up to master strike or deflect it just wouldn't happen no matter how I tried to change my approach.

You can choose what direction to swing your weapon, but it's also affected by your level of skill, so there are some enemies you just cannot beat. Walking in the game is also tedious. If a location is on the other side of a river, instead of having a bridge in the area, you have to walk back into town, back to the entrance, walk a big round to a forest, walk through the forest, and then get to your location just to get a sidequest where you have to go back to town and steal 10 poptarts or something before coming all the way back to get paid 4 cents.

I've come back after 15 more hours to say that I 100% will stand with what I have said.  \n\nTL:DR: The combat is fine in 1v1s but in anything over 2v1s the combat makes the story unplayable.  A game that has so much potential to just throw it away on a broken system is sad.  \n\nI initially wrote a review where I said the game was unfun due to it's combat, and well I'd like to say it again.  I 100% would recommend giving the game a shot if on sale as it has some perks but in my experience I have just been bombarded with headache after headache.  The start of the game is exciting and enjoyable.  Eager to complete quests to move on in the story, it feel refreshing and is the best part of this game.   From there on out it goes down hill.  Quest seem to become very stale where you are just chasing people around, the combat system, which is fine for 1v1s just lets you down any time there is more than one enemy.  I just did not enjoy the game very much past the first 5 hours.  And it isn't that I found the combat system too difficult, I just found it very unfun.  And as I said, if there is more than 1 person you need to fight,  it just breaks.  I would love to continue the story but with work and other IRL activities I can't justify my limited hours on this game.  As I said at the end of my last review maybe I'll come back to finish the game when I have more time. \n\nNote: I even took down my initial review because I though it was emotional and felt the game

My personal opinion: The game pretends to be deep and difficult, but playing it feels very shallow, with no options to make meaningful decisions when skilling your character, painfully boring fights (just bonk them on the head) and almost every quest being boring fetch/kill stuff.\n\nThe developers tried to introduce some unique mechanics, but these mostly turned out horrible.

The start, of you as a 'nobody' going on to rise through the ranks and become proficient in any field you choose, is one that is not explored much in many other RPGs. The skill progression system is interesting, and the earlygame perks some thought put into them. (For example, you can only choose one of two perks if they are incompatible with each other, such as having a fast but small stamina meter or a slow but large one). The story is compelling although it does fall under the usual trope of 'Revenge'.\n\nThe main, and perhaps only peeve I have with the game is that combat is terrible when facing more than 2-3 opponents at the same time. While fighting and focusing on one enemy, the others can take potshots at you out of your FOV and there's not much you can do to mitigate that. If the game restricted the combat encounters to a max of around 3 opponents, the game would rise greatly in my personal ranking. \n\nAll that put together, I would rate the game a solid 8/10. It's not for everyone, but those who like it will REALLY like it.

With the combat animations I keep get glitched out in the enemies because the ones I am not soft locked onto just keep on running into me non stop as I try to master strike and move back. I really enjoy difficult combat in games but this is just bad mechanics. \n\nDon't get me wrong I have really enjoyed most of the game, it looks great, the story is not too bad. Interactions with most npcs are fine, the horse riding is good, the archery is good, etc. But I would not recommend this game for people who enjoy good combat mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1690861153, "timestamp_updated": 1690861153, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143181291": {"recommendationid": "143181291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198953479924", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 33944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33693, "last_played": 1691032773}, "language": "english", "review": "best game i have ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1690859501, "timestamp_updated": 1690859501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143179000": {"recommendationid": "143179000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412037808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 852, "last_played": 1690855519}, "language": "english", "review": "i  want to like this game but the combat is beyond infuriating", "timestamp_created": 1690855602, "timestamp_updated": 1690855602, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399261593818664551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143177992": {"recommendationid": "143177992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000193569", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 357, "last_played": 1692849979}, "language": "english", "review": "Great rpg", "timestamp_created": 1690853920, "timestamp_updated": 1690853920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143175694": {"recommendationid": "143175694", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125744629", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1690844365}, "language": "english", "review": "que juego de mierda", "timestamp_created": 1690850034, "timestamp_updated": 1690850034, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455606162548065186", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143173333": {"recommendationid": "143173333", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180558251", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 867, "last_played": 1689571751}, "language": "english", "review": "I have tried to play this game SO MANY TIMES.

From stealthy infiltration to full-blown combat, the gameplay options are diverse and satisfying. The skill-based progression system feels rewarding, as you witness your character evolve with every challenge conquered.\n\nDespite its brilliance, I must admit that there are some minor bugs and glitches that occasionally crop up. However, the game runs quite smoothly. These occasional annoyances didn't detract significantly from my overall enjoyment.\n\nIn conclusion, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a masterpiece that transports players to a bygone era, offering an unforgettable and immersive experience. The small bugs, though present, should not overshadow the sheer beauty and depth of this game.

And if the combat doesnt bug out its basically just press the block button when the green shield appears and master strike the enemy until they die because randomly attacking the enemy can cause you to be countered which is determined by RNG (fun).\n\nRest of the game is good though, quest dialogue is very well made and makes me invested in henry's journey and the people he meets. The world is nicely sized, not too large and empty and not too small and constricted, only complaint there is no way to get around large rivers other than going on the one bridge since swimming is not something all peasants are taught as a child lol. Customisation is nice in the variety of armour and weaponry you can use although most of the time you'll be seeing henry wearing a thick coat of mud unless you clean yourself every 5 minutes.\n\nIf you're expecting a well made medieval simulator this game can deliver that, but as soon as you're expected to swing a sword at lvl.1 jimmy from the brain defect shop or lvl. 500000 Sir Flinchalot you'll have the worst time ever.", "timestamp_created": 1690706616, "timestamp_updated": 1690706616, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571641385555267334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143068557": {"recommendationid": "143068557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216822272", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 12905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12905, "last_played": 1690702043}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the realism and detail they put into this game.", "timestamp_created": 1690704200, "timestamp_updated": 1690704200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143067965": {"recommendationid": "143067965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198481517", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 740, "last_played": 1694378362}, "language": "english", "review": "this is my [b]KING-DOM[/b]  [b][h1]COME![/h1][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1690703209, "timestamp_updated": 1690703720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143060491": {"recommendationid": "143060491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079666244", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2010, "last_played": 1693492537}, "language": "english", "review": "surprisingly its a very complex and real medieval games, the dev definitely working hard for this. good job huys", "timestamp_created": 1690690779, "timestamp_updated": 1690690779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143055350": {"recommendationid": "143055350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357169937", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5206, "last_played": 1691704627}, "language": "english", "review": "GG", "timestamp_created": 1690682454, "timestamp_updated": 1690682454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143046219": {"recommendationid": "143046219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198975191240", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1839, "last_played": 1690989048}, "language": "english", "review": "best dice game simulator. love it", "timestamp_created": 1690668011, "timestamp_updated": 1690668011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143044444": {"recommendationid": "143044444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046288907", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2031, "last_played": 1690798087}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though the games still in 2023 has many what i call \"obsticals\" instead of bugs the story and gameplay are great.

Obviously there is a lot of love for this game, and I absolutely get why. The world, the aesthetic, the politics - I loved everything about the idea of this game. The setting was so interesting, and so refreshingly different from anything I have played before. I kept waiting for the gameplay to sink its hooks in me, but it just never did.\n\nI downloaded this game for a long flight thinking it would be the perfect game to pass the time (this game is impressively Steam Deck compatible). As I said above, I was immediately intrigued by the setting, characters, and plot of this world. The gameplay was clunky but again, I loved the idea of starting as a \u201cnobody\u201d and working my way up - a game path more games need to try (how many \u201cyou are the chosen one\u201d game types do we have already). But the starting \u201ccommoner\u201d gameplay is CLUNKY. You quite literally start from zero. I did a number of tutorials and did my best to practice them all - introduction to fighting, lockpicking, bartering/selling - all of these systems are incredibly in depth and hard to master. I made my way through chunks of the intro until I got to a point where I had to lockpick a lock to get some necessary equipment to advance a quest. Only, as I stated before, the lockpicking is incredibly difficult in this game (if you google it you can see how controversial the difficulty is for yourself) and I couldn't get the chest open with my one lockpick. So I effectively softlocked myself at the start of my plane ride, and I swapped out games and put Kingdom Come aside for a little bit. A few weeks later I researched lockpicking a bit more and decided to give it another chance - I discovered there was an \u201ceasier lockpick\u201d option baked into the actual game settings itself, which I didn\u2019t feel too bad about using as it is still incredibly difficult. I managed to get that chest unlocked, and progressed through that section and moved the plot along incrementally.\n\nThis allowed me to get a little bit farther at which point I was offered a quest to do one of the side DLC missions that  sort of showed the start of the game again from a different perspective. Given I had taken a few weeks off from playing it I thought this would be a good idea. It was not. If you are reading this DO NOT do the DLC\u2019s early on in this game, it messes with the pacing horribly. I did the first half of \u201ca Woman\u2019s Lot\u201d DLC which I have no doubt is a fine DLC on its own, but better off being played after the main game (or at least a good chunk of the main game). In the game\u2019s defence, it absolutely tells you \u201chey you are about to start a side DLC here, are you sure you want to proceed\u201d but I chose to go this route thinking it would catch me back up to speed. \n\nWell yes, you do replay the intro as another character so it was a nice plot refresher, but this DLC you play as a character that, rather than progresses slowly, does not progress at ALL (speaking in terms of skills/abilities). Once again the character you play as is a commoner and you go on a variety of quests that get decently hard, but your character never really adapts to the increasing difficulty. Which led to a complaint of mine about the next controversial topic: the save system.\n\nKingdom Come wants you to avoid save scumming so it uses a system by which you have to use a potion to manually save the game (with an auto save system in place as well). So no quick save/quick load here. I loved the concept of this: the game wants you to live with your decisions, but unfortunately the gameplay is way too clunky for a system like this. In the DLC mission you are given a stealth-instant-kill option which the quests are very much designed around. You are not good with a sword, so you are going to  lose a sword fight. But jittery movement and  spotty target locks make the instant-kill feel almost RNG. Several times I lost 20-30 minute chunks of gameplay because the bad guy I was meant to instant-kill twitched out, saw I was behind him and of course killed me easily. I lost another 20 minute chunk of gameplay because I started walking too far down a path taking a wide berth from enemies, but the game did not intend for me to take this path yet, so it instant-killed me. Replaying these chunks of the game because of the game being janky, and not at all due to my own shortcomings or misplays, was incredibly frustrating.\n\nBut I proceeded on with the promise of an intriguing story and large battles ahead. I finished the DLC and returned to the main game, did a few more quests and got to a point where only again my character was \u201cdefeated\u201d and the plot sort of restarted with me back at almost-zero again. More tutorials and more practice fighting and ok - now I learned the perfect-parry mechanic, and the game makes you practice this mechanic in a fight right away. Let me tell you I was laser focused and did my absolute best to try and win this fight - blocking, parrying, attacking - I was determined to understand this game. But after several minutes of being unable to land a swing, I am pretty sure it is impossible to win this fight so I put the controller down and let the enemy beat me - yep a scripted fight that I was supposed to lose. \n\nAt this point I had a sad thought: \u201cHow long have I been playing this game?\u201d Well the answer to that was 12.5 hours. Yes, a good chunk of this was the DLC you should absolutely bypass in the beginning. But 12.5 hours and I was barely past the intro, still didn\u2019t really know how to fight (and I don\u2019t mean advanced fighting, I mean beginner fighting). My lockpicking had not improved so that was still going to be hard, and I didn\u2019t even have my own weapon. I haven\u2019t even heard whispers of how to brew this manual-save potion yet.

It plays much like MORDHAU, where swordplay isn't just button mashing but involves the use of combat zones and HEAVILY focuses on your footwork. The combat tutorials greatly highlight these two areas, and you should expect some punishment if you can't pick it up.  Just keep moving, and let your opponent make the first move. Combos, ripostes, and clinches are your friend here. It can be quite challenging at times, so I can understand that's not everyone's cup of tea.\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance also nails realism very well.\n\nYou play as the young son of a blacksmith, so there are areas where you're going to be lacking, and the game is great at elucidating these aspects and telling you how to progress. This involves learning how to read, hunt, forage, fight, and so much more. You're not a one-man army. Multiple-enemy battles often involve some stealth, crafty sabotage, good positioning, or a solid combination of everything.\n\nBut on the other hand, realism can be taken too far to the point where the gameplay becomes tedious. The challenge the game presents while delivering an 'authentic' medieval experience often forces you into just a few or only one playstyle to progress quickly - or worse, breaking the game altogether.\n\nThis is by far my biggest gripe of the game and where I just can't recommend it to most. Unless you're an actual sword-fighting god, you're going to have to use sabotage/stealth for every single enemy camp, and since looting NPCs is one of the only methods to accrue a meaningful amount of capital, you should prepare to steal A LOT of stuff from the poor citizens of Bohemia.

It isn't my favourite genre, I'm not especially interested in medieval times (well, I wasn't before this game) and I couldn't stand Henry's face (reminded me too much of an ex). I'm lazy with games so the combat initially felt like too much effort (but take time to practice with Bernard if you're anything like me because it's a fantastically fun combat system / game element once you get used to it). It's a little rough around the edges, some parts are a bit buggy....and yet, I can easily say it's the best game I've ever played. I can't even settle into another game since completing it - all I want is more Henry :(  \n\nThe story is fantastic and the whole cast of characters are amazing and so well developed / scripted / acted. I miss them now, especially Hanush and Hans. I even ended up loving Henry, despite the face (which I was able to change a little thanks to the modding options). \n\nThe overall experience is incredibly immersive and there are some fantastic little additions such as the dice game and some basic management/building-type stuff, later in the game. There's so much attention to detail and if you're into the history or geography, you definitely won't be disappointed. I even reached a point where my game-laze vanished and I really wanted the game to be hard and loved that some of it was (it actually becomes a bit too easy once you get the hang of the combat), because it definitely added to the immersion and fun.\n\nThe only negative is that it ended too soon.

You might find it quite difficult at the beginning, especially the combat system, but with the time passing and your playing hours counter increasing you will get accustomed to it and feel yourself comfortable fighting your foes.\nThe story line is interesting as well, it suggests you pretty divers quests, and if you are getting tired of the main story line, you also can run side quests parallel developing the main character.\nThe game provides a list of skill brunches, but it does not really give you a diverse choice how to develop your character, like other games in this genre do. You can become either a heavy knight or light one, which will affect only your choice of armor and combat style. But it is completely understandable, since game is focused on realism and takes place in the real medieval era of Central Europe, in Bohemia, to be more precise; so I don't think back the days there were any wizards and other magic stuff that we are used to see in other RPG games alike, for example, The Witcher.\n\nClosely to the end of the game, I got pretty tired of it though. Since the character got quite developed and the combats became easy, I just was looking for the final scene and the curtains. It also worthy of mention that I am not a big fan of RPG and there were some other games to play in my queue, so these factors also played a role in my rush to finish the game quickly. After finishing the main story line I still had many side quests to do and even a few different DLC's to play.

But because the devs gave up. \n\nThe game has almost everything I'd want in such a medieval simulation. But the lack of polish is so evident in every single thing you do in the game that it completely destroys not only the immersion, but any hope of getting a satisfying experience. \n\nEverything from terrible controls, collision boxes, broken ai, constant (and I mean constant) loading screens that even on PC (high end) take far too much out of your day just make this game a chore to play despite all the good stuff in it. \n\nIn addition to these problems, the game also suffers greatly from a lack of creativity in design decisions. There's countless items named \"hoods\" in the game, except none of them are actually hoods nor can they be used as hoods. \n\nThere is no real dialogue with NPCs and for most of the game you won't be able to talk to anyone except traders and activity givers. There are no interesting characters in the game save for 3 that I can name. The inability to change your brightness in game is traumatizing. Some monitors are darker than others and some people are more sensitive to blue light than others, however the devs are selfish enough to want to put accuracy at the expanse of playability. \n\nCombat is god awful. Was I extremely delighted to see enemies using actual combat maneuvers and stances that are not only accurate but some obscure enough that you can tell a lot of research was put in? ABSOLUTELY. But it was destroyed because of one shitty design decision. The player has a physical body outside out of cutsences that gets in the way of everything and makes fighting so damn clunky it becomes insanely difficult to fight on certain terrains. If there's so much as an inch of height difference, expect to get slaughtered. Enemies will clip thorugh things, their animations will spazz out (causing them to t-pose and DBZ you into submission) perfect block works only 30% of the time and master strikes barely ever work even when performed expertly. I spent 3 hours testing this with Captain Bernard. \n\nI honestly applaud the devs and creators of this game for the work they put into researching and creating this authentic experience. This is hands down one of the most accurate medieval sims I've ever played. However, with many updates, DLCs and numerous updated versions of the game, the lack of polish simply becomes unforgivable for me. \n\nI love this game. But I am also incredibly frustrated by it. It could have been the GOAT but it chose to be a donkey. \n\nI sincerely hope a sequel is coming that will iron out all of the issues and get the polish it deserves. But despite the fact I love the game so much I simply can't recommend it the way it is. I've spent more time being frustrated from the game than I did enjoying playing it.\n\nSuggestions - \n1. remove the player's body and keep it first person. \n2. Make it possible to cancel fast travel mid way.\n3. Make it so save cancelling sleep saves the game. Better yet, make it so you can save the game whenever you want without getting drunk.\n4. Fix the loading times. Not every time I wash myself in a trough or eat from a pot needs a loading screen.\n5. Make the world feel more alive than just having NPCs to pickpocket.\n6. Make proper tutorials for everything. 90% of the gameplay isn't explained in any meaningful tutorial (including combat, inventory, archery, etc)\n7. Also fix Archery.

You heal slower than in most games, but you still heal overnight. You can get lost in a vast forest on hardcore difficulty where there are no markers, but it\u2019s still only five minutes across on foot. You can fence with all the shaky camera immersion, but you are still not in control of your entire body.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter. Because any artform is smoke and mirrors in the end. It\u2019s not about realism \u2013 it\u2019s about whether it\u2019s believable. The player has to believe it\u2019s like real life. And when it comes to believability, this game has no peer.\nLook at the landscapes of modern RPGs. You can see a few landmarks from each point of the map. Colors are vibrant, everything is set so that the player doesn\u2019t get bored on the journey (the journey he\u2019s likely to never take or take only once because of fast travel, but that\u2019s besides the point). Kingdom Come is green during the day, grey during the rain and black during the night. It has paths that look the same, it has fields that roll across the horizon, it has streams that murmur gently and samely, and\u2026 It\u2019s real. It\u2019s actually not, because it\u2019s so small you can\u2019t really talk about a big world of any kind, but it feels real. Where in any other game a bandit camp would be marked by all sorts of signs like Shrek\u2019s swamp, here it\u2019s just a few small oddly twisted twigs on tree trunks along the path. In reality it would be like hanging up a neon sign: \u201cHERE BE MERRY MEN\u201d. By videogame standards it\u2019s almost unnoticeable.\nOr take the protagonist. A countryside simpleton \u2013 unrefined and dumb. Not stupid, not dim \u2013 just dumb. The game goes out of its way to show how much of a child he still is. As the plot progresses he slowly turns into his lord\u2019s very own \u201chuman can-opener\u201d\u00a9, a pragmatic down-to-the-ground problem-solver, not cruel by nature but not averse to using violence as a tool. In real life such transitions last years if not decades. Here it only takes a few weeks. But we see this process, it unfolds before our very eyes, and so we believe in it. And Henry\u2019s reaction to the plot twist. No spoilers here. People say: \u201che should be angry, why isn\u2019t he?!\u201d But would he be \u2013 in real life? That\u2019s the thing: he could be, and he could be not. But by not being angry he looks far more believable than he would otherwise.\nTake the plot. Assassin's creed taught us that historical games are those where you meet at least a dozen prominent figures of the depicted period and get involved into the biggest of events. Nope - says Kingdom Come - a historical game is the one where you get immersed. And immersion is far more than just meeting cool people. Apart from Sigismund, there's pretty much no-one of international renown that Henry encounters. That's believable. I can only assume they are going to continue the story into proto-Reformational Hussite wars, so I suppose, historical events will be far more present and big in the next few installments, but still.\n\nBut then there is combat. And \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 combat in Kingdom Come is not believable. It\u2019s realistic. Let me explain.\n\nNow, local combat system got a lot of flak from the uninitiated and the uncaring, but not only from them, and the reasons to this aforementioned flak are more complex than it might seem. I would describe my relationship with it as consisting of four phases: first, I didn\u2019t understand it, then I loved it while being bad at it, then I hated it while thinking I got good at it, and finally I accepted it for what it was and thus truly learnt it.\n\nPhase one. Being the village oaf that you are, you can\u2019t fight anything, and it\u2019s only through a lot of trial and error that you begin to present even a fraction of a threat to a desperate armed peasant. Here is where people not keen on putting themselves in drop off, claiming that combat is awful.\nPhase two. Soon enough, you discover that captain Bernard is the best man in all of Bohemia. Because he can teach you combat. Every day. All day. You can spar, and through sparring you will actually level up your fighting skills! You know, like in real life? I cannot stress enough, how good this design decision is! You can literally lose yourself in the sparring arena for days, advancing your weapon mastery, kicking captain\u2019s buttock and getting your buttock kicked, learning combos, feeling proud if you managed to pull off one of those on your ultraskilled teacher. And then\u2026\nPhase three. You start getting into fights. And that\u2019s where all of your knowledge about combat that Bernard taught you washes away. Because this game\u2019s system is built for duels, and even two versus one is already a problem. Enemies have no honor. They will spam left mouse button on you if they flank you with no hesitation. You will be lucky if you manage to pull a single combo at the beginning of the fight \u2013 before you have to feverishly block, reposition and chop out of harm\u2019s way with little rhyme or reason. It\u2019s utterly frustrating. And even when you get to fight actual duels with a skilled opponent, they can interrupt your fancy combos at any given time with master strikes. Woe\u2026 Utter woe\u2026 @#%$ this game!\nPhase four. And then it hits you. It\u2019s not a tournament we\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s a dirty, nasty fight to the death! So put your opponent between yourself and his archer friend! Pincushion them with arrows from afar! Take advantage of your horse and fight from the saddle! Sneak on them and do terrible things to them from the shadows! Reenact that scene from Pasolini\u2019s Oedipus Rex! Pretend to give up and attack suddenly! Buy the Woman\u2019s Lot DLC and let slip the dog of war! Combo-loving posers don\u2019t live long. Win by clinch. Win by feints. Win by treachery. Win by brains. For better or worse, Kingdom Come\u2019s combat is not believable, it\u2019s literally like real life. All is fair, and no quarter will be given.\nI suspect there is a phase five where you discover a meta, but I probably won\u2019t get to that, neither do I care.\nThis progression \u2013 from an absolute zero \u2013 to an eager beginner \u2013 to a cocky graduate \u2013 to a cocky graduate who\u2019s been handed his bottom line to \u2013 to a fully functional man of war \u2013 is the best thing this game has to offer. And trust me \u2013 everything else it offers is very good, because every system here is designed to be unique, believable and fully synergetic with other systems.\n\nKingdom Come is the game I love for its flaws. And that\u2019s because where its design principle is believability, its biggest flaw is actual realism. I think I applaud.\n\nPS\nThat English translation of characters' names though... Jind\u0159ich turning into a generic Henry... Right...\n\nPPS\nAlso, if approached really slowly, this game gives off a certain feeling. I don't rightly know how best to describe it. I suppose, I only really had it one other time in my gaming experience - when I was playing Gothic as a child, so maybe it's just a personal thing and shows how much I am fond of this game. I would call it a \"surrogate Heideggerian Feldweg feeling\". As in: not quite the real deal, but as close as a game can take us. I don't know, maybe any massive RPG can evoke this feeling, but I love The Witcher 3, and it didn't give me that, nor did Oblivion, which was my first TES game, and those who know, know how much a first TES game can mean to a person- no matter which one it is. I don't know. It's probably personal. I thought it might be a curious observation anyway.\nWas this review helpful? \nYes\n \nNo\n", "timestamp_created": 1690108620, "timestamp_updated": 1690108620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142630854": {"recommendationid": "142630854", "author": {"steamid": "76561199259382270", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 683, "last_played": 1697194839}, "language": "english", "review": "its just to good\n", "timestamp_created": 1690100937, "timestamp_updated": 1690100937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142628780": {"recommendationid": "142628780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124264704", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3993, "last_played": 1690097529}, "language": "english", "review": "GOATED, 5/5 if not for the bugs and the lackluster ending.

Characters are good and the narrative unfolds in a very pleasant and novel-like way. You really feel like you're f*cking around in the middle ages - whether it's good or bad.\n\nIt's a VERY hardcore and punishing game, and may not be for everyone because of that. It tries too much to be realistic, and while some things work, others simply ruin the fun. Pretty much everything in this game can kill or hurt you: even running in a hill can be enough to result in a deadly fall, for instance. \n\nThe combat is slow and feels terrible on mouse+keyboard, so I highly recommend playing with a controler. The stealth is very inconsistent, and I also wouldn't trust it for your first playthrough.\n\nIn the end, it's a clunky and buggy experience, and maybe too ambitious for the small team behind it, but still worth checking out for its art, storytelling and atmosphere. It's similar to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series in this regard. If you like this kind of unpolished but highly atmospheric open world game, it's worth a shot.\n\nHowever, despite all this, I cannot recommend it to most people - unless it's at least 70% off. If you want some medieval fun, get Mount & Blade instead. It's a lot more accessible and easier to get into (although still difficult in its own way).\n\nTLDR: Decent atmospheric game but not for everyone due to its learning curve. Combat feels clunky.

The more you play the easier fights are, but at a point combat just turns into sitting and waiting for the enemy to strike and block into a master strike then a hit. Any chance of hitting a combo gets thrown out the window because any enemy that isn't a peasant can easily perfect block you and master strike you back. T.L.D.R. the combat is pretty linear. Not to mention the only way to fight crowds is by sitting on horse back bowing them down and going back and forth, or just 24/7 backpedaling to prevent enemies from getting behind you.

I took a detour, improved my skills (strength, swords/defence(almost maxed it), agility), and performed many of the side quest and activities. Went to the starting area of the game, Skalitz. Saved in a house nearby and looted Skalitz (you must wait until the Bandits/Cumans leave so wait a bit of in game time, don't skip). Collect and sell the loot.

Basically you have quests and dialogues like in regular rpgs but there is a need system that force you to rest and eat in an inn once in a while or you'll suffer from some nasty effects that can severely impact your combat performance. Also there is no manual saving, its done by sleeping, scripted quests or with a savior schnaps so if you find yourself in a combat you can't win its better to either surrender or run.\n\nStory is pretty nice, without spoiling anything its a pretty simple story about the hero looking for revenge. You don't save the world, you aren't the chosen one and most of the time you aren't even the most important man in the room. It feel grounded and believable. I also really loved the inclusion of cutscenes and scripted quests (as in more than go to X get object Y and come back) which is something you rarely see in RPG's.\nThe ending was a bit disapointing thought, it doesn't feel like a conclusion but rather like a cliffhanger. The ending cutscene make up for it thought as it is truly wonderful but i still feel like there could have been a bit more to it.\n\nSoundtrack is a work of art, its undoubtly one of the most well done part of the game and everyone can universaly agree that its incredible.

Saw a few YouTube videos about it over the years most prominently Nodes 2 videos showing off the pure difficulty of the game. I finally picked up the game since it was $7 with all the DLC, and boy was that the right choice. \n\nnow while I'm not completely through the game at the time of writing this review I am having an absolute blast. This game is exciting, gritty, and most importantly hard and I mean HARD. I decided for my first play-through to play the game in hardcore mode and I'm still deciding if that was a good or bad idea. Without the weapon compass thingy in combat, it makes the combat just more challenging. The enemies doing the same amount of damage as you make fights more real and make duels last and feel frustrating yet fun, because one slight mistake and cause ur enemy to get a big combo and can cause u to die a painful death, and without the autosaves from quests that mistake can cause you hours of progress. \n\nfor the story, it is something I am 100% certain that it is one of the few games where your decisions matter. for example, I had to go to a trader to pay off debt and I saw a dialog option to learn to read I was intrigued and that decision led me to another town, and spent 3 in-game days not only learning English but Latin. I didn't think much of it but then a few hours later I was doing a quest where I got this letter that had important information and because I went out of my way to learn how to read I was able to save myself probably an hour of riding across the map to get it read to me. while this may be a minuet thing it made me appreciate how much my choices matter in this game. \n\nThis game is visually stunning. I have a pretty beefy pc so I am running on complete max settings and wow the game is beautiful. Since I'm playing in hardcore mode I can't fast travel and being forced to ride everywhere u get to see the true natural beauty of this game. ya ill admit the animation isn't flawless the facial expressions are pretty ugly at times sometimes ill ride past someone and half of their body will be invisible and cut scenes will not be at the right perspective and I can't see anything. \n\ntalking about pure combat which is the bread and butter of this game which I briefly mentioned earlier is rewarding that's the only way I can put it. having to think about what position ur going to strike from or if it's even worth fighting in the first place is something that this game does great. one of the biggest things I love about the combat is the armor. if your opponent is wearing something light like chain or padded then a short sword will do the job just fine but once you start fighting heavily armored opponents with plate armor when that sword might not cut it and funny enough just smashing their head in with a hammer will turn the insides of that armor to jelly. \n\nThis game is a 10/10 from me it's fun, frustrating, and rewarding if you like medieval games but like a challenge give this game a shot it's probably the most fun I've had with a story game in a long time.", "timestamp_created": 1689722182, "timestamp_updated": 1689722182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 46533, "total_negative": 9620, "total_reviews": 56153}, "cursors": {"AoJwl8vStYkDdbONnwQ=": "Thu Nov 23 22:54:42 2023"}}
