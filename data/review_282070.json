There's no explanation for any of the mechanics or conditions other than your survivors constant whining for food, sleep, smokes, or medicine. You get flavor hints and prompts; no numbers. You can guess at what the game wants you to do, but often enough your best guess might just kill a run because that's not how the game wants you to play it.\n\nThe wounding system in particular is very catty. In most games, giving the character a rest and a bandage will see them healed up. In This War of Mine, you need daily bandages (almost impossible to keep up), keep them fed to the brim, let them rest in bed for days and nights, and sometimes they'll still get worse. \n\nSickness in cold weather is similar. The game offers you a heater, which one might assume would protect against the cold if you give it wood. Nope. You need multiple heaters. You also need to fill them to the brim, because that makes them hotter. No, it doesn't matter where they're placed. None of this is explained, and you'll be wondering why your survivors are freezing despite having a heater right next to them. \n\nIt's easy to have a survivor freeze to death overnight when healthy, while you struggle to upgrade and construct multiple heaters, because you hadn't planned to need all these heaters, AND, every location is mysteriously out of parts.\n\nIt's very hard to recover from a downward spiral if you don't go on the wiki and KNOW where to go and what to do before it starts, because the game just doesn't convey anything.\n\nI think my biggest gripe is the inventory system. You're given a grid with some locked squares, implying you can upgrade your inventory somehow, so surely you just need a high enough crafting bench right? Maybe make a backpack? Once you get that, everything will go smoothly in your scavenging, right? You'll be abl eto make up for all the spent parts on upgraded workstations, right? Wrong. It's a trap. Most survivors will have 10 slots for life. Deal with it. And items just don't stack past a small handful or 1 per slot. The entire system will have you leaving more goodies than not, which feels disappointing, rather than fun or rewarding. This is what most often causes the downward spiral. You need too many different things all the time and can't bring them home. You'll often have to burn trips by sending in a scav with armor/guns/tools/bullets which leaves no room for taking things back.\n\nI think a lot of players might feel inclined to defend TWoM simply because it's stated goal is to simulate the miserable and desperate struggle of a group of civilians in a warzone. Sure. It succeeds at that. The game does simulate a desperate struggle, but it does this by obfuscating its mechanics and simultaneously punishing you for not knowing them. My best recommendation would be to get an inventory mod or a noob mod and be prepared to read a lot of wiki pages anyhow so you know what you're doing. Even with all of that though, I can't say the game is much fun. Once you learn all the mechanics and map the game out in your head, you'll feel like there isn't much left to see or do.", "timestamp_created": 1645585002, "timestamp_updated": 1645585002, "voted_up":

The bugs work both ways: they can help you too much, rendering the game not challenging, or they can make your life miserable.\n\n**The combat system is the worst aspect of this game.**\nThe character will often not react to your commands, just standing there, getting themselves killed. And you cannot save/load game at any time. So your character dies because the game decided not to listen to you, and then it saves the progress for you.\n\nThe game will also not teach/tell you when it's getting autosaved. If you think you've finished day in the game and decide to turn it off - oops, all day is lost, because it only saves at dawn. Try again.\n\nSelecting characters works randomly. Sometimes, you click on a character and it gets selected. Sometimes you click on a character, and currently selected character goes to the location where you clicked. This hitbox problem seems to affect every interactive object.\n\nYou can basically win the game by going to 1 single location - the Garage. Trader's inventory gets replenished all the time, and once you traded with him, you can go to his basement to steal whatever you just traded in. And then repeat. Almost infinite items - you're limited only by your backpack capacity.\nThis \"exploit\" I noticed myself, but I read on a wiki about many more \"exploits\" like this.\nIt ruins the challenge.\n\nThere is no keyboard support in this game. You can't even look around with arrow keys.\n\nThe game does not remember my fullscreen setting - it always starts in windowed mode.\n\nThe game was made in Poland, yet the Polish localization is so bad (unnatural, mechanical), that I - being native Polish speaker - decided to play the game in English. Weird.\nThe English localization is perfect though.\n\nThe game begs for other improvements:\n- Why can only 1 character go scavenging?\n- Why does the character get tired if I finish scavenging in 1 hour?\n\nNo wonder the game is being sold so cheap - I suspect people would get frustrated if they paid more.\nWell, I got frustrated enough to leave a comment.\n\nWith all the above there's no incentive for me to start another game.\n\nIf there was an option to save the game at any time (or at least if it'd autosave at dusk), I'd just use it to neutralize these combat issues. But there isn't.\n", "timestamp_created": 1645261839, "timestamp_updated": 1645282825, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587065637111663818",

Things were going quite well for my four survivors. It was around Day 27. They had just fixed a broken guitar and a little bit before the nightfall Katia was playing the guitar and Kalina was listening to her play and sang(?). I thought it was heartwarming.\n\nThen it was time to send Katia to scavenge. I chose St. Mary's Church and wasn't too worried, because I thought it would be relatively safe. There wasn't much to find though and then I saw a man and made Katia sneak a little bit closer, so that I could hear what the man was mumbling. I hid Katia and waited. I figured the man wasn't interesting and thought it would be better to leave, and just when Katia stepped out of her hiding spot the man found what he had been looking for, turned around and spotted Katia.\n\nHe had a gun. Katia didn't have any weapons. I think he shot Katia or then I just decided it was best to flee, as he approached Katia threateningly, and after that he started shooting. I wish I had guided Katia to a different route, but I didn't. She started to climb the ladders and was shot to death. I was shocked.\n\nIn the morning, seeing my other survivors sad, especially little Kalina, was heartbreaking. Everything had seemed to go well and now it was just a distant memory. I had lost my bargainer and it was harder to play with only two adults. I knew I had made mistakes and I cursed my timing, maybe Katia would have survived if I had waited longer, maybe I could have hidden her somewhere if I had guided her to a different route. Pavle or Bruno said something like \"she was just here and now she isn't\" and that's exactly how I felt. It was sad and it gives me shivers.\n\nI didn't dare to return to St. Mary's Church, but I want to explore it when I start a new game.

En general, creo que This War of Mine es un t\u00edtulo que transmite muy bien el mensaje que quiere enviar y lo hace con un gameplay desafiante a la par que coherente consigo mismo.\nRespecto al juego, sobre todo al principio, lo vas a pasar mal. Muchas recetas no te las sabes, acumular\u00e1s objetos in\u00fatiles y dem\u00e1s, pero una vez le pillas el tranquillo todo es mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil y entretenido.\n\nComo puntos positivos, destacar\u00eda que el juego tiene un buen apartado visual que va acorde a la est\u00e9tica general, la m\u00fasica est\u00e1 bien y las distintas situaciones en las que te pone son desafiantes. Puedes jugar varias veces una partida y seg\u00fan con qu\u00e9 personajes empieces ser\u00e1 muy distinto.\nEmpec\u00e9 probando al equipo m\u00e1s sencillo, el cual tiene a Pavle (corre, pero no es muy importante), Marko (explora mejor por las noches) y Bruno (las recetas cuestan menos) y hace que una run sea extremadamente f\u00e1cil. Pero luego prob\u00e9 a jugar con Christo (padre) e Iskra (hija) y el desaf\u00edo fue bastante m\u00e1s interesante.\n\nFinalmente, el DLC merece la pena, ya que a\u00f1ade el modo Historias, donde es el mismo juego, pero dirigido por una historia que a\u00f1ade nuevas mec\u00e1nicas (conversaciones de historia) y te fuerza a hacer ciertas misiones especiales que desembocan en varios desenlaces.\n\nEntre las cosas malas que destacar\u00eda del juego es que:\n- a veces es muy obtuso (incluso cuando sabes todo del juego)\n- tiene algunos bugs molestos (aunque poco relevantes) si fuerzas ciertas cosas (y como es un juego antiguo no lo van a arreglar) \n- el juego te fuerza demasiado a ser buena persona. Me gustar\u00eda un poco m\u00e1s de libertad donde pudi\u00e9semos hacer ciertas cosas con algunos personajes, ya que todos se deprimen cuando haces algo \u00e9ticamente cuestionable. Pero siendo sincero, en alguna run me gustar\u00eda probar otras cosas y que el juego no te penalice tanto por decidir matar a un t\u00edo, o al robar a cierta gente, es decir, que nos d\u00e9 algo m\u00e1s de libertad para probar cosas.\n\nPD: Conseguir todos los logros es un infierno.

Its not too hard if you keep your wits in it. Spare items and food, stay hungry but alive and hanging in there and you'll be ok. Perhaps I haven't seen enough sides of the game as I was all the time kind of sailing through with no big issues?\n\nThe other part of gameplay is about going out of your safehouse in nighttime to collect items in maps or trade stuff with people. Sneaking around is sometimes fun and tense, but sometimes the opponents just see you from weird angles. Combat is super dangerous and clunky but you can mostly avoid it because you find enough items by trading and taking stuff lying around.\n\nPeople tell about \"gutwrenching and touching stories\". But I think the characters you have are relatively shallow. In the level of \"This one can cook\", \"This one smokes\", \"This dude is ok with stealing from others, this dude isn't\". \"This dude met his wife while on the job as fireman\", \"This one is pregnant and now only cares about her baby\".. Wow thats deep.\n\nAlso game has few bugs which don't seem like they're going to get fixed. For example, a group of thugs had killed a priest and taken over a church so I whacked one of the guys and also took some of their stuff. It was considered \"stealing\". Later I ended up killing all the bandits there and taking more of their stuff. My people are \"worried that how will the poor people there now make it after I stole their stuff\".... \nNEWSFLASH, they were evil people trying to shoot me and they are dead now. \nSo I don't think they mind anymore.\n\nAll in all, get this on sale and try it out, perhaps you like. But I cannot \"recommend\" a game when its gameplay is quite limited and ultimately relatively easy.\n\nIf you want tips:\n- Make moonshine, you can get assault rifles by day 3 by trading it to soldiers\n- Make a hatchet, chop stuff to pieces to get free fuel\n- Board up your safehouse asap\n- Sleep on daytime\n- Trading is more useful than self suffiency", "timestamp_created": 1642328844, "timestamp_updated": 1642329140, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108117143": {"recommendationid": "108117143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255454056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 578, "last_played": 1682641665}, "language": "english", "review": "I didnt mean to shoot the priest... why did he have to come down the stairs! i just wanted revenge for Marko.

Back in 2014, when this game was released, the survival genre was in the middle of its renaissance. Games like Subnautica, Rust, Don't Starve, and Day Z, had all been released and were receiving great praise. Unfortunately, the variety of titles available at the time has relegated This War of Mine to the proverbial back seat. Now, 7 years later, is this game still good? \n\nWell... yes and no. \n\nIf you love survival games, then yes, This War of Mine is for you; it's a paragon of the survival genre with a few unique mechanics that bring moments of tension and excitement. Unfortunately for me, these moments are too few and far between with the game relying too heavily on the tiresome crafting mechanics. So if you are returning to the survival genre, after a period of respite, expecting to re-ignite your love, then no, this game is not for you.

The player will spend the most part of its day doing nothing, waiting for the night to come and actually be able to scavenge some supplies.

Stockpiling is near impossible  again because of the small inventory spaces that are also fixed, there's no way to improve them through equipment or consumables.\nNarratively speaking, the game is passable. It tells a few stories that are almost enjoyable and the characters within them act like you'd expect in a war.

Ambiente logrado gracias al soundtrack y al arte que maneja. Los personajes se sienten reales cada uno con su personalidad y su propia historia y guerra que los hacen sentir \u00fanicos, ver como se manejan con los problemas que se presentan y como dialogan entre ellos cuando est\u00e1n deprimidos es algo de ver.\nLos problemas que se presentan y las decisiones dif\u00edciles que se toman son crudos y lo m\u00e1s probable es que te vas a arrepentir de lo que tengas que eligir pero es parte de sobrevivir la guerra.\nEl mundo que construyeron al rededor de la guerra se siente vivo... O muerto... Depresivo, se siente la tensi\u00f3n y la pena que cada uno vive y como cada casa es un mundo distintos, desde los viejos que solamente que te vayas sin hacer da\u00f1o hasta la gente que solamente por verte por su territorio va a abrir fuego, a todo esto una cosa que no pens\u00e9 que suceder\u00eda es el hecho de ponerme tenso en mi primera persecuci\u00f3n, logro ponerme nervioso y querer salir por patas de ese lugar pero por suerte ten\u00eda un arma y logre hacerles frente pero eso no quita lo que me hizo sentir, aquel peligro que me ped\u00eda salir disparado hac\u00eda la salida cuando escuche: \"\u00a1Atrapen a esa zorra!\". \n\nEl juego es magnifico como ya dije anteriormente pero no es algo perfecto, hay situaciones muy molestas que casi me hacen dejar el juego, ya que te intentan poner tensi\u00f3n pero termina siendo molesto tener a todos los refugiados heridos y que te roben m\u00e1s de lo que podas obtener por m\u00e1s que este el refugio asegurado al m\u00e1ximo y todos armados. Otro evento que siento que llego tarde en mi partida es el invierno, llego en un momento en el que ya hab\u00eda superado todos los saqueos y estaba bastante bien en mi partida y no logre sentir un peligro ni nada, solamente tuve que construir la chimenea y se acabo pero a lo mejor si lo re juego sea un reto a\u00fan mayor el invierno. \n\n\u00bfRecomiendo This War Of Mine?

I'm not quite sure when I bought it, but around the time it came out i was still a kid in his mid teens. Played for a couple hours then quit because in all honesty I was complete trash at the game.\n\nBut coming back to it recently I found that being trash at the game is sort of part of the experience. In a good way, don't get me wrong. A fantastic way even. Your people will go through tons of struggles and hardships and you'll have to make important choices on what to focus on to keep people alive. Whether it be food, heating, general comfort, hell the game even takes into account psychological aspects where depending on your character, if they see or do something that would negatively impact a normal persons mental state, they can have full on anxiety attacks and such. Which you can treat over time by talking to them, or resort to cigarettes and booze to numb the pain... and then possibly get addicted to either of them.\n\nI wish more games took their choices to the level that this game does. The phrase \"choices matter\" is an understatement here, and they don't always make it super obvious that you have a choice in some spots too. At which I'll say, sometimes if you see something messed up happening, think to yourself and wonder what the right thing to do would be, and if you have the balls to actually do it. As well as think about how it might negatively or positively effect your characters morale.\n\n4$ is an absolute steal for this game and I sort of pray that something similar is in the works because I'd love to see a game like this be a bit bigger with more statuses and effects to manage. And to top all of that off, I noticed the sale and was recommending the game to a friend and went to buy the dlc. One of their DLC is pretty much just an opportunity to give a donation to charity. There are a lot of messed up situations in this game regarding children, and the fact that the developers even include that deserves a mad amount of respect.", "timestamp_created": 1639629034, "timestamp_updated": 1639629034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503676474094390869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105899792": {"recommendationid": "105899792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043407114", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2731, "last_played": 1639338309}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful and unique.

The game is divided into 2 parts. 1st part is day, when you can go around house, build things, eat, rest or heal your survivors, trade if a trader comes around, or maybe help neighbours in some random encounter. \n\nThe second part of the game is at night time, when you can choose one of your survivors and go out into town scavenging. There is a lot of different things, building materials, wood for heating, food, bullets, herbals, medicine and more. Your scavenger has limited space in his backpack, so I always chose the survivor that can carry the most items to go into scavenging missions.\n\nFirst few locations for scavenging are easy, and you will make a lot of it. But as game moves towards mid-game, scavenging missions become harder, enemies carry weapons, and patrol around locations, and it is really not easy to survive. And game is kinda rogue-like, and once you fuck up, there is no turning back, you need to start the game anew.\n\nI didn't manage to finish this game, but it is very addictive, and it made me start over more than 30 times with different survivors and different strategies. Every path and strategy you take has upsides and downsides to it, so you must choose carefully to make optimum profit out of everything.\n\nThere is also this atmosphere of desperation in the air all the time, and music is depressing accordingly. But when you have a sofa, the fire is burning and it is warm, and nobody is hungry, you can see survivors sit on the sofa, read a book and look kinda satisfied, so it makes you happy too. Progress in game is slow, but if you can every night bring maximum load of scavenged items, it will be a steady progress.\n\nExcellent game, excellent idea, unique in game play, great atmosphere.

The concept is great, but with a huge flaw as far as I have seen - You can mostly scavange / loot items from other \"people\" in the city, with subsequent anguish and mental despair for your characters. This seems to be more or less unavoidable - Conflict is basically a part of the game and you will not be able to play this game \"fair\" if you are to succeed. This is maybe a part of the war, but I don't believe it is a necessity of war, where co-op is the key for long-term survival. So by doing the game-play narrowly in this direction, you can't really \"win\". You will always lose, even if you temporarily win. Some items that is a all out necessity is crucially hard to come by, even though in real life, it doesn't seem to be that big of an issue - for example bandages. There are so many other ways to make bandages, it is not really a difficult item in real life. Food is.

Characters lament not knowing where their next meal will come from while tending to the garden and help neighbours to the hospital only to return with their own wounds untreated. Cumulatively, this takes away from the sense that you're sharing a harrowing experience with your survivors as much as you are simply playing a game, fulfilling the mechanical needs of their meters. It seems to occupy an unfortunate middle ground of characterization, where the characters aren't blank enough slates that a personality can be suggested purely by their mechanical abilities but also the dialogue and flavour-text aren't strong enough that their crafted personalities are endearing.\n\nI think games should allow for moments that are, in a classical sense, awesome. These moments are generally where the written narrative and the emergent ludonarrative suddenly interlock in a beautiful, transcendent whole. The AI of an enemy in XCOM 2 causing it to attack a soldier with a psychic shield for multiple turns, allowing them to have a drawn out energy-blade duel; the moment in Spec Ops: The Line when you choose how you respond to the lynch mob that just removed of one of your NPC helpers from play; Sans' judgement in Undertale. I found but one moment that even approached that in War of Mine, when a newcomer to my house was kind to my little girl character and was able to offer her a healing item since *he* was healthy enough to do a scavenging run instead of the other--injured--adults. It was touching, and fulfilling--but fleeting. And, for some reason, not what the game was build around or seemingly designed to reliably reproduce.\n\nSure, one can argue that the game is about feeling bad, not about awesome moments. But I would argue that if you're not being made to feel awesomely sad, you're not sad. You're merely recognizing that the aesthetics of the game are demanding sadness. That's the thing to say about a game like War of Mine because the alternative opens one up to accusations of sociopathy. Ah yes, when small sprites I'd told were old people on my screen said 'please don't!' as I took their digital food tokens, I was inflicted with much sympathy. I ace all my Voight-Kampffs!

The individuals you look after are trying to deal with both the physical and mental issues of living in a warzone, hungry and tired and trying to come to terms with why they have to suffer when they never asked to be involved in a war they never started. It's heartbreaking to keep trying so hard and still seeing the people suffer, the hardest one for me was the one that starts off with a lone father and his daughter. It was hard to see how much stress and mental anguish the child suffered while the parent just muddled through. When another adult appeared you find yourself very suspicious of their motives, you have to decide if you're going to trust another adult to enter the group. Very clever way to play emotional games with you.\n\nYes, there are some technical things that could be improved, placing objects you made such as chairs and stoves can be a pain as you only have so much space and only allowed one type of object in a room at anytime. However it's not really about the technical prowess of the game, it's how it plays on your emotions and empathy for the suffering of other human beings.\n\nIt was very odd to play a game, they're just sprites but I really cared about the people especially the children, every time they wanted a hug or sat down and just cried, you felt you had to do something.

Oh boy, that's not it... you also can't have a previous save before hand! But, that's the beauty of this game. You can't just go around killing people, there are consequences to your actions.

I wish I had more places to put things so I could have more than one work station/chair/whatever per room. I also really wish the characters had more idle animations or actually did stuff like reading, sweeping or something. Also while you can board up some holes and recycle some furniture you can't ever seal the whole base off, which gets really annoying when the characters are complaining about snow and you just sit there like \"WHY CAN'T I SEAL THESE BROKEN WINDOWS!?\" \nThe night scavenging is actually really good, combat is tense and difficult but it is possible to survive it if your careful. Stealth is very tense, mostly because of the top notch sound work and I love it! Some people might dislike the strict time limit that scavenging puts you under and I agree its far too short. But over all its a good mechanic and the level design is pretty solid, though the ai is... Bad. \n\nUnarmed goons will rush you even if you have a loaded assault rifle and a full suit of body armour. If you kill a sentry or any NPC really, the others don't change their patrol paths if you return or try to replace their lookouts. If a guy spawns on the third floor, he will stay there until you do something to lure him down. Then he will go right back to where he was if he didn't see you. Their movements are also quite predictable which I don't really mind, it does make stealth kills very easy but it's not the worst thing. I really wish the game would react more to you're scavenging or raiding. Instead every single location is heavily scripted which makes them loose any replay value pretty fast. \n\nWhen it comes to crafting the game tries to keep it \"realistic\" you're not going to craft a machine gun from nothing, or get medieval with a bow and arrow like this is minecraft. But it does have its share of nonsense, why do I need a filter to make Moonshine if the only ingredients are sugar and CLEAN water? Why do I need a filter for rain water, can't I just boil it? It's not the worst ever but I'm not above nitpicking moon logic in a game that wants to sell me a realistic war story.\n\nI can't think of a good segway so lets talk about characters.\nEach character has a unique ability which range from \"unclear\" to \"worthless\" and \"game breaking cheese\"\nFor an example, Pavle is just flat out faster at running than everyone. Not really that helpful is it.\nBut what do you do with a skill like \"Good with kids\"? \nThen there's Roman who has the game breaking \"Combat trained\" which means he can one shot melee, feels no guilt over murdering people by the dozens, and has way better aim and reloading speed.\nThen there's Marko and his \"Good cooking\" which means his Moonshine takes half as many supplies to make but is worth just as much. No wonder they only let you carry one bottle per stack because Marko is the king of barter town. Combine him with Katia's \"bartering skills\" and you can buy basically anything. \n\nEach character can and will develop status effects as you play. A lot of which are at best unclear or at worst designed to just make you waste resources.\nFor example, still hungry means nothing. Don't waste food making sure everyone is stuffed unless they've got a status effect like wounded or depressed.\nSame thing goes for slightly wounded. Just give them rest and regular food, don't bother filling their belly or giving them bandages.\n\nHowever some statuses are just stupid. \nDepressed, Sad and Broken are dumb.\nI don't want the game to TELL me how my character's feel. Especially because what triggers the statuses is basically \"random\". (In the sense they are so heavily scripted or character dependant it becomes impossible to find a pattern)\nFor example, robbing this one specific old couple will make who ever does it sad.\nBut robbing other random survivors? No emotional penalty unless you fail an invisible dice roll.\nKilling random survivors is a great way to make your character depressed, but if the survivor is classed as a bandit (something you could only find out through wikipedia) then murder away! Who cares if they beg for mercy! Club 'em to death! Shoot them! Slit their throats when they ain't lookin! Their bandits! They have no souls!\n\nThe game wants to have its moral cake and eat it too. This is some Spec Ops the Line bullshit where the game just gets really judgy on you for no good reason. \nStaying with that tangent for a moment and veering close to spoilers. The endings are dumb. \nEach character has 6: Death, Suicide, Leaving, Karma, Sad and Good.\nDeath and Suicide should be obvious.\nLeaving means they left the party for whatever reason.\n\"Karma\" happens when you survive till the cease fire or escape the city but kill too many people or steal too much. \n\"Sad\" happens when you do the same but you didn't steal enough or kill enough to get the Karma ending but you ALSO didn't do enough random side objectives to get the \"Good\" ending.\nGood happens when you don't steal, don't kill, and give away free supplies whenever the game asks you to. \nAgain the game is very judgemental, I wish that each character had fewer endings with more detail instead of stretching them to fill a bunch of arbitrary moral classifications. \n\nAlso addictions, addictions are dumb. \nSome characters will suffer a mood penalty (making them more likely to become Sad, Depressed or Broken whenever the appropriate roll is made) if they don't get their one pure water and cup of coffee or 3 smokes a day. \nAlso you can pound Moonshine back like its water and they will never get addicted which I think is funny for some reason. The game wants to tackle some very serious issues but doesn't want to look at maladaptive coping mechanisms. \nI wish I could use coffee or cigarettes to boost my character's morale, at the risk of them becoming addicted or having bad side effects instead of it just being an automatic thing decided on generation. Or at least make them random instead of fixed.\n\nWhen it comes to taking care of your survivors, some actions are basically pointless.\nFor example building chairs does nothing, even if you have books characters will never read. They'll just sit around and do nothing. I know just HAVING them supposedly provides positive morale but the game doesn't give you any feed back on how much morale (if any) is gained from having a comfy house. Just cheap uninspired flavour text. \nCooking is also pretty worthless sine it consumes more resources than just eating canned food or eating raw food twice. (Unless you have Bruno then cooking actually pays some return on investment) If you wanna play on GG-EZ mode just avoid eating all together until the second day of \"Very Hungry\" status. \n\nAlso, I know part of the profits for every copy of this game go to/went to charity. But that doesn't justify rough experience like this. If you care that much about charity, donate to them directly. \n\nI do admit, I enjoy This War of Mine. But I don't think cackling with glee when Marko beats 3 gunmen to death with a shovel is the kind of enjoyment the devs want me to be having. \nLike I said its got some flaws, but the gameplay is challenging and exploitable enough to keep me going on that a lone. \nAnd I fully admit most of the flaws can be fixed with mods, but a review should be about what a game IS not what it CAN become if you bolt the right fan addons to it.

It's an odd blend that is very much it's own thing. While the game loop itself is great, it's the wonderfully crafted context that really sells it. The visuals, the writing, the characters, the environment and the outstanding music all come together to make a uniquely tangible, depressing and sometimes cosy mood that only this game can offer. Throw in a good amount of replayability and a solid list of achievements to hunt, with no nonsense, and it's practically perfect for what it does. \n\n[b]Verdict:[/b] I completely recommend it for anyone looking for a challenge or for something a bit different.", "timestamp_created": 1634944000, "timestamp_updated": 1639364775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580152690410614014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101441110": {"recommendationid": "101441110", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967642591", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3599, "last_played": 1602979050}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my most favorite games!", "timestamp_created": 1634913385, "timestamp_updated": 1634913385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101430303": {"recommendationid": "101430303", "author": {"steamid": "76561199090985864", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 502, "last_played": 1676177699}, "language": "english", "review": "its a game that extremely focuses on time management, and preparing for future events. its difficult, but extremely fun. would definitely recommend", "timestamp_created": 1634896597, "timestamp_updated": 1634896597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101413210": {"recommendationid": "101413210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349620536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1055, "last_played": 1673310913}, "language": "spanish", "review": "compralo", "timestamp_created": 1634859810, "timestamp_updated": 1634859810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101397451": {"recommendationid": "101397451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372258260", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6822, "last_played": 1650226544}, "language": "english", "review": "Really amaizing game, even if simple it can really show you how terrible war is.", "timestamp_created": 1634834712, "timestamp_updated": 1634834712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101388528": {"recommendationid": "101388528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000808670", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3848, "last_played": 1634972557}, "language": "english", "review": "Ooph...

Throughout the game you are given multiple places that you can only explore when night falls and multiple characters in the beginning of the game, and NO you don't have to go out there and kill everyone rambo style, in order to survive this horrible time. You can even get sick and you will need lots of rest and even meds to recover, you have to play it smart, learn how to trade the right resources and sometimes help people in the same situation you are (or even worse). Most of your decisions will write the ending story (if you can survive that long). You will have to steal sometimes (I wish the impact of still leaving half the food or materials in some houses would also impact the ending of the game) and I'm sorry that the developers  decided the \"meat source\" you can find in the game was catching rats (or small animals idk).  I am sure making vegetable soups should be no real problem in tough times and you should have more options on what to eat and how to make various warm meals even without meat. I doubt people would choose to eat rat meat (cat/dog whatever) even in those times.

This is often ignored, not only in video games but media in general, likely because it's harder to glorify pointless suffering for propaganda purposes compared to conventional warfare and the current world superpower considers bombing civilian settlements a valid strategy they still practice to this day. This War of Mine seems to be inspired by the Breakup of Yugoslavia, but many may draw parallels to more recent Syrian Civil War which is still ongoing as of October of 2021.\nThe game starts somewhat promising, but it only takes a few hours for This War of Mine to become a regular survival game, and I can't help but think this goes against the original intent.\nA lot of people mention different set pieces that elicited an emotional reaction from them, but I personally believe the game gets downright cheesy at times. The color palette is mostly comprised of different shades of grey and there's always sad music in the background, it feels forced rather than interactive.\nAlso, the cyclical nature of the gameplay plus the long duration of the campaign means that by the end of it most players will be thinking about moonshine economics rather than morality. You can only shank an NPC so many times until you become desensitized to it and I highly doubt that's the message they were going for because the sad atmosphere is maintained to the very end. \nHowever, I find it morbidly cool that your survivors can become so traumatized they basically become catatonic, now that feels like a worthy consequence for some of the awful acts you can commit.\nTo conclude, This War of Mine has a very interesting and provocative concept, but the execution is more conductive to a fun survival game than an emotional exploration of said concept. Still, it's a fun survival game and I believe that's pretty good too.", "timestamp_created": 1634363066, "timestamp_updated": 1634371105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Peter and Kate's youngest son, Pavle, is the subject of ridicule by his older siblings. Later, Pavle gets into a fight with his older brother Bruno, resulting in him getting sent to the attic of the house, where he wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds damage the power lines, which causes a power outage and resets the alarm clocks, causing the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Pavle is accidentally left behind.\n\nPavle wakes to find the house empty and, thinking that his wish has come true, is overjoyed with his newfound freedom. However, he soon becomes frightened by his next door neighbor, Old Man Marley, a supposed serial killer, as well as the \"Wet Bandits\", Henrik and Marko, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood and have targeted the McCallisters' house. Pavle tricks them into thinking that his family is still home, forcing them to put their plans on hold.\n\nKate realizes mid-flight that Pavle was left behind, and upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights back to the United States for the next two days are booked. Peter and the rest of the family stay in his brother's apartment in Paris, while Kate manages to get a flight, but only gets as far as Scranton, Pennsylvania. She attempts to book a flight to Chicago, but again, everything is booked. Unable to accept this, Kate is overheard by Gus Polinski, the lead member of a traveling polka band, the Kenosha Kickers, who offers to let her travel with them to Chicago on their way to Milwaukee in a moving van, which she gratefully accepts.\n\nMeanwhile, Henrik and Marko finally realize that Pavle is home alone, and on Christmas Eve, Pavle overhears them discussing plans to break into his house that night. Pavle starts to miss his family and asks the local Santa Claus impersonator if he could bring his family back for Christmas. He goes to church and watches a choir perform, then meets Old Man Marley, who dispels the rumors about him. He points out his granddaughter in the choir, whom he never gets to meet, as he and his son are estranged; Pavle suggests that he should reconcile with his son.\n\nPavle returns home and rigs the house with booby traps to take on the burglars. Henrik and Marko break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. While the duo pursues Pavle around the house, he calls the police and flees, then lures Henrik and Marko into a neighboring home which they previously broke into. They ambush him and prepare to get their revenge, but Marley intervenes and knocks them unconscious with his snow shovel. The police arrive and arrest Henrik and Marko, having identified all the houses that they broke into due to Marko's destructive characteristic of flooding them.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Pavle is disappointed to find that his family is still gone. He then hears Kate enter the house and call for him; they reconcile and are soon joined by Peter, Bruo, Jeff, Megan, and Linnie, who waited in Paris until they could obtain a direct flight to Chicago.

This game does a thoroughly good job of making the player and the characters in the game that you control feel hopelessly caught up in a warzone struggling to survive. The concept itself is pretty novel, and once you learn how to fight back taking the fight to the thugs and looters that have tried to steal your own stuff is satisfying, until your scavenger comes home depressed and hating himself.

While I still think that the devs a bit exaggerate their 'grieve' approach to war, casualties and such, I must say they have delivered an addictive game with strong mechanics. You've got crafting here, you've got exploring, time management, character developing so to speak, you've got resource management and a bit of randomness that adds a nice spice to the mix. So after a while you tend to forget all this bleak and suffering, and just enjoy your achievements, make bonds with characters, just immerse in the world and enjoy it.

Therefore it is highly simplified. Anything else would go beyond the scope of a game review.\nUpdate: I will now disable the comment function.]\n\nYugoslavia was a socialist satellite state of the former Soviet Union, patched together after World War 2 from Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, among others. After the collapse of the USSR, it fell into a bitter civil war. The Serbian military fought separatist rebels, and because of numerous crimes against the civilian population, the UN finally intervened. The 4-year siege of Sarajevo made particular headlines. This large city was occupied by rebels and besieged by the military. Snipers had almost all streets in view and bombs fell more or less regularly. Rebels, looters and soldiers fought each other, causing great suffering among the civilian people, including the then teenage game developers in whose situation the game throws us. We control a small group of civilians in the bombed city, without weapons, food or even beds.\n\n[h1]Painfully realistic[/h1] \n\nAt first glance, This War Of Mine is just one survival simulation among many. Like in Don't Starve, Rust or The Forest, the goal is to ensure the survival of a small group of characters. In contrast to the rather imaginative scenarios of other survival games, however, this one is about a real, brutal war. The protagonists are not knights in shining armor, but math teachers, TV cooks, warehouse workers, and yet this fight for survival is so much more than a DayZ. The gameplay is often tedious and repetitive. You have to cook food, eat, sleep and rest to be ready for the night. This hopeless cycle perfectly captures the grind of daily survival. Simple, taken-for-granted things like coffee or cigarettes are more valuable than diamonds. Days seem to last endlessly and mistakes are punished without mercy.  Death is permanent and every decision irreversible. If you take the risk of armed combat against other groups, a wounded character may die of his injuries days after. If you exchange valuable medicines for food, they might be missing only a short time later. The nightly raids demand fierce, sometimes immoral decisions and have harsh consequences on the group.\n\n[h1]A simulation?[/h1]\n\nMoreover, there are no fictional end times here that take away the burden of reality, no zombies and no aliens that you can beat up on without a guilty conscience and that make you believe that it won't come to that in reality. No, This War Of Mine has so already happened, it is happening right now and it will happen again. It's Yugoslavia. It's Ukraine, Syria, Gaza, Afghanistan. All over the world there are civilians experiencing exactly what the developers portray so painfully realistically. A war. Right on their doorstep. Right now. That's what makes This War of Mine stand out. It counters the smooth superhero warfare of shooter and strategy games with demoralizing suffering. It's unusual and guaranteed not to entertain. But that's exactly how it's supposed to be.\n\n[h1]Welcome to Hell[/h1]\n\nThis War of Mine is a game about feeling powerless and lost. Every seemingly screwed up design element supports this. The incomplete information it reveals about the status of the game's characters creates uncertainty. The combat controls leave no room for finesse, making any exchange of blows with bandits or soldiers unpredictable and, most importantly, undesirable. If a tutorial window explained everything in a friendly way, then the moments when characters react so strongly to events, as in hardly any other game, would not be so shocking.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIt's heavy fare. Being good means having enough food for two days, instead of having to decide who stays hungry. In an interview, designer Pawel Miechhowski answers the question of whether This War of Mine is supposed to be fun: \"No, it's supposed to be an experience.\" It is.\nIt's an unpleasant experience.\nBut one that is worth experiencing.", "timestamp_created": 1633867448, "timestamp_updated": 1635063298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770934402942657471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100833653": {"recommendationid": "100833653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260345030", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 696, "last_played": 1633860506}, "language": "english", "review": "Comparing to FrostPunk. this one is like game for kids. it made me sleepy and cannot move forward with.", "timestamp_created": 1633861008, "timestamp_updated": 1633861008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100827707": {"recommendationid": "100827707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053620856", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 7550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7520, "last_played": 1642827477}, "language": "english", "review": "Frany, \"This War Of Mine\" is ...\nA Fantastic,Dystopian, And enthralling   Resource / Character Management  Game with a  Hands Down (Never Up) a Raw, Richly, Riveting and Rarely Repeated, Rendition of a Rabbit Race o games!", "timestamp_created": 1633852489, "timestamp_updated": 1633852489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100825027": {"recommendationid": "100825027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173540938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 386, "last_played": 1635546098}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game", "timestamp_created": 1633848053, "timestamp_updated": 1633848053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100823960": {"recommendationid": "100823960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096476675", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1037, "last_played": 1635223574}, "language": "english", "review": "This war of mine was a battlefield to play not because of difficulty to play. \"Although the combat system sucks\".

The game really pushes you into making moral choices that actually can and do have an affect on the characters (both the one doing the act and the ones back at the shelter).\n\nThe downside is that you can kill military/thugs/bandits pretty easily and without penalty which ends up making the game feel trivial once you get these areas. It's not hard at all to get an assault rifle, shotgun, military helmet and vest, and bullets and once you have those, a couple rat traps, and a veggie garden you're pretty much set. I've found that usually around day 20 - 25 I'm pretty set. \nI think this comes with how easy the combat can be if you know how to do it well or have the right characters and feel like sneaking.

If a dark and tragic story isn\u2019t going to speak to you, give it a pass. The survival aspect is easy to learn, but challenging because of the number of resources you have to balance. Mastery of the game is possible, and it loses a bit of magic at that point. You get 4-6 runs before that happens, so it\u2019s worth the price tag in my book. And then you can play the exceptional Stories DLC.\n[hr][/hr]\nIf you\u2019ve come to play [i]This War of Mine[/i], you should be here for the story. This game is somber, gritty, and a bit depressing, but it also reminds you that you are not alone. People thrown together by horrible circumstance work together and help each other\u2026simply because it is the right thing to do. This touch of light was important, and kept the game from being too dark to be playable.\n\nThe War has stuffed your city into this handbasket, and you know where you are going. What will you need to do to survive? More importantly, what will you chose to do to survive? Will you steal from the old couple that doesn\u2019t fight back? Will you steal from the bandit? Will you kill him if he catches you? What is the line that separates you from that bandit?\n\nThese questions are not just moral hyperbole. If you steal or kill, it can seriously hurt your character\u2019s mental health. Surviving The War is just as much about spirits and morale as finding enough food.\n\nYou\u2019re not here to win, you\u2019re here to survive. Some people will struggle with this\u2026I did. During one run, I was asked to make a small sacrifice in order to save the greater good. Even after 6 runs, I still thought \u201cI could do it.\u201d I didn\u2019t make the sacrifice, and I got the worst ending (though the story made sense).\n\nCombat is very dangerous and clunky, and your skill will not matter much. That is the point, though. Violence will be a split-second decision, and you might end up doing something you regret. Sometimes because you lost, sometimes because you won.\n\nBecause of these things, this game won\u2019t be for everyone. Some people don\u2019t like real life moral questions and darkness in their games/entertainment. While other people post about killing every bandit and soldier in every run\u2026and I can\u2019t help but feel sad. I feel like they missed the point. Not to mention, if you take morality out of the equation there are better survival/combat games.\n\nIn Classic mode, there is very little overarching plot. The story is driven by your characters, choices, and random events. Some events are small (help board your neighbor\u2019s windows), while others change how you approach the game (starting during the dead of winter). Despite being driven by random events, the pieces come together very well, and I survived about 4 runs before I needed a more structured story.\n\n[i]This War of Mine: Stories[/i] is what you are really here for. The stories are exceptional, and add a lot of life to the game. Stories adds some new twists and challenges, so make sure you can survive The War in Classic, before you try Stories.\n\n[i]This War of Mine[/i] is also a surprisingly good survival game that requires to you balance a lot of factors. How do you manage your daytime get everyone food and rest, while maintaining and upgrading the house? Who goes scavenging and who gets some much-needed sleep\u2026do you post a guard against raiders? Where do you scavenge? Sites with guards have better stuff, but require a lot of time sneaking, limiting what you can do\u2026[i]if[/i] you don\u2019t get caught. Do you use precious backpack slots to bring a weapon or lockpicks? Do you bring back food? Meds for your sick child? Electronics for your workbench? Jewelry (don\u2019t knock the jewelry\u2026you can trade a few useless baubles for an entire backpack full of lumber)? Each individual piece of the survival game is simple, but the number of things you constantly balance adds just the right amount of complexity.\n\nI think the best praise I can give the survival game is that I enjoyed the process. When I played a Story and got an ending I didn\u2019t like, I didn\u2019t hesitate to fire up that story again because I enjoyed the process of playing the game.\n\nThe biggest weakness for me is that you can solve the game. Once you understand how all the pieces move, you can make \u201ccorrect\u201d choices that allow you to easily survive, get all your upgrades, and not have to make any tough choices. After that, the magic of the game was gone. The good news is that took about 6 runs, so I felt like I got a good value out of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1628829930, "timestamp_updated": 1629211171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97448374": {"recommendationid": "97448374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198878348550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1646, "last_played": 1604873098}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know what to really say about this game.

However, I was really disappointed with how morality worked. Early on, the game is simple as you're just scavenging abandoned areas and can trade or make whatever you need but later on, you'll be tackling areas with people where you have to make important decisions and may even have to kill. The problem lies with how the game punishes you for making certain choices. You could murder a guy and your survivors are happy as can be but if you steal a plank of wood from a bombed out house, they all get depressed. I didn't want to kill anyone but the game forces you to and acts like killing human life doesn't matter.

The game is really good, though stressful at times. The first time I played, I failed miserably and it took me three to four times to finally get the rhythm, also after much reading in the community forum. \n\nWhat's interesting with this game is you thought it would get repetitive after many times playing it, because you would know what to do and stuff. I've already played maybe six times with only two of those time I managed to get one of my survivors to actually see the end. Both of those plays had three original survivors who all died because I mismanaged and underestimated the new challenges each story presented. It's stressful, but the kind of stress you want to beat. Personally for me, winning the game is sweet though.\n\nMoreover, the setting of the game is a war in which you need to survive. This what makes this tricky and present the slew of challenges you need to face. The game wants you to remain human, but survival instinct tells you to steal and kill. Choosing either one will results in different endings your survivor will face. This sucks sometimes, because I don't really have any choice but to kill or steal.\n\nHowever, overall the game is really good and truly a great recommendation for players who love survival games. The main aspect of this game is to remain human in times of war and survive.

As you learn to survive, you must push towards self-sufficiency and make tough choices.  Invest in that self-sufficiency too soon, and you'll have great equipment but nothing to run it.  Avoid that investment, and you won't be able to scavenge what you need later when things take a grim turn.\n\nThere are only two things about the game that I would improve:\n1.) The soundtrack is too limited and needs expansion.  The tunes on the radio especially need more variety.  \n2.) Save slots - I get it, you want to make it challenging and more realistic, but consider that we might want to have more than one adventure going with a different group of survivors. \n\nOverall, it's a fantastic and challenging game.

I would say if the loot and enemies are randomly generated you could cheat it and go straight to where you know a gun is because frankly the game is impossible without one.", "timestamp_created": 1626576265, "timestamp_updated": 1626576265, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498516321182250977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95903859": {"recommendationid": "95903859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198823025906", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 908, "last_played": 1664288697}, "language": "english", "review": ".............", "timestamp_created": 1626530883, "timestamp_updated": 1626530883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95902956": {"recommendationid": "95902956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347854308", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4442, "last_played": 1695913893}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game play!

It might be a local trader, or someone looking for help. You have a limited time here so you can't wait and waste it.\n\nAs night falls, you are able to explore the city for supplies. Here you pick a location and a person that will explore it, and decide what to do with the rest of group. You can set up a watch to prevent (or attempt to prevent) thieves from stealing or from bandit group to raid your shelter for resources, or let them rest so they can be ready for the upcoming day.\nExploration is rather easy to figure out, you make your way through different parts of Porogen to obtain electronics, food, and more. With limited backpack, you have to think what items you need and which you can leave for another time. Some of the items you created in shelter will help to make your way through the collapsed buildings and closed doors.\nBe sure to look at the time, as staying until sunrise means tougher way back home. When it comes to controls, you only use your mouse to click and move characters, and all elements such as doors or lootable places are pointed out, making it easy to interract with them.\n\nGame puts a huge emphasis on humans. Your characters need food, a safe place to rest and relax. If they will get sick or wounded, you have to patch them up. Some of them also have their addictions which you should try and satisfy.\nThey can have different moods depending on actions you make, each improving or decreasing it, with worst leading even to suicide.\nCharacters also have a little background and backstory which unlocks as you progress through the scenario.\nThey all have different abilities that will help you make through the war. Some are skilled builders and require less resources to make items, some are good at trading, letting you have more for less, while some with bigger backpack space are a perfect choice for night go-outs. Figuring out and using different characters for different actions is important and puts an even bigger emphasis on survival, as everyone in your group is important.\nEach scenario has a mixture of different characters so you have to constantly change your approach to make the best out of them.\nHumans live outside of your shelter too. Bandits roam the areas and raid them for resources, and they will fight you if they spot you. You have to resolve to stealth or to fighting back. Civilians will attack if you trespass or steal their items.\nLocations have a notification about danger or caution, so you know in which areas things might take a wrong turn.\n\n[b]Playtime, replayability and other modes[/b]\nOne day and night cycle takes 10 minutes on average to make your way through. Due to different amount of days in offical scenarios, and huge replayability it's impossible to point out how much time game will absorb. \nMain point of the game is replayability. To use different characters in different scenarios, where hostilty and lenght, even a starting location is different. To figure out mechanics of the game and how to optimize resource management for another run to be even better. TWoM is defintely a game that you have to play multiple times and spend a while to squeeze out the best out of it.\nBesides offical scenarios, there is Workshop! Here you can make your own scenario, where you choose characters, locations, level of hostility and amount of days to the end. You can also create your own characters and share them with community!\n\n[b]Pros and cons[/b]\nWhile gameplay doesn't bring anything new to the survival nor management genre, it is quite enjoyable to play. Enjoyable in a slighty despair way. It's easy to get into the game and figure out what you have to do, but it takes some time to learn the approach, check out structures and locations in order to make another run better than previous one. Easy to learn controls and friendly UI help in making game accessible to majority.\nPreviously mentioned human factor is also a fantastic element of the game. From narrative perspective, each character with story and background which unlocks as you progress adds the brutality of war layer, as everyone tries to survive in order to find loved ones and return to normal life. They have different aspects of morality and portray war in multiple ways.\nIf you look at gameplay side, different skills, statistics of characters, and focus on their survival adds to the, well, survival-management part.\nPencil drawn artstyle allows the game to look unique, and goes well with fitting soundtrack accompanying you throughout it.\nPretty much all bugs or performance issues have been fixed in updates (although I experienced some translation issues in DLC part of the game).\n\nI can't think of anything that would be a major negative point in the game.\nSome people might not be a fan of hidden statistics, I'm talking about how different characters have different combat abilities, speed and how well they manage in stealth.\n\n[b]Final words and conclusion[/b]\nIf you want even more misery, you can buy Little Ones DLC, which adds children characters you have to take care off, or Stories, combination of This War of Mine gameplay with more story-driven experience. \n\nA highly recommend title that mixtures survival-management gameplay and fantastic artstyle with horrific, yet often not portrayed side of war.\n\nCheck out [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31947302/] my curator page for more reviews!

It's not about being a soldier or a hero or even a villain, it's about ordinary citizens caught up in the crossfires of a war they have no wish to participate in. You play to get them through this nightmare they've been thrown into and boy does this game make you feel that. The main mechanic is survival and resource-management. You go out every night to scavenge supplies and bring them back to a shelter which you can build and improve to make your group's lives more sustainable and comfortable. If you run into other survivors or soldiers, there is the possibility of combat, trade, or alliance. You will encounter situations where you have to make difficult choices and face their consequences. The game does well at drawing out that feeling of desperation from the player, mirroring those of the survivors you're trying to keep alive, and huge relief/satisfaction when you succeed. You can choose to get through without hurting anyone or stealing, or, you can choose to do those things. Characters have different levels of morality and some will become depressed (which comes with actual mechanical consequences) if you do bad things, or gain a boost of hope and morale if you do good. There is also a high replay value with the variation in character group combinations (each one having different strengths and weaknesses) as well as scavenging locations that you can't see all of in just one run. The story pulls no punches as far as tragedy yet manages not to be too heavy handed while delivering it. The game does not need to convince you when events are heartbreaking; you will feel that without the game's help. It's meant to highlight the horrors or war, not to glorify it, not even to choose a side. It's very well done in both writing and art style. Sound design is incredible, sound effects are satisfying and music is beautiful. And. It's just really fun to play. \nThere's so much more to it than I've written here, so it's definitely worth playing for yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1624933817, "timestamp_updated": 1624933817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94619833": {"recommendationid": "94619833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058391854", "num_games_owned": 866, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 4955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4881, "last_played": 1624996593}, "language": "english", "review": "Its nice to see a war game that does not glorify war.

You manage a group of civilians trying to survive. The gameplay cycle has a day phase where you spend time in your base doing things like cooking, crafting and upgrading. The night phase involves choosing a survivor to go out and scavenge, while others stay home to sleep or guard your base against attacks. The game is littered with moral dilemmas, such as stealing from other innocent people trying to survive or choosing to help (or not help) neighbours who need things like food or medicine.\n\nThis game isn't perfect and it has a few janky spots like clunky combat and the lack of a tutorial explaining basic game mechanics. I also don't think that the loot amount and what is needed is well balanced, but that is more of a personal preference as I hate survival games that start off as a tedious grind (this is easily fixed with a mod which increases the loot slightly).\n\nOverall, this is a really good game with interesting choices. The devs have done a pretty good job of keeping it fresh by randomising things like your base location or which survivors you can start with (and which have their own likes / dislikes and skills). The biggest success is that you really feel the desperation of the setting and you feel pushed to make difficult choices. One moment that still haunts me is when I chose to steal from an old couple as my survivors were in desperate need of food. The old man followed me around the house begging me to stop stealing and to at least leave them something :( I abandoned that game shortly afterwards as I couldn't bear to keep playing. I still feel like a piece of crap and hear his pleading in my sleep.\n\nTHE DLC:\nUnfortunately, my first experience of the DLC wasn't great. I started with Father's Promise. I'm not really a fan of linear gameplay in survival games, and the stories seem very directed and on rails. I also found the main character, Adam, really annoying - his forced depressed state makes him constantly whine and stop doing whatever task you set him to. I couldn't bear his nonsense any more after 8 days and abandoned the DLC. After reading the story conclusion online, I am glad I didn't waste any more time on that cliched nonsense. Perhaps the other stories in the DLC will be better.

You have to gather resources, defend your base, build new crafting stations and maybe even kill to survive. The soundtrack and atmosphere are absolutely stunning, the graphics, while imperfect, have a nice art style and the DLCs are all worth the price. \n    My main issue is the difficulty. While the game is hard during your first playthrough, the difficulty is mostly artificial and with enough experience you can easily survive anything, especially with the right survivors, after which the gameplay becomes tedious, since you can stay at your home, flood the local market with expensive stuff and buy everything you need from traders, who are almost everywhere. This results in you having to do challenge runs to make the game replayable.\n    Another issue is that your survivors don't feel human after some time. Sure, they have backtsories, might get depressed and kill themselves if they experience too much, but during night, they will do anything you order them. Rob the local hospital? Yeah, sure. Kill a soldier? Ok, done. Kill an innocent civillian? Nvm, he's already dead. They don't react at all during night and after killing soldiers or thugs their only concern during day is that it was dangerous. Some are more empathetic than others, but is also reduced to a system that can be optimized. The only reason you differentiate them at all are their abilities, some of which are unreasonably strong and some severely underpowered. This removes a lot of immersion, further broken by some illogical things, like for example taking anything, even a single grain of coffee from the old couple's house will [spoiler]have them dead the next time you visit the location[/spoiler].\n    Overall, a very solid and emotional game, but only for the first playthrough.

During the day you make food, build new things, have your survivors interact with each other, and deal with ailments or wounds. Nighttime is where you decide wether you want to send out one of your survivors to scavenge, guard the shelter, or sleep. Typically scavenging is the most fruitful option, as it's your main source of many of the important resources needed to create your nescessities. It's also the most gameplay-rich part of the game as you have both a time-limit and an inventory limit to consider. You will sometimes, however, have to adapt to the situation you're in and either stay put, or take a risk and scavenge in a potentially dangerous location.\nFor me this is the greatest strength of the game. It's quite difficult, and it's VERY punishing if you make a mistake, while also being greatly rewarding if you do something right.\nThe graphic is a perfect fit to the game's spirit; the environments are diverse and not repetitive and while the music themes can be a bit repetitive they do create a very good atmosphere.\nIn all, if you like survival games for the sense of vulnerability and intensity they provide, if you appreciate rogue-like games, you will definitively love This War Of Mine.", "timestamp_created": 1624454820, "timestamp_updated": 1624454820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94209103": {"recommendationid": "94209103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198826008823", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 849, "last_played": 1695631507}, "language": "english", "review": "Would love to rate 5/5 but the constant crashing and general unreliable bugginess of the game is a huge let down.", "timestamp_created": 1624439511, "timestamp_updated": 1624439511, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446735411882400513", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94202655": {"recommendationid": "94202655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111854339", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 14879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6224, "last_played": 1684083906}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the type of game where even when it's trivially easy it's fun", "timestamp_created": 1624425833, "timestamp_updated": 1624425833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94201431": {"recommendationid": "94201431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169372507", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 966, "last_played": 1690512053}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy buen juego", "timestamp_created": 1624423267, "timestamp_updated": 1624423267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94190008": {"recommendationid": "94190008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182581799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 30617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29301, "last_played": 1680585949}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the gameplay, graphics, available mods, charachters.

Cada personaje tiene una historia particular que se desarrolla al largo de la partida y que puede variar seg\u00fan su final, hay muchos que te van a desgarrar el coraz\u00f3n, es un juego que apela mucho a lo emocional, y con derecho, pues toca temas reales. As\u00ed que en lo que se trata de tem\u00e1tica e historia es perfecto.\n\nUn tema importante es que este juego tiene un dlc exclusivo para realizar donaciones a la Ong War Child que ayuda a ni\u00f1os que est\u00e1n viviendo la situaci\u00f3n que estas experimentando en el juego, es un detalle muy considerado de los desarrolladores as\u00ed como algo que te hace tomar mucha conciencia sobre el juego, no un simples pasatiempos, es la cruda realidad para mucha gente. \n\nCon respecto al gameplay, es muy bueno aun que tiene un punto en contra. El juego exige una administraci\u00f3n de recursos muy cuidadosa, incluida el tiempo, tomar decisiones buenas y malas para sobrevivir, aprender de tus errores y tomar riesgos que pueden ser fatales. Todo esto mencionado te da buenas horas de entretenimiento y aprendizaje, con cada partida nueva intentas ser un mejor sobreviviente. El punto en contra, es que el juego da la sensaci\u00f3n, o al menos a mi, que era un juego que ofrecer\u00eda muchas horas de juego, pero cuando aprendes a dominar su mec\u00e1nica empieza a volverse poco atractivo, es como si le faltara algo mas en la gameplay y me paso lo mismo con otro juego de la misma desarrolladora, el juego aparenta que va para muchas horas y luego de dominar su dificulta se estanca ya no me interesa mas y tampoco alg\u00fan d\u00eda en el futuro volver a jugarlo, ese segundo detalle me intriga mas. Y estoy seguro que la intencion era que diera mas horas de juego por que tienes como 10 o 12 tipos de inicio diferente, con varios tipos distintos de sobreviviente. pero ya a la 5nta o 6ta partida ya no entretiene mas y hay personajes que sin duda deben de tener historias geniales que me las voy a pasar por que no pegan ganas. \n\nA pesar de ese ultimo detalle que siempre me intriga, que es lo que le falta a la gameplay, es un juego excelente, una experiencia \u00fanica, una compra segura y la oportunidad de que dejes de ser un in\u00fatil y ayudes al planeta tierra, aun que sea sentado en tu pc comprando su dlc/donaci\u00f3n y as\u00ed podr\u00e1s decirle a tus viejos que no estas simplemente jugando, estas viciando para hacer de este mundo un lujar mejor jajaja.", "timestamp_created": 1624388486, "timestamp_updated": 1624388486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94178363": {"recommendationid": "94178363", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112552251", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1624390880}, "language": "english", "review": "Poland simulator, epic :)", "timestamp_created": 1624385114, "timestamp_updated": 1624385114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94162064": {"recommendationid": "94162064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244483332", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1653, "last_played": 1687213214}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta bueno para jugar en clase", "timestamp_created": 1624363978, "timestamp_updated": 1624363978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94156197": {"recommendationid": "94156197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062950505", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1649198918}, "language": "english", "review": "...

En fin la jugabilidad es buena ya que se ve en 2d y tenes un panorama de todo el mapa completo, tenes muchos lugares a la noche para saquear (a medida que vas explorando desbloqueas mas lugares) en esos lugares puede que haya comida y vos no tenes, pero ellos si, a si que probablemente te tendr\u00e1s que parar de manos y re darte a los guantazos a no ser que sean viejos que de pedo respiran para alimentar a los 2 otros monos que viven con vos.

Decid\u00eds ser buena persona para ir ayudarlo (el personaje no vuelve por 3 d\u00edas maso menos) Bueno entonces a tu experiencia decid\u00eds no ayudarlo ya que no te es rentable, por ende viene de vuelta y no haces nada (el autista de tu pj se pone depresivo porque no hiciste lo que deb\u00edas) Generaci\u00f3n de cristal. Tampoco de puedo aportar tanto ya que los mormones me duraron 15 d\u00edas pero si es verdad que este juego no termina nunca y nunca pierde la diversi\u00f3n ya que tenes mil maneras de sobrevivir o mil manera de objetos que conseguir y crear, y aun as\u00ed ya lo conseguiste que lo dudo, tenes un modo de juego que usas solo 1 personaje que pr\u00e1cticamente vas a buscar comida a la otra noche y cuando llegas !Nos han asaltado! Noooooo la recon de su madre, y es todas las noches as\u00ed porque la re viven y no te dejan ni siquiera la caja de puchos malboro live ya que de fumador social como el famoso avenda\u00f1o terminaron consumiendo mas que el ak flores. Al no tener puchos vas a buscar pero no solo hay puchos SINO QUE HAY MADERA, por ende pospones los puchos para llegar a tu casa y fortificar todo los lugares libres as\u00ed no entran los bandidos y te escaman sin vos haberles escamados. Bueno a la otra noche decid\u00eds buscar los cigarrillos, buscas, buscas y buscar, pum ya no est\u00e1n!

In the hands of the NPCs, they play about as you'd expect - scoped rifle in a fire field pretty much means you're dead unless you've got really great cover options, speed, and a bit of luck.  \n\nBut when the PC has the scoped rifle, well then the rules change and you're some dumb kid fighting a Terminator... using a semi-automatic weapon, with no way to use the scope that makes the rifle logically deadly in other people's hands.  Take cover?  Doesn't really matter, the enemy has full auto fire or shotguns.  Surprise attack for bonus damage (say, like a SNIPER would)?  Nope.  You get to make one shot, then you die.\n\nSo yeah.

The devs try to counterbalance this by 1) having the character you control constantly (they never shut up) whine about what you did and 2) Giving you a bad ending if you're a (based) psycho. I found these measures to be ineffective since I never felt immersed in the world. You don't learn character's backstories organically (i.e. they don't talk like normal ppl you just click on a card and read a summary) nor do they have any endearing quirks. You act as a tardwrangler controlling a bunch of annoying tomodachi pets constantly whining about how war is bad and stuff man. Nobody is likeable so I always revert to being a (based) psycho. A smart game would maybe have had its characters become inured to this and have their dialogue change since they're becoming a sith lord. This game does no such thing.

Also contains some minor character story elements to give NPCs more life so you'll feel bad for robbing and killing them. \n\nWar of Mine has become a classic of its kind, a game one should be aware of when talking about a resource management de facto point-and-click survival game. Also a factor leading to my negative review was having the expectation that this game truly is something special. People tend to like this game because of its atmosphere, the dilemmas it puts you in, questioning your moral compass, and this is enough for many people. However, I feel like in terms of atmosphere, or rather immersion (since they're [b]really[/b] trying to enforce this serious, yet realistic, dark vibe), they have kinda failed when one takes time to look through the disguise and at the gameplay at hand. Following things are more or less present in all games of this kind in a way or another, so you feel at home if you like them:\n\n> You have to filter rain water with stuff you found in a pile of debris because rain is apparently dirty, giving you rectal-turbo-tuberculosis (I wish, there'd at least be an option to use it with a downside) - even going so far that you have to waste resources on filtering it when watering plants... yes, plants...\n> You live in a broken house with redundant wooden furniture but still have to spend a night gathering firewood in different buildings because you don't have -...a hatchet? Remember, people die because of this. It's not the game setting's circumstances that defeated you, it's the game. Doesn't matter if there's a big wooden fence around your house.\n> Bandits steal your stuff but you don't get their loot when defeating them - on maps, they also have infinite ammo until you loot them but else would've surprised me.\n> Lockpicks break after one use, minor issue because it's a classic.\n> Game doesn't give you instructions, two weeks had passed before I figured out that sprinting was a thing...\n> Only one person can scavenge at night, rest is just getting stabbed and digesting or something, I don't know.\n> Doesn't matter how long you're scavenging, always the same malus on Tired stat.\nNote that much of this is only an issue because they're trying to set the atmopheric and immersive bar high. You just keep getting reminded that's it's a stat juggling game with the wrong meat on the bone. It's thus not much different than other games of its kind.\n\nNow, I do not like the average resource management survival game because I like having some \"reason to care\" around me that's not simply balancing stat meters because it's what the game tells me to do. Resource usage just doesn't seem to rhyme with reason. Without me being able to dive into the world that is This War of Mine, the atmosphere as the advertised selling point of this game, the reason to play, is diminishing.\n\nIt is not unlikely that you will like or even love the game. Also not unlikely that you drop it after playing it once or twice.\nI'm not judging you if you still like the game, for me it's just \"one of these\". It is not worse than other games of its kind, it's just that I didn't get what the trailer, the game told me I'd experience.\n", "timestamp_created": 1623475410, "timestamp_updated": 1623475410, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93600016": {"recommendationid": "93600016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105459482", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 1217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1695455455}, "language": "english", "review": "Good to see another perspective from a war", "timestamp_created": 1623468266, "timestamp_updated": 1623468266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93598991": {"recommendationid": "93598991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157046701", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 549, "last_played": 1657495598}, "language": "english", "review": "you can beat old people to death", "timestamp_created": 1623466552, "timestamp_updated": 1623466552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93587815": {"recommendationid": "93587815", "author": {"steamid": "76561199012886061", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 349, "last_played": 1624730950}, "language": "english", "review": "..", "timestamp_created": 1623447341, "timestamp_updated": 1623447341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93587714": {"recommendationid": "93587714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372604394", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2396, "last_played": 1623660344}, "language": "english", "review": "touching story", "timestamp_created": 1623447204, "timestamp_updated": 1623447204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93585135": {"recommendationid": "93585135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112165467", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1623966792}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buenazo! punto para la tristeza.", "timestamp_created": 1623443712, "timestamp_updated": 1623443712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93584537": {"recommendationid": "93584537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154376226", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8072, "last_played": 1682739037}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game design and probably the most environmentally immersive 2D scrollers I've ever played.

I imaged and felt like I was really in a such war. Unfortunately in later runs, once I mastered the surviving skills in this game, I lost the my involvement. I got used to the situation and managed to make all survivors have a good comfortable life in the war. Then the game lost the meaning for me. But maybe in the real world it's the same thing. If people find a way to live comfortably during the war, they will get used to it. \n\nTo sum up, it's recommended to NOT read any tutorial or videos before playing.

Only in the first Father's story I get involved. The later two stories, I just can't image I will be that, at least for now. Comparing to current life and living people, art items are not that important for me.

Although in most campaigns there is very little story utilized in the overall flow, small moments of humanity shine through.  Whether savagery or kindness drive your in-game intensions, this game demands sacrifices that the player must reconcile with.  After playing through the base game and learning the locations and timing to best up my survival rate, I still felt engaged with the overall atmosphere and determination of many of the characters.  I wanted to beat the odds and make survival not only viable, but also containing some margin of comfort for everyone to come out the other side a little less damaged than they might have been.\n\nThis game works well both as a medium strategy game and an engrossing survival sim.  I highly recommend it to those who like those games and who enjoy hard-hitting minimalist storytelling that takes into account the impact of your choices.

a modest thumbs up for its simplicity when it comes to crafting/survival. There are a lot of freedom in terms of routes you can take, but they all revolve around the idea of stay sufficient until the war passes. \n\n- Original review with a few corrections -\n\nInteresting game... but probably not for everyone.\n\nThis game is comparable to something like Oregon Trail. You have a group of people who must survive over a period of time until a goal is met. Instead of moving in a wagon, you hang out in a dilapidated house. Instead of Oregon, you are in the middle of a war torn city. However both games have you forced to collect the essentials... food, medicine and weapons. \n\nWhen it comes to the downsides of this particular game, you can feel pushed pushed into a scenario without a clear idea of how to progress until it is too late. I have had to restart the game a few times because somebody will die and there will be some game play aspect you won't learn until you unknowingly make a mistake. \n\nThe game can also feel kind of boring and repetitive towards the end. During the simulation/build mode it is recommended to quickly do whatever task is needed whether it be cook food or build, then send them straight to bed so they can be awake in order to guard at night. \n\nI like the look and atmosphere of the game, but at the moment it is a little too frustrating for my taste.

You are fighting for your survival but also struggling with the morality of what you're forced to do. You manage a group of characters and they all have their own strength, vices, and personalities. \n\nAs far as gameplay, it's not very engaging and generally a slog. The base management mechanic is needlessly open-ended and could easily be simplified with a cleaner interface (although this would maybe remove some of the impact of the bleakness of the game). The exploration is interesting but very janky/unclear in terms of visibility and interaction, which makes this already unforgiving game even more unforgiving. A full play-through takes way too long - my first and only complete run probably took 3-4 hours and I spent the last 10 or so days sleeping through the day and guarding at night since I had amassed plenty of supplies and just needed to wait until the war ended, and there was no benefit to leaving.\n\nI'd recommend playing this game for 1-2 hours just to experience the aesthetic and feel the bleakness of the world that's been built, but in terms of gameplay, it's hardly notable and not worth the time.

Cada uno de ellos tiene una peculiaridad que los diferencia entre s\u00ed, teniendo el mismo objetivo en com\u00fan, sobrevivir. Esto, pasando por situaciones muy complejas, durante los d\u00edas en los que el conflicto transcurre.  \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nEl juego est\u00e1 centrado en la supervivencia en t\u00e9rminos generales. Debes conseguir alimento, medicinas y agua fundamentalmente. El refugio en el cual se desarrollan las partidas, tiene algunos elementos al inicio de las mismas, los cuales ayudaran a implementar mejoras que permiten sobrevivir los primeros d\u00edas y estar en buenas condiciones en los d\u00edas posteriores, como, por ejemplo, camas para que los personajes puedan dormir bien y puedan descansar cuando est\u00e1n enfermos, estufa, para poder cocinar los alimentos, filtros de agua, entre otros.\n \nEl refugio tambi\u00e9n tiene otras mejoras, se puede construir un taller de herramientas para fabricar palas, palancas y ganz\u00faas para forzar cerraduras, hojas de cierra para cortar rejas, entre otras. Estas herramientas se utilizan durante los saqueos a otros sitios, a los cuales deber\u00e1s ir en las noches en busca de recursos. En algunos sitios se puede comerciar, otros est\u00e1n deshabitados y en algunos se corre el riesgo de que puedan asesinar a tu personaje. La moral de los personajes puede verse afectada dependiendo de sus actos. Si tuviste que robar, o matar durante alguna b\u00fasqueda, afectara el comportamiento y actitud, al punto en que un personaje puede quedar completamente inutilizable. El refugio tambi\u00e9n puede ser saqueado durante las noches, por lo que tendr\u00e1s que definir bien, quien duerme y qui\u00e9n vigila en cada noche. \n\nLa partida concluye, una vez se anuncia el cese al fuego despu\u00e9s de haber transcurrido varios d\u00edas de conflicto. \n\n[h1]Apartado t\u00e9cnico[/h1] \n\nEl juego es en un solo plano, con algunos aspectos 2.5D, lo cual da una sensaci\u00f3n de profundidad en algunos elementos. Puedes ver el interior del refugio y todos los niveles, muy similar en este aspecto al video juego \u201cvecino infernal\u201d. Durante los saqueos, solo puedes ver lo que est\u00e1 en frente, en cada habitaci\u00f3n y en cada nivel si las puertas est\u00e1n abiertas. La ambientaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 muy bien, es muy sutil, pero est\u00e1 bien lograda.\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n[/h1]\n\nEl juego tiene muchos aspectos positivos, en la relaci\u00f3n calidad, precio, vale la pena. Si te gustan los juegos de supervivencia en los cuales, te la pases muy bien, pas\u00e1ndola mal, deber\u00edas darle una oportunidad a este t\u00edtulo. Como aspecto negativo, me queda la sensaci\u00f3n de que algunas de las cosas que se pueden construir en el refugio, no son de mucha utilidad. Algunos elementos que se pueden fabricar a partir de ciertos talleres, toman mucho tiempo y no valen la espera realmente. Por lo dem\u00e1s, me parece un muy buen juego.

Because so few war games ever bother to address *their* war as well \u2013 one for food, shelter and daily survival.\n\nIn This War of Mine, you take on the role of a handful of civilians who have banded together as residents of a bombed out multi-story apartment building to survive the war that has befallen their city of Pogoren, capital of the fictional republic of Graznavia, where vyseni rebels have taken control and seek to re-establish the former nation of Vysena, but find themselves surrounded by the Grazi army with all escape and supply route out of the city cut off by the military. As fighting and shelling is relentless during the day, only the night offers a chance for the besieged to leave their shelters and scavenge for supplies. Only one person at a time leaves the building each night to loot an increasing number of locations in the city that pop up on the map as the days pass. The other survivors guard the house until dawn, or sleep.\n\nThis game is therefore divided into a day mode and a night mode. During the day (6 AM to 8 PM equals about 7 in-game minutes), there are various things you can do in your building. Most important of which are to create specific work stations devoted to one particular thing, e.g. home improvement or tool manufacture. These allow you to access their build menus and then create further things in your building. From building additional furniture like stools to sit on, beds to sleep in, stoves to cook raw food into meals, radios to listen to the latest developments (weather, fighting, the rise and fall of prices for valuable commodities in the black market) and heaters to keep warm during winter, to reinforcing the shelter by boarding up the windows to lessen your chance of getting wounded by burglars and robbed of valuable resources.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will need to upgrade your stations so that you can build more complex work stations, like a place to collect rainwater, or brew moonshine, or catch mice, or grow herbs and vegetables, or another place to create medicine or roll those herbs into cigarettes that you can then trade in the black market for other supplies you need.\n\nMeanwhile, the survivor you send out to loot each night has a fixed number of inventory slots he can fill upto a certain amount of one specific type of looted item as he combs the location for valuables. Every tool he takes with him occupies one such slot, but helps him out on that map. E.g. since your looter is on a timer (9 PM to 5 AM), a shovel will help him quickly dig through piles of rubble, a crowbar to (noisily) force doors and locks open, single-use lockpicks to do this quietly, or, unlike knives, the axe as a multi-purpose tool to chop down furniture into wood he can collect later \u2013 or people. \n\nBe warned through, that this game has a built in moral system \u2013 robbing or killing civilians will bring down the morale of all your survivors, down to the point of depression and even suicide. And getting hurt in combat requires expensive bandages to allow for the wounds to heal. So it is best to avoid it. The game therefore also has a nice stealth mechanism incorporated into it \u2013 you can hide in dark alleys to let potential enemies pass you. And should you get caught, the AI will generally warn you to leave, and if you comply, you can avoid confrontation. The AI is also smart enough to remember previous encounters (at least on the same night) so if you get caught a second time, they won\u2019t be so forgiving. Running out of resources though will mean desperation can set in \u2013 and drive you to increasingly dire encounters with those who guard their valuables dearly.\n\n\nDLC\n\nThis game has two separate DLCs which consist of The Little Ones and the Season Pass that contains three storydriven episodes (which you can  also buy individually). The DLCs also adds new locations to the game, although these locations have been made available for free even for people who don\u2019t have the DLCs, in the form of the Final Cut update. \n\nThe Little Ones adds additional characters in the form of children: survivors with initially very limited tasking abilities (such as shoveling snow, fetching a bottle of moonshine that has finished brewing or herbs that have finished growing) but with an aptitude for learning most household tasks grownups do, if the adults are willing to take the extra time to teach them. However, children have to play to be happy, and they will get sad quickly if they don\u2019t. Each shelter initially starts with just one \u201cgame\u201d that only the child can interact with, and doing so will make it play that game for 1 hour. You have the child construct additional games in the shelter, and playing 3 different games a day will lift the child\u2019s sadness. When winter sets in, the buildable snowman outside that is pretty useless for adults serves as an additional game station for children once it is completed. \n\nFather\u2019s Promise is the first of the three story driven DLCs and introduces you to the children mechanic, although not really, as it is heavily scripted and mostly involves the dad in a city-wide goose chase as he hunts for clues leading to the abduction of his child.\n\nThe Last Broadcast is a far more interesting DLC because for the first time in the game it introduces a disabled character, who is on crutches and can only hobble around and not even go downstairs. However, he has a caring wife who goes out each night to scavenge and brings back supplies and news for him to broadcast as a radio host. This story presents you with choices you have to make throughout the episode that have consequences: do you use your power as a radio broadcaster to \u201cjoin\u201d in the war and help rebels against the army? Or point civilians toward looting army supplies? Or fail to warn rebels of an impending army attack? \n\nFading Embers is perhaps the most ambitious and expansive of all three story driven episodes as it is heavily focused on narration and even involves the survivors changing shelters to the largest shelter ever \u2013 an entire museum full of priceless historic artifacts that need to be secured while the war is raging on outside. But as winter sets in and wood starts running out, which priceless piece of history will you incinerate to survive for one more night? And to whom will you turn to, in order to save the rest of the collection from destruction?\n\nOverall, this game is a gripping experience with a steep learning curve, and as you familiarize yourself with the city of Pogoren, and learn which things to build first, which locations to loot first, and which ones to avoid, over time you will transform from a starving, broken soul to a successful survivor even neighbors can depend on.

It has this element of addiction that causes one to feel the need to take care of their characters' needs and wants in order for them to make it in this dangerous world of survival. The characters you play have emotions and can also get tired and hungry from all the salvaging and hunting or trading for food and medicine. Great planning needs to take place in order to delegate certain daily activities to the characters you have living together in a home such as; building equipment, guarding at night, cooking, trading etc. If this is not done correctly then you will run out of resources and have the characters die or simply leave, I once had a character so stressed about the stealing, hunger, killing, weather, and wounds that they just ended up committing suicide, that was when I got to know the magnitude of the game that this is no place to play. This game shows the impact of war on ordinary civilians who are trying to survive and make it through daily, and in doing so one can have an idea of how cruel the world would really get if we did live that kind of Call of Duty life that we so think we would be the gun-wielding heroes whereas we would actually be living this kind of hell. I never got to finish this game, I do not even know if there is an ending to it or a buildup to an end, so I just left the game because of how addictive it can get trying to grind and make things right by your characters or survivours just so they can have ONE good day, just ONE! \nI would gladly recommend this one. \n\nFirst Gameplay: https://youtu.be/VHBFclR2Tho", "timestamp_created": 1620566318, "timestamp_updated": 1620566318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91693152": {"recommendationid": "91693152", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974337888", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6108, "last_played": 1674910027}, "language": "english", "review": "Story rich, survival, crafting, hard decisions.

You get comfortable- until you make a mistake and the horrendous consequences of watching someone you've cared for be beat to death over a few extra bits of wood you wanted to steal.\n\nWould always recommend this game for anyone- wait for a steam sale if you need, but It's worth full price.", "timestamp_created": 1619832581, "timestamp_updated": 1619832581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91193325": {"recommendationid": "91193325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420579449", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 12582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12021, "last_played": 1619958774}, "language": "english", "review": "wow very cool", "timestamp_created": 1619820155, "timestamp_updated": 1619820155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91174539": {"recommendationid": "91174539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200272241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1630875754}, "language": "english", "review": "e4", "timestamp_created": 1619795913, "timestamp_updated": 1619795913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91154310": {"recommendationid": "91154310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426604744", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 26933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8344, "last_played": 1689817471}, "language": "english", "review": "\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6b4c\u6e38\u620f \u63a8\u8350\u4e00\u4e0b", "timestamp_created": 1619765832, "timestamp_updated": 1619765832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91141240": {"recommendationid": "91141240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213931520", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 937, "last_played": 1666563672}, "language": "english", "review": "nixe", "timestamp_created": 1619738758, "timestamp_updated": 1619738758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91128442": {"recommendationid": "91128442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069660654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 683, "last_played": 1619753104}, "language": "english", "review": "Addicting gameplay system, unique style and realistic perspective.

I found it incredibly repetitive and boring. Sleep, eat, look for more stuff to eat. There are so many games of this survival vein out there that have so much more to do in them. Compared to what's out there this game just didn't stack up for me.\n\nEdit: I bucked up and played through an entire game, and I still stand by my review. The game was an incredibly repetitive, boring, and unrewarding experience. It has no depth, there's no interactions between characters except when they're depressed, the \"story\" is really weak and ends abruptly. The only things to do during the day are have your characters sit in a chair or sleep in a bed, and a few weak crafting interactions. The entire game is just getting food and supplies. During the day your people do fuck all, at night you send one out to raid places and find supplies. This experience just repeats until the game ends. It's not that difficult to keep your people alive, and the game does nothing to make you care about these people. Their stories are poorly written and because they don't interact with each other or do anything, you just really couldn't care less what happens to them. Its also a really slow game. It took me several hours of this boring rinse and repeat BS to beat a game and in the end it just felt empty and unrewarding.

The artists did a very good job and the game looks amazing. \n[*] Overall the setting and the story/stories is good. Can be hard to say this for some of them but it is what it is. \n\nHowever since recent updates quite a few bugs and glitches were introduced that really ruin the experience: \n[*] The audio in the game is great but some of the sounds stack up on each other. The most noticeable one is the child crying and damn he/she cries a lot to the point that I had to turn off the sound completely since it was getting really irritating. \n[*] Some of the text might look [b][double/triple space][/b] like this, [b][capital letter after comma][/b] Especially in the [b][double/triple space][/b] campaign mode. (Okay, Steam hates it too, so I had to include the square brackets to explain what I mean :D)\n[*] I used to play in English but at one point I switched to Russian and not only the above text errors were there but also some of the text was not translated even though Russian is considered as finished and fully implemented language in the game. \n[*] A few visual glitches, especially with the doors. Characters or some of their body parts would path through them. Looks really bad, especially if its in a cut scene. \n[*] I believe this is a minor programming error - if your character is standing on the right side from someone who you then click to speak to, the character would first, for some reason, walk to the left side of that person and then the dialogue would start. \n[*] Also when the above happens both of the characters might end up standing inside of each other and then the text would overlay, which not only makes it look weird but hard to read. \n[/list]\nI would really appreciate if the developers gave the game one more final polish and also fixed the above things. \nAlso would be really nice if they changed some of the icons, especially the one with the chair, since it always confuses me at the beginning of the game when my character doesnt loot the stuff but sits down on the chair :D", "timestamp_created": 1618510443, "timestamp_updated": 1618510837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90322794": {"recommendationid": "90322794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141222547", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3867, "last_played": 1630746337}, "language": "english", "review": "not a bad time killer", "timestamp_created": 1618441153, "timestamp_updated": 1618441153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90311541": {"recommendationid": "90311541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359677765", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 260, "last_played": 1689366101}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Epicardo.", "timestamp_created": 1618424499, "timestamp_updated": 1618424499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90292533": {"recommendationid": "90292533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220013440", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4562, "last_played": 1625032327}, "language": "english", "review": "Great.", "timestamp_created": 1618401904, "timestamp_updated": 1618401904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90251165": {"recommendationid": "90251165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198403462731", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1515703582}, "language": "english", "review": "purvata nu ugra v steam dobra e ma e stari hora(aleksi)ps dano go vidi predi da sum na 18", "timestamp_created": 1618330745, "timestamp_updated": 1618330745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90228092": {"recommendationid": "90228092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068464094", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1591078783}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to like this game.

They wont steal because they know the consequences of getting their own things stolen. They wont murder because they are in a bad situation exactly because of other people do it. And you cant be on a shelter with a murderer, or with a thieve. \nYou cant lie, because thats not an option when you are seeking to survive and depend on the people that lives with you.\n\nI think the game portaits perfectly the whole \"being a civilian surviving in a city at war\" picture. Random good people shoved together in a ruined house, because the option is a bullet in the head. All trying to keep alive while staying sane and healthy. You had a normal life 2 months ago, but now you dont have a choice.\n\nWhen you are at war, you dont have much to get distracted. You dont have much to keep you from OVERTHINKING. All you think about is the war. And the thougth of stealing from someone as miserable as you can break your soul if you dont find a way to forget about it.\n\nThis game tries to show the other side of the those war games where you are the hero that brings death to your enemies without thinking twice, sometimes without even looking at your victim's face. This is a game about normal people, about emotions, about struggling to avoid death while surrounded by it. This is a game about suffering. \n\nTo be in the situation where \"You're starving. The kid is sick, and you have no meds\", and you are facing the impossible choice, is exactly why you want to play this game. Do you become the vilain and steal, or even murder your neighbor? Someone who could have been your friend a couple of weeks ago? If you cant think of another option, then you will do it \"because you have to\"? \nThe alternative is your own suffering and misery, so you have to decide. What do you choose? Will you become the monster who survives or the monster who let the kid die?\n\nThis is war.\n", "timestamp_created": 1617845878, "timestamp_updated": 1617845878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89913735": {"recommendationid": "89913735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205338404", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1110, "last_played": 1648934159}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not fun but its great", "timestamp_created": 1617837024, "timestamp_updated": 1617837024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89891735": {"recommendationid": "89891735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376479253", "num_games_owned": 971, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 2279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2279, "last_played": 1617805640}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n\n>Unique dark atmosphere and setting.\n>Unique art style.\n>Unique playable characters.\n>Unique & well done crafting system.\n>Unique base management system.\n>Unique story.\n\nCons:\n\n>Game itself can become tedious & frustrating at times due to the serious unforgiving nature of the game.\n>Can become repetitive.\n\nA unique mix of base management game & a survival game which can be both intense\n& casually fun at times.A must play for both serious & causal gamers alike.\n\nOverall I give it a 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1617808909, "timestamp_updated": 1617809126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637034893035888672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89831460": {"recommendationid": "89831460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142826567", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1617718970}, "language": "english", "review": ":(", "timestamp_created": 1617719710, "timestamp_updated": 1617719710, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.403935790061950684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89803914": {"recommendationid": "89803914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080803432", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2106, "last_played": 1685554624}, "language": "english", "review": "Dude, this game, I haven't played it in 2 years and it still haunts my dreams and skirts my daily consciousness with imagery and melancholy.

At first, I was actually finding this game to be pretty good, but then the massive flaws starts showing up and really dragged this game down way too much.\n1) The game is buggy. I found a good number of items disappearing from scavanging spots I dropped my stuff off when I find something I need more of during revisits, especially when I come back in the very next day and there are no NPCs in said area.  \n2) Melee combat does not work whatsoever. Even if you have a good melee weapon and need to take out an enemy, almost all the time you try to engage in melee combat, the enemy will almost always be the one to successfully attack your character. Especially in parts where there is no hiding spots and/or if you ran out of ammo and need to resort to melee combat. \n3) The cover is pretty awkward at times. If you step out of cover, you have to move around before you can get back into the same cover. Getting back into the same spot from where you exit doesn't work. Tried it a couple of times during a lot of my failed attempts (mostly due how awful the melee combat is), and never worked. It gets pretty bad when you sneak attack and kill an enemy, and sometimes that triggers the others to come up after you, and trying to get back into cover like this will take a bit more time, when time is sometimes what you don't have. \n4) The game is way too slow. There is no speed up option to make the day go any faster, meaning you have to wait forever for the clock to run out as you wait for whoever that is working on something to get their job finished. It gets even worse if you have to restart the same day with a lot of things you have to redo again, mainly cause of failed attempts, meaning you have to wait for the game to drag on even longer just so you can wait for the night and whatnot.", "timestamp_created": 1617303920, "timestamp_updated": 1617303920, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89502098": {"recommendationid": "89502098", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007459177", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 637, "last_played": 1646605141}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and storylines.

The artwork and styling is gorgeous. The characters are interesting. The game mechanics are somewhat difficult to learn. The premise is original. And it actually becomes pretty fun once you know what you're doing. Save for a small number of very annoying problems, I'd absolutely recommend this game.\n\nLet's start with the time efficiency problem. Suppose you have your characters working on something in the shelter. You want to complete that task and then start the next one? Sit there and wait and watch them work as there is no fast-forward option. You have only the \"End Day\" button. The game would be unplayable without this. But even still, it's a frustrating waste of time to sit around waiting. This complaint matters a lot more once you've learned the game and want to play through all the scenarios quickly, especially if you don't have much time to game. There is simply too much time wasted waiting around staring at your monitor.\n\nSpeaking of the \"End Day\" button, it's conveniently located next to the \"our stuff\" button. Mis-click? Too bad, it doesn't ask for confirmation. Close the game, re-load, and re-do the whole day.\n\nAlso annoying is that there is no built-in game save feature. I know they didn't want the player to defeat the RNG and simply re-roll when something happens that they don't like. I appreciate that as I like playing games the way they were meant to be played - bad things happen and you have to deal with them. But, back to the efficiency point. I'd love the feature to simply save the game at any point and return to it at that point instead of being forced to play through the whole in-game day and night. Also, it could allow you to have a few different games in parallel.\n\nFinal critical points. 1) Can't change keybinds and M1 and M2 do the same action. Why on earth wouldn't you split these up??? Can't say how many times I've tried panning the camera with M2 only to accidentally move a character to the wrong place. 2) Character pathing. \"I don't know how to get there.\" What? But you know how to run to the exit across the whole map! Also, you were just there! Also, when you do know how to get there, why are you running into the locked door instead of going around?\n\nThese complaints are from the perspective of someone who doesn't have that much time to play games. So when I do, I don't want to spend a lot of time waiting around.

It is extremely bleak, difficult, dark, and engaging.  The reason I have not played it more is that I lose a lot. I'm crap at this game, and I don't want to go read a guide about it, because I'm still intrigued about learning the game. \n\nSo why haven't I played more often? When you lose, you have not just died yourself like in most games, but your whole group has died. One. By. One. It is just brutal to lose this game. The developers have truly created not only an atmosphere (which is noteworthy, detailed and lit with artistic sensibility), but you get character development and story beats that are absorbing and emotionally affecting. It is highly stylized realism. I cannot say enough about these elements of the game. Simply brilliant.\n\nThe mechanics and game play are excellent. everything works, and there are no boring chores. Crafting makes sense, and it is not simple. The levels of realism in the game do not make it boring or plodding.  Things happen at a perfect pace.  The various missions and the map are intriguing and varied, so there is never a sense that they have re-purposed a previous level or model. Excellent craftsmanship, all around.\n\nI had no technical problems in the game. Everything worked as expected, and the visuals are great, but do not seem to burden a system set up for gaming (mine is modest, not top of the line).  This is not an action game, so I would warn off those looking for a lot of fighting or shooting.

The depth and importance of this game strikes home even more when you consider that this isn't merely fiction, and it doesn't romanticize war like so many works do, its based upon real war and realistic events like what occurred in the Siege of Sarajevo. The game gives us a valuable perspective on the nature of war and on history that many people probably arent aware of. That we can learn from it, give some context and feeling to things that happen in the real world through a game...

The game can be quite challenging at first but once you're introduced to all the elements, it becomes a boring repetition. Is it worth the money though?

Nada de soldados, aqu\u00ed nos encontramos con civiles que viven la funesta y luctuosa consecuencia de una guerra que azota su ciudad. Una ciudad que l\u00f3gicamente est\u00e1 asolada, y los civiles se encuentran a la merced de sus habilidades para rebuscar en escombros y proveerse de v\u00edveres y otros \u00fatiles que les permitan seguir sufriendo una ma\u00f1ana m\u00e1s, con la esperanza de hallar un futuro menos funeb\u00e9rrimo.\n\nSeg\u00fan van sucedi\u00e9ndose las jornadas, vamos encontrando nuevos retos, sobre todo por las noches, que tenemos que abandonar nuestro ya de por s\u00ed lamentable refugio, para tratar de rapi\u00f1ar en otras propiedades colindantes, y enfrentarnos a situaciones desconocidas, como pudieran ser otros civiles hostiles, o incluso con soldados.\n\nLa banda sonora y los efectos son muy adecuados, y otorgan al juego una seriedad m\u00e1xima. Est\u00e1 muy cuidado en todos los aspectos, y creo que en general, esta aventura har\u00e1 las delicias de todos los aficionados a la estrategia, supervivencia y a las buenas tramas e historias.

There are also custom stories you can download from workshop for additional gameplay and fun plots.\n-Alternate endings and not just one linear storyline.\n\nCons:\n-A few bugs here and there. Funniest one is when your character gets hit and phases through a grate. \n-A bit of slow interactions or no interactions when clicking a few times.

about if there's a guy with guns that breaks into your house and kill your love ones.\n\n[h1]But,is that really ture?[/h1]\n\nNo is not.\n\nConflicts are never seems to be stopped for thousands of years,when there's is a disagreement between two countries,there probably a war.Thousands of years,the war never changed.From the Western Europe to the Middle East,from the middle age to the modern warfare.\n\nChildren in some Middle East countries cant even get a good sleep or just a cup of clean water.Nobody help them when their friends get shot,nobody help them when their home was destroyed last night.\n\nBut what can they do?Only to live.They need to leave the home they live for many years and travel thousands miles to get to the safe zones just because they dont wanna get killed.\n\nThey are just innocent,they are not meant to die,they dont deserve it,it's not the way their lives should be,if there's no war,they probably gonna live just like us,dont need to think about food,water and shelter.They can go to school,play with their best friends,dont need to worry if there is an air strike that can destroy their homes in the midnight.\n\nThings are different when in different situations.You dont need to feel sorry if you robbed somebody or killed someone just wanna to get some supplies,cause this is just a game,you just wanna live and you dont need to kill a real person.\n\nIn the game,war will continue for 60 days at most.But in real life,the Siege of Sarajevo continues for more than 4 years.It becomes the largest city-siege war after WWII,3 times longer than Battle of Stalingrad,and about 5000 civilian were killed in the siege.\n\nAfter knowing this,will you still say No for the beginning question?\n\nEveryone wants to be a good person,no one wants to hurt others,but if you're a father,your son is dying,he needs to be treated ASAP,will you still hold your line and not rob the neighbor\uff1fIn war zones,will you lie to others only to get a ticket

This is a simple survival/crafting game that keeps on giving even after you have mastered it.\n\nMuch has already been said by others about the mechanics of the game so, while I will touch a little bit on that topic, I will mostly focus on the storytelling.\n\nTo start with: the stories in the game leave a bit to be desired. All the characters are stock, with stock storylines. However, when I first opened the game up, I was still amazed at THIS story, the story that I was playing through!\n\nWhen people say that decisions matter in a game, they usually are referring to branching storylines, but in TWoM, there is only one storyline - the one you are playing. (In fact, until the DLC, there wasn't even any alternate win-conditions! You just had to survive until the end of each group's story.)\n\nSo, when I say \"choices matter\" in this game, I mean your day-to-day, moment-to-moment choices have an impact on the experiences of your survivors. Do you help your neighbors or let them die for lack of resources? Do you help the hoodlums looting abandoned buildings or let them go their way? How will your characters feel about those choices? Will they be content with their humanitarian efforts, or will they become depressed because they are callously adding to the devastation around them? (Each choice can sometimes lead you down a path, also; if you make a shady choice, you may be asked to make even shadier choices, until eventually you realize that you are no longer the Good Guy.)\n\nWhenever you do/not do a humane deed, you will suffer a morale bonus/penalty, so if you are looking for a game without consequences, this one isn't it. This one preaches at you that you must be a good person.\n\nThe mechanics are stupid-easy; use your left mouse to go places and do things, use your right mouse button to go and do faster. Collect, build, produce, trade. Survive. Win. At first, until I understood how the game worked, survival was somewhat challenging; now? Not so much.\n\nOn the other hand, the entire game is constantly busy telling you, \"War is bad, mmkay?\" And, about the time that I could play the game with my eyes closed, I realized something else: I knew exactly which people to help (because they would return the favor,) and which to leave behind (because they either wouldn't help me back, or they wouldn't penalize me for not helping.) I knew which tools to take to which locations to maximize my looting time. I knew how to optimize my trades. I knew how to create a comfortable economy, and how to make the right weapons, and which weapons to sell and which to use. I knew when to be peaceful for maximum benefit and when it was okay to kill. I also knew how to get my spirits up after I had done so. I knew how to ignore This War of Mine.\n\nThe final treat in this game is the realization that I have become inured to This War of Mine, and while I still return to the game over and over, I have become desensitized to the human suffering that exists all around me in the game. I took this gaming experience and tried to look at the Real World through its lens, and now I am faced with a choice in the Real World: Do I become desensitized and cynical, or do I keep trying to help the people around me with the little bit that I have been blessed with?\n\nEven though I (arguably) have mastered this game, it is still preaching to me and teaching me things I need to think about.", "timestamp_created": 1613080800, "timestamp_updated": 1613080800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561853706836700439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86424752": {"recommendationid": "86424752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034313307", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 288, "playtime_forever": 6276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6272, "last_played": 1613080882}, "language": "english", "review": "This game deleted all my progress after 90+ hours of play.

Though, I don't agree with it all the time but it did its job in general of making you feel bad for your virtual actions. You'll have a hard time if you aren't creative. I didn't even know you could backstab people out of dark alcoves until I searched for a guide online. \n\nThe game's message is very meaningful as well considering this was released sometime around when FPS games were at their peak. Very insightful to be a civilian living through the war and not a soldier fighting the war. I've never really thought about the contrast until I played this game. I am now more grateful.\n\nHas a bit of technical issues too thought I couldn't launch the game on steam itself I had to go to the steam files and either launch the 32 bit version or the 64 bit version both worked for me I just had to interchange them maybe its my computer but still it was a bit annoying lol", "timestamp_created": 1612966123, "timestamp_updated": 1612966666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86318600": {"recommendationid": "86318600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198974639640", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 851, "last_played": 1698422493}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good game, just bad replayability", "timestamp_created": 1612941481, "timestamp_updated": 1612941481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86310221": {"recommendationid": "86310221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240535634", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 673, "last_played": 1552233514}, "language": "english", "review": "It gets really easy when you learn that killing people is not hard at all lmao \n...\nI'M NOT A PSYCHOPATH IM DOING THIS FOR MY FAMILY", "timestamp_created": 1612928460, "timestamp_updated": 1612928460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86230149": {"recommendationid": "86230149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192053695", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3226, "last_played": 1693556785}, "language": "english", "review": "good sims simulation. manage your happy family in the grand architecture of soviet shoddiness and balkan neighbourly relations", "timestamp_created": 1612820892, "timestamp_updated": 1612820892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86225890": {"recommendationid": "86225890", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967430643", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 2911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2911, "last_played": 1612814562}, "language": "english", "review": "Great concept and offers tough moral choices as you play as survivors in an ongoing war.

The game is pretty different from everything else that I've played but I got bored/irritated quite a few times. One of my critique points is that the game doesn't really try and help you understand the game mechanics and the impacts of decisions. But this might be an analogy for \"When you're surviving in the middle of a war as a civilian you're also improvising as you go\". Maybe the intention is indeed to give you this sense of helplessness.\n\nI haven't finished any playthrough because there comes a point where the risk becomes increasingly high and you kind of run out of interesting things to do. I think the game could do with some usability improvements to make it more pleasant to play. But the core idea is pretty cool.\n\nIt's also interesting to note how some of the mechanics ended up being used in the later \"Frostpunk\" (Which in my opinion is way better in all aspects, but is admittingly a completely different genre).\n\nI'm giving it a thumbs up for creativity and core gameplay, but it gets repetitive/annoying fast.", "timestamp_created": 1612622388, "timestamp_updated": 1612622388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86055980": {"recommendationid": "86055980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054977435", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1504, "last_played": 1612598521}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me a while to get around to surviving past a few days.

It was nostalgic and that gave it value yes, but what's really meaningful in this game is not the content to explore but the feeling and emotions there are to it. \n\nYou don't control a bunch of fighters, but just normal people trying to survive while war rages on. You cook, sleep, keep your shelter up, and get ready for the night by day. If you have time you might want to try playing the guitar or build a snowman to keep the spirits up. By night you choose one character to go out and scavenge with and hope that you prepared the others so that they are able to defend your home from bandits. \n\nIf it gets too cold you'll get sick and die, if you get hit you'll bleed and die, if you don't have food you'll starve and die, if you don't sleep enough you'll get weak and die, and if one character does poorly others will get stressed and unhappy. \n\nThe game is not perfect and it doesn't have super deep mechanics, but everything there is works very well together. There is a danger to a game like this to have too much stuff to do, making it confusing for a starter. But I don't feel like This War of Mine has that problem. There could be more to it though, but it's definitely not too little either. Even though I knew most of the maps and characters by heart I still spent +25 hours playing just the core game and having fun right after buying it.\n\nThere is Stories (DLC) that I didn't even touch yet (even though I bought it too), which I feel can only make the game better with the extra play value it offers. Even if the stories would turn out to be a weak addition, the core game is good enough alone to be well worth buying This War of Mine.\n\nI hated having kids in the game (Little Ones DLC). They make it so hard and annoying sometimes. But at the same time they do add to the realism of the game. And while I cursed them for making the game more difficult in a way I disliked, I still do enjoy a good challenge.\n\n\nBonus points if you like:\n- micro management games\n- dark & moody games\n- difficult games\n\nStuff some people might not enjoy:\n- trying to go slow and steady, playing \"just to survive\"\n- your characters dying off for good\n- stress\n\n\nCore game is excellent.

But I just cannot recommend it. \n\nIt is actually a solid game. You search for resources in a great variety of detailed and unique settings, and use those to build up your home in a way that'll help you survive the war. There's a lot of freedom in how you do this, and a lot of flexibility. That's great.\n\nThe art style is really fitting, and very tasteful. It's grim without being dark, it's busy without being cluttered, and it's simple without being dull. Honestly, presentation is 10/10. \n\nBut where it falls down, for me, is when the game starts to punish you for playing in a way that is seen as immoral. Here's how it works:\nYou have a shelter, three adults and a kid. You're starving. The kid is sick, and you have no meds. All the safe places have been picked clean, and you're faced with a choice: You can go and risk scavenging in an extremely dangerous area where there's a good chance you'll die way before you find food or meds. You can go and try to rob a few thugs and probably get your shit wrecked in the process, or you can sneak into a rich house and steal some of their shit. Guess which choice the game punishes?\n\nYup, stealing. A minority of characters are OK with it, but the majority will get sad and eventually depressed if you steal or murder, which makes them sleep badly, refuse to work, or just leave one night. This is annoying for a few reasons:\n\n-NPC's are always more important than the more moral PCs. Doesn't matter how tough things are, stealing is never OK, and boy does the game shove this down your throat with little speech boxes appearing every two minutes where the guy is ruminating on how terrible your choice was. 'Did we really need to steal from those poor people?' YES, the kid is seriously ill and we have no food. YES we needed to steal. Next time we'll just eat your sanctimonious ass. \n\n-The aforementioned sadness mechanic. There are a whole list of things that can increase PC sadness, but very little that can decrease it. Being well fed and warm isnt enough to make your guys 'content', they also need to be helping other people every couple of days. Meanwhile, steal one can of meat and WHAT HAVE WE BECOME??\n\n-Finally, why is my guy always going back to the shelter in the morning and just telling everyone that he brained some crazy old guy with a crowbar to steal his meds? He went out alone, he came back alone with a bag of goodies. At least give me the option to lie to the other folk and maybe avoid the sadness.\n\nSo that's why I can't recommend this game; they want you to play a game set in a besieged, war torn city in the depths of winter, with a collection of people who have had their families and homes torn apart, but they want you to retain the moral standards of a wealthy, church going suburban American family. Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not play this game any way that would upset the developers. \n\nOh and if someone dies because you didn't steal those meds, guess what? Everyone gets depressed anyway.

Will you hold on to your humanitarian values and help those in need or pursue survival at all costs, facing its\u2019 horrors and moral implications? There aren\u2019t right answers. Wrong things don\u2019t happen to good or bad people, they happen to people who did the wrong thing at the wrong time. Even if you think you\u2019re getting the hang of things and actually have supplies and food, the game reminds you that war and its cruelty will get you no matter how much you plan or organize. It can and will break your soul to the point where, even if survival is possible, it\u2019s not wanted anymore.\n\nI found myself emotionally exhausted after finishing each game, which I see as an incredible achievement from the developers. Your play through will stay with you even after you\u2019ve turned off the game hours ago, as survival is of upmost importance and seeing your characters not make it is heartbreaking. The way their faces look so real and their eyes close when they pass away is gut wrenching, as we see them as real people who we failed.\n\nThe Little Ones DLC adds to the challenge as children are now involved. They won\u2019t naturally know how to do most things and you can teach them while also spending time playing with them, since their happiness and spirit also affect the rest of the team. It\u2019s a constant battle to maintain the little innocence they have left while living in an active war zone, their memories and thoughts being of better times in the past.\n\nThe stunning artwork and soundtrack lift this game to another level, as despair isn\u2019t only conveyed by your actions but also through the existing atmosphere. A low saturated world where happiness feels like a foreign thought, listening to depressing and revenge anthems whilst trying to live just another day.\n\nImmense replayability with different scenarios, characters and traits. Simple game mechanics for any type of player.

Mediocre Execution.  It is like a gorgeously presented plate of food with no flavor.  The stark, oppressive, and at times depressing atmosphere is just that: An unending Stark, oppressive and depressing backdrop with no relief in sight.  I am a vet.  I have been deployed in hostile fire zones, peacekeeper missions, and relief work from Africa to former Yugoslavia and no matter what,  in all of those situations, there are occasional moments laughter and fun.  I get the serious nature of this subject matter, but Holy Hell!  I would slit my own throat to avoid the grind of these poor fools.  Which brings me to the game.  Tedious is the one word I would use to describe it.  I could not really connect to ant of the characters, since they have ZERO personality.  An occasional voice over narrative would have been nice and enhanced the atmosphere and helped me connect to otherwise 2 dimensional characters.  They don't really connect to each other either.  There is minimal conversation between them and they blunder through their day without so much as a good morning to their fellow companions.  A radio voice would have been nice as well.  Neither of these added features would have been too costly for game developers.  Character's skills (most of which are useless anyway) did not seem to factor, nor can they get \"better\" at any skills which is not true to real life or game life at all. There was no option to negotiate out of combat - NPC's just see you and start firing.  If you kill, your companions are sad, even when you kill in self defence.   You will be raided about every third night... even if you have an armed guard because yes, they suck.    I could not get invested in the bland, inept characters at all.  \nNot being invested in them worked out though.  Because some or all of your people will die.  Always.  Mostly out of your control and it vexed me quite a bit.  Many die in wars and conflicts.  I get that.  But this is a game and I just couldn't enjoy it.  Many do obviously.  I just felt with one or two more tweeks, this could have been a great game.  As it is I cannot recommend.
