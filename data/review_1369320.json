I use it on my days off for house chores to make things more fun. I love that you can add an animal and change the weather. It may not be much but it works for me.

It's a very minimalist experience - there's no pomodoro timers or tracking tools or even a personalized playlist. You get a nice set of music selected by the \"house\" as it were (you can refine it to exclude songs you don't like), and the ability to set the atmosphere of your office space.

[i]Moonlit[/i] by TESK and nothing else matters.\n\n[b]THE GRAPHICS[/b]\nLovely, full of warm colors. They definitely set the mood. Even during winter. If there's an event to happen - like Halloween or Christmas - you can see the decorations added, such as pumpkins or lights.\n\n[b]THE SUMMARY[/b]\nNeed more focus on reading, studying, doing household chores or preparing stuff to leave for work? [i]Virtual Cottage[/i] is a perfect choice. You won't hear any aggressive sounds, it's all around the tones which make you chilled out.

I think virtual cottage is great, definitely helps me stay focused. I totally recommend! Some updates I would like to see in the future though would be:\n\n1. If there were more background noises. Right now they have rain, snow, wind, and fireplace sounds. While those are all great and cozy, sometimes I want something with more of a Spring aspect! I think it'd be great to include waterfall, river stream, birds, or other nature sounds.\n2. I would LOVE if there was a way to incorporate a continuous timer. I try to use the pomodoro method with virtual cottage (I set a timer for 25 min studying, then 5 min break) but it really breaks my flow to keep having to start it over manually. If there was an option to set timers up on their own I think this game would blow up (in a good way of course)!\n3. This one might be more difficult and I understand if it's not possible, but it would be awesome if we could upload our own study playlists instead of the set ones the app provides. Maybe linking spotify? Or there can be an option where you can only upload music if you purchase the app? I would be so down to spend money on that. \n\nOtherwise I love this app and I really wish I could do more with it!

Whenever I'm doing homework I put this on my second monitor partially for vibes and partially to prevent myself from putting a YouTube video there and getting distracted. I've been using it for a while and enjoying it, but I have a few issues/suggestions with it. \n\n1) I wish there was more personalizing options when it comes to the layout. I like the details of the color changing with the time, and how cute the house looks, but other than that, it feels very empty. I think some nice additions would be giving more options with color, the person at the keyboard, possibly even the house layout. I do like how the current one looks, but adding more variety would make it more appealing to those who get bored easily. \n\n2) The music selection is too small. Because I've gone through the same selection of songs for so long, I've resorted to muting the music and playing my own music in the background, but using the rain/fire sounds that are given on the screen. This isn't hard to do, but I think expanding the music selection would be nice. What a lot of people would probably enjoy would be a way to link a music application to the game so they're able to shuffle through or play their own playlist through the game, whether it be Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music. That being said, the current songs given are still very pleasant, and I love the features for weather sounds. \n\nThis isn't critique, but I love the To-Do feature. It's a cute way to organize my tasks homework wise, and the timer is useful if I want to take water breaks or if I have laundry / chores to do while working. It also doesn't ruin the aesthetic of the screen, and blends in well with the game. \n\nI enjoy how this game is currently, but I believe I'd use it even more if the developers updated it.", "timestamp_created": 1680656882, "timestamp_updated": 1693861854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136098229": {"recommendationid": "136098229", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982295752", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2028, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1689260014}, "language": "english", "review": "Virtual Cottage is a free to play program that is like a time clock with a cute visual virtual cottage scene that you can make some changes in the scene and listen to music.

As I poured hours into perfecting my virtual cottage, I found myself developing a newfound passion for design and architecture. This passion translated into real-world activities, such as participating in school design competitions and volunteering for local community projects.\n\nMy experiences with Virtual Cottage helped me build a strong and unique extracurricular profile, which ultimately caught the attention of Harvard's admissions committee. I was thrilled to receive my first acceptance letter from Harvard, and over the next few years, I found myself being admitted to the prestigious university again and again.\n\nIn summary, Virtual Cottage may not be a direct ticket to Harvard, but it certainly helped me develop important skills and interests that ultimately led to my multiple admissions.

On one hand because the game is extremely useful to set a study Timer and keep track of time as well as keeping an overview which tasks are still on your to do list and on the other hand keeping this open on your second monitor (if you have one) is a great way to fight the temptation to get distracted by other thing you COULD be watching on your other monitor as well (for example Netflix or Youtube).\nBesides the visual help, the sounds also provide an excellent study setting with a great assortment of relaxing but not distracting Lofi Soundtracks and sound effects such as rain tapping on your window or a fireplace crackling beside you.

You have at your disposal many distractions, one of them could be Steam which you could open a game from a click away. You may have dual monitors while working and the temptation to just open a game while the work sits on the other screen is real.\n \nThis is when Virtual Cottage comes to play. You decide not to try and ignore that Steam temptation but you do actually open it and actually go to your library and start a game, this one. And now you have at your disposal a realistic goal that you are going to set for yourself (try to be honest with yourself). You set a time to focus, 60 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, it\u2019s up to you. If it\u2019s cold outside the fireplace will give you an extra comfy feeling not only for the looks but from the sounds from cracking wood as well. You can do the same for wind, snow and rain as well. Are you finding a certain track too distracting or you prefer no music at all? The sound of rain, wind, snow or the sound coming from the fireplace can be everything you need then, just turn down the music volume and you\u2019re set.\n \nAre you a dog person? A cute dog will stay around you while you focus. A cat person? A cat buddy is available as well with a simple click.\n\nAs you go on with your study or work you feel you need to have a checklist of things? You can add or remove them by having them on the left side of your cottage. \n\nSo, as you can see, you can have Steam while studying or working and instead of being a cruel distraction it can become an ally to reach your goals with a soft, relaxing mood. There\u2019s no rush, no stress, grab your headset select the sound of nature or mix them with the music provided and you\u2019re good to go. Yes, you could just open a browser or an app and select any music you would like but with Virtual Cottage you have a mix of relaxing music combined with the sounds of wind, snow, fireplace or rain, a check list to keep your goals in place, a timer set by yourself that you can change or reset at any time and finally, the temptation to open steam is gone. It\u2019s already there, being busy playing this game to keep you focused.\n\nGive it a try!", "timestamp_created": 1674037342, "timestamp_updated": 1674037342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810616791248321533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131060919": {"recommendationid": "131060919", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229934713", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1673931362}, "language": "english", "review": "cream", "timestamp_created": 1674004639, "timestamp_updated": 1674004639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131059062": {"recommendationid": "131059062", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037692928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 473, "last_played": 1674013554}, "language": "english", "review": "helped focus", "timestamp_created": 1674001297, "timestamp_updated": 1674001297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130997396": {"recommendationid": "130997396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355465661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1695218158}, "language": "english", "review": "= Pro =\n- its free\n- the music is like those lofi Youtube Video-Streams and calming\n- you can disable music tracks that you dont like\n- there are different effects (fire, weather) with different volume sliders\n-I like the pets and how they are in different places :3\n- it has a day-night cycle that follows the clock on your computer\n\n= Contra =\n- The time where you are in the menu counts for the archivements (I did 2 60min-sessions and got 10hours gameplay because i forgot it was open in the background at a lan party)\n- when you pause the session and you have an idea you CANT add it to your TODO List, you need to unpause, add it and lose time. :/\n- It does not save the TODO List when it closes (maybe add a txt file where it saves @devs?)\n- No Customisation (modification of the home, more than one animation for the person, modification of the person) maybe a dlc content update like the music one @devs *hint*?\n- no mods (mods bring live in a programm, the customisation issue would be gone with that too)", "timestamp_created": 1673908727, "timestamp_updated": 1673908727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130994401": {"recommendationid": "130994401", "author": {"steamid": "76561199237354471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1673890815}, "language": "english", "review": "Kalm", "timestamp_created": 1673904558, "timestamp_updated": 1673904558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130987053": {"recommendationid": "130987053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246308230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 510, "last_played": 1673895799}, "language": "english", "review": "Good application for time managing!

The \"To-Do\" list is also a great interactive part, and you can set timers for yourself + add an optional title for your studying sequence. My brain enjoys \"Ticking/checking off\" completed things!

It is cozy, relaxing, and low-key, while also having a decent amount of functionality built in. As a glorified focus timer, it works well.\n\nI would like to see a bit more done with the concept of a cottage- for example, furniture and decor options, as well as paint and flooring options. This would also help with gamifying and motivation- for example, a store could be added to buy different furnishings, and coins/currency could be earned through focus time.\n\nHowever, as-is, the game is perfectly fine. Though not as motivating as some other apps (which often have gamifying elements to them) it still delivers well on a lower-key and low stakes focus timer. I find that it works best when used in tandem with other focus apps, instead of as a complete solution.\n\nedit: after several more hours in-game, my previous comments still stand. However, after reading some comments and posts by the devs, I understand why gamifying the app is, for the most part, unachievable. However, a few different customization options would still go a long way. After spending more time in the game, I would most like to be able to access statistics (to-dos completed, time focused, etc), track time focused for different goals, and change the avatar's appearance.

"review": "This isn't really a game - it's more of an aesthetically packaged lofi station app. That said, it's helped a lot with my productivity. I've tried using those 3 hour lofi hiphop mixes on YouTube, but the constant ads bothered me a lot, and just setting it up was a \"try not to get distracted\" challenge for me because I'd take any chance to put off my studying/work and would just watch whatever caught my eye in my recommended feed. \n\nI've been finding it really simple to get into a flow state with my work by entering my virtual cottage. When I'm not referencing a textbook or a slideshow on screen, I keep the app in full screen to help me focus better. Also, the to-do list function and timer really helps me narrow my focus and stick to pomodoro-style studying sessions. I really do appreciate how the setting is dynamic - the scene shifts depending on your time of day. Gotta acknowledge how the aesthetic lofi girl has tan skin, a decent effort for diversity. \n\nThe ambient sound effects are simple to control, and the songs have minimal lyrics, which is another plus for someone who gets distracted easily. The only complaint I have is that there aren't a huge selection of songs, so I find that if I've been studying for more than an hour, I start getting bored of hearing the same tunes over and over again.\n\nOverall, if you're a student or someone who needs to get stuff done but is easily distracted, give it a try!

This game is very helpful when I want to work on my art commissions. Very chill music and a nice setting to look at. I like to change the weather on the program to match with the weather outside my window. I usually use Youtube clips of game music or chill music people would upload into 2-3 hour long clips. This is basically the same if you really want to get something done.\n\nAs for the negatives:\n- Needs more songs to listen to. If this is a game you are giving people to use to keep them on track. Having A LOT of songs (countless even!) can help keep the person onboard to use it more often instead of getting bored. Even just beach sounds, ocean sounds, nature or forest sounds or chatter as music options can be super nice. I know I enjoy listening to the waves of the ocean for hours on end when working.\n- The character in the room is a female. Perhaps give more options for the choice of gender or diversity between groups to allow for a more personal look for players to use the program and to feel more at home like this game is a little part of them. Having room for design or change can make the player feel more connected/attached.\n- Don't get me wrong, it is an adorable game and I adore it but having more individually items/assets can go A LONG way depending on what you do with them with your targeted audience.\n\nAs for what I wish this game had more of:\n- Upgrades to decorate your cottage room space depending on the hours you have the game running when in use.\n- More options for pets (birds, hamsters and etc).\n- Different colours to pick from for tables, chairs and what not to paint or change.\n- Even allowing players to completely CHANGE the whole room from top to bottom can have many decorating it for hours to appeal to them and what speaks out to them.\n- Maybe even changing the coat of animals/pets in the room or have many you can have in the room.\n- Allow for the room to EXPAND. Wouldn't it be great to see the space GROW depending on how many hours pass by to reward you with more space to decorate and put together for staying on top of your studies/tasks/etc????\n\nBasically what I am saying is. Reward the player with customisation options/rewards so the space they are looking at appeals more to them, their personality and character. I know this game is meant to be strictly to keep one on task but these kinds of people who concentrate on studies as a whole are most likely people who want something nice to look at or create.\n\nHaving issues with the game crashing on start up?\n- Download: ( https://www.revouninstaller.com/start-freeware-download/ ) For an external app to delete ALL files of the game. Steam tends to skip files that you may already have buried in your PC. This app helps to remove EVERYTHING to allow for it to start up smoothly with no crashes. A friend of mine recommended it to me because a black out happened a few nights back. After using it, the game is running smoothly once more!

You can also create a to-do list and you're also able to cross out things you've accomplished. I do however wish there was a bigger library of music cause after only being in it for a little bit you'll be able to recognize every song. I also wish there was some sort of menu where you could create your own shortcuts for like pausing the music and other stuff. Overall I feel like they need one dedicated update for adding in songs and another dedicated update for those menu options to make sure everything is all polished. \n\nI have noticed some bad things about it.

The music was also very calming and helped me focus. :) 10/10 love it <3", "timestamp_created": 1660597597, "timestamp_updated": 1660597597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120660081": {"recommendationid": "120660081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198950486393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1674476031}, "language": "english", "review": "Cozy", "timestamp_created": 1660548624, "timestamp_updated": 1660548624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120638602": {"recommendationid": "120638602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198423992134", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1660511678}, "language": "english", "review": "if you wanna have a chill time doing stuff just download this", "timestamp_created": 1660511800, "timestamp_updated": 1660511800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120634576": {"recommendationid": "120634576", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039681522", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 938, "last_played": 1662650774}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1660506847, "timestamp_updated": 1660506847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120631199": {"recommendationid": "120631199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198895173200", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 99, "last_played": 1661379615}, "language": "english", "review": "I have not felt happiness like this in years", "timestamp_created": 1660502897, "timestamp_updated": 1660502897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676582276821136475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120608951": {"recommendationid": "120608951", "author": {"steamid": "76561199081271177", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1660474779}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice and chill game", "timestamp_created": 1660474976, "timestamp_updated": 1660474976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120592480": {"recommendationid": "120592480", "author": {"steamid": "76561199161532963", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1660457761}, "language": "english", "review": "good but PLEASE ADD MORE SONGS \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nAND LET ME PET CAT", "timestamp_created": 1660447534, "timestamp_updated": 1660447534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120588830": {"recommendationid": "120588830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983109775", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 6125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6125, "last_played": 1660434578}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great application to use to stay focused on tasks that you want to get accomplished.

Pop it on while I\u2019m working/cleaning or just generally having some chill out time. \n\nThe To do list feature is so SO helpful, I love lists and the fact the game has achievements for time spent in the app/game and being productive, because who wants to be productive all the time? Not me certainly. Just the right little dose of dopamine to get me through some tasks.\n\nI\u2019m only mad I discovered this now instead of when it was first released. Could\u2019ve used this during my \u201cspaceship you\u201d time during lockdown. Would love to see the game devs work on it a bit more or release a premium/paid version of this. \n\nI\u2019m obviously not a game developer but these are few things I LOVE and not so love about this little app.  \n\nPROS\n- Music is all Low-Fi which is proven to reduce stress and enhance focus. Also, what is it about low-fi music being like a brain massage? Just me?\n\n- Can have just ambience sounds like rain, wind, fire crackling and snow? I guess. I live in Australia so the snow thing is kind of weird to me but I like you can shut off the music. \n\n- The task list is a great idea to have inside the app especially if you want to jot down some key things you want to get done during your session.\n \nCONS (but not really cons?)\n- Would be helpful if the \u201cActivity\u201d you are focusing on could be put in your Steam status as a sub status somehow, just to help minimise distractions or let others know what you are doing. \n\n- Task-list disappears when you close the app, you can pause or stop the session and the task-list stays though so that\u2019s good! Just make sure you don\u2019t want to save any tasks for later before closing. \n\n- Music seems to be a bit repetitive, could just be a licensing thing. Could just mute the app and play other types of music at the same time through paid streaming services though. So yeah, still not mad. \n\nOverall given the app is currently free and not perfect, I am in love and would be genuinely interested in a premium or paid version of this in the future.\n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1660216179, "timestamp_updated": 1660216544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120415550": {"recommendationid": "120415550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257660756", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4809, "last_played": 1694480130}, "language": "english", "review": "It's really chill\nI wonder if it would be possible to add a chat to that, so you can talk with other people\nbut still, chill", "timestamp_created": 1660172367, "timestamp_updated": 1660172367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120412244": {"recommendationid": "120412244", "author": {"steamid": "76561199177895298", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1318, "last_played": 1675481737}, "language": "english", "review": "\nIt's very well made visually, and it definitely helps me get my everyday chores done.", "timestamp_created": 1660167150, "timestamp_updated": 1660167150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120410367": {"recommendationid": "120410367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368529693", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3425, "last_played": 1660663122}, "language": "english", "review": "I chill.

Games contain meaningful gamelike interaction and game loops, which are absent in this software.  This is a simple software \"assistant\" application that presents a hand drawn cottage, which is supposed to help you study or do your housework.  You can customise the appearance of the cottage in a couple of ways, change your pet from a cat to a dog, set the weather and time of day, and you can add an in-game \"to-do\" list to track whatever housework you have to do instead of wasting your time looking at a picture of a cottage.  [i]There's no actual interaction or gameplay, it's just a picture of a cottage.[/i]\n\nFor those unfamiliar with what actually makes something a game, a \"game loop\" describes the interaction and feedback a gamer has when playing a game.  Tetris, for example, has a game loop where a random block appears, the gamer interacts with the block to position it, and then the game decides if that finishes a row or not, increases the players score if any rows were completed, then gives the gamer another block to position.  Counter-Strike has a game loop where a player seeks another player, tests their skill against that player by shooting them or being shot, the computer rewards the player if they win, and then if the player survives, they repeat that loop.  There's no loop here, no true interactive feedback.  It simply is not a game, it cannot be \"played\". \n\nThis has misleadingly been launched in the \"Games\" section of Steam instead of the \"Software\" section. This is a common mistake for developers who are new to Steam, or don't understand the difference between games and software which isn't a game.  It seems this software published incorrectly as a game is simply lack of experience/knowledge of the correct process.\n\nHere's a link for the process to publish non-game software on Steam: \n\n[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=925]Steam Developer Help With Software Publishing[/url]\n\nIt's unfortunate this process was not known about/followed, resulting in a software application being published in the wrong place.\n\nPublishing things which aren't games on Steam in the Games section as games is misleading to gamers and somewhat harmful, because it pollutes the Steam marketplace and takes away visibility and market exposure for genuine game developers who do the right thing and make games for gamers.\n\nThere are no gameplay loops in this software, no \"gameplay\", no meaningful game like interaction. It's a software application and as such has no merits as a video game for gamers. Because of this, I cannot recommend this non-game software as a game to gamers.\n", "timestamp_created": 1656219475, "timestamp_updated": 1656219475, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny":
