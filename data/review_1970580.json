[i]\"They finally turned that flash game, Help The Hero, into something bigger!\"[/i] was my initial thought. The simple premise but satisfying roguelike mix of organization and tactics to conquer challenges before you was more than enough to keep going, and [i]holy,[/i] did it keep going. Update after update. New enemies, events, characters, items! Changes to how mechanics work, characters that flip the base mechanics on their head but are equally as satisfying to figure out and play with. Until finally the full release was out. Eight days ago I was addicted all over again. Finding a myriad of new challenges and ways to play. The story mode's execution is done amazingly to help new players learn and experienced players try new things. Not to mention a city organizing mechanic, which just simply makes sense to put alongside the gameplay, like how it makes sense to put items that boost each other next together. Everything in its place and yet every run can change on a dime due to the sheer amount of items there are. The story itself is all up to you to discover. Items spawn that give more depth to the world you play in and makes you wonder what's still out there, whether it's in the game or not. I know that these developers will keep giving us fresh content, they've done nothing but improve and expand over and over again.\n\nI completed the full list of achievements 8 days after release, becoming the [i]very first[/i] player to do so, and that I just about doubled my playtime in that period alone.

Doesn't feel too addictive either, but that's subjective to each player.\n\nImportant features to note:\n+Can be played one handed (mouse covers everything) However, I'd like to see a clickable button for rotating  items and accessing the context menu (currently limited to Right click).  Then it could be a one button game, which I think is important for accessibility users.  Regardless, It's nice to have a free hand to smoke/drink/pet a cat with.  However, the game also has controller options of course.\n\n+It's not timed nor time intensive.  Actions are turn based, exploration waits on your commands. Can be walked away from and still be okay to play coming back. Runs are usually done within 30 minutes or less.\n\n+Lots of build variety - There's multiple projectile styles, Melee variates with buffs and powers, Magic is odd with a networked system based on item conduits (mana is an expendable)\n\nI WOULD like to see them add quick time events or puzzles to the dungeon (Indiana Jones style events would be fitting.)  Right now, the special events are mostly gambling and multiple choice options.  DLC could remedy that if the devs are feeling feisty. \n\nEither way, not a bad way to spend 10-15 bucks, they did a good job.

You start a run, you have fun, you unlock things along the way depending on your actions. It's great, it's a fun time. Now imagine, in-between every run, if you want to unlock anything or even see later levels of the game, you have to run across a huge open field, talk to 10 NPCs randomly scattered along the map (the game won't tell you which one you need or in what order), sit through endless repetitive dialogue that goes nowhere about how your dad thinks it's dangerous to go into the cave over and over and over again. Not only that, but it wants you to build endless buildings, sell loot you've found in the dungeon (the game doesn't tell you if you'll need them for anything or not), and it constantly want you to check in on every single NPC to even receive missions or get the pleasure of going to the next floor in future dungeon runs.\nEven if you know what you're doing, it takes forever to get anything done in the main hub.\nEvery item you ever collect in the dungeon (a lot, this is an inventory manage game after all) is collected in your hub inventory. An NPC may be looking for one specific item, you might even have it, but good luck finding it\n* The game does nothing to tell you what is important in the NPC town, so you have to spam every dialogue and every option select for every character just to make sure you don't miss anything.\nAnd to top it all off, the game is insultingly easy. If you have ever played a deckbuilder (roguelite or not) or any form of strategy game, it will be almost impossible to lose as long as you read the effects of what you are using. Heck, even when I completely failed to do that and I accidentally burned my only arrow during my an archer-only \"challenge\", where every other game would kill you for failing to have any synergy or ways to deal consistent damage, I was able to win because an enemy dropped a rose earlier, letting enemies take very small amounts of damage every time I blocked. I was able to win, including beating a boss, dealing 1 damage at the time. Absolutely ridiculous. After 5+ hours of gameplay, every run feels like this. It is so easy it is almost insulting. There is never any risk, never any challenge, nothing that makes you reconsider your choices, and once you get a powerful weapon or two, never any need to think. Click the same inventory slots every turn, and win for free. Never the need to swap anything out of your inventory, which is a shame because it's one of the main mechanics.\nAll of this, and I still found myself wanting to play. There is a fantastic game deep down somewhere. Inventory management is fun, and having your inventory slots tied to abilities you can freely use is creative and fun. It is such a shame it is held back by you never needing to engage with its systems due to the absolute lack of difficulty, to the point where I have won games by not adding or removing anything from my inventory. Furthermore, when the game forces you to engage with its systems in the hub world, it strips the game of everything that made it fun, including making the graphics look like Backpack Hero from Wish. It is tedious, stays in the way of what could be a fantastic game, and despite hours of gameplay, you are still stuck with the same starter loadout you begun with. It's a shame.\n", "timestamp_created": 1700688111, "timestamp_updated": 1700688111, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151163421": {"recommendationid": "151163421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034280155", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1752, "playtime_at_review": 2165, "last_played": 1700690171}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun puzzle-oriented gameplay without being too demanding or brain bending.

I feel slightly invested as you do spend some time in the town and chat with folks, all giving you some piece of advice or silly quotes.\nThere's also a quick game mode for even more chaotic runs to do.\n(Warning: Do not start Quick mode unless you want to get spoiled about story/cosmetics/character unlocks/item unlocks)\n\nVery few games manage to make me bring along consumables and actually make me use them in tough spots (I'm one of those \"but what if I need this potion later on?\", thanks RE). The game has a lot of charm, the backpack system with limited space, quirky sorting depending what items you get (some items can be tilted different ways for different effects) and just overall the sheer amount of builds always gives you plenty of different things to try each run. Every character also comes with their own quirk and playstyle, so there's multiple ways to tackle a run.\n\nWanna be a chonky tank who defeats their opponents by shielding up to absurd numbers and win by damage reflecting?

On the surface and at the start, it seems really fun.  Perhaps I'm missing something here, but:\n\nThe problem I ran into is the strategy element of figuring out builds kind of falls apart after a few runs.  It incentivizes you to try different builds by giving you a quest that requires you to play with certain items.  The main issue is that those different play styles are not actually viable.  So, take an archery build for example:  You use a bow and you get arrows.  Arrows do a set amount of damage based on the how many empty columns there are to the right.  Your bow will automatically fire arrows to the right of it, so you instantly get a damage nerf because you have to place the bow to the left, then the arrows to the right of that, then damage is based on how many empty columns there are to the right of that.  This also has the additional negative of making you choose between picking up items and leaving empty spaces so you do decent damage.  You would think that having items that give you dodge would be great, a few items that allow you dodge attacks so you can save space for your arrows and damage.  I found one item that give you dodge, it can be used one time per round and it gives you one.  You can hold 30 of these, but good luck finding more than a couple in a run.  You are force to choose items that give you block in this scenario.\n\nI ran to a similar problem with a magic build.  For that you get items that increase your mana, and items that restore your mana.  So it starts you with a ring that uses 1 mana to add 4 block, an item that holds 2 mana, and a magic staff.  You would think that you are concerned only with mana in a build like this and it would replace energy.  It doesn't though.  You have to juggle energy and mana.  This wouldn't be so bad, but unlike energy, your mana doesn't refill every round, only every battle.  Your magic staff, on use, restores one mana to your \"mana network\" for the first attack of every round.  You pick up magic wands that use mana charges, like your ring that give you block.  You pick up more of these mana stones or shards as you play, so your mana pool gets larger.  That sounds good, right?  Sounds very interesting?  It would be if the wands, which are weapons that use mana, were worth anything.  You may get wands that do a little damage, or give you a little regen, stuff like that, but it never really popped off.  At no point are you doing anything but hitting enemies with your magic staff and sometimes using a wand sometimes.  Once again... you are forced to use items that give you block and filling your inventory with them so you can survive through your mission.\n\nMost builds start you with some very basic items.  For example, the magic build above starts off with just those things.  A basic fighter will be a shield, a wood sword, and some food.  And the idea is that you build based on things you come across as you play.  But here is another misstep for the game.  Early on, you rarely see any items that is not just a basic item.  Lots of times you have to be deeper into the dungeon in order to find better items, which would be fine except that you basically start with the exact same build every single time to get to later floors.  So, you stock up on things like a good melee weapon, a decent shield, perhaps a bunch of armor to give you block, then  you can't really switch based on a piecemeal items you find after battles or in chests since enemy groups have more enemies in them that do different things AND do more damage. \n\nMy biggest issue with the builds is that taking a basic melee weapon and loading up on armor gives you a 100% success rate on any run.  They try to steer you different ways, but the only time I have failed a run is with any build other than the basic melee build.  And that is mostly because there are a ton of armor pieces that give you block, but only 1 that gives you dodge.  So why use that one at all, when you can wear 7 other helmets, 3 sets of shoes, two types of chest armor, and a few kinds of gloves that all give you block.  And that will take up my inventory by a lot, but it will make that run successful every single time.  \n\nThe town building is not fun either.  I thought it would be awesome, but you just kind place stuff where ever you want and it doesn't matter all the much.  You get research or selling bonuses for having certain decorations around it, lots of times you have to do later quests to unlock any of those decorative items.  Like, you have about 6 different types of things that take research before you get a town hall which you connect to via walkways so you can do all your research from the town hub rather than walking to each building.  The interface here is not very good either.  When you are in a certain menu, you may be inclined to hit escape to back out of it.  Nope, brings up the game menu.  You have to click on a back arrow that is on the interface to back out of menu.  Sometimes that takes you completely out of it and sometimes it takes you back one layer, so it's incredibly inconsistent.  NPC are also running all over the place, so if you are looking for a certain NPC, they are hard to find.\n\nThere are NPCs in the dungeon you can run into as well.  But they are very underwhelming.  You run into one, and for a few gold it will give you a random weapon, shield, or food items.  But I have never been happy with anything I have got, nothing that you could consider a game changer at all in terms of how you are playing.  Another one will let you roll dice to get an item, but once again, nothing that will change how you play.  There are shops, which have random things in them, which is where you are most likely going to find anything that may have you try something different.  There is an NPC that forges items in the dungeon, but it will give you 4 random choices, and those choices may not have anything to do with how you want to play.  One time it will offer more block on armor, more block on shields, more damage on a weapon, or to make something \"Conductice\", which adds energy to the mana pool.  Another time it may offer to add poison to a weapon, or add weakness, or add spikes to a shield, but not every item can be upgraded, and most items can only be upgraded once so it's not like you can turn a melee build into a magic build by adding conductivity to your all your armor and buying a wand.  It just doesn't work.\n\nSo, the game feels chaotic and unfocused.  And in being that way, makes it so only a single build type is viable.  You are never given a way to start your run, so you basically get funneled the same each run because you are doing a quest of your choice before you start out, and it feels like a waste to not accomplish that quest.  There are a ton of quests that unlock more things, but you are never really driven to complete any given thing because it feels like more of the same. \n Even if you unlock the Fletcher building to upgrade bows, playing with an archery build just makes it so easy for you to die that it feels like a waste of your time.\n\nI don't think I have given up on this game yet, but I don't know how much more of the \"same\" thing I have in me.  I just can't suggest it.  Great concept, delivery is very poor.  And by god, find some music you want in the background because the same 2 chip tunes playing constantly will make you have the music in this game.  The music is just incredibly boring.", "timestamp_created": 1700674538, "timestamp_updated": 1700674538, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151083889": {"recommendationid": "151083889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119650377", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 809, "playtime_at_review": 2640, "last_played": 1700684901}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic roguelike game that offers a unique take on the adventuring into dungeons.

entire genre of copycats (I'm looking at you, backpack Battlers). \n\nThe meta-progression / story mode is currently a bit scuffed and certainly needs work on, but gives players a host of different challenges as you upgrade your arsenal of weapons or take on specific 'quests' which are effectively challenge modes.\n\nWith the exception of Tote, all the characters have fun and interesting variations on the inventory management gameplay, with their unique items to match their gameplay.

[/b]\n\nI'll be very honest in this review, I played this game so much in the early access in a really short period of time that I got kinda bored of it and I couldn't stand it for months, so I had a positive first impression and I didn't enjoy the game for some time, but now... I think this game is amazing. Version 1.0 is all this game needed.\nThis game has really cool pixel art and soundtrack and an innovative gameplay, space management and turn RPG go really well with each other. My main problem with the game in early access was that it caused a really good impression, but once I got experienced, I found myself repeating the same builds again and again just for the sake of winning, because the game is very punishing in certain bosses if you don't use the right weapons and I found no purpose on completing the game again and again because it was the same ending all over again. \nNow though, I think it's perfect with the story mode! The game gave you a purpose to go down the dungeon, because you get new information, lore about the world and different dialogues each time you go back to the village, I'm really enjoying the journey to find Purse's mom. It's not repetitive anymore either, because the game forces you to do different builds each time you descend into the dungeon in order to get the items to progress the story, so both things complement each other.\nIn my opinion it's finally an amazing game now, probably the best indie from 2023, so mainly if you like strategy games and pixel art, go for it.", "timestamp_created": 1700622195, "timestamp_updated": 1700622195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150812516": {"recommendationid": "150812516", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999114337", "num_games_owned": 1142, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 698, "playtime_at_review": 1026, "last_played": 1700700529}, "language": "english", "review": "I always enjoy inventory management games, and making a game focused on that concept that is also roguelike?

my backpack for better ones. \n\nYou can make mistakes by not reading items properly, you can upgrade to unlock new potential items in one of your dungeon crawls. \nIt does start off easy, but believe me... It can get hard, you will die, especially if you don't pay attention to what items do in the backpack! \n\nI love love LOVE the main screen music, it's so catchy and I could listen to it for ages.

I just wish to critique one thing.\n\nBackpack Hero is a game that has amazing gameplay but honest to god far too much writing for what it is supposed to be. Im not saying it cant have a story. Im not even saying it shouldnt explain its story. But it comes to a point where a fairly simple story you want to enjoy inbetween runs turns into almost a visual novel type of reading scenario.\n\nThis btw is about the main campaign, not the general gameplay you can enjoy just as much. But if you play the campaign and wish to unlock everything, its practically gated behind needing to talk to people constantly. And some of these are hidden behind message after message after message.\n\nThe town needs a mayor. Alright. There is a guy who asks you to make a townhall so the town can be run again. Fair and simple. Then why does this need to be dragged on into a full back and forth of the main character and this character? Yea I get it, we aint playing ourselves. We playing the main character. There is a story to be played no matter what. But if I were to compare this to a game like \"Plague Tale\" in which we too play a character, the dialogue never felt like it slowed down the game.\n\nIf you are really into the story then sure, this has it in spades. Lots of details, lots of characters, lots of worldbuilding. Its great. But if you wanna play what is a roguelike deckbuilder, you are not here to read a visual novel worthy story. Dark Souls, which has a ton of story, backstory and lore to boot makes it so players can choose to read up on it. And I feel this is much to its advantage. Cause if you had to read up on the lore of every armorset, weapon, spell or Bosssoul each time you find it, it would slow down the gameplay to a crawl and would lead to refunds more often than not.\n\n--\n\nAgain. There is nothing wrong with the game having a story. But if I have to click though dialogue up to 10-15 times just to get to simple research or other new mechanics, thats a bit excessive.", "timestamp_created": 1700532919, "timestamp_updated": 1700533570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150524647": {"recommendationid": "150524647", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983167993", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 386, "playtime_at_review": 386, "last_played": 1700267721}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1700532155, "timestamp_updated": 1700532155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150524309": {"recommendationid": "150524309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152993096", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 297, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1700620630}, "language": "english", "review": "I love to question every choice I make.

The sessions in between runs is atrocious. Having to turn an item into one of these at the town can easily turn into 5 minutes of running in circles clicking on every single npc until you accidentally stumble on the right one who will take your item.

The game retains all of its charm and novelty. The town building is fun and the progression does not feel forced. There aren't too many bugs that I've run into playing ~15 hours of the new version and none that are major.\n\nHOWEVER. The reason I do not recommend is because they still haven't changed the most glaringly obvious broken issue on the summoner class - being able to recall pets more than 1 time a turn. All you need to do is choose one of the 0 summon cost pets (which if memory serves you always have the option to get) and get the Pet Bed item which sleeps (miss a turn) an enemy on summon. With the ~3 starting energy the class has you can recall+summon time-lock every single fight in the entire game. The run is over you cannot physically lose. The bosses can't summon men because they are time locked. There is maybe 1 or 2 minion fights  (that you might not even encounter) late game with more mobs than the free summon + energy-costing resummons you have by default cannot perma-lock and by that point you will have other items that would coast you over (or maybe you have some energy items so you can time lock all 5 by then).\n\nThe only piece of the \"combo\" you need to assemble is the 1 item. As soon as you do, you \"win\" that run, no gameplay needed anymore. Given that this interaction remains exactly the same as the beta tells me worrying things about how little balance was considered for this release. As in not at all - which is worrying for a game that advertises that proper management of the backpack is rewarding. All they had to do was limit recalls to 1 time per turn or maybe with a +1 cost each time (and the combination would still have you breeze through most fights), and they had at least 6 months to implement this change.\n\nI will edit this review as it becomes pertinent.", "timestamp_created": 1700224545, "timestamp_updated": 1700284037, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.43483927845954895", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150273723": {"recommendationid": "150273723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071836832", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 11955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3953, "playtime_at_review": 10457, "last_played": 1700753313}, "language": "english", "review": "Far better than this has any right to be.", "timestamp_created": 1700221849, "timestamp_updated": 1700221849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150271053": {"recommendationid": "150271053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124051531", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1330, "playtime_at_review": 1034, "last_played": 1700699821}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game but devs need to fix the glitch where the game suddenly deletes all your buildings off the map and returns the village to square one.

I was impressed with the amount of items and playstyles available, always keeping runs fresh. And to top it off, unlockable characters that each have their own unique backpack mechanics and add a twist to it. My original criticism with the town still stands, and I really wish the UI there wasn't as clunky, but I am starting to get used to it now.\n\n=======================\nORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW\n\n\nI'll start off by saying, this game is fun and I want to play it more. It is definitely not a bad game.\n\nThe combat is very fun, the art style in the dungeon is great and gameplay feels reminiscent of Slay the Spire where mechanics are simple enough by themselves, but they combine in many fun ways and can lead to some very interesting interactions. The inventory management aspect could be better (the game Backpack Battles shows more promise there) but is still fun to interact with.\n\nMy main issue with the game and reason for the thumbs down is the hub and metaprogression. The beautiful pixel art from the dungeon gets scaled down here and as a result it looks a lot less charming to me, The overall gameplay here is pretty standard: spend currency you acquire during runs to unlock buildings who in turn can unlock items from their respective branch (weapons, magic, archery, etc.). You get some dialogue and story and are given quests to do in the dungeon and unlock more features.\n\nThe metaprogression sounds decent on paper, but the way it is executed is so incredibly tedious that it takes away any curiosity I had and even hindered my progress on some occasions. \n- NPCs are scattered around the place, there is a list available but it doesn't say what they do or even their name, it's just a portrait.\n- one npc could unlock the next area for me but required a specific item. Once I got that item I spent a while talking to each NPC trying to remember which one wanted it. This happened with other NPCs too. Their portraits weren't even lighted up to indicate they had a pending task.\n- the inventory is incredibly cluttered and not easy to navigate or even sort. When submitting items to an NPC that only accepts specific items like the Librarian, you still need to sift through your entire inventory looking for the scroll when all the other items there are invalid anyway.\n- it's not always clear what you need to unlock certain things (e.g. an unlock required two shivs, I submitted one shiv and the two shiv icons were marked as completed)\n- you get dozens of quests and it's not always easy figuring out which ones are important for progression and which ones are just unlocking a specific set of items or not that interesting\n- items that boost efficiency can just be moved around as you need for a specific building, which is incredibly annoying to do but can help you save resource (I optimized the fun out of that mechanic, didn't I)\n- Building menu mixes production buildings (repeatable) and one-time, REALLY important buildings you should definitely prioritize. Also it removes their icons once built so if you place a building in a corner you could just forget about it altogether.\n\nI could list more but with so many rogue-like games out there, I was expecting a much better UI and systems there. I could easily do away with having a character to walk around in the hub. Just make it a smaller map where I can directly click each building without panning around, see what I have not built yet greyed out. Instead of having tons of individual unlocks where you read every single item and figure out what you should spend your currency on, make it gradually unlock (not add 12 items at once), or even unlock items automatically as you stock up that specific building with items and currency (i.e. upgrade buildings). That way you don't need to agonize over so many choices and just invest in the playstyle that you want to pursue.\n\nI think the concept of the game is great, the combat is very well designed but a lot of stuff falls through in other areas and it creates this weird feeling of wanting to play more, but dreading having to handle the town part and being unsure about how to make runs as meaningful as possible (so many quests).\n\nI am giving it a thumbs down for now for all the issues mentioned, if the UI for the metaprogression side was improved and some of the biggest pain points addressed, it would have a lot more potential and I would love to see that.", "timestamp_created": 1700190794, "timestamp_updated": 1700718552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824297308921813965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150256982": {"recommendationid": "150256982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392831249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 253, "playtime_at_review": 887, "last_played": 1700591663}, "language": "english", "review": "i found this game on itch.io around a year ago.

With that said, it can be really fun to see your build go off like that so it can be a plus too, but it also means you kind of just click through the game without meaningful choices after, so it can get a bit repetitive in some runs in that way.\nThere are a bunch of different run modifiers though that add challenges or just make the game harder, as well as challenging yourself for more difficult builds or characters you aren't as good with, so even though sometimes you might be phoning it in for a couple of floors at the end of a powerful run, you might find a proper challenge on the next one. If the Devs read this, really the one thing I would hope to see might be to change how the challenges work to more like toggles, so you can mix and match them, or at the least up/down the difficulty in a generic way on any run: If you feel that you need hard mode 3 to be challenging, not being able to have that difficulty when trying something like glass cannon might make it less interesting\n\nHonestly I would recommend at least trying this game to everyone, there are ways to play that will fit so many different styles and skill levels.", "timestamp_created": 1699988512, "timestamp_updated": 1699988512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713699460029602051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150126314": {"recommendationid": "150126314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053292247", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 5533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2509, "playtime_at_review": 3063, "last_played": 1700299970}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

The unlimited ways in which you can develop your arsenal and defenses through careful planning and organization of your inventory is a fun and unique twist on character and game progression. Items have single, stand alone uses almost all of the time, however, it is the synergies that they possess and pass on to other items in your inventory that truly bring out their full power and potential. Sometimes they impact an adjacent item, sometimes it is an item nearby, and other times the impact can be on an item or multiple items in an entirely different part of your inventory!\n\nEach of the current 5 heroes is unique in their own ways, with alternate ways of setting up their inventories and synergizing with items within. I personally love satchel, with is ability to charm your opponents with musical instruments and percussion. As your hero advances and defeats opponents, they are awarded experience. This experience is solely used at specific thresholds to allow you to increase not only your inventory size, but how it is shaped and laid out. You will find free chests and other rewards as you advance, and will accumulate gold over time from defeating opponents, finding it in the dungeon, and selling valuable, but unneeded items you find in your travels to one of the many vendors you encounter along the way. Gold can be used in the obvious way, to buy new items from those vendors, but can also be used in other ways to improve both your hero, and your items.\n\nThe addition of the story mode and ability to build your own version of the hero's town, called Haversack Hill, has really elevated the game to a whole new level. With fun, unique, and interesting challenges for all 5 of the game's unique heroes, you advance through dozens of different scenarios to meet and unlock each hero, and collect resources along the way to begin building your town from a field of ruined buildings and piles of debris into a thriving little community. As the town grows and more townsfolk are added through the construction of a variety of unique specialty buildings, you begin to unlock more and more items which can be found in future adventures into the dungeon.\n\nThe development team are a fun and friendly group who are always in touch with the community to hear ideas and get feedback on game mechanics and balancing issues. At the same time, they are also always working on new items and new heroes to add to the game. They are always within earshot on their friendly and helpful Discord as well as through the community page here on Steam. The gaming community is also fun to talk to and interact with. They're always full of fun and unique new strategies, and are willing to help newer folks understand how things work.\n\nIt is such a unique game that it is hard to describe to anyone who has not played it, as there really isn't any similar games that I'm aware of. The juggling many hundreds of available items obtained randomly through each adventure in an inventory of finite space is a fun and challenging puzzle each play through.

I'm not going to give it credit for being a roguelike or having a furry-bait artstyle or taking years to add any sort of story to the game to explain what was going on... just to rewrite Made in Abyss for every other story beat.\n\nSo, you want some serious negatives?\n\nFurry bait. Call it artistic choice, you know full well they aren't trying to harken back to old cartoons.\n\nFor as much archetype variety you can pick from while making a build mid-run, within those archetypes there's not that much variance. A lot of items exist just to be better/worse versions of other items.\n\nItem bloat. While again, you can somewhat force archetypes with the beta system's themed runs, you'll find time and time again that you get a couple items for a build, decide to try and go with it, then never find anything else you're looking for. I'm not saying it's a horrible thing, but the heavily rng-dependence of this game's loot system will have a lot of people turning away.\n\nIt's surprisingly short. Again, if you aren't playing on the beta (which is buggy and still has some interesting balance changes in it) then a run consists of 9 floors, 3 bosses. After that you go into endless mode which is just going back to the top and going through 9 floors and 3 bosses except it has an insane power spike and 99% of builds that beat the 3rd boss won't get past the 4th. It's got replayability, but you're gonna have to still deal with the same issue FTL has in that you don't get a lot of time to really develop your build in a run (which, longer runs would help significantly with smoothing out all the rng-dependence)\n\nIf you want to play the beta, you have to deal with a fairly lackluster story, discount animal crossing voices, awkward ux and more awkward building mechanics... and worst of all... god damned Bee-Ear-Rape-Noises.wav\n\n- all in all, it's a fun game, but if you're like a lot of us and you've got a monthly budget for spending on games, get this on sale. I know developers gotta eat too, but at the end of the day they're selling a product, you're buying a product, and right now their product is priced at about twice what it's really worth at the moment.\n", "timestamp_created": 1697979010, "timestamp_updated": 1697979426, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514599144458770752", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1698083155, "developer_response": "Hey!

In some situations I really spent some time organizing my backpack in order to take advantage of rare items.\n\n[b]Areas for Improvement:[/b]\n- I hope to see more weapons and customizations for weapons/armors in the future. And there is no motivation to play with different builds.\n- Over time, the game can become easier, especially when you become very powerful. It could use some tweaks to keep it challenging. There might be more levels and different enemy types that will surprise us.\n- The game could benefit from more events to keep players engaged for longer.\n\n\n[h3]Overall, I had fun playing this game and appreciate the work and creativity of the developers.

You puzzle your way through a ton of items, trying to fit the right setup into your bag.

Yes, you work towards to find your build and you will stick with it for the rest of the run. This is the goal of the game, It is like complaining that football is nothing more than 22 idiots trying to kick a ball into a square. \n\nCaveat:\nI do agree though that the hazard system is unnecessary and forced. I just click somewhere to place \"honey\", \"ice\", and whatever I didn't read, somewhere on my inventory. I always brute force through it and after the fight the \"hazards\" disappear.\nThe \"curse\" mechanic got a little better but still has a \"why?\" hanging over it. At the beginning it was great. A curse was something terrible, something that influenced your whole run, As of later versions, curses became a nuisance, something to sigh at if encountered. It is something I accommodate, rather adjust to. \"Today it is quite cold. Bummer\" instead of \"If you go outside you'll literally freeze!\"\n\nConclusion:\nI had a ton of fun just playing with \"Purse\" alone, and doing her challenges.\nThe game isn't perfect, there are some screws I'd like to adjust myself.

Runs used to be quick, focused, and enjoyable, and are now outright slogs with frustration mechanics that weigh you down and stop you dead in your tracks.

Mind you, I have played plenty of this game over the past year but each update, I play less and less and less until finally I barely want to play anymore at all.\n\nTo make matters worse, recent updates are incredibly bug-laden, in a way that's very noticeable and not enjoyable.

There is an Atlas that logs everything you've seen, like in Gungeon; unlike in Gungeon, however, this logs literally EVERYTHING YOU SEE (as opposed to everything you pick up), so the Atlas fills up very quickly; this is just a consequence of how the game is set up, however, where you can freely decide not to stick with items you've picked up outside of battle.\n\nThere are five characters in Backpack Hero, each unlocked from the very start of the game:\n\nA normal run of Backpack Hero with THE MOUSE has nine levels, unless you decide to enter Endless Mode, and games will generally last an hour or two at most if you're playing well. THE MOUSE is the most straightforward character, straight from the demo, and the only one I've beaten the game with. The other four characters are basically ideas the devs had that they tried their best to make work THE MOUSE's Backpack system. THE BIRD's gimmicks are \"Pockets\" (getting to build your bag with disjointed spaces at the cost of said pieces being mostly-useless shapes) and what amounts to a separate damage type that converts enemies to your side instead of killing them; countering both of these is that THE BIRD's gear sucks. THE FROG's gimmick is that most items are cards that you shuffle, draw, and discard \"Slay-the-Spire\"-style, with their Backpack being a playing field; the cost here is that the mechanics are a bit of a mess, that THE FROG gets less playing space through leveling up than basically everyone else, and that (like in \"Slay-the-Spire\") THE FROG cannot get rid of cards in their deck without paying. THE PORCUPINE's gimmick is that she gets Familiars who come with their own mini-Backpacks and can serve as meat-shields, countered by the Familiars being awful and your loot pools being polluted with stuff catered just to them. Lastly, THE ROBOT was some sort of attempt at a \"build-a-circuit-for-Auto-Battling\" idea I'm sure the devs got from another game; they just tried reworking him, possibly for the second or third time, and I've heard that he's still a broken hassle to use.\n\nI wouldn't say the game scales particularly well; you'll either win or lose by Level 7 depending on what you have by Level 6, and that's in a game with 9 Levels. It's fairly charming, though, and some of the systems are pretty interesting. There are players far better than I, of course, who adore the game.\n\nI'd say wait until it gets finished, but not recommending it feels unduly mean. x3\n", "timestamp_created": 1694062300, "timestamp_updated": 1694062300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578150331974029541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145831120": {"recommendationid": "145831120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141840511", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8479, "last_played": 1694997244}, "language": "english", "review": "such a simple game...

Every run recently, I've given up prematurely because some combo piece I wanted to use simply refuses to work. What's the point of playing this kind of game when bugs prevent you from doing anything interesting? This doesn't seem to be a priority for the devs, who seem to be barreling towards a 1.0 release with their main focus being an ill-conceived story mode. I really hope they get a handle on things, because if they keep adding new stuff without fixing what's already there, the game will become unbearable to play.\n\nRE: dev response\n\nBug reports for the items in question have already been submitted- CR-8's portal, black manastone, and any item that is moved after use (like the candle that destroys an item) being particularly annoying examples. Also, entire mechanics frequently fail to work, like pocket detection on Satchel, mana networks not connecting properly, CR-8's entire gimmick (not even counting the undocumented distance limit of charges), objects being moved or broken on save/load, items that rely on positioning (ie citrine) not being detected, etc. It's just reached a breaking point where the game doesn't even feel worth playing right now. I hope I'm proven wrong, but it feels like adding meta progression (something I actively dislike) and a story onto a game that is essentially a build sandbox is going to be much of an improvement. I really liked playing the game previously, and if the issues are all fixed then I'll enjoy playing it again- but right now, it's not in a state that I consider acceptable.\n\nAfter trying the most recent update (which dropped later the day I wrote this review) in my first run I have run into a 0-use consumable which I believe had its charges used in a CR-8 test fire, as well as a burn-applying wand which consumed mana but did not actually apply the burn effect. This was before the 3rd floor.\n\nPost 1.0 release: things are just as bad as they've always been, except there are brand-new systems which are also full of bugs. Even the dialogue has bugs, with missing translation string errors at key story points and even item descriptions, so you can't see what some items do.

The Demo may also give a bit of a weird look at the game as a lot of stuff has changed between the time the demo was made and the making of this comment. I know I've only played 5 hours, so far, but I played the demo a bit before finally deciding to grab the game itself and my verdict is... It's good, but still very early.\n\nThe good parts of the game is the same you'll see in any other review: It's a very creative way of handling a dungeon crawling game with a lot of different ways you can go through the world. Variety is the spice of the game for sure, because each character plays notably differently and there are various types of builds you can do with the Dungeon itself even having variety to it with typically two different location for each floor. Which is neat, though the enemy variety is rather low despite this, but that's probably for the best. Some types, like a rogue rat that shoots multiple times or a fire breathing salamander, can get really annoying.\n\nThe overall Gameplay Loop is nice and easy to understand. Organize your backpack, click on items in backpack to use them, and go through the game trying to not die from overload and from the people trying to kill you for some reason. It is odd there's not that many real \"monsters\", but that's another topic. Either way, the big issue with the backpack theme is mostly a lack of quality of life options. \n\nFor example: There is an item called a satchel, not to be confused with the character named Satchel, which you can open and items inside with the only negative being that you can't open it during combat to use them. Which is fair and very helpful, but... opening it opens a small square space to show the squares inside that satchel space and it goes over whatever was under the actual satchel item in your main backpack and you can't move it, so you have to close it, move the item itself, then open it again. This happens a lot more with the character that has pets with their own inventory too and it's a minor thing, but really throws off your groove, y'know? It'd be nice to just move the opened square, but no area I clicked seemed to help.\n\nThis sort of stuff is what the game is lacking so far, which is good despite being a negative, as I didn't really run into any major bugs except some text appearing over other text boxes; like your energy number appearing above a speech box. There are also some items with text that I just don't understand or misunderstood, but they are few and far between. \n\nFor my big negatives of this game, it has a far too high difficulty spike, a lack of any real things to unlock, and there isn't many ways to properly fix your build up. In order to use arrows for example, you have to have a bow, even if it doesn't say as much, and I've gone like six floors without seeing a single bow, but several types of arrows. Sometimes that's just how it is and I get it, but it'd be nice to have the merchants at least have an option for one specific type of item when you visit them for the first time. Somethin' simple.\n\nThe difficulty spike is what really hurts the game for me, though. I can adapt to having bad luck with items, but it feels that many enemies you fight get stronger as the fight goes on, even if it's their fault. For example: there is a knight and priest combo I ran into where the knight kept throwing \"Spikes\" onto his allies and the priest kept healing. So if I hit them, I'd be hurt and they'd just heal. Which is normal and the Spikes started low at just 4 a turn, and they die off quick every turn anyways, while the healing was at 20. It'd take awhile, but I'd win with that pattern as I could block the spikes when I smacked them, then block their attacks.\n\n... And then the Spikes shot up to 7... and then 14, after just a 5-6 turns. The healing also shot up to 25-30 and they were gaining at least 20 armor per turn as well. I was hitting for maybe 10-16 per hit with what I had in my pack, but I couldn't block all those spikes and attack comfortably anymore. It quickly turned into nothing but a death wall, since there's no way to run, and that really hurt the experience for me. They weren't even a boss; just a regular chump in the dungeon. I'll get 'em next time, though.\n\nOverall! I can only really rate this game as \"It's early access.\" It's going to have issues and the devs seem very responsive to criticism, as long as you're not being a chump about it yourself. They have unique ideas, the characters are all interesting, and I appreciate the costumes they have too, though I feel those should be things you have to unlock at least. Really helps in Rogue-Likes to have a type of goal, y'know?\n\nEither way, I recommend the game if it sounds fun. If nothing else, it's not demanding much from you except your brain power, so it's a go-to game for on the go or just to relax with. Hope you enjoy. (' ')/\n\n[Edit: I've added this part forward for the 1.0 Update as it's now out of Early Access!]\n\nIncluding the stuff I've said above, the game hasn't truly changed that much from when I first reviewed it and its full release. Excluding, of course, the new \"Story\" mode that includes a lot of unlockable features that were mostly available during the Early Access Quick Play. Which is still a thing you can do anyways in the full game, as a nice feature. \n\nI have yet to beat the Story Mode as of the time of this review, but it's neat so far. It revolves around creating and upgrading a new town near the Dungeon after finding out that Purse's mother was lost within. Magic Backpack in hand, Purse is dedicated to finding out the truth /and/ making a place for everyone to live comfortably. The story itself isn't bad, but that's about as much as I'll say. You'll have to dig deep in the pack to find the truth~!\n\nThe Story Mode Gameplay is where the new form shines, as it does address my issue with the game not having much to unlock- now a massive amount of items that are either new, or are in Quick Play, are something you can unlock. The way you unlock them is by first building something related to them, such as a Blacksmith or a Magic Shop, and then using items from the dungeon to research this new item. It's a very smart way to add even more variety to the game as now you'll have to build your runs around what you want to take back, too; sometimes you'll /have/ to hold onto that Shuriken so you can research new Shuriken at home.\n\nThere are also various people in your village that give you quests, unlocking more items by going on unique runs. Some runs make you just do the default stuff, but there were others that required you to use a bow, or one that had me use a fish-stick powered up by other fish. It was neat and allows for different ways of playing, as you can redo those quests anytime you want, though for no real reward after the first time. Still, unlocking the new features may lead to even more ways to start standard runs... such as getting access to the other characters through their own quests. I won't spoil how you do so, but it is neat that each character seems to have their own set of quests too; I'm only dreading the robot's quests...\n\nRegardless, my opinion on this game has only improved, although it seems the difficulty curve still has trouble; I've had plenty of runs where numbers suddenly just skyrocket and I'm left going \"Well, heck, I didn't have a miracle in my pack!\" There's always next run of course, but I can see it being frustrating when you're near the end. At least dying lets you take one item back for free... though the mail-mole is probably better.

Otherwise, from time alone, if you want to clear every character at least once on standard you will get enough playtime out of it to justify the purchase.\n\n[u] [b] The positive points: [/b] [/u]\n\n- Some characters are super fun and very well thought out in how different they function and what combinations they can go for. Really different playstyles that also do make inventory management meaningful, on top of what kind of damage (flat, projectile, magic, spike/defensive, poison etc) you are going for. That tandem mechanic for characters like the Satchel and CR8 and Pochette are really interesting and fun to play around with...for a while.\n\n- Items can be crafted on. I positively love this, having an item with a description so long that you need to scroll downward is 100% awesome, not just that, you can add crafting potential (albeit there is far too few points for that as of right now in the standard game) to add further possibilities all in the neverending search for that one completely broken build.\n\n- The humour is great, every new enemy and every item is fun to find and it adds charm to the otherwise rather dull dungeoncrawl.\n\n- It is still Early Access. A story is supposed to get added which is nice and a certain hope for awesome is always there when it comes to Early Access passion projects which this certainly seems to be\n\n\n[u] [b] What holds it back: [/b] [/u]\n\n- There is nothing that binds it all together, everything seems kinda fragmented, you never get the feeling that you are doing something of worth with an impact for further runs. It\u00b4s not just a story, it could be starting stats for characters that you could have to work for. Or certain permanent itemupgrades or pathways or...but literally not even the settings selections stick until the next session. \n\n- Why the above point is hurting gameplay fun for me is bound to how the game is set up. You play a tutorial, which is basically the whole game. And then you can select some other \"gamemodes\" which is basically mostly gimmick changes like \"hard mode\" which is just some modifiers to our health and the enemies. Or limitations to the backpack spaces available. No doubt, those are extra challenges. But basically it suffers from all roguelites extra challenge modes...of course you can make everything so difficult that nobody can clear it anymore UNLESS you get that one perfect run finding all the perfect items and getting the perfect combination of enemies and...yeah well for the majority of players, myself included, that is simply not fun. I am playing exactly to make builds and explore synergies...so then you go the other direction: you pick \"endless dream\" which gets rid of status effects and gives endless forge potential. That is nice. But the thing about endless is...you don\u00b4t have endless backpack space. Infact, in endless you do the same thing that you do in normal standard games that go on endlessly: Yes, you die slower, but you just wait it out until the enemies become unbeatable. That\u00b4s it. That\u00b4s all there is to endlessmode. You wait until it is over. \nSo you can go the one direction: Make the game \"harder\" which is mostly just hinging on luck at some point.\nOr you can go the other direction: Make the game easier and wait until you have to fight an enemy you can\u00b4t beat, no matter the struggle.\nThis is not Slay the Spire. You do not get to make infinite-turn one-break the game-synergies. You have limited amounts of space, limited amounts of gold to craft, limited lifepool...you will get overwhelmed no matter what. So there really is no real point to endless mode. And standard mode ends quick, it\u00b4s like 9 floors, barely enough to enjoy a build once it comes together. It feels like only 50% of the standard game is done yet. There is just not enough content for anyone but the first character. Everything else feels like: Yeah we don\u00b4t know how to go on with this system so lets just create a new mode or a new character. And with everyone of them it feels like: Yes, this was nice, where\u00b4s the rest of the run? No, not endless, the rest of the actual thought out content? Oh its not there, well, early access I guess. But its still unsatisfying. Every end of a run feels like you just started working something out and then its over and there is no point to it either, you experienced it and thats about as good as it gets. Rarely will I go back to do a strategy just because I think I could do better. I played it once and that\u00b4s how good it gets honestly...and do I play another strategy? Eh, not really, most of the time. It\u00b4s not like you have endless combinations but every character has like 3 different ways that are viable for it, so usually if I like playing two different ways on a character, then I play two rounds of the character, both of which felt had an unsatisfying ending and then that\u00b4s it. Kinda meh. \n\n- There are many combinations of items and spaces than can get you do win a run. But you basically will never do anything that feels like \"I outsmarted the game\". Mostly its just, I found an item that adds atk per adjacent gem. So you search gems. That\u00b4s not really clever. It\u00b4s a winning strategy, but its not really anything more than that, everyone deciding to build around that item will build the exact same way with more or less tactics and luck in finding them. Everything else works the same way usually. It\u00b4s not like different items really work together, they just stack. You don\u00b4t multiply poison stacks, you just add. You don\u00b4t trigger them early. You just wait your turn. You don\u00b4t change poison stacks to something else, you just wait it out. You never will do something special honestly, if you use an item wrong, well then you don\u00b4t win. Its not like you stumble into a hidden strategy. You do what the item says, the better a player you are the better you make use of it. It works, but its not Slay the Spire openness to build ideas.\n\n- You can get simply stuck on enemies. Approaching the final boss with full health would suggest that you are ready for it, if you play well then that has to be the case, right? No. You can do fine against everything else and then, because there is no free gameplay but only inventory handling, you can play as well as you like against a boss and literally have no way of winning basically losing you the run by default. That should never be the case and yet it happens frequently, clearing everything with full life should give an indication about your powerlevel and not completely randomly stop working regardless of gameplay.\n\n- Character strength is unbalanced. Tote is literally just less fun than all other characters. His kit doesn\u00b4t allow for great combos. There is no way to get rid of unnecessary carvings. It is hard to cycle through them as well. \n\n- Bugs bugs bugs. Sometimes selected curses can not be removed from the deck. Sometimes inventory spaces get stuck behind the backpack. Sometimes items get locked in the selection area. Sometimes an item gets used in an infinity loop etc etc. That being said...\n\n- It is early access. And I surely hope they do not go the Brotato or Peglin route: \"Just add more stuff on top, just stack it and that makes it more interesting\". Those other two I gave a negative review for that reason. Here I hope that most of what those negative aspects are will get fixed with a storymode being added and the game taking actual shape from there. I have that hope. And I do have like 10 hours of fun gameplay for 10 bucks which is making it worth it already. But its nothing more as of yet. A cool concept with many different stacking mechanics. But very little synergy and very little reason for exploration. And those aspects would be what would make it a 90%er for me.", "timestamp_created": 1690498548, "timestamp_updated": 1690665488, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543859660625457764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142904130": {"recommendationid": "142904130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020781657", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 656, "last_played": 1699382108}, "language": "english", "review": "It's buggy, I've had items disappear on me that shouldn't have, some descriptions are extremely vague, and it's a rogue-like, which means any and all of these have the potential of breaking a multi-hour long run.\n\nThat all being said, I've lost a ton of time not watching the clock while playing this, so it's still quite addictive.

So this is just my feelings on how the game is thus far.\n\nThe game is great, your character (there are several to choose from) is moving around a dungeon via a map at the top of the screen. You encounter events, npcs, and loot galore. The whole game revolves around your Backpack ala the title of the game. It has a limited amount of spots (Think of a grid based inventory system). \n\nThink of the items in your backpack as equipped on your character as they act like that. Everything in your pack can either be used or modifies other items inside of it or affects you directly. If you want to attack you have to use an item in your Backpack to do so. And doing so costs energy of which you usually start with 3. You can choose to attack 3 times with a 1 energy weapon or attack twice and defend with your shield once, increasing your block by X amount. There are a lot of other items that can be interacted with within the backpack to crease a lot of innovative and crazy combinations during the game not just attacking and defending.\n\nThe game lacks a bit in the visual and audio departments. While the characters look great and I enjoy the designs of them all. The backgrounds for the different areas are very basic, with all of them being wall with a few hints of what area you are currently in. Like the starting area is a stone brick wall, and the next area is a stone brick wall with a few vines, and the next area is a stone brick wall with some ice. Some more detailed backgrounds for the general roaming, and specific backgrounds when you enter a shop, or encounter certain npcs or areas would be amazing to see.\n\nAudio wise, the sound effects are fine, they are basic, but get the point across And while I hope that every weapon would get their own sound, I know that will probably not happen, nor would I expect it to happen. That said. Musically, each area at least should get its own theme, same with different bosses and maybe even mini bosses. That is how I feel anyway. Right now its all the same music and I found myself turning off the music and throwing on my own as I played for any extended period of time.\n\nOverall the game is amazing so far. Game play wise everything to do with the backpack is great. The characters are all different and their mechanics feel good. Everything else is just atmospheric problems for me. Some better backgrounds, and music would raise this up so much higher in my opinion, and I am excited to see what comes next.", "timestamp_created": 1689562624, "timestamp_updated": 1689562624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142221217": {"recommendationid": "142221217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372606826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 989, "last_played": 1689528821}, "language": "english", "review": "It's OK.  The concept is great.  And while there are some (much-discussed) annoying issues with the UI and with rules not working, it's Early Access, so that's not a deal-breaker.\n\nThe bigger issue is game balance and flow of play.  Of course, this is a lot like a deckbuilder; there are going to be stronger and weaker builds and demented combos; but it feels like you go to zero to 60 in one second and then up to about 300 the second after that.  In my last play, I happened to pick up two items in a row 1/3 of the way through that resulted in _literally_ no enemy getting a single turn for the rest of the game. \n That's neat, but there doesn't seem to be much middle ground; either you have a build that obliterates things or you plink away slowly until hitting something that kills you.\n\nAt the same time, figuring out optimal item arrangements takes a lot longer than it feels like it should; part this is due to UI weaknesses, but part of this is also just because many of the strong strategies involve a lot of \"these 8 items each give a bonus to adjacent items, but some apply diagonally and some don't, some of them limit which items receive the bonus, some give different bonuses to different types of items, some of them care about vertical or horizontal placement...\" (and it doesn't help that some location-based effects, like mana conduction, don't work intuitively when you have, e.g., a diagonal item.)  I know this is sort of the point of the game; I just feel like there has to be a way to implement it that feels less twiddly while still incorporating all that optimizing, min-maxing goodness.\n\nI don't think any of this is the result of poor design choices -- I think it sorts of comes with the nature of the mechanics.  And I think it's solvable, but it requires the game to bake in the oven for longer rather than hurtling towards a full release.  For that reason, and only that reason, I find it concerning that effort and attention is put into advertising plushies of its characters (real life ones for sale with real money) on the title screen, when both the central mechanics and the UI feel unbaked.  That feels a bit like the cart is being put ahead of the horse.

In this game, you control one of several characters with a backpack that can hold usable items, with each character having their own unique mechanics. The backpacks use an inventory system similar to PoE or Diablo where items take up a variable number of slots and you end up playing inventory jenga to best fit your entire build. Most items have some sort of incentivized placement; Some items do more when adjacent to other items, some need no items nearby for them to work, some items are \"heavy\" and can only be placed at the bottom of the bag or on top of other heavy items, and this list goes on and on. This simple concept is actually ridiculously fun, and adds a lot of build variety and freshness, since its a concept that is 100% original and unique. On top of this, the discord community is very active and the developer is very accepting of feedback from the playerbase; patch after patch, the game only seems to get better and the things that players complain the most about get fixed within a patch or two.\n\nI will say that the game is quite hard at times. Sometimes, its really easy to just die because of bad item rolls. On top of this, as of writing, this game still doesn't really have a prestige system. The game does have gameplay modifiers which can act as a ascension system, but the difficulty related ones are more leaps rather than stepping stones that they are in most games.

I like that sometimes you just have to accept being hit for 20 damage to survive the run and how that affects later choices. \n\nI really love the varied approached to a run and how one item frequently has the power to pivot the backpack. \n\nI have tried multiple bags from the mage doing a huge amount of damage in one turn but with little to no armour, I have played a tank who used a ton of haste and spikes to watch my enemies suicide onto me, and I have played almost everything in between. \n\nBUT.\n\nThis last update is a fairly large step back. I am not a fan of how the curses now work, and I'm also beginning to tire of a lot of the new items, which in my opinion aren't much better than the old items which mean they just take up loot drops and so slow down and make the game more difficult but not in a 'fun' way. \n\nI'm not sure exactly when this change happened but you now cannot forge certain items (and I'm not sure what specifically is the reason why some can or can't be) and the most frustrating thing is there isn't a tool tip advising you of this, so you can have a scenario similar to my last run: I needed a haste upgrade to stay alive, went to the forge and was 5 gold short, so I sold something only to go to the forge and discover I couldn't add haste to my shield anyway. \n\nI do thoroughly recommend the game but I would urge the developers to consider quality over quantity in the next update, there are plenty of items which do not see use, even in niche runs and the game is too difficult in it's current state to play with new builds. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1687807617, "timestamp_updated": 1687807617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140739413": {"recommendationid": "140739413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088813211", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 486, "last_played": 1689486026}, "language": "english", "review": "What an amazing game so far!

Seriously, I was up until 5 am last night playing this game, I've played it all day today, I'm still playing it, and I have no idea when I'll stop because this is all of my favorite game elements in one package with a bunch of characters and mechanics and every run feels unique even if I do relatively similar things.

This is not to say that the game is bad. The game is good. But it has a whole lot of unrealized potential and missing features because it is in very heavy development, and as a result I feel like a lot of its negative reviews are unfair to the game and its developers, especially because of how much effort they put in to balancing the game *while they are making it*, which is needless to say a massive undertaking.\n\nIn particular, there are a few complaints I've seen I'd like to set straight.\n\nThe new curse system is far improved from the old one. When you are cursed, curses are a status effect that can be self-cleansed by any of the usual methods before the end of combat. At the end of combat, this status spawns a number of additional cursed items as loot. These cursed items are (usually) powerful items that have strong upsides, but also have notable drawbacks. The curse part comes in when you choose not to take them. In future combats, curses you have left behind take the place of new battle rewards, (but not chest drops or shop rewards, with the exception of the 'shops spawn instead of loot' challenge mode) and continue to do so until you cleanse the curses, allowing them to be left behind.\n\nOther reviews would lead you to believe this is the only way to deal with curses, but that's not true. Random events that take items accept curses, and treat those curses as Common items (as far as I can tell) for the purposes of rarity. Rerolling loot deletes all curses currently following you. And last, but not least, you can straight up destroy cursed items via conventional means... and in fact, certain cursed items are actually good for destroying curses!\n\nThis system is a HUGE improvement from what it replaced; previously, when you were cursed, you'd get a 1x1, 1x2, or 2x2 token that you had to place into your bag or you'd take scaling damage based upon how many curses you'd skipped. Many of these curses could not be removed without far more limited cleansing and destruction effects (or using them and incurring steep drawbacks) and would destroy anything they were placed upon, and there was no counterplay to curses other than 'kill the enemy before it curses you'.\n\nHazards took the place of the old curses, and now they're temporary items that can be played on top of items in your bag, without destroying them. At the end of each combat, they are completely removed, but items completely covered by hazards are disabled, so watch out. Some of them are a smidge too brutal, but they're very new and still getting active balance passes.\n\nMy general advice to anyone looking at this game: If you don't mind rough edges and somewhat janky balancing in some cases, this game is great. If you're coming into this expecting a perfectly balanced, perfectly polished, finished experience, you won't find that here yet, and you shouldn't expect that. The game is Early Access, and unlike many other games, is *properly using* that label. Even in spite of all that, it is a fun game that I am more than getting my money's worth out of, even after paying extra through Kickstarter to support the developers and get my items added to the game.", "timestamp_created": 1683586909, "timestamp_updated": 1683586909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137989564": {"recommendationid": "137989564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023508422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 974, "last_played": 1693891578}, "language": "english", "review": "Dungeon crawler with kinda quirky mechanics.

I don't want to understate this, you'll be fighting a regular enemy and they can just PERMANENTLY CURSE YOU, there's rare curse removal items and you can remove curses at the healer but you only get to choose one thing at the healer so god help you if you're low on health. I've also been told you can avoid getting the curse by using an item to remove the curse status effect before the battle ends. but again this is just extremely punishing for no reason, I could understand curses being a thing in a challenge game mode but it just being retroactively added to everything is insane. Overall I feel it punishes you for playing the game with your only recourse be hope you find enough anti-curse items (which is impossible considering the frequency you are being cursed.) I wanted to have an open mind but the curse items you're forced to pick up aren't even \"it's got side effects but it's still useful\" it's things like \"+1 dmg but you lose 1 health every turn\" or \"deals 10 dmg but inflicts 3 self damage and stops working\" it's just a horrific side effect with a really lame positive effect. I think there's a fix for this beyond fully removing curses. like maybe making the cursed items down-sides disappear when you purify the curse? or putting the curses into their own game mode solely for the devs? just anything to make the curses feel like they aren't a detriment to the game as a whole. because as is, it stifles the creativity on display with the new characters, and i'm not really sure how it got past early testing.", "timestamp_created": 1683265273, "timestamp_updated": 1683266559, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1683277109, "developer_response": "Hey, There are more ways to remove curses besides cleansing them!

The game is filled to the brim with interesting and fun characters, a unique combat system, intuitive inventory management and cute and expressive pixel art. It combines well-known tropes in both storytelling and game design, and gives it all its own unique spin. You could describe the game as both incredibly easy to pick up and play, and incredibly complex to memorize and master.\n\nThe game involves you picking one of five main characters (currently), each with their own unique playstyle, and dropping into the first floor of a massive megadungeon, equipped with a kit that's unique to them and will be replaced, bit by bit over the course of your adventure. You can swap between setups or \"builds\" with only the items you have on hand and choose between a staggering amount of options, ranging from tiny multi-hit attacks to massive Berserker-like blows that get stronger over time, to a mage with a blazing staff that regenerates mana each turn, to pure defense that slowly takes down enemies through Spikes, a status that hurts enemies each time they strike you, or anything in between. A pacifist's build is possible as well, using the Charm status to turn enemies over to your side. All \"builds\" have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the synergy between each is only bound by your imagination; There's no class system stopping you from trying out anything and everything.\n\nYes, I am singing this game's praises, because I truly believe it deserves it. The care for this passion project is clear to see with every step you take in it. The developers spend plenty of time listening to and talking with the game's fanbase, gathering all kinds of feedback and working on bugs practically in real time. I love this indie adventure roguelike puzzle game, and as you can see by my hours logged here, I'll continue to love it... No matter how many bad reviews it receives.\n\nPart of buying an early access game is inevitably seeing it change, as the developers experiment with the mechanics, items, structure and world. Items will be shifted, buffed and debuffed until they finally click into place. Entire mechanics will be changed, made more interactive, creative and hopefully intuitive as time goes on. By buying an early access game, you agree to support the developers with your purchase, with no promises of what the game turns out to be. You are effectively buying a demo, with the agreement that your money will be used to fund its improvement.\n\nThe game is being hate-bombed by players who somehow mistook this cute, relaxing puzzle game with great, harmonic music, a cheerful tone and fun mechanics for one that allows them to endlessly mash a button and watch pretty numbers go up, with no difficulty or depth of thought. You know the ones, they mash through a tutorial as fast as possible, refuse to read the game's text then blame the game for not telling them what to do or how to do it. This is not a game that lets you do that. You need to learn, adapt and exercise your brain muscles in order to get where you need to go. The game isn't hard to figure out by any means and the most it demands from you is math. If anything, the developers have created many modes and modifiers to fine-tune the game's difficulty to your liking, including some special modes. This game is accessible and thoughtful in its implementation. It is not, however, mindless. It is, in the end, a puzzle game. So if you also like creative puzzle games and grid-based inventory systems, please give this one a try. It goes on sale fairly consistently and I'll happily vouch for it; It's worth the money by far.\n\nI, for one, am very excited to see how they add to the world presented here.

As it stands the hazard system seems fairly comfortable to play with and poses a secondary challenge of items being blocked, or debuffs applied to the player. I still think fire cascading out of control is a bit strong, but the rest seem interesting and a fun challenge, such as smoke flooding your inventory and fading away after a few turns. maybe if the fire had a decay on it, being able to propagate X number of times before it turns into a smoke hazard and goes on from there. Perhaps if the lightning debuf did a similar thing, creating a fire hazard instead of generating more lightning below it. Self damage isn't bad, but when you have large scale inventories it poses a real risk, but again that's half the fun of the game.\n\nSince the curse system (my biggest issue within recent updates) has been adjusted and seems much more friendly (despite it being a hindrance), the game is very good, it might a bit more QA testing for each update, but I would otherwise recommend it\n\n[strike]Update after update, this game looks more and more fun to play, over 700 items to mess around with, But all I get are curses. The newest Hazard/Curse mechanic is just... bad. If you get one curse, you're stuck with that item until you get lucky and get a rare item that can cleanse an item, but only if that item is in your inventory, and even then it's only ONE item, which is compeltely useless when you run in enemy after enemy after enemy after enemy that applies multiple curses to you. Keep in mind this is -after- a hotfix that made it so enemies won't try to curse you if you're already cursed, but they still do. \n\nI really want to like this game, I really do, but with every update changing core mechanics, it goes from a comfy cozy RPG inventory management game, to a damn race against time and praying you get an item that clears status effects (positive and negative), or just hope you can get strong enough before every. single. item, gets replaced with cursed items, that don't go away until you can either fit them in your inventory and get a random lucky decursing item, or pray you can beat the boss with your whimpy gear and get cleansed by the healer at the end of it all (if you have enough money that is).\n\nI can't in good faith give this game a positive review until after an update that fixes or makes these curses not nearly as bad. I preferred the old curse system over this one, and the new hazards are interesting but they escalate and get out of hand WAY to fast. There's one that adds a fire item to your inventory, which spreads to adjacent spaces, which then doubles, quadruples, octuple, and so on, until your inventory is full. The only upside is that they're free to 'clear', but they give 2 burn to you. Unless you can clear any buffs you have, you're absolutely screwed if you don't win immediately after clearing the fires. Oh and did I mention that they dissable anything their ontop of until you clear them?

Enemies begin to get exponentially more powerful each floor you progress, and the experience you gain does not increase with it, which will very quickly leave your once-powerful build nearly powerless. Have an amazing armor-oriented build with some insane armor buildup with spikes to deal with those stronger enemies, not only through spikes and haste, but also your weapon, which deals more damage the more armor you have in your backpack owing to having two pairs of those boots with that effect on your weapon? Before long, you'll deal with enemies who will apply a stack of 20+ poison on you every few turns, paired with another enemy who inflicts you with a similar stack of Weak, rendering you unable to protect yourself from damage and unable to deal damage. And if not poison, then large stacks of Rage being applied to 4+ enemies at once, who often hit twice, every few turns.\n\nThis difficulty spike really begins to kick in by the time you defeat the first boss in the 2nd loop (essentially the 4th boss). I can deal with this, sure, but if you want to see how far you can go... well, good luck.

I just did a quick run with the new update and was happy with how they've adjusted the new curse system. I'm reverting my recommendation back to thumbs up now.\n\nEDIT: With the most recent update and the addition of the new curse system, I have to revise my review. What was once a relaxing game that I spent almost 200 hours playing has become a tedious chore that I no longer enjoy. The new curse system isn't explained very well and adds nothing but a layer of frustration to the game. I went from completely loving the game to hating it. \n\nOriginal review: Love it, love it, love it! I know it's still early access, but I really like what they've done with this game, so far. I haven't even played any of the other characters because I'm so in-love with Purse's mechanics! I really like \"Endless Dream\" mode and love to see how far I can make it. \n\nThe interesting thing about this game, one that everyone is probably already aware of, is that it's not only about packing things in your backpack so that everything fits snugly. No, there's also positives and negatives to take into account for each item, too! Want to be an archer? Well, arrows do more damage the more empty spaces to the right of them. So, if you're a pack-rat, you won't do a whole lot of damage as an archer! There's gems in the game that give you extra energy or more damage! But, sometimes they have quirks that make it so you can't have anything in the diagonal spaces around the gem, or you lose energy or take damage each turn! I love how almost every item makes you think about the positves and negatives and if you really want that extra damage at the expense of something else. \n\nAll in all, this is a charming game.

You'll need an item combo, like mana battery or two plus a wand etc. to make magic items work, but you can't get them all at once, and inert, they occupy space in the bag that has armor and weapons in it keeping you alive. \n\nYou don't have the space to keep things you aren't using, so you have to just walk past items that combine for different builds all the time and are generally stuck with the sword and board build.\n\nA lot of items are just trash as well, self damaging, one use, etc. not worth the space in the bag.\n\nThe game needs GUI improvement, the bag in a bag is really hard to use for example and for some inexplicable reason, when you upgrade your gear the smiths take it out of your pack, if you continue without putting it back in you leave it behind and it is lost forever.\n\nGenerally a lot of tuning is needed for items, space and RNG drop mechanics.\n\nI'll come back in May and see what they did.", "timestamp_created": 1680288091, "timestamp_updated": 1680288091, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135785467": {"recommendationid": "135785467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081643672", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1680600851}, "language": "english", "review": "A BRILLIANTLY fun and unique concept. I knew this game was good when I became instantly addicted to it. \nThis game mostly revolves around strategy and planning which are my favourite aspects of deckbuilders. There's a large variety of factors that go into building your backpack, and being able to find those synergies makes the game so satisfying after spending so much time organising everything with the limited space you have.\n\nAs mentioned in another review, in endless mode it feels like you build your backpack to a point where you can't go much further with it and simply have to hope that it goes as far as possible whilst you repeat the same moves over and over until you die. The 'endless dream' mode allows you to continue improving your build and reach higher levels, but it doesn't change the gameplay of clicking the same buttons over and over again. I feel the limited bag space and the slow rate of level-ups contributes to this feeling as well. Also, unlike other deckbuilders like slay the spire, your available actions are largely not randomly determined, so pushing for higher levels can feel pretty repetitive.\nEven though I love endless modes, I think this is something that has to be accepted (for now) and the game isn't designed to go forever (like most deckbuilders). There's a good variety of characters in the game and some interesting game modes between them, so there's plenty of good fun to get out of the game still.\n\nAs of this time of writing, I reckon the game would benefit from the addition of meta progression systems. Currently, you can unlock harder or alternate modes which is great (I even think more modes/characters should be locked from the start until you complete standard on the first character). \nI do believe they are adding a village for you to upgrade in the future, and I hope it'll add stuff that makes the runs more interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1680244663, "timestamp_updated": 1680244663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135774452": {"recommendationid": "135774452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010653848", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 3551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 912, "last_played": 1693444840}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoyed this game.

I played hard for about 2 months.\nAnd now I bought it with my account and I'm playing it, but I suddenly thought I should leave a review, so I'm writing it. \nIn the hope that the developers got inspiration from this review.\n\nThe backpack management feature wasn't novel, but it wasn't bad either.\nHowever, the overall content feels unpolished, lacks volume, and is out of balance.\nThe balance issue between characters itself can also play a role in the difficulty mode, so it can be.\n\n*The balance between the items is seriously bad, and because of this, the playstyle is generally similar despite the number of items varying somewhat.\nIf you have enough armor, pick up a decent weapon, and have a growth plan, the game is already over.\n\n*There is also a problem that the performance and grade of the item are not properly proportioned.\n\n*The problem is that the backpack is too large, so it can hardly make use of the feature of organizing space.\n(There is a mod that limits backpacks, but it cannot be combined with other mods.)\n\n* It is also a problem that the enemies do not have characteristics.\nExcept for the simple stat difference between the enemies encountered at the very beginning and the final boss, there is no difference that can be felt as unique in their behavior patterns.\nAttack, Poison or Burn, Debuff, Defense, Summon, Buff.\nAll enemies move 'simply' with these as the main, and there is almost no gimmick unique to the enemy.\nI can't even feel that the final boss has a gimmick...\nIt's very disappointing considering that Slay the Spire has all the enemies, elites, and bosses all with their own characteristics.\n'Nemesis' 'Sentry' 'Chosen' etc. I hope you learn how many enemies behave with their own characteristics.\nSince all the enemies in Backpack Hero are similar, the countermeasures also boil down to pursuing simple attack/defense power,\nIt's a big reason why my playstyle becomes similar every time.\n\n* The type of gimmick of the item is lacking. Or, there are many items that cannot utilize gimmicks due to lack of performance.\nThis problem also, in most cases, is the cause of narrowing down the playstyle to simple attack/defense enhancement.\n\n*In particular, I felt that the type of armor and gimmick were lacking. Armor, shoes, helmets, and gloves of decent performance.\nIt's all uncharacteristic, and it's the same in every game.\nWhy no capes, no belts, no shoulder guards?\nThese could give gamers a lot of options.\nArmor, helmet, and shoes should be limited to wearing only one of each.\nInstead, it would be nice to add socks or shirts so that these can be worn under armor or shoes.\nShoulder guards may be limited to those that must be adjacent to a type of armor or clothing. An item that can only be placed in the middle of a backpack would be fun.\nA glove that provides an attack bonus or ignores weapon recoil damage when adjacent to a weapon.\nA gas mask that provides no defense, but somewhat reduces poison.\n\n*To counteract the fact that it is too easy to collect armor and weapons, it can be a good option to set durability on items.\nIt can be destroyed when used a certain number of times, or destroyed when hit a certain number of times.\nIt seems fun to have it destroyed only when it receives more than a certain amount of damage at once, destroyed when it takes damage from burns, or destroyed when it receives poison for more than a certain number of turns.\nSetting the durability in this way also solves the problem that the backpack is too big because you need to have a spare item. Since you have to have a spare item, you will have to manage the space more efficiently. (Durability can be disabled in a space-restricted mode.)\n\n*In addition, there are several game modes, but multiple selection is not possible.\nEven the hardest mode is easy, so I want to mix something like 57 mode, but I can't..\n\nI thought I could forgive all these flaws because it was an early access, but it was scheduled for an official release in April..\nCan these problems be fixed in just two months? I'm not sure...\n\nBut I think this game has potential. Befitting the name ['Backpack' Hero], the feature of space management should be further emphasized. And if you give various gimmicks to the enemies, I think gamers will be able to enjoy it with a sense of tension every time.\n\n*This is my personal complaint, the game is too slow. I'm not talking about computer specs. I would like to add a 10x or 100x speed option. (Like Slay the spire's super fast mod)\nAnd I wish I could assign a hotkey to a specific item. I want to play at high speed by assigning f key to the wooden sword, d key to the shield, s key to the whetstone and the space key to end the turn.\n\n*Is it possible to communicate with the development team via email? I don't use Discord or Twitter.\n\nI have a good feeling about this game and I don't regret buying it at all. So, if the DLC comes out in the future, I will buy all of them. Because this game has plenty of potential for improvement.\nGood luck with this game and its creators.\n\nThis review was written through Google Translate.", "timestamp_created": 1676544137, "timestamp_updated": 1676544286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487772107124328613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132957849": {"recommendationid": "132957849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054593625", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 43174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1281, "playtime_at_review": 26676, "last_played": 1700702959}, "language": "english", "review": "I keep organizing my backpack in this game rather than organizing my life\n\nupdate: Curse update was brutal and a misstep, the developers listened to the community and the game feels good and balanced again now.

A sort-of-Roguelike game where managing your inventory is everything, with a cute aesthetic and a lot to make you think.  You also get into townbuilding, multiple characters and an actual plot!  It's not exactly a must-buy as you have to appreciate what it does, but it's very clever and accessible while leaning into its chosen mechanics.\n\nYou're a cute mouse in a world of cute animals - oppressed by an evil king who's obsessed with a local dungeon where your mom vanished.  With the help of a magic backpack you'll search for the truth, rebuild a town, make friends, and kill a LOT of bad guys.  Welcome to the world of Backpack Hero.\n\nBackpack hero takes inventory management, most people's least favorite part of any game, and turns it into the cornerstone of an entire game.  Inventory management was sort of an annoying puzzle, Backpack hero asks \"What if we made it fun?\" then not only leans into it, but adds a bunch of other stuff besdies.\n\nAs any number of cute creatures with different abilities - from a big backpack to magical powers that create things to pets - you sally forth into dungeons to murder everything until you get to the end.  Most of the story centers around charming mouse adventuress Patch, but there's a Toad sorceress, a cool and suave avian bard, and more.\n\nInventory management/puzzle part is the OBVIOUS core of the game  Some equipment works better in certain positions or adjacent to other positions.  Magical powers manifest new things.  One character is a robot whose inventory is a rube goldberg machine inside of them.  The game turns into a mix of monster-mashing and optimizing arrangements - shades of puzzle and builder games.\n\nThe dungeon romp is more or less standard random-dungeon-and events.  Monsters are interesting and require tactical thought, and limited inventory pushes you to really make decisions.  Physical Space might be your biggest enemy . . .\n\nOnce you leave the dungeon, you get to help rebuild a town which has its own puzzle-like elements.  Resources you bring back help rebuild the town and you can unlock new buildings and options.  The town part is interesting and provides a plot, but at times is a little hard to manage due to the retro interface - and there is some grinding (but then again, hey, semi-Roguelike).\n\nHowever the town and dungeon combine to give you a LOT to do.  Unlock new stuff.  Meet new characters you can also play.  Create an optimal town so you can unlock ALL the equipment.  If you're an unlocker/checklist type gamer, this is up your alley.\n\nSo is it worth it?  It's a great game, but it is a SPECIALIST game.  You have to really enjoy the inventory/puzzle mechanics and the townbuilding grind.  Therefore it's a game that EVOLVES mechanics, but you have to LIKE those mechanics.  If you don't want to calculate object placement and building locations, you're probably not going to enjoy it - which is fine.\n\nSo if you want to see Inventory HEAVILY re-imagined, then this game is 100% for you.  You probably already got it.  It's also a great gift to people who like Rogeulikes just in case.\n\nIt's also an example of why these experimental games matter, as it really dives into mechanical possibilities.", "timestamp_created": 1676050928, "timestamp_updated": 1700684762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132529063": {"recommendationid": "132529063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004299650", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1681795801}, "language": "english", "review": "So after playing the demo for over 100 hours (lol poors) I finally snagged the full game and I am just in love with it.

This comes from the game's lack of new content, which I feel could be improved. What I mean by this would be the pacing of new information to the player. It seems quite overwhelming towards the beginning, but underwhelming and overly easy after one understands every character's mechanics. My experience followed this path exactly, and as I reached the final boss of normal mode, it was very exciting to explore, but after I had completed that mode, the game seemed to pose no further obstacle other than player-induced challenges. \n\nA mechanic that outweighs this slightly would be the modifiers and mutations that one can apply to their runs at the start. However, this did not fix the issue, as, while the game was different in ways and enemies were more threatening, it never felt like I was facing a new or interesting challenge, instead having to adapt to more organizational and logic situations, which is not inherently a problem with game design. This leads into the main point I feel about this game. This game does not seem like it encourages failure much, instead being very forgiving in every gamemode. It seems as it was designed to almost be a sandbox logic puzzle, encouraging the player to find new ways to experiment on their own. I enjoy this aspect, and finding these new ways is invigorating, but unlike larger titles such as Slay the Spire, I feel as if I never get to use any skills or knowledge I gain while experimenting.\n\nThe biggest way I think that this issue could be fixed without change of the core mechanics of the game would be to simply restrain the player to limited items and characters until they unlock this content through reaching milestones. This would encourage a longer playthrough, and reward the player for getting further than required. I know a few friends that love this type of game, and just be able to sit experimenting at their leisure, but that sort of gameplay without proper pressure or difficulty puts me off about the game. \n\nOverall, this game was not what I expected, throwing much of what many other roguelikes include away, and for the time I was learning the basics of the game, and the time where the unknown was to be expected, it blew me away. I do not recommend buying if you want a similar experience to other popular titles (STS, BOR, HOF, DD, ATO, etc.).

A few of them are very simple (use energy, hit enemy) whereas others are designed to interact with adjacent items, or items in the same row/column, or some other idea.\nWhat this means in terms of gameplay is that you have to be very careful when positioning new stuff in your backpack to get the most bang for your buck, as the space is limited and so is the energy per turn.\nThis system is both a blessing and a curse.\nThe good part is the catharsis that comes when you design the most efficient backpack possible and watch as every piece falls into place creating a beautiful cosmos of mechanics that let's you destroy rats in seconds.\nThe bad part is that, once you've reached that point, there's no reason to keep getting new items or touch anything unless some really good item comes your way. In practice, this means that there's a good chance that you'll be \"done\" when you're still half through a run, meaning that from that point onwards every fight will simply be a process of clicking things in order every single turn until death happens, which is not exactly engaging gameplay.\nNow, the game let's you change things on the spot, but doing so consumes your turn (not exactly, but almost), and messing around with the backpack when you have 24 different all interacting with each other items can be a huge hassle.\nThe result is that you will spend a lot of time thinking things through for the first 4 to 6 stages and then just click away 'til the end, which is the exact opposite of how roguelite games usually work, and in my opinion not very engaging.\n\nAlso, and as a minor complaint, certain builds take so many items to start working that it's rarely worth the effort of saving up items just in case it ends up working in the end.\n\nStill thumbs up because it is amazing game design at its core and I think it's absolutely worth exploring what else could this game offer.", "timestamp_created": 1675939020, "timestamp_updated": 1676048951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132461661": {"recommendationid": "132461661", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970354036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "playtime_at_review": 2917, "last_played": 1700255320}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, now with the latest balancing updates, this game rocks hard!", "timestamp_created": 1675933405, "timestamp_updated": 1695322828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132459743": {"recommendationid": "132459743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018243691", "num_games_owned": 1824, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126, "last_played": 1675931424}, "language": "english", "review": "I acquired this game after reading my friend's review.

And the \"Pokemon\" random encounter spamming is actually very annoying.\n\n\nDIFFICULTY\nAnalogy: It's not a easy true or false, it's more like a 8 multiple choice test. (Use your brain and THINK! I MEAN REALLY THINK! THINK HARD!)\n\nThis game is honestly very difficult at the very beginning but gets easier slowly when you collect more items. You can find 2, 3, or 4 monsters that can have a total of 2,3, or 4 attacks while you deal small damage to one monster. (you get stronger slowly later in the game with more items) I guess they did this so people wouldn't complain that the game will be too easy. This game requires you to think to win and I mean really think about your decisions to succeed. I died twice in tutorial. Which is really embarrassing and a shame since it's the TUTORIAL. But proves my point that the game is difficult.\n\nAT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME (BIGGEST FLAWS TO THIS GAME, FIX THIS PLEASE)\n-The backpack is way too small (There was a lot of good gear that could've helped me but took way too many spaces)\n-You do very little damage even after two rounds of collecting items. 1 on 1 monster, 1 on 2 monsters, easy\n1 on 3, 1 on 4, 1 vs. a boss. (early game) WAY TOO DIFFICULT!\n-There's no potions to heal. You gotta be really lucky to find some or make that decision to pick up a 4 space sideways staff that heals a itty bitty tiny bit of health. 4 spaces! Why not make a wand with 2 spaces? (Small Backpack problem)\n\n\nOTHER THINGS\n-very fast download which was very nice.\n\nFloor, Experience, Gold, Stats, Save game, Options tab and map button could be 3 or 4 times bigger. My eyes are bad but not that bad (My glasses are up to date 2023 btw, so no, I don't need better glasses and I put it on full screen) the icons are tiny. \n\nReally cool arcade music. I have excellent hearing btw, and the music is LOUD, had to lower it in options\n\nAfter every battle, click on the map on the far right corner and click a location. Otherwise you will wait forever and see your character bouncing up and down clueless. I was actually stuck for about 2 minutes waiting for something to happen.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nI like the retro arcade graphics and music. Also feels like \"Dungeons and Dragons.\" I will not refund this game. Although it can be very annoying being very challenging. (Means I need to take my time and really think with the battle decisions, really think hard, spend 4 to 7 minutes per battle to pick the perfect decisions)\n\nAnd to answer the question about the reviews being right or wrong. Honestly depends on your skill. \n-If you are a person who's really smart and bright, is naturally highly skilled, and play \"expert\" or \"hell mode\" difficulty for the thrill and fun. As in the intense difficulty doesn't give you stress but makes you excited, the reviews are all correct.\nOR\n-If you are a person like me who is average or below average in intelligence, loves easy games even if it can be boring to win way too much, prefer easy or normal difficulty, or hard mode if I'm feeling dangerous. The reviews are wrong.\n\nFeel free to comment or thrash talk, at least my review is 120% honest and legit.", "timestamp_created": 1675899701, "timestamp_updated": 1675899760, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.394308507442474365", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1675962761, "developer_response": "Thanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful review!

I find that the lack of permanent consequences and the general quickness of the genre lends itself really well to creating a stimulating but ultimately stress-free experience.\n\nWhy am I telling you this?\n\nThere is no denying that Backpack Hero is well designed and generally entertaining, but unlike a lot of other roguelikes it's not relaxing in any way. Not for me, at least.\n\nRuns don't really \"flow\". You have to keep rotating and moving stuff in your backpack, deciding which items you want to keep, which items you want to throw away, which items you want to upgrade, what to buy or sell at the merchant, etc. You spend way more time managing your build than you do actually using it in fights. Once I finish a run I often feel exhausted rather than motivated to try another.\n\nThat being said, the question Steam asks when you're writing a review isn't \"Would you recommend this game to yourself?\" It's \"Would you recommend this game to other players?\"\n\nAnd my answer is yes.

First off, don't take this as scathing criticism of the game, but I wanted to make sure my concerns were highlighted well enough. \n\nMy closest relevant experience to this game is probably Slay the Spire so that's what I'll use for my constructive criticism.\n\nThe game drew me in and hooked me due to the unique inventory management system being the way the game works. It's like making a game out of RE:4 inventory management screen. I actually do really like the game, and it is a ton of fun to play a run. The characters you can play as are actually quite refreshingly unique in their mechanics. It's not Slay the Spire in that characters just get their own unique cards, but each character here gets their own _mechanics_. It's sweet to have a character focused on pets and managing their inventories too. It's cool that a robot is focused on strategic aiming of a charge pulse through your backpack as the only way to activate your items. However there are some stark difficulties I have that I want to share here.\n\nThe largest problem so far is just an overall lack of clarity in pretty much everything. Some of that comes in the limited sprite assets not being high enough resolution and/or poor UI placement, and some comes from no tutorials that tell you what a character's gimmick is. For example - if I summon a pet, which spot does the pet go in? If I rearrange the player/pet order, who uses the energy? How do I revive a dead pet that is no longer there when I leave the room? Why do I have to open each pet's inventory manually every turn to use their items? Why do some items allow effects to be rotated too but not others? A crystal gem can give a bonus to the weapon above it - I can rotate it left to make the effect go left instead, but rotating boots doesn't adjust which direction it checks for spaces to increase the armor value it provides? \"Above\" changes to \"left\" in the text of the gem when rotated, but the boots do not.\n\nThe robot with the pulse system uses the normal energy you'd have per turn as it hits the items it pulses through - reducing the remaining value of the pulse by whatever the hit item costs on activation. There's a splitter item that divides the pulse into two even values in different directions when it hits it, but what happens when an odd number is split? All activation costs are in integer values, but how does a pulse utilize 1.5 energy? Not to mention later as you build up a lot more you'll be throwing pulses through splitters, redirectors, batteries, amplifiers, etc. The amount of pure chaos in the pulses is literally impossible to use for calculation. Am I going to kill this guy and not need to shield? WHO KNOWS?! I literally cannot calculate the values of the pulses ahead of time or even in real time to gauge my strategy. \n\nNext comes balance. For the most part this is actually pretty good, but still needs severe tweaking. There are simply too many items thrown at you, honestly. A chest and post-battle loot can give you upwards of 5-6 items at a time. You can usually take 3 at a time too. Sometimes I'll pick up 4 consumables that deal X damage to enemies. Well the next battle is literally 1 turn long since I just spam them with 0 energy cost. Then the next battle could be 5 enemies at a time in the first dungeon. How am I supposed to deal with that with a wooden sword? I've found three categories of items, in general, as I play through: \n1. 10+ variations of a sword with damages that are extremely similar to the basic sword. Wooden sword does 7dmg for 3 vertical slots and 1 energy. A hooked sword does 10 for 3 hooked slots and 0 energy, but increasing by +1 every use. So every battle I get a maximum of 2 uses of said sword before it's objectively better to use the starting weapon. After that it's 3 wasted slots. Shivs do 2 dmg, take one slot, are free, but can only be used once per turn. Enemies have like 40+ hp in most cases and are almost never alone. It's mostly just a waste of a slot (better for pets though). \n2. A godlike legendary sword/bow that trivializes an entire hour of the game (Jagged Sword). A keg is OP. For 2 gold you can spawn a healing mug. It heals 10hp for 0 energy AND turns into a 0 cost weapon after. AND the keg takes no energy to use AND can be used unlimited times per turn.\n3. Items that take too much luck/investment to even get working - i.e. magic. It utilizes a separate resource system but is limited to the size of your mana crystals. You can expect to get 1-2 uses of a _single_ magic item per fight unless you're ungodly lucky with item drops. Why doesn't a character utilize magic as their main weapon type and actually provide good starting gear/progression for it? Any mage character will still be slapping people with a sword the entire game anyways.\n\nYou can survive most of the time by piecing together builds as you go, but some of the items are just flat-out game ruining if you can find one. And they are not really that rare to be honest. Speaking of game-ruining. You can be doing quite well or holding on well enough for a long time only to be ended completely by a single encounter. One of my godly runs ended because an encounter had 3 enemies - one with over 700hp. My super buffed sword did 70dmg per hit for 1 energy, but they hit for nearly 30-40 damage. I only have 45hp. Even with solid block and a decent few pieces of armor you're looking at 20block passively? Another run I decided to kick a plant in the very first room I walked into - it starts an encounter. Well it was 3 enemies that spam heals for ~20 each on ALL enemies at once. Wooden sword? Literally impossible to win the first room. \n\nI really enjoy build-as-you-go games because it makes me think creatively, but what kind of build am I doing when most of my items are one-time consumables? I can't do a shuriken build because getting spammed with them in 2 battles doesn't guarantee I'll ever see one again. In Slay the Spire you will focus on one aspect of a character's strengths in a run. In Backpack Hero you will focus on specific items and try to tailor them to your character's unique playstyle. In the end no matter who you play as, your run is always dictated by hoping for the strongest legendary items and their buff/synergies. Every character will get mileage out of that Jagged Sword I mentioned. \n\nWhy can I get an hour into a run and the gold/heart/exp drop rooms still only give 5 of their resource? I need 150xp for a level...\n\nSo far as I can tell there's no real reward system for playing either. No new card packs, character levels, or other unlocks. Slay the Spire doesn't have as much breadth of content as what BH is trying for, but it is _solidly_ balanced, consistent, and predictable. \n\nI want to be clear here. The only reason I am being this harsh is because I saw that the plan for EA was 7 months and we are ~6 months in from original release. I have not done much research or followed any roadmaps/updates, so this is all judgment based on my experience going in blind. There's a ton of potential here, but at the moment it just isn't there for me. I have no doubts this can be great, but I do have doubts that it will be soon.", "timestamp_created": 1675817278, "timestamp_updated": 1675817278, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664242267608642578", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1675969496, "developer_response": "Thanks for writing such a detailed review!

The game has a great, original concept, the developers have obviously put a lot of time and effort into the game, and the game is fun and enjoyable, so it feels wrong to leave a negative review, especially when the dev can potentially lose sales due to negative reviews.\n\nOriginal:  I have had a lot of fun with this game, however I am marking this as negative because there are some issues that hold it back from being a great game, and I want to make sure the developer sees this so it will be a great game and I can update the review and flip it to being positive.\n\nI'll start with my biggest issue: there's no sense of accomplishment.  After playing and beating it, it's pretty deflating to see a wedge of cheese with throwaway text and a Start Over button, and that's after a wall of stats pop up after you beat a boss that you're not even aware is the final boss.  Now, obviously the ideal would be something like The Binding of Issac where there are multiple possible endings with actual cutscenes, but if that is beyond the scope of the game, at least have some celebratory artwork, credits, and music.\nI realize that in the store meta-progression (in an overworld, no less) is planned for the final release, so hopefully that will be addressed there, but another element of the lack of accomplishment is the complete lack of Steam Achievements.  I've done some pretty cool stuff in the game, like kill the final boss in one turn, kill 5 enemies with a single move, beat the harder modes, beat the game without taking damage, etc., but it feels kind of hollow without the little thrill of getting an achievement.\n\nAnother aspect that feels pretty hollow is the endless mode.  I had a pretty overpowered build, and went into the endless mode after beating the game, but the ramping of the enemies is terrible, it didn't take long before the enemies had over 8K HP and became a brick wall.\n\nNow obviously this being Early Access there are some glitches and oversights (like Rage not powering up Scratch, for example, the ninja helmets being unusable if you've reorganized them into a pouch after using them, or more serious issues like not being able to click on anything and having to exit the game) but I expect these to get worked out, that's what Early Access is there for anyways, but some things are missing that were in the demo, and that's puzzling.  For example, in the demo when you grab one of your items in the shop, it will immediately tell you how much the shopkeeper will buy them for.  For some reason that's missing in the full game, and from trial and error you'll discover that the prices are based on the rarity of the item, so not a huge issue for experienced players, but an unnecessary hurdle for new players.", "timestamp_created": 1674562790, "timestamp_updated": 1674919712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131428213": {"recommendationid": "131428213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198407099384", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 25511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12580, "last_played": 1696276590}, "language": "english", "review": "e", "timestamp_created": 1674512106, "timestamp_updated": 1674512106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131394661": {"recommendationid": "131394661", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996658883", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 6836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 105, "playtime_at_review": 1901, "last_played": 1700520160}, "language": "english", "review": "Best way to play with a mouse sack on steam.

Unfortunately the architecture of the game is built in a way, that at some point in the game, you basically lock down your backpack build and you go with it until you finish the game or die trying. At this point the game becomes pointless and you basically just click away until the end. There is no real variation with the enemies, that would require you to figure out new tactics to survive. \n\nI see this troublesome for the developers, because your backpack build is difficult to change fast, so is is almost impossible to even vary the enemies much, as players wouldn't have anything to counter the changes. IMO this all boils down to the  core concept of backpack organizing, which is nice on paper, but is really restrictive when you try to build a good game around it. Good comparison of this would be Slay the spire, where you have game changing relics, and literally multiple different ways to kill the enemies and the enemies have also many different ways to kill you. I really hope that the developers can find a way the fix this issue, as in its current form, the game get repetitive very fast. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1674464382, "timestamp_updated": 1674464382, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 458, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881928145885467529", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131384071": {"recommendationid": "131384071", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229708471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 141, "last_played": 1674624926}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a great game so far but for people who see this and get the game with the robot character if you duplicate the core with an event you can not get rid of it without dying thus wasting space", "timestamp_created": 1674449442, "timestamp_updated": 1674449442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131379439": {"recommendationid": "131379439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023494434", "num_games_owned": 490, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 499, "last_played": 1676084988}, "language": "english", "review": "this is great rouge lite game, fir the price currently, its good, lots of fun and a really cool main game mechanic.\nsupport more of these indie games please!

This is especially bad for the robot, with whom I've run the same exact setup with different weapons every time, winning easily, but is also a big problem for all characters. There are some fun, weird builds that you can make work, but you need to go out of your way, and it might fail. If, instead, you find a bow, gg, you win automatically. \n\nThe runs individually are also slightly too long, partly because the combats just take quite long.

His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way\u2014marking the points with a lean forefinger\u2014as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.\n\n\u201cYou must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?\u201d said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.\n\n\u201cI do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is all right,\u201d said the Psychologist.\n\n\u201cNor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere I object,\u201d said Filby. \u201cOf course a solid body may exist. All real things\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t follow you,\u201d said Filby.\n\n\u201cCan a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?\u201d\n\nFilby became pensive. \u201cClearly,\u201d the Time Traveller proceeded, \u201cany real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and\u2014Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp; \u201cthat . . . very clear indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,\u201d continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. \u201cReally this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not,\u201d said the Provincial Mayor.\n\n\u201cIt is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly\u2014why not another direction at right angles to the other three?\u2014and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four\u2014if they could master the perspective of the thing. See?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words. \u201cYes, I think I see it now,\u201d he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\n\n\u201cWell, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\n\n\u201cScientific people,\u201d proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this, \u201cknow very well that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, \u201cif Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?\u201d\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled. \u201cAre you so sure we can move freely in Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said the Medical Man. \u201cThere are balloons.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill they could move a little up and down,\u201d said the Medical Man.\n\n\u201cEasier, far easier down than up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the present moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth\u2019s surface.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the great difficulty is this,\u201d interrupted the Psychologist. \u2019You can move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, this,\u201d began Filby, \u201cis all\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said the Time Traveller.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s against reason,\u201d said Filby.\n\n\u201cWhat reason?\u201d said the Time Traveller.\n\n\u201cYou can show black is white by argument,\u201d said Filby, \u201cbut you will never convince me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly not,\u201d said the Time Traveller. \u201cBut now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTo travel through Time!\u201d exclaimed the Very Young Man.\n\n\u201cThat shall travel indifferently in any direction", "timestamp_created": 1672298839, "timestamp_updated": 1672298839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129550858": {"recommendationid": "129550858", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971629434", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 924, "playtime_at_review": 1527, "last_played": 1700569295}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cute, slay the spire style combat with interesting and unique mechanic involving choosing and organizing your loot.

They've struck a perfect balance of difficulty and fun, and aren't afraid to let you run away with a totally ridiculous backpack build if you're smart enough to arrange one. The amount of flexibility and customization baked into the game means we get nearly endless options for play style. Each character adds unique mechanics and strategies. Not to mention adorable art and personality! The soundtrack is full of bops, too.\n\nEven in early access, the game feels smooth, satisfying, and complete. AND STILL! This is clearly a labor of love because the devs release incredibly frequent (!!! Seriously! Devs! Y'all are amazing!) updates and even seasonal content (Halloween and Winter Holidays so far). I'm excited to see what gets added to the lore and world building behind this ridiculously fun bag-based adventure.\n\n I've even found that playing on the testing branch doesn't break the game in any meaningful way (sure, you can tell it's a little scruffier, but not in a way that impacts fun).\n\nPlease give this little game a shot! I've had hours of fun with it already, and if you're still not convinced, the dev team offers a very-very-very-early version (a mere glimmer of what it is now!) of the game for free on itch.io Go try it!

If it seems boring to arrange an inventory, just know, it isn't just that and has much more to it.\nMany different builds to try, with different characters changing the gameplay formula drastically. \nItems are rather unique, and add depth to gameplay instead of just damage ups.\nMany special ? and ! rooms can shake up a run\nSAVING DURING A RUN, this is a big one, and it makes a single misclick less unforgiving.\n\nCons:\nCertain builds can b hard to learn. (At least for me, the mana items took so long to get used to how they work)\nCertain builds NEED a specific few items to work, which can be limiting.\nAs it is in early access, still has some balancing to go.\nSome weapons are just better than others. (straight upgrades, which means if you get unlucky you don't get these straight upgrades)\nSome builds just seem bad, or hard to make work. (For me, I find structures like brick to be less good than just armor.)\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game.

It\u2019s got a simple yet solid set of game mechanics that is just so much fun to play even with the (plenty) of flaws the current game has. In addition the game doesn\u2019t (currently) lock its content behind a frustrating timesink wall that requires you to grind out hours in order to progress. \u2018Progression\u2019 systems have ruined otherwise enjoyable games for me, so I\u2019m really happy to see that isn\u2019t the case here. The short version of this review is that if you like roguelites with more a space management/micromanagement vibe, Backpack Hero will definitely scratch that itch.\n\nThe base gameplay of Backpack Hero involves reducing the HP of a parade of enemies to 0 as you traverse a dungeon to fight the boss. There\u2019s not much of a plot, though with all the items and enemies you could probably hack together some Dark Souls like lore nonsense if you really felt compelled. The primary loop of the game involves killing (or sometimes befriending) enemies, getting loot, then using that loot to defeat new enemies. None of this probably sounds impressive, and indeed, there isn\u2019t really anything Backpack Hero does that\u2019s new. What makes it so enjoyable is just how hard it leans into that rote RPG experience.\n\nAll your items take up space, and the \u2018game\u2019 isn\u2019t so much what you do in battles, but how you prepare for them. Certain items require space in your titular backpack in order to function. Some require proximity to other items, some need to be spaced far away from other items. Some items need literal space to move around between turns. When you\u2019re choosing what to add to your inventory, you are constantly playing a game of what you need right now vs what will be useful later. In a weird twist in a game about a backpack, hoarding can be to your detriment, and the game actively pushes you to use consumables rather than stockpiling them. There isn\u2019t one right way to play and every floor can be a game of figuring out what your priorities need to be and how to adapt to what gets thrown at you. This foundation is incredibly enjoyable, and kept me coming back to clear out the more challenging modes.\n\nWith that said, there\u2019s a lot to turn your nose up at as well. Enemies are basically just damage dealers, and there isn\u2019t much creativity on that front. Enemy types can look really similar, which doesn\u2019t really matter because they rarely do anything different from one another anyway, but combined with the somewhat bland art style it\u2019s easy to look at the game and not be terribly impressed by what you\u2019re looking at. The UI is buggy, and particularly on the puzzle game modes,  downright incomprehensible. The music isn\u2019t that good, and the sound design could use more work to be more satisfying. The base gameplay is more of a tutorial level difficulty and you will probably clear your first game by complete accident. The harder difficulties and challenge modes are truly where the game shines, as each game becomes its own unique puzzle to solve, but if you just play the bog standard mode you\u2019ll probably get bored very quickly. I would highly recommend the higher difficulties, at least up to Hard Mode 3, which is as far as I've gotten.\n\nThere are at the time of this review 5 wildly different characters to play as in addition, which is impressive even if I don\u2019t think they all hit the mark. The mouse character and robot are standouts to me, with the robot in particular being a clever twist on autobattlers that honestly feels compelling enough that it could be its own game. Unfortunately I found the frog and hedgehog (?) characters very tedious to play, owing in part to clunky UI. \n\nLooking forward to see what the team does when the game is out of early access!\n", "timestamp_created": 1670029567, "timestamp_updated": 1670029567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127797631": {"recommendationid": "127797631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035911630", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 50, "last_played": 1671060510}, "language": "english", "review": "For you, it's on the mouse.", "timestamp_created": 1670024096, "timestamp_updated": 1670024096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567341625690460205", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127791999": {"recommendationid": "127791999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088933301", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 462, "playtime_at_review": 5862, "last_played": 1700195654}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Enjoyable game.", "timestamp_created": 1670017657, "timestamp_updated": 1670017657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127788024": {"recommendationid": "127788024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015499779", "num_games_owned": 508, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 2414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 689, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1700737542}, "language": "english", "review": "Very comfy game, when you wanna take it slow and chill.\nThe backpack mechanics with different type of weapons are indeed fun and different from one another.\nGame also throws alot of consumables (and items in general) in a run at you, so you never feel stuck with a bad luck.\n\nBut, on the other hand - game is extremelly easy.\nI'm not claiming my judgement is 100% objective, giving that i only played two runs (one per first two chars) but both runs i never felt challenged, bosses weren't threatening at all.\n\nThis is a big downside for me, cause it's either means game lacks depth or it's very unbalanced.\nI like the mechanics of the game, but balance-wise...\nWay to easy to start stacking infinite damage, healing options are also way too numerous and basically free.\n\nWill be looking forward for future updates, hope difficulty wise game sorts itself out for a full release.\nOr not and be kind of a casual game - which is also fine. \nJust not for me", "timestamp_created": 1670013198, "timestamp_updated": 1670013198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127787795": {"recommendationid": "127787795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120721022", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1083, "playtime_at_review": 1388, "last_played": 1700703298}, "language": "english", "review": "A game about inventory management sounded interesting, and I don't regret the purchase.

All rogue-likes/lites place different amounts of importance on each aspect. The extreme end of conflict-focused rogue-likes/lites would be Heat Signature, where there is hardly any preparation and the fun is in improvising based on what you're given. Somewhere in the middle would be deckbuilding rogue-likes/lites like Slay the Spire or Inscryption (the first act) where the cards you choose to put into your deck can change your odds greatly but you still need to make good decisions during the battles. That is usually as far as games go towards conflict preparation-focused gameplay: somewhere in the middle where both aspects of gameplay are equally important. This is the first rogue-like/lite that I've played that crosses the line to the other side where the preparation for the battles is more important than how you play the battle itself (depending on your build and character). There is even a character (CR-8) where battles are almost entirely autonomous. This game also challenges some preconceived notions the gaming community has about what makes fun gameplay. Inventory management has always been seen as a necessary evil that no player enjoys having to deal with but is necessary because it accentuates other aspects of the gameplay such as scarcity of resources and the tension that results from it. However, this game shows that even aspects of games that players begrudgingly go along with (inventory management) can be made to be deeply nuanced and satisfying if done correctly. This game makes me wonder what other parts of gameplay that players frequently moan about can be made to become beloved as well. May I even daringly suggest escort missions?\n\nRegardless of how you feel about inventory management in video games, this game is worth at least a try simply due to how it can change how you think about gameplay mechanics.

You have multiple characters with various ways to play each of them and multiple optional challenges if you like that kind of stuff.\n\nThe gameplay itself is easy to learn but provides a surprising amount of depth and the random roguelike nature of it means that every player will have successful runs from time to time while more experienced players will still frequently enjoy having tougher runs (that's not even factoring in the challenge modes). If you like simple yet deep roguelike games you will probably like Backpack Hero.\n\nEDIT: Small update, with the game now fully released, I can only recommend it more.

It's not even hard to put together some basic builds that generate so much value either by bursting enemies down or by providing enough free block every turn that you don't need to dedicate any energy to it. \n\n- Another problem related to the first point is that enemies don't really provide varied challenges. You can mostly just defeat them all in the same way by becoming generically stronger. You don't need to evolve your strategy and adapt as you go on, you just need to keep adding power. The game even has different zones you can sometimes choose between but for the life of me I couldn't tell you what was different about them other than the background art. \n\n- Because you're so limited on space and many builds take up a lot of space to combo and be effective, it's really hard to pivot your build based on finding new cool items. In a deckbuilder like slay the spire, the cost of adding a currently dead card to your deck is just that you will occasionally draw it in a hand of 5+ cards instead of something else. In this game, you might have to give up a critical part of your current build that will make you much weaker in fights on a speculative item that may not pay off.

Its hard to know what an item means at times, and the tooltips are lack luster. While I have kind of enjoyed the game, it just isn't ready. They say the game will release in April, but I don't see how they can pull that off with so many bad item interactions and a fairly limited item pool. It seems a lot, but depending on the way you build and your tactics, you find that there are not many items that will benefit you. I'd also say they added way too many consumable items. A consumable heavy build is pretty fun I admit. I think there is something at the heart of the game that fundementally isn't working. I think it is to due with the fact that better items are more rare, but there is no item scaling. That is, to some extent fine for the way they have it now. But as it stands there are only 9 floors, 3 bosses and you beat the game....Once you do and go into unlimited mode, the enemy scaling quickly outpaces the items which don't get any better until it becomes numerically impossible which isn't a satisfying way to lose and so I don't really do it. Nothing new pops up. I don't know. I'd say wait for a huge sale. Unless in the next 6 months things massively change, I wouldn't suggest the game. I think I've done everything I could have wanted to explore in a couple dozens playthroughs. I'm not a fan of the variety through different characters thing they have going. But thats maybe personal. Seems dangerous to have done that path since it means you now have to balance everything for every character, and if something is too OP for even a single character, it has to become useless for all the others. Kind of a shame. Oh well. Get the game if it goes on sale for $10 or less. I think it is really fun, but for a rogue-like it has shockingly poor replay value in my eyes, considering you don't really get much out of new runs. Its not like I'm trying to improve my reaction times. I simply click things in turn based combat. Not much room to improve there, and I like the turn based thing. I need more chill games, but I just think the game's foundation was faulty from the start. I want a run to last a long time, not after 9 floors.

Your experience may vary and/or be different, be aware of that. No two humans are the same but we could have similarities. Here I write about things I dislike and like about the game. The conclusion will give an overal description.\n\n\n\n[h1]What do I dislike?[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Balancing (1)\n[*]Sound\n[*]UI / Menus (2)\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]What do I like?[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics\n[*]Animation\n[*]Overall character and enemy design\n[*]Game idea (3)\n[/list]\n\n\n\n[h1](1) Balancing[/h1]\nThe game's balancing is so extremely off that you will experience the \"what did I do wrong?\"-feeling quite a lot. Not because you did something wrong but because the enemy scale at combat turn 1, fight 1, stage 1. If you are not on your toes the whole time you will face game over extremely fast.\n\nThis isn't as prominent within the standard game mode but definitively within some of the harder challenges. Don't get me wrong here: Challenges should be, well, a challenge. But \"sheer extreme luck\" should not be the only (read exactly!) way to get through a challenge.\n\nMy personal approach is always: Luck 1/5, Knowledge & Planning 3/5 and last but not least ressource management 1/5.\n\nOverall the dev(s) are, in my opinion, overburdened with the balancing of the game since they probably not using scalable and modular functions (If you don't know what this is. It's basically a \"Lego set\" for creating in-game content automatically in which you just have to tweak a single number in most cases)\n\nIn game modes in which you are limited to your 3x3 space you can still get items through events that are larger than the space available. But this is rarely happening and thus, for me, just a minor inconvinience - still an inconvinience.\n\n\n\n[h1](2) UI / Menus[/h1]\nI am not happy with the menus and/or UI design of this game. It get's it's job done but it's not \"dumdum proofed\" (Which is just a saying.). Especially when picking up loot. You have a button that says \"Done picking up loot\" which has no right to be existing in any way. You can move on, skip and pick up loot without that button.\n\nNext part is when you want to restart a run. Restart needs you to be in an empty room. This is also, in my opinion, a very bad design choice since when someone want to do a restart, they should do a restart.\n\nMenus don't close automatically if you want to do something else. For me it's a major inconvinience to have to click up to three times to get away from an event (character) that I just want to see what they offer.\n\n\n\n[h1](3) Game idea[/h1]\nThis is where the magnifiency starts for real. Every single character you play has a completely different way to play and/or puzzle the game! You can have the classic character (as in the demo!) which has the biggest inventory space at the end. Another one has a deck-building mechanic within the backpack-building mechanic.\n\nThe third character has you to puzzle through your backpack to create a \"circuit\" of attacks and defenses. Last but definitively not least the currently last character as of this writing: The musician.\n\nThe musician uses the 'charm' debuff to 'convince' enemies to be on his side. With the power of music and friendship :) Absolutely fun! And an extreme variety especially with the challenges for each and everyone of those characters. A fifth character is in the work and for me it looks like they have a pet. I am looking forward to this.\n\nEverything else is also very exciting: You have a lot of different combinations of items, weapons, armor and so much more that you will be playing for a while until you have seen everything. Even if you have seen everything you have enough variety to make every playthourgh exciting, no matter the build you go for.\n\nThe main mechanic and thus the gameplay loop is executed extremely good yet the balancing throws you off at times. Even if that may sound like a gamebreaking moment you will probably come back for more. Until the balancing is fixed you can skip the extreme challenges and do all the others and there are. A. Lot!\n\n\n\n\n\n[h1]Overall conclusion[/h1]\nIf you like Monster Train, Slay the Spire and so many other deck building games, this will be up your alley. I promise you that. Although this game doesn't invent the genre anew it certainly has some serious good mechanics to keep you entertained and coming back.\n\nIf you're new to the whole genre of deck-building (or here: backpack tetris ^^) and rogue lite genre, this here makes an excellent entry point since it's easy to understand and easy to master relatively quickly.\n\nI would give this game an absolutely yes on to buy it with or without a sale. This has proofen, for me, to be worth every single cent I've paid.\n\nIf the dev(s) can keep it up, the game will be easily a nominee for some serious prices.\n\n\n\nStay crunchy.", "timestamp_created": 1666772877, "timestamp_updated": 1666772877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586466372013092041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124402249": {"recommendationid": "124402249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059909101", "num_games_owned": 485, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1668648266}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an excellent twist on Slay the Spire.

It also has a fairly simple game play loop and a lot of replay-ability. At least in theory. \n\nThe main problem the game ends up having is the sheer number of items, weapons and equipment available to you to choose from but with a combination of pure RNG, highly limited inventory and how much is needed for some builds to even work leaves you with a game that ends up feeling more frustrating than not much of the time. There are a few combinations of items that seem like they'd be fun to try, but ultimately end up being more of a risk than it's worth due to how many different types of items can be thrown at you. \n\nStructure combinations, cleavers, and magic are among the many options that seem amazing as a concept but very underwhelming and unreliable in reality. They have incredible potential but require a specific set of items to appear in order to make them worth hanging onto which ends up leaving you with defaulting to the reliable pick up instead of hanging onto them hoping a key items shows up to make it all worth it. \n\nThe end result is a game that ends up feeling very frustrating when your loss is just pure RNG giving you an extremely good bow only to never drop one arrow for the entire rest of the run, or give you four really good arrows but not a single bow to use them with, or floors with many locked doors but not a single key drop for the entire run, or a few cleavers that work extremely well with many other cleavers but never giving you more than those two, or many basic cleavers but none of the higher rarity cleavers required to make them worth having. It's not anything the game itself is specifically doing poorly it just seems to be the nature of how the RNG operates and how heavily it's relied on in the game from map generation to item drops. \n\nThen there's the curses. They seem fun in concept but with a game that relies so heavily on inventory management and specific placements of items, throwing in curses that can at times be impossible to prepare for, especially when the game's RNG throws at you 3 enemies in a single battle that each rotate hitting you with a different curse that tend to be 1 or two squares in size. The cost of not having room for them is taking a bunch of damage and getting rid of them from your inventory can be just as costly ranging from granting the enemy buffs that can result in a run ender if you get rid of them, but can also end the run if you don't get rid of them quickly at the same time. \n\nThe difficulty in this game also ramps up extremely hard at the last third of the game which kills any run that hasn't already gotten really good synergies to work with. The difficulty spike as well as the large variety of items to chose from, as well as the requirements to get many of the combinations to work properly result in a game you will lose 99% of the time by the last area of the game.\n\nDespite how enjoyable the game has the potential to be, the problems that are presented with how the game currently operates makes it hard to recommend. If you enjoy this style of game there is a lot of enjoyment to be had from it, as long as you can get over the many problems it has.

People tend to have this misconception that roguelites will inherently have broken or unbeatable scenarios, which is not necessarily true, but Backpack Hero falls squarely into that category and has fallen into it every single run I have played thus far.\n\nYou simply cannot play a balanced run in it so far. Once you understand how to manage your inventory, builds very quickly become one-note nukes with extreme potency at most encounters, but all it takes is one gimmick you can't deal with to instantly kill you. The screen gets very busy with information some of which is unclear, and due to the main mechanic of managing a fairly tight inventory space, you HAVE to specialize if you want to actually deal the sort of damage the game expects from you.\n\nAs a result, Backpack Hero ends up feeling a little bit flaccid once you realize what kind of gameplay loop is in store for you. Get extremely strong, die an unavoidable death at a highly specific encounter, reset, and play again knowing that your run, at any point, will end to basically anything.

A backpack is fully open information, and its up to you to decide how to organize it. The map really lent to that appeal, since you could strategically plan your exploration around your items. Things like \"Should I spend a key now to regain some room in my bag when I know it could be used later for a shop?\", \"I should hold on to this legend in case the question mark is a 'rarity trade' event\". or \"I should sell stuff at this shop now, because I know theres a chest coming up and I need room for that\" were strategic decisions that I as a player had to make.\n\nWithout that 'open information', I feel like Im just throwing things around in the dark, and don't have an extra layer of game on top of the combat system. Its just 'kill thing, see what I find, pigeonhole myself into a build, because I don't know if I can be flexible on this floor, die, repeat'. It feels like I have less agency and choice now, and the choices I do make are inherently devalued where they weren't before.\n\nIt might sound overdramatic to say, but this one small change has genuinely ruined the game for me. It completely removed a layer of strategic gameplay that I found engaging on top of the backpack management, and simultaneously devalues the core gameplay loop of managing a backpack's contents through tough decisions.\n\nI've already seen responses that say their next update is a dungeon redesign which will do things like 'add a shop to each floor for reliability', but I hope with all the similar feedback Ive seen they change it back, or even make it an option to toggle. A \"\"Dungeon Redesign\"\" can't add strategic depth like the game originally had before this was added.\n\nAs it stands now, I can't recommend it but I truly hope to be able to in the future.\"[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1665678545, "timestamp_updated": 1665678545, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544438302516937256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123731618": {"recommendationid": "123731618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059850002", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 623, "last_played": 1674672953}, "language": "english", "review": "So excited to see how this game will end up being!

I definitely recommend people to try it out!)\n\nTl;dr: I think Backpack Hero is worth trying for fans of the roguelike deckbuilder genre (despite how the game is marketed as an inventory management roguelike), just for the innovations it tried. For people new to the genre though, I think the game needs to have a more polished UI and explain more things that come as natural to fans of the genre, but you should still be in for a good time despite that.\n\nGameplay:\nI would say the base concept of adding spatial management to a roguelike is executed very well in this game. Some items work with how they are positioned or how they move to provide combat bonuses, and powerful items are balanced by their size or restriction they place on inventory management, making full use of the spatial management concept.\n\nPacing:\nThe pacing of the game is also very good. Each normal run (beating the area 3 boss) takes around 1 hour to finish, which to me feels like a good length. Combat is quick, and generally no animation is excessively long (except for the robot's energy beams). One thing I dislike about the combat is how enemies can grow stronger with time within each combat, especially when it is not communicated to the players. But this should not affect players most of the times. \n\nPresentation:\n(This part is very much my own opinion) The presentation is decent - the music is very good, especially the combat theme and the area themes. On the other hand, the visuals are just okay and really does not stand out as stylish.\n\nDifficulty:\nThe run progression / difficulty curve feels okay. You are frequently tasked with solving more and more difficult (and varied) combats, and the boss battles do require some preparation, so the game is very engaging when you need to solve these problems. However (personal opinion from someone that is familiar with the genre), when you know what to optimize and find good items or forge options, the run can feel like it is solved, lowering engagement. I would suggest slightly increasing the difficulty, but again it should depend on the data developers have.\n\nExtras:\nFinally, did I mention that there're a bunch of custom modes for you to try? Because there is and they boost replayability by a lot. For an early access title, this game has a surprising amount of content.\n\nNow, some issues I think that can be improved on:\nThe UI\n1) The item cards should be slightly reworked. When an item receives many different effects from different sources, the item card will stretch out and go beyond the screen, becoming basically unreadable. There is an option to open a separate window but it isn't the default - maybe it should be?\n2) A lot of things are not explained to players. I know that burn and poison are different in how they damage you, but it is not explained unless you hover over the entity suffering from them. Why is it not explained in the item cards that apply them? Also, I didn't understand what the map square with a \"!\" is about, until a friend pointed out that it shows the area boss - also not explained.\n3) There is no tutorial on carving removal. If you are familiar with the genre you would guess you can do that, and you would be right, but the option is behind 2 layers of menus (While in a carvings shop, you need to go to your carvings menu, and then go to the drop down menu of the carving you want to remove via right click, then there's the option). This is VERY unintuitive. Also the option is not fully translated for some languages.\n\nThe characters\nI don't believe that there needs to be a balance of power level between characters, but I do believe that they should feel unique from each other. There lies my issue with the characters. Of course I could be wrong (especially if the data on developers' side disagrees with my feelings), so interpret this with caution.\n1) Currently, pochette and the robot feel sufficiently distinct from the rest of the cast, but the others feels similar-ish. I think the issue here is that the generalist way of playing (The play that is available regardless of the character you are playing) is more powerful than character-specific way of playing for the other 3 characters. For example, it is relatively easy to get a combo of cleavers (good and highly available for all characters besides the robot) or to power up a single legendary weapon to do the heavy lifting, such that I will not need to pick up carvings, care about separate pockets, or consider charming the enemy.\n2) Some characters don't start out different enough. I can almost always go to the generalist play style within a few combats from the starting backpack. Maybe making different drop pools at different stages of the game (especially early game) will help diversify playstyle? (I'm happy to see that pochette managed to be different from the rest of the cast by having friendly unit drops as items, which certainly makes me build the character different from the others.)", "timestamp_created": 1665482219, "timestamp_updated": 1670595647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619554102420806885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123657422": {"recommendationid": "123657422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091125882", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "playtime_at_review": 390, "last_played": 1700441401}, "language": "english", "review": "The Good Shit.\n\nand no this doesn't make me a furry.", "timestamp_created": 1665442384, "timestamp_updated": 1665442396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769246816635132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123652461": {"recommendationid": "123652461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025692050", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 5876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5156, "last_played": 1698417552}, "language": "english", "review": "i have not stopped playing this since the original kickstarter demo. help", "timestamp_created": 1665433123, "timestamp_updated": 1665433123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123639636": {"recommendationid": "123639636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100790032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 221, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1664802949}, "language": "english", "review": "i am not interested in playing the pack rat game", "timestamp_created": 1665414421, "timestamp_updated": 1672752386, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417246162891387939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123633926": {"recommendationid": "123633926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149600070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 90, "playtime_at_review": 3044, "last_played": 1700694593}, "language": "english", "review": "its good give it a try", "timestamp_created": 1665405387, "timestamp_updated": 1665405387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123613835": {"recommendationid": "123613835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086078155", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1700067591}, "language": "english", "review": "cute", "timestamp_created": 1665358897, "timestamp_updated": 1665358897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769246816635132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123612242": {"recommendationid": "123612242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005507129", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 10491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 133, "playtime_at_review": 3155, "last_played": 1700705319}, "language": "english", "review": "The demo is a great way to start your addiction to this game, but remember to buy the full version", "timestamp_created": 1665355615, "timestamp_updated": 1665355615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123609305": {"recommendationid": "123609305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068718724", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8466, "last_played": 1679837954}, "language": "english", "review": "This is right up there with FTL for great rouge likes  the inventory managment systems really gives it near  infinte replayability.

The game is not finished, it is incomplete and full of bugs. \n\nThe story or narrative itself may have a beginning and an end, but the game still feels like it is in beta testing. Game mechanics still haven't been fleshed out and sometimes they haven't been figured out, so the game may see massive updates that change it drastically. This is what Early Access was intended for, to test things in the game to see what sticks and what doesn't, and to help the developers find bugs, but apparently that didn't help finding them since the game is still riddled with bugs.\n\nA small rundown just to give you an idea:\n[olist]\n[*]A bug that deletes your town\n[*]One that changes your town into something else\n[*]One that removes your max health\n[*]One that deletes your save file\n[/olist]\nAdmittedly, the game was way more buggy, borderline unplayable at times 2 years ago, but if you're gonna take it out of Early Access prematurely and charge it full price, then it is in your potential buyer's best interest to avoid it for the time being. \n\nTo know whether the game is finally good to purchase, check the Steam forum. If it only has 1 or less bug report thread, then that means it is stable.\n\nOriginal review:\nVery good game for the most part, I recommend it to anyone who likes strategy rpgs, inventory management and Slay The Spire.\n\nAlthough it is an Early Access game, it is already fairly complete and functions just fine. There are still issues to correct, and the story mode to add according to the roadmap, however, it provides far more content than most other betas and games in Early Access, including several playable characters with each a unique gameplay gimmick. \n\nFurthermore, it is dangerously addicting. In terms of replay value, this game is great at it. It is full of extra challenge modes to test your skills at the game to the best of your ability.\n\n\nMy only complaint would be for how much the game is causing problems when the developer is putting out updates. Sometimes, a new item will be added that will be overwhelmingly more powerful than every other item in-game and sometimes the opposite is true. Sometimes, a new feature is added that nobody likes.\n\nThe oldest occurrence of this issue, regarding balance, was back when magic items were added. Mana was a finite stackable resource much like money is. However, because it was stackable and it had no cap, it was absolutely overpowered. By picking up books and wizard clothings, it was possible to generate an endless supply of mana during fights, which meant anyone could just just get as much mana as needed on a prior fight before beating the enemies and then, given the right circumstances, just spam the wand until they win the next battle. This was changed into the current system which is fine and works well. \nThis mechanic stayed in the game in spirit. If you can manage to find the Orksork Axe, you are gonna have a great time. Unfortunately, there is no item that generates money for free (only items that generate money whenever the player kills enemies and the piggy bank that generates money at the end of fights), so it is not nearly as broken, but in the gamemode \"Penny Pincher\" it gets powerful and in the gamemode \"No Experience\", it is almost mandatory just to win the game. Though admittedly, it is a legendary item, so that is fine by me.\n\nRegardless, an old running-gag regarding balance were the Cleavers. The Cleavers are weapons that combo off each other. They used to cost 1 energy to use, but now they cost 2. Anyway, who cares! With the shield spirit, their cost is irrelevant. This brings another problem with the way these items are balanced, they are all tested in a vacuum and then released into the wild when, in fact, these items often synergize with other items for the most optimal and broken outcomes. \nI think for this reason, the Shield Spirit needs a nerf of some sort. My proposal would be to remove the -1 damage to weapons, and change it into a +1 energy cost to shields, similarly to the Barbells. \n\nAnyway, back on topic. There is an item in the game called \"Doru\", this item is a 1 base damage/2 energy cost weapon that gains +16 damage per turn. Would you believe me if I told you that this item used to have, respectively, a 1 energy cost and then a 3 energy cost? Although, that did happen.\nWhen the item was first introduced it had a 1 energy cost and it was overpowered. Once the developer finally realized it, he increased the cost from 1 to 3, but 3 energy was expensive, therefore, nobody ever used that weapon. Finally, it was improved to cost only 2 energy.\nThis weapon's history in the game is the perfect example of \"I do not know what I am doing\", honestly.\n\nA more recent case (as recent as the game being released to the public in Steam Early Access in fact.) regards the cactus item. The cactus received an astronomical buff. It used to be rare and would add +1 spike whenever the player took damage, it is now common and adds +7 spikes whenever the player takes damage. This is plainly absurd, not only this effect can be triggered [b]on purpose[/b] via the Stopwatch and the Tooth Necklace, but even without these two items, by stacking cacti in the player's backpack and then forget to block once to actually take a hit, the player can just watch their foes take their own lives very quickly. \nThis item does not ring me as a common item, it rings me as a [b]Legendary[/b] item. It has yet to be fixed as of the writing of this review. This item actually went through the Doru's arc in reverse: it used to suck, but it was made overwhelmingly powerful. \nThe developer added another item called the \"Crab Cactus\" alongside the beefing up of the regular cactus, and let me tell you, comparatively this item is bad. It activates only when the enemy attacks, not when the player takes damage, plus it provides a worse effect: it adds only +2 spikes. Yet, this one is considered legendary by the game's standards.\n\nI mostly spoke about overpowered items, but the Philosopher's Stone exists. It is a Legendary item that adds +1 energy per adjacent consumable which it then destroys. Most consumables are better off consumed than burned off this way, and there are consumables that not only give the player energy, but also provides them with healing like the Frothy Drink. \nWhy would I use the Philosopher's Stone in conjunction with the Frothy Drink when it is better to just keep the Frothy Drink and use it directly? By the way, the log costs 1 energy to use, so it is not even a good excuse to use the herbs with the Philosopher's Stone, it just sucks.\n\nAnd don't get me started with the Shurikens. Just look at the community tab and check for any post concerning these items to see for yourself. Oh my gosh.\n\nAnd I believe this is tiring for everybody to bring these issues up, it would be better if the items were added and then they were already perfectly balanced as all things should be. \n\nIf items being overpowered and underpowered was the only problem that would be one thing, but recently there have been many people who were upset at the newly added features by the developer. Notably, the forge having a limit and the map being covered and slowly revealing itself as the player progresses through the dungeon. The expression \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" should be taken more seriously here.\n\n\nIn conclusion, my only recommendation for the developer would be to [b]hire a beta tester[/b] before putting the updates live because this would prevent these issues from happening. Technically, anybody who plays the testing branch is a beta tester, but with a massive amount of people, this is difficult to get the proper feedback, and thus, the developer should entrust 1 person and 1 person only to get access to the updates before anyone else, and then get feedback from that person alone.

This is one of the most addicting and challenging roguelikes in the history of the genre. If you're a fan of inventory management especially, you literally cannot find a better game on Steam. Casual players can just play the game on Standard or Classic Mathew and get enough replayability out of the game to justify the pricepoint. For those who like a challenge, this game is infinitely replayable. And that's with only 4 available characters, with many more coming in the future. The developers have a dedicated road map that they have been sticking to since release. The devs are quick to respond, they listen to feedback, and they really care about the community, sometimes to a fault (balancing to make the game less challenging, as opposed to respecting their original vision and sticking with a more challenging approach). This isn't even something that bothers me really, I'm just not a fan of developers being pressured by players to make their games easier, but there is still plenty of challenge for players like me. And if it gets more people playing the game, I'm not going to complain.\n\nPros:\n- Strong Character/Build Variety\n- Endless Replayability\n- Great Music\n- Timeless Art Style\n- Great Community\n\nCons (These are more warnings to new players than actual marks against the game):\n- Some challenge modes are EXTREMELY difficult. Like, dying on the first encounter difficult. It's important to learn and understand the game deeply before tackling some of the later challenges, but they're not all gated so any new player can just click on some of the more difficult runs/characters, get deleted, and then blame the game/devs and post a negative Steam review. So this is more of a warning than an actual knock against the game.\n\n- Lack of Progression. Most roguelikes/roguelites will offer some kind of external progression beyond the core gameplay and since this is early access, at the time of writing this review, there is nothing like this HOWEVER, the devs have an entire update coming within the next few months that will add in these features along with MUCH MORE CONTENT. It bears clarifying that this is one of the most complete feeling Early Access games I've played in years just due to how well designed the core gameplay is and the amount of variety just on launch.\n\nIt's going to be hard to find a better game this year, at least for me. The build/item variety, the addicting gameplay, the inventory management, the art style, music, it's all wonderful. This game has a very timeless quality to it.

There are some ways to create some bonkers synergies and create a godlike character. The gameplay loop is fun and different enough each time to where each run feels pretty novel while also not being too difficult to discern. While some strategies are stronger than others, every single one seems viable once you get the right cadre of items.\n\nThe Meh:\n\n- You basically get locked into a strategy with your fist \"build-around\" pickup. It's not gamebreaking but due to the reliance on synergies, you don't have time to search for other potential items. And if you don't find a build-around item by the first boss? Forget it, you may as well restart.\n\nThe God-Awful:\n\n- The name \"Endless Mode\" is a cruel joke. Enemy damage and HP values shoot up rapidly, faster than you can possibly deal with. The second boss in endless has almost 6,000 HP, summons enemies and enrages. I have yet to find a strategy that can get past it. Very frustrating to see enemy stats spike so aggressively for no reason.\n\n- There are certain encounters early on that are run killers before you even have a chance to get off the ground. Specifically, there is a wizard/warrior combo that heal/armor up every round that you can run into very early on. If you are unlucky to have not found a way to deal 40+ damage a turn by the time you hit this encounter, your run is over.  Very frustrating to have found a really neat item but not have the right synergies set up yet only to die to an enemy that can just outlast you.\n\nIt might sound like a lot of compaining, but I really do love the game.

A backpack is fully open information, and its up to you to decide how to organize it. The map really lent to that appeal, since you could strategically plan your exploration around your items. Things like \"Should I spend a key now to regain some room in my bag when I know it could be used later for a shop?\", \"I should hold on to this legend in case the question mark is a 'rarity trade' event\". or \"I should sell stuff at this shop now, because I know theres a chest coming up and I need room for that\" were strategic decisions that I as a player had to make.\n\nWithout that 'open information', I feel like Im just throwing things around in the dark, and don't have an extra layer of game on top of the combat system. Its just 'kill thing, see what I find, pigeonhole myself into a build, because I don't know if I can be flexible on this floor, die, repeat'. It feels like I have less agency and choice now, and the choices I do make are inherently devalued where they weren't before.\n\nIt might sound overdramatic to say, but this one small change has genuinely ruined the game for me. It completely removed a layer of strategic gameplay that I found engaging on top of the backpack management, and simultaneously devalues the core gameplay loop of managing a backpack's contents through tough decisions. \n\nI've already seen responses that say their next update is a dungeon redesign which will do things like 'add a shop to each floor for reliability', but I hope with all the similar feedback Ive seen they change it back, or even make it an option to toggle.
