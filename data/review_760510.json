Some of the levels are rather tricky at certain times, but it's mostly rather relaxed and easy. The soundtrack is lovely and doesn't get annoying while playing. There is also extra challenge levels called Gem Jam mode and DOGO mode.\n\nGem Jam requires you to collect as many gems as you can before the timer runs out, that mode doesn't have any Dogo guards, so you are just focused on collecting the gems. DOGO mode has extra Dogo guards that you need to avoid, you don't collect any gems in this mode, but you need to find all 4 keys and get out of the level without the Dogo guards noticing you. Both modes add some extra fun to the game, but Gem Jam was a tad bit annoying, as the timer was short and achieving platinum in each level was hard.\n\nFor a free game this is definitely one of the more greater finds that I have found and it's definitely worth your time.

Mostly easy, but does have a bit of challenge to it as well. Can be played with keyboard and mouse, but controller is definitely preferable and easier, as you get full 360 degree movement and control over your speed. (I tried both.)\n\nThe gameplay consists of controlling Kat to sneak past the dog guards and grab four keys and as many gems as possible on the way, then make it to the locked vault, which ends the level. Kat must avoid touching the dog guards or their flashlight beams, and also avoid search lights that move in circular patterns. You also need to position the camera right to be able to see where you're going, and keys and gems to pick up.\n\nThe seven original levels are reworked for two other game modes: \n- In Gem Jam, all the guards and search lights have been removed from the levels, and lots of gems have been placed around the map. You have 1 minute to collect as many gems as possible, earning a higher medal reward the more you're able to collect. This was really fun, but also super easy. I definitely think the Platinum medal could've been at 200 gems instead of 150, because I found that I always had more than enough time to get that many on my first try. On some of the levels I was even able to collect every gem available, and still have time to spare. (Ending the level when there are no more gems left to collect would be nice, because I sometimes had to wait for the level to end.) I also think that these are a bit achievement spammy, basically netting you 4 achievements on each level. But the Gem Jam game mode was fun to play!\n- In Dogo Mode, there are no longer any gems to collect. You only need to get the four keys and reach the vault. However, there are now a whole lot more dog guards around, and some of the paths have been removed. This is definitely a bit of a challenge compared to the normal game mode, but not much more challenging than if you're also going for all the gems in normal mode.\n\nA couple of other things that I feel could be changed:\n- Dog guards have light beams from their flashlights, and this can go through walls. If you're touched by it, you're automatically seen by the dog guard, even if there's a two feet thick steel wall between you. This isn't a big problem, as there are very few places this can happen, but it would be nice if there were none.\n- Search lights can also see you even if you're not actually in the light. This might be that the collision box for Kat is a bit wider than her character model, and sometimes the lights hit it, and you must restart the level. Again, this one's not a big problem either, but as with the previous point it does feel annoying and unfair when it happens.\n- The overlays for Gem Jam and Dogo Mode that appears at the start of the levels for those two game modes stay there too long, and it gets kind of annoying when you just want to retry a level after getting caught. For Gem Jam this is particularly annoying due to the extra \"Ready?\" and \"Go!\" overlays that you also need to wait for, while for Dogo Mode it's extra annoying because you're likely to get caught a few times per level, and will have to wait for the overlay every time.\n\nThe graphics are nice and fitting. Nothing big, but it works. The music feels kind of perfect for the game. Level design is decent. And mentioning them between levels is a nice way of spreading awareness for the various charities.\n\nAll in all, definitely worth playing!\n\n100% in roughly 6 hours. (Most achievements are for just completing levels, some are for exploring the Extras menu, and one is for getting caught the first time. The only, slightly challenging achievements, aside from completing the more challenging levels, are getting all the gems in each of the seven normal missions.)", "timestamp_created": 1655292396, "timestamp_updated": 1655292396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494439214468002319", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114436629": {"recommendationid": "114436629", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086504624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1684030969}, "language": "english", "review": "Captain Toad Treasure Tracker \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u0635\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0628\u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0641\u0643\u0631\u0629  \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0634\u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629", "timestamp_created": 1650860917, "timestamp_updated": 1650860917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113114440": {"recommendationid": "113114440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011289000", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 164, "last_played": 1643538018}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd like to recommend Cat Burglar but a couple of big issues prevent this despite it being free.\n\nVisually the game is appealing, I particularly like the character design of the dogs.

Fortunately the levels are short and quick enough that this doesn't become a major issue. Overall, this is still a game I'd recommend for a short and sweet game to bat around.\n\nFree as you can see.

My only issue is that the mouse controls were needlessly bad - there's no reason they couldn't have made the camera rotate without needing to constantly hold down the mouse button, and an option to snap the camera to 45-degree increments would have been really helpful. A few of the levels contain \"inside\" areas that are difficult to see from the orbital perspective, but usually those areas don't have enemies, so they're not too bad.\n\nOverall, this is a cute, fun little stealth game worth an hour or two of your time, and probably worth throwing a few bucks their way for the work they're doing highlighting animal charities!", "timestamp_created": 1575731818, "timestamp_updated": 1575731818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59067242": {"recommendationid": "59067242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137758961", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1583609082}, "language": "english", "review": "There is a reason behind every good game", "timestamp_created": 1575321497, "timestamp_updated": 1575321497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59013671": {"recommendationid": "59013671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061818185", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 177, "last_played": 1575286474}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this.", "timestamp_created": 1575286285, "timestamp_updated": 1575286285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58794540": {"recommendationid": "58794540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103511847", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1647982412}, "language": "english", "review": "It's cute and simple, but the 3D rotation is difficult to control with a keyboard and mouse (or maybe I'm just bad at it).

While just like in Toads Treasure Tracker you'll need some fancy camera work and angling to navigate your way through the platforming in these levels. Like a true master thief and cat burglar you'll have to think three steps ahead while navigating watching the guards and lights patterns to map out the best routes to go through as well as a safe stopping point to plan again. If you don't think it through and time it right then you'll most likely just keep getting caught.\n\nAs far as controls go you use W A S D to move, and control the camera by holding the left mouse button, unless you use a controller. They recommend a controller, but I think I like it better with keyboard and mouse honestly. That's a personal preference though. The one disappointment I found controls wise is I wish you could jump. I just love having the option even if it serves no game mechanic purpose. It would ruin some of the platforming puzzles if you could jump high making them significantly easier. So maybe if they even put a small jump in so that you wouldn't feel so locked to the ground.\n\nThe level design was very good in my opinion it got steadily harder with the exception of level 6 and 7. So like I've said before you have to move around the camera in all directions if you want to find all the keys and gems. It will also help you scope out all the pathways, hidden routes and guard/light patterns. You can't fall off the building to your death, but you can fall to lower floors granted that it's not too long of a drop. You need to be careful though when it comes to the guards flashlights since the ramps and walls won't stop the flashlight's light. It's hard to explain exactly but the cone of light clips through. If you watch the guards pattern you'll see where the light goes as well and how best to avoid it. As I've mentioned the levels get harder with each additional one, adding more depth, layers, guards and lights. The exception being levels 6 and 7. I say that because level 6 was for me unquestionably the hardest level. I got caught an incredible amount of times. Level 7 looks more intimidating if you compare it by looks alone. However while I was caught countless times on level 6, I was only caught once on level 7. I don't think they should be switched though as level 7 looks like it should be the last level.\n\nI also like the heavy charity approach this game takes. As you may have noticed 20% of this games earnings go to an animal charity, along with all the DLCs just being more direct donations to animal charities. Inside the game you even get an achievement for looking at their Charities page in Extras, as well as them showing you an animal charity they support on each winning screen.\n\nIt is a very short game, but if you like a challenge or just want to get a game that helps a good cause then this is one of those games. It's all about stealth though and requires a lot of patience on certain levels. I would also like to mention that on your library page if it shows the wrong achievements are locked don't worry it did that for me too. You just have to go to hit the stats button.

This is just awesome! It helps that the game by itself is very fun as well. Also, the puns in the title are equal parts cheesy and adorable.\n\nI usually don't expect much game-wise from PSA games, as long as they drive the message home, but this one is surprisingly good. It is straight-forward, simple, plays well, controls well, and has a very fun core mechanic to it. The music is excellent, I love how there are different songs for each level, and the graphics are cute, albeit a tad on the simpler side.\n\nOn the role of a female cat burglar, you must invade multi-layered military bases run by dogs, collect four keys to move on to the next level and, optionally, collect a number of gems that are spread out in every level, all while avoiding being spotted by dogs and cameras. It all works surprisingly well, with solid controls and fair hitboxes (for the most part). As you traverse these fiendish bases, you'll have to move the camera around to see your surroundings and find extra gems and passages to get you out of tight situations, as well as to decide where to drop from ledges to reach collectibles on high places, kinda like, say, that Captain Toad game for the Wii U.\n\nThe game is overall very fun to play, simple to understand, but provides little in the way of challenge for experienced gamers. A game like this can't be hard, so I don't mind that there are no super challenges here. It is also pretty short, but that's okay, since it's free.\n\nOutside of that, the framerate occasionally chugs, which is weird since this game looks so simple, but thankfully it's never low enough to break the game flow. Also, it's kind of frustrating to lose all your progress when you make a small mistake and get spotted :(\n\nWith all that being said, this is, in general, a very nice little game which brings much needed attention to animal shelters and other animal initiatives while also providing entertaining gameplay.

It's free, it has solid controls and graphical quality, it runs quite well and has a tinge of challenge to it (if you go for all of the gems, at least). It has a good artstyle, a cute little narrative and it was made to support animal-based charities, raising awareness of several through the run of the game. There is little that is actually wrong with it and compared to many other free games out there, it does hold a high class.\n\nWith that said, it's not perfect. The game is based around avoiding enemies and getting the different keys/gems by generally going to a higher level and then dropping down onto a box or platform. Problem is, there isn't a solid mechanic for dropping, and there is no jumping, so the whole \"dropping down\" part is a bit awkward. On top of that, a lot of the difficulty comes from pure camera placement, with a lot of the levels being partially or heavily obscured, making it (again), awkward to keep track of everything you need to keep track of.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice little game that is good for an hour of entertainment (in its current state at least).

It is a very soft and laid-back game, as the description implies.\n-Great time killer.

I usually add a little bit of humor to my reviews of games under the impression that noone will see them and if they do, they may get a small giggle out of it, but I'm writing this review in the hopes that it's noticed by the developers, seeing as they're accepting feedback on this game.\n\nCat Burglar is a solid game, which is surprising considering the type of effort that normally goes into games like these. I played a few levels and knew I wasn't going to get anything except more of the same but with a surprisingly tight difficulty curve, which is fine by me, but it's definitely a game that has some potential for it to be a neat little casual stealth game to play on the side.\n\nI'm going to now open up all the problems this game has, and then follow up with everything it does right.\n\nFirstly, there's unity based problems this game comes across. Like being able to walk on ledges that would normally shove you off in any other engine. I blame this mainly on the engine, but this is to a degree something that the developers could easily fix by adding some invisible walls to props near the edge of the level, much like how they did to disallow you from falling off the level entirely. \n\nAnother problem is the camera. The layout of levels has the character constantly moving themselves so that the walls come between the camera and the character. This is mitigated slightly by the character's silhouette appearing over the wall where the character should be, much like Super Mario Sunshine's sewer segments. This would be great if the same effect were given to patrolling enemies as well.\n\nThe patrol themselves are also somewhat unfair. Theoretically, they can see you through walls, as their viewcone is simply that. A cone. It's not quite an advanced sensor. It's also pretty funny to see their viewsight move over a ledge and act as if they're looking at a flat floor. An easy fix is strangely enough readily available to the developers, as they could probably use the same code that comes from the rotating spotlights, which work much like a spotlight should. Whether this may possibly cause balancing issues is yet to be seen.\n\nThe sound design is iffy. The only sounds you get are when you pick up gems or keys, and the music that plays in the background (and getting captured too, I suppose). The music doesn't loop nicely either. I'd like to hear Kat's footsteps while she walks around, and maybe the dog patrols sniffing around while they stand still when Kat gets close to them. Little things like that to fill up the strange silence.\n\nAnother thing that could use some work is the animations. Mainly just... Blinking. Everything else flows nicely but Kat's eyes... They stare into the soul. Maybe have her eyes look around, much like Link from WindWaker would do. The dogs are fine animation wise, as their eyes are covered up, but little details really add up in making a good game, so maybe adding some idle animations to them beyond just looking around. Maybe they're biting on the bone they carry around with them when noone's looking. Again, it's the little things that add up.\n\nThere's also a lack of things to do. The variety of puzzles consists of looking around the map for gems and keys, figuring out that you have to climb to a higher platform and drop down from it to pick up the collectibles, and then move on your merry way, avoiding guards and the likes. While this alone does work well and can be rearranged in a number of ways, it doesn't offer much in terms of engagement with the player.\n\nLastly, the game likes to place an advertisement for the multiple charities they endorse. While it's nice that they made this game for the sake of publicizing these charities, it might be better if they shoved that somewhere near the end, before the credits play, and maybe instead of hiding it away in the extra's menu, they could make it their selection in the main menu to bring it more to the forefront without breaking up gameplay in a somewhat strange way. This critique is almost entirely a personal thing for me though so don't take this as a definitive negative to your game.\n\nLike I said, the game is solid considering it's a charity game. It's got enough in it to keep you entertained if you like playing casual games and the aesthetic is pleasant to look at. It also helps that it's an above average unity game featuring it's own assets. It has a potential to be pretty great, and I hope that the developers take the time to think this game through before releasing it out of early access as is.\n\nOverall I give it my very own personally created award of [b]\"Yep, that's a game alright!\"[/b] and rate it a solid [b]Tactical Catspionage Action/This is my longest review as of the time of writing this[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1528758269, "timestamp_updated": 1528758269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500960826873779297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1528961964, "developer_response": "Thanks for taking the time to write some in depth feedback.

No\nIs it Bad?   No\n\nSummary.\nIt's not a bad game just somewhat forgettable and the design can be a bit tedious. It needs adjustment to feel like an actual game and reduce repetitive action. Incorporate more elements about charity and more things to do. As changes come along and new elements are rolled out I would love to be able to update my review and change my reccomendation.\n\n\nWhat works in Cat Burglar?\n-Charity is a moral candy bar, a charity for cats and dogs is like moral Girl Scout cookies.\n-Showing the player various web sites and charity orignizations for animals is a positive cinsidering I wasn't actually \n  expecting to have it mentioned in the game. \n\nWhat fell flat with Cat Burglar?\n-I missed the tutorial, it didn't stand out enough from the environment. Perhaps adding a glowing silhouette to the instructional boards would draw better player attention.\n-Unbind space bar from the paws menu, there were several instances of accidentally hitting it and one that resulted in lost progress.\n-Having free motion camera controls actually hinders the player experience, too much time is spent fidgeting with the right angle and results in mission failure. Perhaps a system similar to FEZ with fixed camera angle that the player can rotate between would be more appropriate.\n-The game doesnt seem to actually have anything to do with animal charity other than having animals in it and an abrasive series of ads for various charity groups between each level. It would assist the games purpose if the charity information as well as the message of helping animals was more directly related to gameplay. Perhaps find and free various abused animals hidden in each level and have a series of unlockable posters or decorations about charity for a hideout that the player could customize. \n-It's kind of boring. To be honest I gave up on level 5 of 7 because it's lackluster and tedious. More of just about anything would have helped and being that it is early access I hope more jem types and objectives get added along with more levels of varying locations and environments.\n\n-BUGS\n  1.

The game is free and fantastic, so why not go try it out!\n\nThis game says it is in Early Access, but so far the levels feel polished and fun, better than a lot of the cheap shovelware out there.\n\nYou play as Kat, and you need to infiltrate the Dogo base, collecting gems along the way, as well as 4 keys in order to get past each level's main door. Good thing the Dogo Corps leader, Major Bull, decided to leave these gems everywhere so that he can catch you red-handed. Each level you complete shows a pet charity, and tells you how you can help out.\n\nThis is a good platforming game, it is short and sweet. The controls are responsive--only movement and camera controls. The game can be played with keyboard/mouse or controller. You can zoom in and out and move the camera around, which is crucial in some areas to avoid Dogo detection!\n\nThe graphics are good and polished, the small cartoon segments and the design of the levels are pretty nice too. Some really goofy and cute parts too!\n\nThe music is really cheerful and fun, the sound effects are simple and nice.\n\nSeriously though, this is a fun little game that is well designed and feels polished.

It seems to draw on inspirations from games like Fez and of course one of my favorite games of all time, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker! It is fun to mess with the camera to get to a tricky spot for those sweet bonus gems. \n\nWhat makes Cat Burglar cool is that it is a charity game that has a focus on pet charities. Every time you beat a level it gives an advertisement for a pet charity (no spoilers, if you want to find out what the charities there are, you have to play the game!) I honestly wish that there were a lot more charity games out there that people could support. \n\nPros: \n\n-Free/not too long\n\n-Very informational. It is fun to learn about the different charities in between levels\n\n-Controller Support (feels great on my X-box 360 controller!)\n\n-Really good camera\n\n-Great Art Style \n\n- Easy to beat, harder to beat with all the gems.\n\n-Little secrets hidden throughout. (I found something odd hidden in a few places\u2026..crafty)\n\n-Annoyingly catchy music (even the charity ads have a fun jingle) \n\n\nCons: \n\n-Cats are moody and weird. Dogs are better! \n\n-If you don\u2019t like it, you can't get a refund on free, even if you have played less than 2 hours. \n \n", "timestamp_created": 1528215304, "timestamp_updated": 1528215304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500780045986175537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42511991": {"recommendationid": "42511991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196511410", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1622420595}, "language": "english", "review": "Cats rule!
