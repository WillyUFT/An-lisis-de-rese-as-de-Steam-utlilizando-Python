I made assumptions about the game without ever playing or seeing a gameplay video. I don\u2019t know why I did this, there was just something in my head telling me this wasn\u2019t the game for me. Honestly, all puzzle games intimidated me and just weren\u2019t games I was interested in playing. Then, needing a break from Skyrim and RDR2, I added games recommended by friends and various youtubers like Razbuten and Darryl Plays Games. I took the plunge with Figment, The Room, Limbo, Inside, and Hue and for the most part enjoyed my experiences.\n\nNow that my puzzle game anxiety had been put in check it was time to dive into Portal. I appreciate how the game eases you into the various mechanics. I found solving each chamber an absolute joy. The use of portals, cubes, and turrets is such an amazing and inventive gameplay element. I felt such a sense of accomplishment as I passed through each door. That turned to frustration with the last few chambers especially the moving platforms for death water. This feeling quickly turned to exhilaration when I finally made it to GLaDOS. The final battle was fun, and I enjoyed the story as it was revealed through each passing chamber. I found GLaDOS\u2019 dialogue to be amusing and I couldn\u2019t wait to take her down by the end. Navigating through the Aperture Lab and the various testing chambers was so interesting and made me want to learn more about the place and its history.\n\nThe main game is very accessible, while the advanced maps and challenge maps ratchet up the difficulty. I am so glad I gave Portal a chance and can\u2019t wait to start Portal 2 and possibly earn myself some cake!", "timestamp_created": 1700682208, "timestamp_updated": 1700682208, "voted_up": true,

puzzle game. The events of the game take place in the Half-Life universe, in the Aperture Science Portal Nature Research Laboratory. The player takes on the role of a girl named Chell who is being tested inside this Laboratory. Gameplay is based on solving puzzles using a portable portal device. Portal was highly praised by critics and won many awards and was so liked by players.\nAmong the disadvantages of the game, we can note the same levels, which sometimes makes it difficult to find the right path, as well as the weak voice acting of GLaDOS - the main antagonist of the game.\nHowever, I definitely recommend the game, my rating is 8/10.\n\n\u0412\u0456\u0434\u043c\u0456\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0443 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0456 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0438. \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0456\u0457 \u0433\u0440\u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0443 \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0456 Half-Life, \u0432 \u041b\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0456\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0432 \"Aperture Science\". \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0446\u044c \u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0454 \u0443 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0456 \u0434\u0456\u0432\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0456\u043c'\u044f \u0427\u0435\u043b\u043b, \u044f\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0438\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0456 \u0446\u0456\u0454\u0457 \u041b\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457. \u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u0440\u0456\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0456 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043a \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e\u044e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u044e.

maneuvers to finish the puzzles and survive, and don't worry if you get stuck, the Portal forums here on Steam have 100% achievement guides and general playthroughs. the lore is surprisingly deep, with stuff like \"the cake is a lie\" and Black Mesa's involvement being a popular part of it.  it's also fairly short, with my finishing time being 3.5 hours, you could get even shorter if you're not

Before I started playing, I enjoyed some of that Cujo cabbage, if you know what I'm sayin'.\n(You know what I'm sayin', right?)\n\nI have to say, what a delight this experience was! I thoroughly enjoyed the humor, and the pacing. It is a short enough game that even when taking your time, you can easily get through it in 1-2 sittings. With just the main story, I would say that it's worth $10. There are bonus levels, though I'm yet to get into them.\n\nIf you're looking to be mildly insulted while shooting portals to complete puzzles, look no further!", "timestamp_created": 1697868012,

From its innovative gameplay to its darkly humorous narrative, Portal offers an experience that's both intellectually stimulating and highly entertaining.\n\nThe core gameplay mechanic of Portal revolves around the use of a device known as the \"Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\" or simply the \"portal gun.\" With this device, players can create two interconnected portals on walls, floors, and ceilings. This simple yet brilliantly executed concept allows for a wide range of mind-bending puzzles that challenge your spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills. The puzzles become progressively more complex as you advance through the game, which keeps you engaged and motivated to solve each one.\n\nWhat sets Portal apart from other puzzle games is its witty and darkly comedic narrative. You play as Chell, a silent protagonist, who awakens in the Aperture Science research facility and is guided by GLaDOS, a malevolent AI with a penchant for sarcasm. GLaDOS's humorous and increasingly sinister commentary adds a unique layer of personality to the game. Her lines have become iconic, and players will remember them long after finishing the game.\n\nThe pacing of Portal is impeccable. The game is relatively short, but it's tightly packed with memorable moments, challenging puzzles, and unexpected twists. It never outstays its welcome, leaving players craving more rather than feeling fatigued.\n\nThe minimalist visual design of Portal is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The sterile, clinical look of the Aperture Science facility juxtaposes beautifully with the colorful, otherworldly portals themselves. This contrast not only serves the gameplay but also enhances the immersion in the game's unique atmosphere.\n\nPortal's soundtrack is another standout element. The ambient, electronic music perfectly complements the game's atmosphere, providing an eerie and memorable backdrop to your puzzle-solving adventures.\n\nOverall, Portal is a game that has rightly earned its place in the gaming hall of fame. Its innovative gameplay, dark humor, and clever level design make it a must-play for anyone interested in puzzle games or gaming in general. Even years after its release, Portal continues to be a beloved classic, and its influence can be seen in countless other games that followed. If you haven't had the pleasure of experiencing Portal yet, do yourself a favor and dive into this mind-bending and thoroughly enjoyable adventure.\n\nOverall score: 8", "timestamp_created": 1697703578, "timestamp_updated": 1697703578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148474052": {"recommendationid": "148474052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142959071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 674, "last_played": 1697698054}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a perfect game.

Developed by Valve Corporation, this puzzle-platformer stands as a shining gem in the gaming industry, renowned for its innovative gameplay, sharp wit, and immersive storytelling.\n\nAt its core, \"Portal\" is a testament to the power of creativity. The game's central mechanic, the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, offers a refreshingly unique approach to puzzles. Creating interlinked portals on surfaces not only serves as a means of traversal but also opens a Pandora's box of ingenious challenges. The puzzles start deceptively simple, lulling you into a false sense of security before gradually ramping up in complexity. Each solution feels like a triumph, rewarding players with a satisfying sense of accomplishment.\n\nWhat truly sets \"Portal\" apart, however, is its narrative finesse. Through the disembodied voice of GLaDOS, the sinister yet hilariously deadpan artificial intelligence, players are guided through a series of tests that gradually peel back the layers of Aperture Science's mysterious past. The witty and often dark humor adds depth to the story, making every moment engaging and memorable.\n\nVisually, the game's minimalist design is elegant and effective. The sterile, clinical environments of Aperture Science juxtapose the game's complex puzzles, creating an atmosphere that is both eerie and awe-inspiring. The subtle details in the environment, combined with the game's excellent physics engine, enhance the immersion, making the player feel like an integral part of this enigmatic world.\n\nMoreover, \"Portal\" boasts an unforgettable antagonist in GLaDOS. Her sarcastic remarks and unpredictable behavior keep players on their toes, turning what could have been a mere sequence of puzzles into a narrative-driven experience.\n\nIn the realm of video game storytelling, \"Portal\" stands tall as a pioneer of its genre. Its intelligent puzzles, combined with a compelling narrative and sharp humor, create an experience that is as mentally stimulating as it is emotionally resonant. Whether you're a fan of puzzles, a lover of compelling narratives, or just someone seeking an unforgettable gaming experience, \"Portal\" is an absolute must-play that will challenge your mind and leave you craving more.", "timestamp_created": 1697645689, "timestamp_updated": 1697645689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148435869": {"recommendationid": "148435869", "author": {"steamid": "76561199447785310", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 893, "last_played": 1681095504}, "language": "english", "review": "it is just puzzles and puzzles can i have a break?", "timestamp_created": 1697635831, "timestamp_updated": 1697635831, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472102999687194824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148433073": {"recommendationid": "148433073", "author": {"steamid": "76561199018736053", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 393, "last_played": 1697631412}, "language": "english", "review": "poortarts", "timestamp_created": 1697631587, "timestamp_updated": 1697631587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148421266": {"recommendationid": "148421266", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004016512", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1455, "last_played": 1698289361}, "language": "english", "review": "i fucking love portal", "timestamp_created": 1697605320, "timestamp_updated": 1697605320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148419922": {"recommendationid": "148419922", "author": {"steamid": "76561199172971525", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1699759424}, "language": "english", "review": "Funni Puzzle game\n\n(go in to options>keyboard>advanced>enable developer console, then use the command sv_cheats 1, and have fun with dev mode :))", "timestamp_created": 1697602279, "timestamp_updated": 1697602279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148418488": {"recommendationid": "148418488", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983388585", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1012, "last_played": 1697584968}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaxing and chill until you try to get the achievements, FromSoftware hasn't made anything like Portal 1's Challenge chambers.

In a sense, we can probably chalk up a lot of creative modern experiments in gameplay in today's triple A and indie titles alike to the legacy of Portal, which really showed how familiar game genres can be turned into something completely new, as well as introducing the world to new ways of using simulated physics for mind-bending puzzles that are equal parts intuitive and alien.\n\n One thing to realize going into Portal however, this game can be *far* more difficult at times than you might expect. It's gameplay focus on physics puzzles rather than combat may lead some to mistakenly assume that this is a \"casual\" title that's more about idle fun than challenge, but that could not be further from the truth. There will be some points later on where this game will make you never want to see another downward > forward momentum puzzle for as long as you live. The main game is short, but in my opinion the difficulty gets high enough in the back half that I wouldn't expect to breeze through it especially quickly as a first-time player unless maybe simulated wormhole physics just clicks with you unusually well (and even if you do fall into that latter demographic, there are more difficult bonus and challenge maps that you can attempt as well). If you're someone who gets easily frustrated with finicky and time-sensitive puzzles, I'd suggest caution with Portal. Luckily, the quick save system is *extremely* generous, so you can essentially just \"save scum\" your way through the most complicated and unforgiving test chambers if all else fails. In any event, Portal rewards perseverance, and practice will make the surreal physics more familiar with time. \n\n Also, while there isn't really any combat in the traditional sense (without going into spoilers, yes, there *are* enemies, of a sort, but the things you have to do to defeat them aren't exactly what I'd call \"fighting\"), it *is* possible to die at many points, and at some points you will probably end up dying *a lot* before you get things just right (again, due to the generosity with saves, dying isn't particularly punished, though).\n\nFor any Half-Life fans out there; yes, this game does take place in the same universe, although this doesn't really become readily apparent until the very end apart from a couple of small easter eggs that the observant might pick up on. Familiarity with Half-Life is absolutely not essential, though.\n\n In conclusion, this is a game that still holds up very well more than a decade and a half later, and which I'd highly recommend, especially if recent games like Tears of the Kingdom have gotten you interested in physics puzzles. \n\n Oh yeah, and the cake is a lie.", "timestamp_created": 1697498559, "timestamp_updated":

From the first minutes of play, everything is structured to create an exponential learning curve; initially the player will find himself inside a closed cell as Chell, a young girl who has been hired to test some new Aperture Science technology. Apparently, the capsule in which Chell lingers would appear to have no way out, but after a few seconds, thanks to the appearance of a portal, the player will be free to begin testing the various chambers of the Aperture facility. From there on, the player will be faced with several tests, and when he or she has mastered the blue portal, he or she will also unlock the orange one, kicking off the full potential of the game.\n\nA NEW CUBY FRIEND:\nAs can be inferred from the name of the game or the introduction of the review, it is all about using portals, mainly two, one blue and one orange. These portals do not have different characteristics, but are actually unlocked at different times so that the player can figure out how to use one at a time. Several other mechanics are present, which in the same way as the portals are explained right from the start, namely the use of cubes to press buttons; obviously it is very intuitive as a mechanic, but combined with the use of portals to reach tricky buttons makes it more fun and complicated. Other mechanics rely on dodging and destroying deadly turrets, or repelling energy orbs in order to activate passages. Plot-wise, the first chapter does not hold a candle to the second, with a rather simple story with few narrative twists.\n\n\nHEY, THAT\u2019S ME!:\nGraphically Portal awakens perfectly to a game of its era; moreover, due to its simplicity the game becomes almost immortal. Obviously, the aesthetics of the logos and the use of colors in the right situations are excellently done.\n\nHEARING THE RADIO:\nFrom an audio standpoint, there is not much to discuss; the use of sound effects to make clear the use of the various game objects and their interaction with the environment is excellent. \n\nACHIEVEMENTS:\nThe achievements in this title are fairly simple and quick to complete. The Still Alive version of Portal provides several extra levels to tackle and two challenges in the campaign that are rather tough, namely finishing the game without ever being hit by turrets and finishing it by going only through orange portals. The latter is an obvious easter egg to the Valve\u2019s Orange Box collection and provides a more thoughtful approach to the game's puzzles.\n\nBUT WHY 9?\n\nPROS - CONS:\nAll in all, the original Portal does not have much to discuss; all the pros have already been mentioned in the parts above; of negative points, however, I personally struggle to find any, as it really is a near-perfect game. Small appreciable detail in both Portal is the Commentary mode, where the developers explain their approach in the making of this title, useful for young programmers or more commonly for curious players.\n\nRATING\nGameplay: 10\nMusic: 7\nStory: 8\nPuzzles: 10\n_\n", "timestamp_created": 1697029049, "timestamp_updated": 1697029049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

It's a masterpiece that combines ingenious puzzle design with a darkly humorous narrative, resulting in an unforgettable gaming experience that defies conventions and continues to captivate players even years after its release.\n\nUnique Gameplay Concept (5/5):\nPortal introduces players to the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, a tool that allows them to create interdimensional portals. This groundbreaking gameplay mechanic is the core of the game and presents a series of mind-bending puzzles that challenge spatial perception and critical thinking. The sheer brilliance of Portal's puzzle design cannot be overstated.\n\nNarrative Excellence (5/5):\nWhile Portal's gameplay is extraordinary, its narrative is equally exceptional. The darkly comedic AI, GLaDOS, guides players through the game, offering a sharp and witty commentary that adds depth to the experience. The subtle storytelling and unexpected twists keep players engaged from start to finish.\n\nCompact and Cohesive (5/5):\nPortal is a model of efficient game design. It's a relatively short game that manages to deliver a perfectly paced and tightly woven experience. Every puzzle, every line of dialogue, and every moment contributes to the overall narrative and gameplay, making it a satisfying and cohesive journey.\n\nInnovative First-Person Puzzler (5/5):\nPortal was groundbreaking not just for its puzzles but also for its approach to first-person gameplay. It demonstrated that the first-person perspective could be used for more than just shooting, paving the way for a new genre of puzzle-based first-person games.\n\nMinimalist Aesthetic (4/5):\nPortal's minimalist aesthetic suits the game's narrative and atmosphere perfectly. The sterile test chambers and the iconic Portal gun's blue and orange portals create a visual identity that is instantly recognizable and memorable.\n\nEnduring Legacy (5/5):\nPortal's influence on the gaming industry is immeasurable. It has inspired countless puzzle games, first-person experiences, and narratives that value player agency and storytelling. The character of GLaDOS remains an iconic figure in gaming culture.\n\nShort Duration (4/5):\nWhile Portal's brevity contributes to its tight design, some players may wish for a longer experience. However, the concise nature of the game ensures that it can be enjoyed in a single sitting or revisited multiple times.\n\nIn conclusion, Portal is a shining example of innovation, narrative excellence, and exceptional puzzle design. It is a game that stands the test of time and continues to be celebrated as one of the greatest achievements in gaming history. Its unique gameplay, memorable characters, and darkly comedic narrative combine to create an experience that is nothing short of extraordinary. Portal's impact on gaming is immeasurable, and it remains a must-play title for anyone seeking a brilliant and mind-bending gaming adventure, earning a perfect 5/5 rating for its sheer brilliance and enduring legacy.", "timestamp_created": 1696794644, "timestamp_updated": 1696794644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147887786": {"recommendationid": "147887786", "author": {"steamid": "76561199247493209", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 760, "last_played": 1696793198}, "language": "english", "review": "Portals,\n\nI love portals..", "timestamp_created": 1696793499, "timestamp_updated": 1699950627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147887410": {"recommendationid": "147887410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184022739", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 276, "last_played": 1696792959}, "language": "english", "review": "The tutorial was 19 levels.

This game was different. With the coolest game mechanic to mess with, a subtle story that gradually grows to become more climactic, intuitive puzzles of increasing difficulty, and the god-tier humor of GLaDOS, I refused to let myself quit at any puzzle, even level eighteen. It's also no surprise why this game is so good: just look at the history of Valve's game testing on Portal; the game commentaries you can go through after your first walkthrough will show their dedication. Violence wise, this game is minimal when it comes to what you do to your enemies. As for damage done against you, the machine guns shot by the turrets can be quite loud and jarring to some. These bullets will leave marks on the walls and glass. If you get shot, blood splatters will appear behind you on a wall as though you've been shot through, but it will only be like an added texture. You can actually get shot an infinite amount of times; death comes when you have been shot at for a decent amount of time (probably about 3 seconds maybe). No blood sprays are present. If you're fine with occasional blood appearing up on walls (it's more of a splot (no blood dripping down the walls; it's a static texture)) and the loud sound of machine gun fire, get it. Only those two things could make it more mature.

My Skull. My Melon. My Hair Holder. My Brain Carrier. My Face Base. My noodle. I am immediately knocked unconscious, knowing should i consume the organic matter known as \"Taco Bell\", This is my end.\n\nGaining consciousness at least this manys hours later, I open my Environment Viewers, to find myself with jake from state farm empire, in front of a broken down, destroyed, detonated, haunted, ruined, rubble, Arby's. \"So, mysterious man known as 'The goofy goober'\" Jakonian speaks. \"I heard you sued my favorite organic matter consumption location, Taco Bell, out of business\".

I try to escape, but I am restricted by the ropes around the chair. Jake is holding a tray. A red tray, with a little aluminum lump on it. This lump, being the sandwich. My jaw flies open, not by choice, but because of a device on my mouth that forces my mouth open and closed. He unraps it. It's worse than I thought, drenched in their spicy sauce. I can't stop it. he forces it into my mouth, I try to avoid it, I can't. he forces it down my throat, and immediately, my wish for life is gone. It happens. I flood my pants with poopy, blowing holes in my once existent 3 in one diaper, the ones specially made for the current president of the united states, because I bought that position. But Jake's plan works against him, the poopy, while extremely painful, has the power of 3,000,000,000 pressure washers. It easily cuts through the rope, and simply leaves a crater where my chair used to be. I turn around, and detonate jake from state farm with ease, completely erradicating him and his empire off the face of the earth. I start floating, I fly the speed of light. I watch the earth morph into the utopian it decided to become. This is related to portal because i played it the morning these events cascaded, and it why portal is a good game in my objectively correct opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1695876784, "timestamp_updated": 1695876784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147181906": {"recommendationid": "147181906", "author": {"steamid": "76561199454178079", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1696177251}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nballs", "timestamp_created": 1695876370, "timestamp_updated": 1695959233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147179369": {"recommendationid": "147179369", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039465517", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1696179451}, "language": "english", "review": "I finished this game like a bit ago and would recommend to anyone since this can even run on my potato laptop.

To help draw things out a bit, Valve has included six advanced chambers, all of which are existing test chambers tweaked to present a tougher challenge. You can also take on challenge maps and attempt to complete the test chambers with the least number of portals, the least steps, or in the least time. Ever since it was originally released more than six months ago, there has been ample time for the online community to produce a bevy of maps that, though varying in quality, are freely available for any test-chamber-hungry portaler to download. Its Orange Box roots mean that Portal also comes equipped with in-game achievements that can serve to extend its longevity. Nevertheless, the odds are that it'll be over a bit too quickly for your liking.\n\nIf portal technology is the meat of the game, then GLaDOS is the perfectly paired wine. The omnipresent voice that guides you through the test chambers, GLaDOS initially reveals a dry, almost unintentional sense of humor in the first few test chambers. As you progress, her humor begins to show signs of self-awareness, eventually blossoming into something too hilarious and too well-deployed to spoil here. Suffice it to say, it is one of the chief pleasures of Portal and features some of the best writing in video game history.\n\nShort as it may be, Portal is a fantastic game that should be played by anyone interested in unique, well-crafted gameplay and a witty, whip-smart script. The stand-alone retail release comes with the same price point as the downloadable Steam release, which is about the cost of a night out at the movies. Portal may not last much longer than some feature films, but pound for pound it remains one of the best games on store shelves.

ingeniosos y un car\u00e1cter \u00fanico para crear una experiencia verdaderamente memorable en el mundo de los videojuegos.\n\nLa premisa de Portal es simple pero intrigante: te despiertas en un laboratorio de pruebas aparentemente abandonado y te encuentras equipado con un dispositivo de portal que puede crear portales en superficies espec\u00edficas. Esta herramienta te permite resolver una serie de rompecabezas ingeniosos y desafiantes mientras exploras el enigm\u00e1tico Aperture Science Enrichment Center.\n\nUna de las fortalezas m\u00e1s notables de Portal es su narrativa y su personaje principal, GLaDOS. A medida que avanzas en el juego, GLaDOS te gu\u00eda (o enga\u00f1a) con un sentido del humor sutil y retorcido que se ha convertido en un elemento ic\u00f3nico de la serie. La forma en que la historia se desarrolla gradualmente y c\u00f3mo aprendes m\u00e1s sobre el mundo del juego a trav\u00e9s de las interacciones con GLaDOS es brillante y cautivante.\n\nLos rompecabezas de Portal son ingeniosos y desafiantes sin ser frustrantes. El juego te lleva gradualmente a trav\u00e9s de conceptos y mec\u00e1nicas cada vez m\u00e1s complejos, lo que te permite aprender y dominar las habilidades del dispositivo de portal de manera org\u00e1nica. Cada rompecabezas se siente como un logro cuando lo resuelves, y la sensaci\u00f3n de logro es recompensada con la satisfacci\u00f3n de avanzar en la narrativa.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o visual minimalista de Portal es efectivo y memorable. Los entornos est\u00e9riles y las pruebas de laboratorio contrastan con la personalidad brillante y oscura de GLaDOS, creando un ambiente que se siente \u00fanico en el mundo de los videojuegos.\n\nLa m\u00fasica en Portal, incluida la ic\u00f3nica canci\u00f3n \"Still Alive\", a\u00f1ade otra capa de car\u00e1cter y profundidad al juego. La canci\u00f3n, interpretada por GLaDOS, se ha convertido en un himno para los fan\u00e1ticos del juego.\n\nCOMPRALOOOOO", "timestamp_created": 1695431022, "timestamp_updated": 1695431022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146821472": {"recommendationid": "146821472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198414935729", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1761, "last_played": 1698454109}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game came for the science and got to do science", "timestamp_created": 1695430101, "timestamp_updated": 1695430101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146820797": {"recommendationid": "146820797", "author": {"steamid": "76561199147411534", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 190, "last_played": 1695429136}, "language": "spanish", "review": "bien pro", "timestamp_created": 1695429196, "timestamp_updated": 1695429196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146818500": {"recommendationid": "146818500", "author": {"steamid": "76561199043544749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1208, "last_played": 1695770637}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegazo\n", "timestamp_created": 1695426398, "timestamp_updated": 1695426398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146817556": {"recommendationid": "146817556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312679483", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1590453521}, "language": "english", "review": "Es entretenido y la mec\u00e1nica de los rompecabezas sigue siendo original.

"review": "portal is a pretty good game which introduced some very interesting mechanics. the main campaign is a nice bite size experience though the puzzles were nothing to complex. i am a little less enthusiastic on the bonus maps for they were all reused campaign maps and no unique maps, the advanced maps were fun little challenges that made the existing maps harder to achieve which i really liked. now the challenge maps is where the mechanics of the game fail for me, there is no addition to the  structure of the map only limitations on what you can do. the least portals is  the only fun limitation because it causes you to think of the map in a new way. the speed-run category makes you use controls that were not developed for speed-running and is very frustrating clears. the least steps category fundamentally do not work as sometimes the player steps twice instead of once causing a lot of frustration. \n\ni know most of this review seems like i don't like the game but i do the game is only being held back by the fact that it was made in 2007, overall a fairly good game and i am looking forward to how portal 2 will improve the strong foundation. 6.8/10", "timestamp_created":

I am very new to REAL PC gaming, (lived off of everything Nintendo since 2010, on my school computers I've played flash games) and wanted to play a classic that I remember seeing years ago. I am so glad I did. I never used to think of myself as a puzzle game enjoyer as I have a short fuse and tend to rage quit. However, there is something so fun yet calming in the game play that allowed me to pause at moments within the game and figure everything out myself. This is actually the first puzzle game I've completed entirely by myself, ever. I feel like in this game you can really focus on the puzzles as well, coming from Nintendo games such as the Legend of Zelda, with temples and stuff, I often just looked up all the answers because I just wanted to get back to destroying pots and whatever. This game is great at doing what it's meant to, and MORE! Such as...\nthe little bits of story. Truly, it's smaller details but it did a good job at freaking me out at 2am while I was playing it.

en primera persona y que se caracteriza por ser original, tener unas mec\u00e1nicas muy s\u00f3lidas y una curva de dificultad muy buena, ya que progresivamente los puzzles se ir\u00e1n volviendo m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles y te exigir\u00e1n que recuerdes lo que el juego te ha ido ense\u00f1ando hasta ese momento.\n\nLo que hace especial a Portal es que no solo tiene un gameplay muy bueno, sino que, adem\u00e1s, a la que llegas a la mitad del juego te vas dando cuenta de que tiene una historia de trasfondo llena de misterios que te atrapa y te mantiene intrigado hasta que llegas al final.\n\nLa \u00fanica pega que le veo a Portal es que es muy corto y ofrece poco contenido extra que te incite a rejugarlo, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed me parece un juego excelente y que, adem\u00e1s, si esperas a comprarlo de oferta te sale por menos de 1\u20ac, as\u00ed que al final la duraci\u00f3n del juego acaba compensando bastante.\n\n\u00a1Le doy un 9/10!", "timestamp_created": 1695034618,
