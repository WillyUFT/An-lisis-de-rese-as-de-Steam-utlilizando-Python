Psychonauts is possibly the greatest creation of Tim Schafer, the madman behind hits such as Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fandango and The Secret of Monkey Island. He is one of the few writers in the entire industry capable of not only funny dialogue, but writing that stands the test of time, and there is perhaps no greater example of that than this title.\n\nPsychonauts dives into topics such as psychological health, mental illness, conspiracies and psyops with such a candid and meticulous approach, you'd have no idea this game came out in 2005 from the script alone. The level designs are memorable set pieces dripping in personality and charm, and the bar of quality is so high, you'd think this game was released during the golden era of platforming. It's a title that effortlessly brings to life its themes and concepts into an interactive medium, as if a higher power were given a paintbrush, an easel, and a MacBook Pro 16.\n\nDue to the nature of the genre and its time of release, Psychonauts has an occasionally uncooperative camera, and there's a few minor bugs that may impede gameplay. Collectibles are also difficult to spot in brightly colored levels. Most of these issues are fixable by turning on VSync, playing in Windowed mode or tuning brightness levels.

I've been meaning to write something after finishing the game two years ago [/i]\n\n[h2] Prologue [/h2]\nBefore I begin, I would like to thank [b] James Willems [/b] for introducing me to this wonderful video-game. Thoroughly, I have enjoyed the gaming/entertainment videos that [b] Funhaus [/b] have created during their 2014-2021 era (and Machinima days) and have always had my 15y/o self echoing gut-wrenching laughs in times of comfort and from there, one of their members established an out-of-time bit that I was too young or too unfamiliar to recognise; a game called Psychonauts. This was wayyy before the sequel was announced and much like most of their fanbase, the jokes James would reference about Psychonauts would go over all our heads. \n\nI didn't think much of it until VGAs rolled around and I saw the twitter pic of Mr Willems' face most astonished and shocked face as he reacted to the news of the upcoming sequel. Then what followed were his replays on his personal channel with his wife and his audition to become its voice actors as a talking toilet. And from there my confusion turned into intrigue. Then just months before the sequel releases, I gave it a shot and bought it discounted.\n\nNow 20 y/o at the time, my first impression of Psychonauts before playing was...ugly. Like I thought the artstyle was ugly, the characters = ugly, the colours = garishly ugly. Back then my close-minded ass wondered [i]\"why would anyone willingly play a game so visually disturbing and gross looking  [/i]. But I eventually forgave its aesthetic simply of it being an early 2000's console game. I've heard so many great and insightful things about this game from Mr Willems that I marched forward expecting his proclamations to be true, pushing myself to start this journey and entered Summer camp with an open mind (see what i did there).\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\n\nThis is fairly non-spoiler. So as much as I would listen how much James Willems fawn over how much he love this game, I had zero idea or preconception of what this was about. Maybe I was subconsciously blocking out story details so I would play this game purely blind. I went into this game thinking I'm gonna have to constantly put up with its art-style and yucky mucky characters, that I'm gonna have to have this acidic feeling in my gut everytime I attempt to interact with the other characters...\n\n...and then they spoke.\n\nAll this time, I had it so wrong. Why did I expect a game as visually unique function similarly to other indie games I've played. So I switched out my 'hardcore gaming brain' to my 'film major super analysis brain' and approached Psychonauts from an entirely new perspective. This game doesn't look gross... it's charming, and its fun, funny, funny-looking and doesn't take itself too seriously. The first cut-scene of Raz sneaking into Whispering Rock Summer Camp, catapulted my brain to remember all the times my kid self watched TV at home on a school day. 'Psychonauts' reminds me of those late 90's / early 2000's western serialised TV shows: Hey Arnold, Billy & Mandy, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, My Gym Partner's a Monkey, etc. I loooved watching these shows as a kid everytime they come on the American channel (I'm from Australia so there's like idk 2-3 American channels on cable at the time) and if I owned an original XBOX, I would've been all over Psychonauts, simply of how familiar its presence is and how similar the comedy is to other shows in the same era.\n\nThen when the cutscene explains how this world consists of Psychics and Superpowers, has the child-like perception of what International Spy work is like (like Spy Kids and Spies Next Door), and there's a secret organisation teaching kids how to use their powers like X-Men and protecting themselves from other psychic animals which reminded me Gravity Falls, I was like \"FUCK yeAH, I'm so on board with this concept, gimme more of thatl!\"\n\nAnd by the time the first mission came up, to infiltrate Coach Oleander's mind and battle his psyche and mental immune system in the form of little personified goblin guys, my jaw was floored and my mind (in-game and irl) was blown with how this game came up with the idea of Inception, years before Inception. And once my realisation set in, my eyes were GLUED to the screen for hours because of how invested I was to continue such a creative and freshly unique gaming and narrative experience (and this was only the first 10 minutes, wtfff what a way to lure me in, Double Fine).\n\nAlright now to dive deeper into more spoiler-esque territory :)\n\n[spoiler] \nI was enthralled with the idea of incepting into someone's mind and in the words of Agent Nein, [I] not fix their problems but help fight their inner demons [/i], opened up a lot of ways I perceived mental health and helped me understand that not all ways of thinking are black and white.\nAlso what better way to expand on the Inception concept than to have the subsequent missions take place in the minds of mental asylum patients, each so varying in personality, energy and uniqueness. My all-time favourite levels are Black Velvetopia, Waterloo World and the community standout, The Milkman Conspiracy.\n\nStory-wise, the game did a great job executing a children's show-like mystery plot, interweaving elements of spies and superpowers to supplement a really well-written narrative. I love so many of the characters in this game, Dogen being one of my favourites as the air-headed animal abuser and each one so distinct; the wacky art-style grew on me and I found a newfound appreciation for it. I also appreciate the game for owning this whimsical art-style in the first place, which is essential in translating some of its internal mature themes of trauma, authoritative parental figures and self-image towards children, so that they understand it in a fun and interactive experience.\n\nCalling back on Agent Nein's quote, there is no definitive bad-guy or overall antagonist, as much as the game would have me believe Dr Loboto was the main villain nor Coach Oleander; were effective villains to Razputin, I was glad that the final showdown consisted of Raz's confronting his inner demons, or his negative interpretation of his overly disapproving Father with unrealistic life expectations.\n(Also I find it funny how when you want to run away from home, you join the circus and Raz ran from the circus to join the Psychonauts, thats a good one). \n\nPrior to all events, Razputin's fear of his perception of his father coincides with the common assumption most children have with overly invasive parents with high expectations of them. Not all people are cut & dry so I was overjoyed to discover his father was also a psychic and only wanted what was best for Raz, even open minded to learning his newfound powers as a way to bond father-to-son.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[h3] Gameplay [/h3]\nAs janky as console-ports go, this was surprisingly intuitive and became easy to get the hang of. The platforming reminds me of Ratchet & Clank which I enjoyed very much. Every Puzzle took me a while but super rewarding to complete.\nCombat-wise: introduction of multiple psychic abilities allowed for multiple play-styles during battle engagements.

As someone who has only played 3D platformers from Nintendo, this game was a massive breath of fresh air. Yes, the platforming, humor, art style, and characters are one of a kind, but I loved how every person's backstory was told through their own unique settings. Every person's psyche had something vastly different to do, from rampaging through a fish-inhabited city to uncovering a conspiracy about a milkman in an impossibly structured neighborhood. For such a small game, it is jam-packed with ideas and every person and place has something unique to say. What I like most is how a person\u2019s back story is presented, my favorite being in Milla Vodello\u2019s psyche. You come across a slideshow of Milla taking care of an orphanage until it burns down as she is out shopping, leaving her haunted by the souls of the children she failed. That\u2019s just the slideshow. Right next to it is a portal leading to a flaming jail cell where the dead children\u2019s whispers take over all the sounds in the area. You don\u2019t even have the option to help Milla get past this. It\u2019s just something she keeps bottled up in an otherwise upbeat setting. I also really like that Raz is presented as the most reasonable person in the game, making everyone around him seem crazier than he is, but he\u2019s revealed to have delusions that he can\u2019t conquer on his own. It\u2019s a great twist that puts our entire perspective into question. While I highly recommend this game, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s perfect. Most of its problems stem from its age. By the end of the game, the platforming can get janky, and checkpoint placements make this even more frustrating. The combat is good, but the lack of enemy variety makes it a bit tedious at times. The bosses, while really creative, also have some jank to them. The worst enemy in the game is the camera, which I found myself fighting quite a bit. Finally, it rubs me the wrong way that we cannot enter camp after the last few hours of the game, making much of what\u2019s collected in those final hours virtually useless. All of these issues are pretty minor but they definitely show the game\u2019s age. Overall, Psychonauts is one of the weirdest, funniest, and most creative games I have ever played. It\u2019s shocking it took this long for a sequel to be made but I can see why this excited so many people last year. Now I am really looking forward to playing Psychonauts 2 and I\u2019m curious about how the sequel evolved from its predecessor after 16 years.", "timestamp_created": 1696403668, "timestamp_updated": 1696446394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147545587": {"recommendationid": "147545587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040985232", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2546, "last_played": 1696311054}, "language": "english", "review": "cute little game, keyboard/mouse controls SUCK!!!! use a controller.\nmilk", "timestamp_created": 1696311108, "timestamp_updated": 1696311108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586746156215667725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147514391": {"recommendationid": "147514391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194456742", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 451, "last_played": 1698599377}, "language": "english", "review": "love this game already,would recommend for the unique ideas", "timestamp_created": 1696265827, "timestamp_updated": 1696265827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519034862518310547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147408638": {"recommendationid": "147408638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198849535103", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 340, "last_played": 1697133523}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego, divertido", "timestamp_created": 1696136670, "timestamp_updated": 1696136670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147391780": {"recommendationid": "147391780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202046408", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 329, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1591994668}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Narrativa Innovadora: La historia sigue a Raz, un joven aspirante a psiconauta, mientras explora las mentes de varios personajes coloridos.

There is a ton of exploring the main hub of the campground and the levels themselves contain a lot of platforming sections that can be tedious at times but overall presents a great challenge.\n\nIn this play-through I used the steam deck controls which were very difficult to map as the controller had a spinning camera issue that took a while to fix. Once fixed the controls were great. Halfway through I switched to Mouse and keyboard and found that controlling the character this way took some getting used to. It allowed for an easier experience remapping the various psycho abilities on the fly.\n\n[h3]Graphics and Visuals[/h3]\n\nGraphics are an older OG XBOX era cartoon polish. The steam version is very sharp and feels and looks amazing. The cutscenes are not optimized however and the age of the game shows during these times.\nI enjoyed the creative levels and the mix of bright and colorful with dark and gloomy and even cozy campground vibes.\n\nNo technical issues experienced in my time playing.\n\n[h3]Storyline and Narrative[/h3]\n\nThe story is where the game shines.

I understand that there are workarounds for this issue- including some hack-y methods recommended by the developers themself- and that Linux support isn't the highest priority, but it sounds like it's an issue for Windows users too.

Yet, the platforming is awful.\n\n\n[h1]THE BAD[/h1]\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind are the damn poles. Razputin (the character you control) always gets stuck in the air when you try to climb a pole. Only after a few attempts he finally decides it's a good idea to go up instead of down.\n\nIn the first level, [spoiler]Coach Oleander's mind[/spoiler], there are 2 occasions where you can find a flag tied on a pole that needs to be risen. Unless you enable [spoiler]V-Sync[/spoiler] (which slows down the game overall) you cannot proceed. I was stuck for a good while because of an optional setting?\n\nAnd also, the [spoiler]Levitation Ball[/spoiler] randomly disabling itself while I am [spoiler]rolling[/spoiler] was extremely annoying.\n\nYou can't focus on an enemy while you are on your [spoiler]Levitation Ball[/spoiler]? Why?\n\nThe trampolines taking 1-2 jumps before letting Razputin jump higher was an absolute nerve, especially in the moments where [spoiler]you needed to use them repeatedly in order to collect a specific figment[/spoiler]. (Looking at you [spoiler]stupid Bird figment[/spoiler])\n\nThere's also the Camera automatically adjusting itself when you move. And the setting to disable this doesn't even work. Looking for some Figment that might be placed above? Too bad. I want to show you the pavement instead. (Looking at you [spoiler]Black Velvetopia[/spoiler])\n\nStill in [spoiler]Black Velvetopia[/spoiler], you can [spoiler]start that one fight WITHOUT owning the required PSI Power[/spoiler]! And when are you telling me that?\n\nMy biggest annoyance were the [spoiler]Censors[/spoiler] spawning every second, especially in [spoiler]Black Velvetopia[/spoiler]. You leave an alley, enter, and there they are again charging at you when they know that you always blast them anyways why do they even bother attacking you. Trying to figure out where the last figment was with them always popping up got quite boring after a while.\n\nI also really disliked the sliding mechanic in the game. It is not specific for certain terrains, no. They just decided [spoiler]a terrain inclined by a certain degree will make you slide down[/spoiler] and called it a day. This one really made me angry at times. Especially around [spoiler]Sasha's Lab[/spoiler]. There's a certain area where you can't [spoiler]walk normally and the game forces you to slide down[/spoiler]. Annoying.\n\nThe game is also NOT playable with keyboard and mouse. Sensitivity set to max and moving the camera is still slow. I was able to play only with my controller, which is a shame.\n\nThe message warning you about the Point of no Return showing for 1 millisecond is a really bad take. The first time I had played this game (not counted in the hours) was I ever so annoyed. I had not yet collected every collectible and I dreaded playing the game from start. But guess what? The warning that showed for a millisecond actually reads [spoiler]\"Automatically saving for Point of no Return\" or something along these lines.[/spoiler]\n \n[spoiler]There was an AutoSave placed before the cutscene[/spoiler]! And I found out about this 1 year later during this replay. Let me let you in on a little secret, [spoiler]show this warning BEFORE having us doing that specific action? And long enough for us to read it[/spoiler]? You will have a bad time playing this game for the first time ever. You have been warned.\n\nAnd because I like you so much, I'll spoiler all the annoying things so you are able to experience them yourself.\n\n[h1]Now the good things...[/h1]\n\nOnce the game grabs you, despite all its flaws, it's hard to abandon it. Surely if you only play it for the sake of completing every game you won't last long.\n\nThe camp is filled with various kind of characters, I liked how they interact with each other thorough the game. (Spoiler for achievements: [spoiler]and you can easily miss many achievements if you do not revisit previously explored areas after completing each level, specifically after finishing Sasha's and Milla's[/spoiler])\n\nCollecting all the figments was PAIN; in every single level I always ended up missing only ONE figment, what a luck. I didn't use a guide, and when I got bored I just closed the game.

Here's why.\n\nSo I got this game mostly to play on my Steam Deck. Big mistake. The game has cloud saves, which is rare in games of this era, but the cloud saves don't work between Windows and Linux, so I was forced to use the Windows version of the game on my deck. So much for having a native Linux build when a core feature doesn't work on it. But that's just where the issues start.\n\nFor some reason, when using controller on my Deck with the Windows build, the control bindings completely fudged themselves. It showed keyboard icons on the menus, and ONLY accepted keyboard inputs. Even just to start the game required me to open the virtual keyboard. And even on my Windows PC, where this didn't happen, the options menu has NO CONTROLLER SUPPORT, and as far as I can tell that's not a bug. That's how the menus were designed. Wasn't this game on PS2? How could you NOT have full controller support?? That is impressively bad, even for the game's age. \n\nNot to mention, in basically any area that isn't the main gameplay, the mouse cursor is on screen. Even when using controller. It's not major but holy hell does it get annoying.\n\nIn general, I just can't recommend the game with all these issues. Sure, you CAN use keyboard and mouse, but it's VERY obvious the game wasn't designed with it in mind. Not to mention, that's not much an option on Steam Deck. I just wonder how the hell the game GOT so bad. Age isn't even an excuse; many games of the era have been updated with simple quality of life features and, hell, THIS game still gets maintenance updates. Could they not be bothered to just modify the game a bit to un-screw the controller input and fix cloud saves (which doesn't even require going into the game's code)? \n\nIf this game got a facelift update to make it work in the modern day or, better yet, a remaster, I'd love to try the game out. It really didn't get a fair chance with this awful port. I'd be willing to give it leeway with its age, but seeing as it's being sold on a modern storefront for modern devices and there's no reason the game can't get quality of life updates, especially with renewed interest in the series, I think it's deserving of the not recommended review.

When I bought the game, I felt like I was just fulfilling a responsibility as I had heard it was a cult classic. It took me a long time to even start it up, since I figured it would have aged a ton. After only a short time with it, the experience still felt remarkably fresh. By the time it was over, I realized it had a lot of timeless aspects, but fills a great role even in the niche aspects of early platformers. \n\nThe main appeal is that the game has so much personality, from its art to its jokes. As soon as I heard the protagonist, Raz, speak his first line, I knew I was in for a good time since I used to love Invader Zim and they both have the talent of Richard Horvitz. Most of the experience felt like I was playing through an old saturday morning cartoon, with all the adventure a kid would enjoy, but filled up with dozens of jokes an adult could sink their teeth into. Very few games are actually funny, especially as they get older, but this one seemed to work. I think it helped that it wasn't too long, and had a totally unique premise that was still easy to pick up fast. \n\nAs a platforming game, I first thought it reminded me of stuff like Tak and the Power of Juju, likely because of its art and graphics; but then I felt like it was more similar to Glover on N64 with its numerous linear worlds. Eventually, it just had its own kind of level structure I couldn't make good comparisons with, it was original and fulfilling. Every new stage felt like a whole new take on the game, with very few frustrating segments. Despite the large amount of potential powers for the protagonist, they also made great use out of all of them. The only complaint I had is that the game is so linear and has so many unlockables that it felt like the most extended tutorial of all time. I don't think I stopped learning new things until I was 80% through. In some ways, it's also a collectathon; but I didn't dedicate much time to solving this puzzle, as I'm at an age where I don't find that 100% system all that fulfilling. I also think it's a little weaker than games like Banjo-Kazooie, since the collectables aren't very eye-catching. It didn't feel like 100 coins in Mario or all the bananas in DK64. It just felt like unfortunate filler to give more replayability to what is admittedly a pretty small game.\n\nI'm not so sure if I'm quite ready for the sequel, but I still can see why this first game holds up as a major classic. There's so much to love even if you don't have any childhood nostalgia.

This game goes deep on its characters, with ten (or so) Mental Worlds packed to the brim with details that tell you about who they are, how they think, and what dark stories might exist in their memories.\nAnd yet, it's not boring to play at all! It's actually got some awesome momentum mechanics under the hood that Sonic fans might find are pretty fun to play with. Look up a speedrun, it's incredible! \nPsychonauts is an absolute gem, and my best way to summarize it is:  It's an action-packed 3D platformer, made by point-and-click devs. The writing is amazing, and the gameplay mechanics are super fun to play around with.

It didn't seem like that interesting of a game, it looked predictable and the style wasn't very appealing...\nBut then I played it... and I realised I'm a fucking dumbass. This is the best game I've played all year.\n\nNever judge a book unless you've held it, read it, or have an ounce of understanding about it, that's what I learned from this game. \n\nIt immediately introduces you to the world, shows you all the characters and powers at play, and during the course of the game it goes into greater depth while being entertaining and giving plenty of time for characters and events to explain themselves. \nThe story itself is very cartoonish while having surreal moments and keeping a serious and almost horrific undertone. To be more simple, it has funny moments but serious (almost disturbing) moments melded together perfectly. \n\nAnd the pacing of the game is good. Each stage of the game gives you plenty of time to explore the map, before it gets boring, changing things up every time you complete a task, keeping you curious about what has changed and not disappointing you. If you see something that doesn't make sense, you probably missed it, now restart the game to see what happened. (JK, the game gives you plenty of save spots so you can always go back before you did something to either complete achievements or look around some more for interesting things)\n\nVoice acting is just... PERFECT! I'm too lazy to say anything else.\n\nPowers and abilities are fun and can be cycled through fairly easily. And not a single one is underutilised for the entirety of the game... I think.\n\nThe story itself is pretty good. Its aware all throughout, never forgetting anything that has happened. Also making use of every event that transpired before the previous.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game for nostalgia and a one of a kind experience. \n\nI love it.

more refined game and was more fun to 100% than this.\n\n[h1]Graphics & Audio[/h1]\nYou're going to hear some audio popping, but nothing that will prevent you from playing.\nThe Doublefine intro is very loud regardless of how low you set the audio, I recommend taking your headphones off before booting up the game.\n\nGraphics aren't too bad, only the cutscenes are noticeably low resolution because they're pre-rendered videos instead of real time.", "timestamp_created": 1692083649, "timestamp_updated": 1692083649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

It is a bit clunky and platforming itself can be a bit annoying. Luckily the game gives you a double jump and slow falling option which makes the controls a bit more forgivable. By itself it is really not a hard game. Platofrming rarely presents a challenge, which in my opinion is good, since thee game is all about walking you through a story while enabling you to explore and collect some fun stuff.\n\nA story focused platformer without the best platforming is not something that would usually get a pass, since the game needs to do something extraordinarily to compensate for the mediocre core mechanics. But Psychonauts manages to do something extraordinary. And I really didn't expect that.\n\nWhat makes Psychonauts that great is art direction, character design, great voice acting and brilliant idea that is quite well executed. For the most part it felt like i was watching an intractable cartoon from the old Cartoon Network. Which felt amazing.\n\nEvery level is a new adventure with completely different vibe. And I got surprised and intrigued the more I played. Character design is also amazing. I don't remember seeing so much variety and personality in main and side characters in a videogame.\n\nEven If I didn't like playing some of the levels, I can't praise enough how well the authors managed to convert mental problems into a visual and interactive experience. It is very hard to draw abstract concepts like love, paranoia, anger and fear. But Psychonauts manages to create entire mental worlds with graet visual hints and allegories.\n\nMy favorite levels are Milkman Conspiracy, Black Velvetopia and Waterloo World The levels that I didn't like that much were Lungfishopolis, Brain Tumbler Experiment, Gloria\u2019s Theater and Meat Circus\n\nThe game, of course, had to simplify some of the mental problem concepts in order to make the experience understandable and digestible. I personally don't have a problem with that. But it would definitely be cool to see these mental worlds paint more multidimensional perspective on given troubles or circumstances that led character into such mental state.\n\nWith that said I recommend playing Psychonauts. Although the 3D platforming standards from 2005 should be noted. But if you can get past the clunky controls, a great adventure awaits you.", "timestamp_created": 1690059504, "timestamp_updated": 1690059504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56204378604888916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142587416": {"recommendationid": "142587416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009899388", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 1032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1032, "last_played": 1683456823}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great platformer and the levels are varied and quirky.

I played through the entire thing with unmodified visuals, but I'd highly suggest going over to nexusmods and seeing what's available in terms of 4K textures and cutscene upscaling. Although the gameplay visuals clean up a bit when you raise the resolution, the cutscenes look super muddy and blurry\n- The game's visual style is still pretty great, though. Very cartoonish. The character designs are very Tim Burton-esque\n- The game's music is pretty good. It's about what you'd expect from a mid-00's platformer. Jaunty, cartoonish tunes abound\n- The vocal performances are pretty good. I recognized some of the voices from other properties. Some characters do, unfortunately, sound pretty annoying (kids crying in games will always be grating to the ears)\n\n[b]Story & Vibes[/b]\n- This is where Psychonauts really excels. The story is excellent. In addition to the plot being engaging, the emotional and developmental narratives really do carry this coming-of-age tale along nicely\n- The plot follows the story of a young boy named Razputin, who sneaks his way into a Psychonauts training summer camp in hopes of pursuing his chosen career. Unfortunately, your father, a circus performer who wants Raz to become an acrobat, catches wind and is on his way to pick you up from the camp. You're going to have to work fast to collect your Psychonaut skills before he shows up, especially when kids around the camp begin to mysteriously lose their brains\n- The emotional content of the game does a nice job of highlighting the natural friction between aspiration and expectation; it asks some important questions. Should we choose to pursue or dreams, or take the most obvious path forward? Are we fair to those who stand in the way of our goals, or can we step outside ourselves to see the concern and love that can sometimes place obstacles in our path?\n- In all, it's a more contemplative and interesting approach to the 3D platformer than you'll see from other similar games of the era\n\n[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]\n- In addition to the game's summer camp overworld, you'll go from level to level by jumping into the minds of different characters. All of the levels have excellent and interesting design, making good use of vertical and horizontal space. It's nice that the path forward is almost always clear despite how densely packed most of the levels are\n- As you may expect from a 3D platformer, you're going to do a lot of jumping around, exploring stages, picking up collectibles, fighting enemies, defeating bosses, and unlocking new abilities\n- The platforming mechanics are fairly average; they don't feel overly snappy or sluggish. Like in many 3D platformers, the camera is a constant source of frustration. I've seen worse, but it's still annoying to make certain jumps when the camera is hiding Raz behind level architecture, forcing you to make jumps with weird camera perspectives\n- The powers are pretty closely woven into the level design. I appreciate that the game is up-front about which powers and abilities you'll need for certain levels. Does completing a level require the Telekinesis ability? Well, the game will let you enter that level if you want, but it'll tell you that you won't be able to complete it\n- Rather than powers being unlocked by beating bosses, you'll get them as you level up Raz throughout the game\n- I'm not sure if I'll be replaying Psychonauts anytime soon, but it would be nice to come back and do some achievement cleanup down the road\n\n[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]\n- I missed this one back when it was released. Halo 2 had just been come out and that's basically all I played at the time. It was nice to go back and finally experience what is widely considered a cult classic. I can see the appeal; there's more to Psychonauts than there is to most platformers\n- Being an old game, you won't have much trouble getting this to run on most hardware. I have a fairly midrange setup, and it didn't break a sweat running this game\n\n[b]Final Verdict[/b]\n[b]8.5/10[/b]. It's been a well-regarded game for a long time for a reason. The narrative and gameplay still hold up in spite of the dated visuals (again, consider doing a little modding to fix that issue). If you're in the mood for a platformer, it's well worth considering this popular title\n", "timestamp_created": 1687193225, "timestamp_updated": 1687193225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140340631": {"recommendationid": "140340631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085399703", "num_games_owned": 1908, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1688732451}, "language": "english", "review": "Just started it and seems brilliant, but might quit because 100% completing the punchy target mini-game on KBM made me want to exit this life", "timestamp_created": 1687191372, "timestamp_updated": 1693072279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140330003": {"recommendationid": "140330003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198822724319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1696, "last_played": 1687255090}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] One of the best 3D platformers ever made.  [/h1]\n\nI'm a massive fan of platformers, both 2D and 3D. It was the main genre that made me interested in video games to begin with. Over the years, I've played a lot of them. From the simple pleasure of Mario, to the fast paced and inconsistent rollarcoaster of Sonic, to the smashing and bashing of Crash Bandicoot, I've seen all of the biggest stars of this genre. Psychonauts, meanwhile, is a game that easily deserves to stand among them. \n\n[b] In fact, I'd go so far to say that this game alone is better than most of them.  [/b]\n\nFirstly, the story and writing is fantastic. The care and effort put into it is obvious at all times. If you're somehow unaware of the plot, I won't spoil it. It's a rather simple story honestly, but the characters are what make it great. The core premise of the game revolves around a young psychic kid named Razputin who has to use his powers to enter the minds of other characters. As such, every level is themed around that character's mind. Themed around their past. Themed around their trauma. Psychonauts is not a game to shy away from dark subject matter. Many of the minds you enter in this game belong to deeply troubled individuals suffering from mental illness, and your goal is to help them work through their trauma and help them forge better lives for themselves. It's all handled with such care and attention to detail. Every collectable you find has meaning beyond it's gameplay value. From figments of ideas that compliment their surroundings, to literal emotional baggage, to mental cobwebs formed by an individual neglecting part of their psyche, and to living vaults that contain the individuals brightest (and darkest) memories. Everything in this game is working to tell the story and flesh out it's characters.\n\nHowever, despite it's very serious subject matter, Psychonauts is a delightfully funny game. The game is constantly hitting you with jokes, and not in an overbearing way either. Psychonauts knows exactly when to be funny and exactly when to be serious. It's not mocking it's subject matter. The humor serves to constantly lighten the mood and never allow the game to become overly dark. As for the type of humor in Psychonauts, it's usually dark humor, but portrayed in a very cartoony over-the-top way. It's pretty similar to something like Invader Zim or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, which seems appropriate considering the game's voice talent. It's very 2000s feeling, but in the best possible way. Thankfully, the writing actually aged pretty damn well in my opinion, which I unfortunately can't say for a lot of other 2000s comedy media.\n\nBut enough about story, what about the gameplay? Well, it's fantastic too. Some people call the game a collectathon which it kinda is but also kinda isn't. Every non-inventory item serves to boost your Psi-Cadet Rank. Collect enough of the right things, and you rank up. The maximum rank is 101, and that's essentially 100% completion. You only need to hit rank 30 (which is not at all hard to do) to beat the game. After you hit 30, you simply get helpful but unneeded upgrades. I got 101% which was (mostly) a pretty fun task. Most of the collectables are a blast to get, although figments can be pretty annoying. However it's still not accurate to call it an actual collectathon. Rather, Psychonauts is a level by level platformer with combat and old-school adventure game elements. Some levels lean hard on platforming, some lean hard on combat, and some lean hard on adventure-style puzzle solving. So let's break all three down one by one.\n\nPlatforming:\nRazputin was born in the circus, so he's a very skilled acrobat. The game is filled with various circus-themed obstacles, alongside usual platforming obstacles. The controls are pretty smooth and it's pretty fun to just jump and fling yourself around. Raz is also a psychic, so he learns various psychic powers throughout the plot. Most of them don't have platforming use, aside from one notable exception: Levitation. Raz can summon a rolling ball and bounce high in the air then glide freely to the ground. It's kinda broken but it's super fun. There's not much more to say about platforming. It's pretty fun and it does it's job.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat is alright. Raz has a three hit combo as well as various psychic moves you can pull out. It's pretty easy to exploit, especially if you have a pretty high rank, but again it's fun enough to keep the gameplay interesting. Enemies were pretty repetitive but it's not a big deal. Combat isn't really a big deal.\n\nAdventure:\nThe game involves a lot of talking to characters, figuring out what they want you to do, and often what item you need to find to do it. The puzzles never get that complicated but it keeps the levels interesting. The game naturally also has lots and lots of exploration, especially if you want to go for 101%. \n\nWhile none of these three styles are super deep, the game is greater than the sum of it's parts. It all adds together into a really great gameplay loop, and when you add that with the constant deliberate story it all combines to a very complete feeling experience. The game is firing on all fronts, and even if it didn't hit the mark perfectly on all of them, it hit close enough that it doesn't really matter to me. Psychonauts is a cult classic for a reason, and I think everyone owes it to themselves to play it at least once. For the cheap price this game is constantly at, recommending this is a no-brainer....

Por eso, volver a juegos como \u201cPsychonauts\u201d nos hace retrotraernos y a\u00f1orar una \u00e9poca en la que \u00e9ste pr\u00e1cticamente era el g\u00e9nero predominante y que, no se sabe muy bien por qu\u00e9, pas\u00f3 a ser casi irrelevante dentro del sector. No obstante, en uno de sus \u00faltimos coletazos y de la mano de Tim Schafer, creador de \u201cMonkey Island\u201d y de tantos otros \u00e9xitos, nos adentraremos dentro de las insondables profundidades de la mente humana a trav\u00e9s de los ojos de un ni\u00f1o de paso por un campamento de verano que sirve como punto de partida para este ya cl\u00e1sico videojuego de plataformas, aventura y acci\u00f3n. As\u00ed, \u201cPsychonauts\u201d no ha alcanzado este estatus de culto sin esfuerzo, sino que a golpe de originalidad se ha hecho un hueco en la historia de este medio. Y es que, pese a factores como su dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico que pueden resultar cuestionables seg\u00fan gustos personales, lo que es innegable es que su elemento diferenciador es la enorme variedad art\u00edstica y jugable con la que nos avasalla a lo largo de su desarrollo, gracias a una capacidad de reinvenci\u00f3n constante que hace que estemos jugando a m\u00faltiples aventuras y enfrentemos un sinf\u00edn de situaciones dentro de un \u00fanico videojuego. Lamentablemente, todo su trabajo art\u00edstico y de dise\u00f1o resulta en ocasiones opacado por la incomprensible decisi\u00f3n de tambi\u00e9n avasallar al jugador con una mir\u00edada de coleccionables que no est\u00e1n precisamente ocultos y que interrumpen y distraen al jugador, distanci\u00e1ndolo del resto de valores del t\u00edtulo.  Con todo, y si bien \u201cPsychonauts\u201d quiz\u00e1 nunca alcance el Olimpo de los mejores plataformas 3D, es bien merecedor de toda la popularidad que ha ganado a lo largo de los a\u00f1os gracias a una originalidad fuera de toda duda y, sobre todo, al gran esfuerzo que invierte en lograrla. \u201cPsychonauts\u201d es, como sus personajes, un inadaptado dentro de un mundo estandarizado, seriado y, en excesivas ocasiones, falto de originalidad.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- rezuma originalidad en su dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico y de niveles;\n- se reinventa a cada momento ofreciendo un sinf\u00edn de situaciones diferentes;\n- no es en absoluto un juego dif\u00edcil, pero tampoco nos lo pone todo en bandeja.\n\n[b]Contras:[/b]\n- el control resulta algo tosco para los est\u00e1ndares actuales;\n- pese a su originalidad, el dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico tipo Tim Burton da para ser alabado y odiado a partes iguales;\n- se les fue la mano (mucho) con los coleccionables: se convierten en una distracci\u00f3n que lastra el ritmo de la jugabilidad;\n- todav\u00eda arrastra el que fue uno de los grandes males del sector: el final sin retorno;\n- no est\u00e1 traducido al castellano.\n\n[h1]ENG[/h1]\nNowadays, few are those who still dare to launch a classic 3D platformer. For this reason, going back to games like \"Psychonauts\" makes us go back longing for a time when this was practically the predominant genre and which, it is not very clear why, became almost irrelevant within the sector. However, in one of its last opportunities and with the help of Tim Schafer, creator of \"Monkey Island\" and many other hits, we will delve into the unfathomable depths of the human mind through the eyes of a young boy attending a summer camp that serves as the starting point for this classic platform, adventure and action video game. Thus, \"Psychonauts\" has not achieved this cult status without effort, but through originality it has earned a rightful place in the history of this medium. And so it is that, despite factors such as its artistic design that may be questionable according to personal tastes, what is undeniable is that its differentiating element is the enormous artistic and playable variety with which it overwhelms us throughout its development, thanks to an ability for constant reinvention that makes us play multiple adventures and face an endless number of situations within a single video game. Unfortunately, all this artistic and design work is sometimes overshadowed by the incomprehensible decision to also overwhelm the player with a myriad of collectibles that are not exactly hidden and that interrupt and distract the player, distancing him from the rest of the title's values. All in all, and although \"Psychonauts\" may never reach the Olympus of the best 3D platformers, it is well deserving of all the popularity it has gained over the years thanks to its unquestionable originality and, above all, the great effort invested in achieving it. \u201cPsychonauts\u201d is, like its characters, a misfit in a world that is standardized, serialized and that, too often, lacks originality.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b] \n- oozes originality in its art and level design; \n- It continuously reinvents itself, offering an endless number of different situations; \n- It is not a difficult game at all, but it does not make things easier either.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- its control is somewhat rough by today's standards; \n- despite its originality, the Tim Burton-like artistic design can be equally praised and hated; \n- they went too far (a lot) with the collectibles: they become a distraction, disturbing the pace of the gameplay;\n- It still drags what was one of biggest problems of the sector: the no return ending.", "timestamp_created": 1686420146, "timestamp_updated": 1686420146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554140150547027588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139842451": {"recommendationid": "139842451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179676643", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1062, "last_played": 1686864740}, "language": "english", "review": "\u042f \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443, \u041d\u041e!\nOh, man...

You play as a boy named Raz, attending a summer camp to develop his psychic abilities and become a Psychonaut, secret agents who can traverse the minds of others. But when the fellow campers and the mentors start losing their brains, Raz might just have the chance to prove that he got what it takes. The game has a really unique artstyle, with very stylized, cartoony, caricature-like characters. But it fits the overall comedic tone.\n\nWhat I really like about this game is the variation of levels and mechanics when we enter someone's mind. Some levels, especially the early ones, can be linear and straightforward, getting from start to finish under guidance from the mentors. In later levels, some are more open and less linear, making you do a set of objectives to progress. And the settings are vastly different as well. Like you have a disco club level which serves as Levitation training, a fish city where you're a giant, a twisting neighborhood filled with suspicious characters, and more. It's guaranteed you'll never get bored!\n\nCombat is also pretty creative, and not just throwing punches. Your psychic abilities will be a great help, and sometimes even being the sole way to deal with enemies or bosses, yet they are used for exploration as well. Like you have telekinesis, pyrokinesis, shield, and invisibility among others. And there are lots of enemy types, looking distinct from each other and having different powers, much like the mind-worlds they appear in.\n\nI think Psychonauts is a surprisingly ambitious game, having great variations in levels and enemies, as well as being quite longer than expected, yet not overstaying its welcome. If you like 3D platformers with action such as American McGee's Alice or A Hat in Time, you'll definitely have fun with this title.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Each character feels nuanced and unique, with likable, while flawed, personalities. Psychonauts is so cerebral, so unlike anything else I\u2019ve played, that I don\u2019t know why no one else has taken notes from everything Double Fine is doing so right. Since the whole idea of the story revolves around brains, psykinetic powers and the like, the game has the freedom to basically put whatever the hell insane ideas they want in each mind you explore. \n\nThe story is the clear standout, pairing incredible character writing with some of the best comedy I\u2019ve seen in games. Even after the recent 2010s surge of comedy driven games like The Stanley Parable and Henry Stickmin Collection, Psychonauts stands toe to toe with their comedic chops without using any sort of \u201cmeta\u201d crutch AND still maintaining a genuinely fun gameplay style. \n\nThe atmosphere is also top notch, so many areas are still etched into my mind, from the Milkman\u2019s mind to that little room in the camp store with the TV in it, each area feels so humanly crafted, so personal. This is a perfect example of why people say that mainstream games don\u2019t have the soul that they used to. I don\u2019t really agree with that point but when this much raw charm is exuded by a game almost 18 years old, I can see why people think this type of game is dead now. (in my opinion these types of games have shifted more to the indie landscape) Anyway, this is a long-winded way of saying that I felt very comfortable in these environments, they felt homely and intimate oddly. It really endeared me to the world and helped me to take my time with each mind. \n\nAs for the gameplay loop, you\u2019re provided with a fair few interesting and engaging mechanics that slot quite plainly into the solutions for a good number of puzzles. The abilities are good fun, the balancing ball completely breaks the game in half and I love it. I\u2019m fine with the ball because the platforming will often leave something to be desired. There are certainly some portions of the game that were near infuriating due to its\u2019 jank, but the aforementioned ball was helpful in allowing some cheesy strats. \n\nOverall Psychonauts is an exceedingly underrated experience and one I\u2019m so glad I finally decided to crack into. Its\u2019 cerebral storytelling, strong characters, snappy and hilarious writing and captivating level design make it a certified cream of the crop platformer that I would recommend to pretty much anyone with a sense of humor.", "timestamp_created": 1679894767, "timestamp_updated": 1679894767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688910543918609619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135519412": {"recommendationid": "135519412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025456735", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1312614000}, "language": "english", "review": "Stone-cold classic 3d platformer.

Highly recommended, but don't let the \"cartoonish\" look fool you, this is a challenging 3rd person platformer. \n\nGet the bad out of the way-Infuriating in that the game does not hold your hand. It does tell you what your next objective is, and sometmes gives a hint with a cutscene, but otherwise it is left to you to figure out how to achieve certain things. The platforming is tricking and being third person it can get tricky trying to land your mark, especially in later levels. There are some abilities you get that can help you out with transversal (one in particular), but it in itself is tricky to master. The save system is decent, though sometimes I found saving a game and then reloading put me further back. It does autosave in spots, but sometimes those spots are few and far between. I will admit looking up hints for how to progress.\n\nThe beautiful-such a visual feast. Each level is laid out with different ways and layouts to progress, and very much fun when the 3 dimesions start getting twisted around looking something out of escher. Because the story focusses on different peoples minds, the developers really have fun with this for the most part-later levels (particularly final ones) tend to be....not as well done IMO. But the beauty and fun of each level is worth transversing in itself (a certain level early in the game has an incredible Disco/70's theme that is beautiful just for the fun and the music alone, and the ability you get). Speaking of soundtrack, some great tunes and well done. Writing and dialogue is pretty good, and gets into some interesting ideas and themes about mental states, how people deal with their inner demons, and just a really thoughtful story about the dark side of mental illness. \n\n8/10 recommend.

Developed by Double Fine Productions and released in 2005, Psychonauts has been praised for its originality, humor, and creativity.\nThe game follows Razputin \"Raz\" Aquato, a young psychic who runs away from the circus to join the Psychonauts, an elite group of international psychic secret agents. However, he soon discovers that something is wrong at their secret training facility: Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. A mysterious villain has kidnapped Raz's fellow campers and stolen their brains. Now Raz must use his psychic powers of Telekinesis, Levitation, Invisibility, Pyrokinesis, and more to explore the fantastic realm of the inner mind and save the day.\nPsychonauts is a game that will challenge your imagination and your skills. Each level is a unique mental world that reflects the personality and psyche of its owner. You will encounter giant lungfishes, rampaging milkmen, twisted dentists, disco dancers, meat circuses, and more.

It's a bit daunting to play a game with so much expectations. I can see why Pyshonauts made such a strong impression when it came out. Playing an 18-year-old game, I felt like I was fighting all the mechanics for 5 hours. While I appreciate the story and how the game changes from mind-to-mind, the struggle to play kinda lowered my experience overall. It doesn't help that, at least for me, my controller wouldn't connect. Playing with an Xbox controller, if I pushed the Xbox button, the Xbox overlay popped up. But the game wouldn't recognize the controller. So I had to play with mouse and keyboard, which I normally prefer but was a struggle with Pyschonauts.

There's many big names in the voice cast, including Tara Strong and Richard Steven Horvitz, and even the smaller name voice actors do an incredible job! The art style, both with the 3D stuff like the gameplay and the cut-scenes, and the 2D stuff like the memory vaults, are very nice and have aged very well (though the character design may take some getting used to). \nThe music in Psychonauts is fantastic, to the point where I showed a friend who doesn't usually take game suggestions a few of the songs and he decided to buy the game because of them! Peter McConnell is the composer for this game and he did great work!\nNow onto the cons: The controls may take some getting used to, many find it to be a bit difficult to space some of the jumps, but hey!

Don't take it from me, look at the Overwhelmingly Positive Steam reviews. After finally playing it myself in the year 2023, I respectfully disagree.\n\nThere's a lot to love, and I understand where people are coming from. The classic Double Fine style is on full display, and it looks great for its time. The world is imaginative and funny, and the characters are incredibly wacky. I fully enjoyed many parts of this game (Lungfish, Milkman, Napoleon).\n\nHowever.\n\nFor such a story-focused game, it fails to bring a sense of cohesion to the table. Almost all the characters are extremely simple. Character introductions are sparse, if present at all. At many points, it feels like important plot beats are skipped. The penultimate area's denizens are given zero context before you're thrust into their heads, and they ultimately don't matter at all. It's all just so simple, and I was expecting more from such an esteemed classic.\n\nSide note about the audiovisuals: the mixing is completely broken in this port. There's no way it was this bad on release, right? It contributed to me almost dropping the game.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay: it's ass. The physics are jank, so much so that they are nearly broken in some places. The animations don't help, with how jerky they are. Its adventure game trappings make you go into your inventory and use a specific item in a specific place, which is wild to me in the year 2023, but I remember those days. It's ostensibly a platformer, but only, like, 3 or 4 levels make you use your fancy platforming moves. And don't get me started on the double jump. The game doesn't let you double jump all the time, but you can always float, which was extremely upsetting in the final level where a double jump would have done the same thing as the float in getting me to a platform, but the double jump was not allowed. Like I said before, it's jank.\n\nAgain, I liked parts of this game, and I appreciate it. But I can't recommend playing it yourself.

A charming and delightful game that blends platforming and action with a quirky sense of humor and a richly imagined world.\n\nAt its core, Psychonauts tells the story of Razputin, a young psychic with dreams of becoming a member of the eponymous Psychonauts - a group of elite agents who use their psychic powers to explore the inner workings of the mind. The game takes place in a summer camp for psychics, where Razputin must use his powers to navigate a series of mind-bending levels and uncover a sinister conspiracy that threatens not only the camp but the world at large.\n\nThe gameplay is a joy, with a mix of acrobatic platforming and psychic abilities that allow Razputin to interact with the world in unique and inventive ways. From levitation to telekinesis to pyrokinesis, each ability is fun and satisfying to use, and the levels are designed in such a way that players must use their powers in creative and clever ways to progress.\n\nBut perhaps what sets Psychonauts apart is its wit and charm. The game is filled with memorable characters, each with their own distinct personality and quirks, and the writing is clever and frequently hilarious. From the camp counselor who's secretly in love with his own brain to the milkman who's convinced that everyone is out to get him, the characters in Psychonauts are a delight to interact with and make the game's world feel all the more vibrant and alive.\n\nIn conclusion, Psychonauts is a must-play for anyone who loves inventive and imaginative games with a strong sense of humor. Its combination of clever writing, fun gameplay, and a richly imagined world make it a classic of the genre, and it's not hard to see why it's still beloved by fans today.", "timestamp_created": 1676434023, "timestamp_updated": 1676434023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489285707473754883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132862354": {"recommendationid": "132862354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066377901", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 2234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2234, "last_played": 1651376639}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot recommend this game enough", "timestamp_created": 1676415454, "timestamp_updated": 1676415454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486891388893127441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132862104": {"recommendationid": "132862104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307617724", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1011, "last_played": 1676414993}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Plataformas, est\u00e9tica \u00fanica, juego como pocos, 100% recomendado a pesar de ser de la ps2 y tener ya 18 aaaa\u00f1osss.

This imo only shows how much Psychonauts 2 improved on everything this game did wrong, but let's get to the main points I honestly dislike (Spoilers for the final parts of the game are included!).\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nControls are really bad. When using Keyboard and Mouse, the default settings have a really slow movement of the mouse itself, which doesn't change much when setting sensitivity to highest possible.\n\nController is a bit better in that regard but still feels kinda weird. Not to mention are the actual settings like keyboard/controller bindings not accessible with the controller itself. Also, unplugging the controller while the game is running will make the cursor go absolutely nuts.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nGameplay is... okay. I'm not the biggest fan of having your PSI-Blast depend on a resource (Which thankfully was replaced with recharges in the 2nd game), the confusion granate is really only useful for one part (The one where you actually get it), invisibility has barely any real use and the platforming is often just awful.\n\nGetting on a ledge, only to then have Razputin let go instead of climbing up happens a lot. The bars where he swings on also take ages for him to get to speed (Which in the final level - the Meat Circus - is also not good because of the \"time limit\" you have). and it just feels half-assed at times.\n\nI also had the game crash on me at 3 different times without any provocation. I only entered a loading zone and that was it...\n\n[h1]Meat Circus[/h1]\nThis entire level is pain. It's no fun from start to finish. You have to protect this little child, which on its own is interesting and challenging, but then you have to go through annoying platforming that also contains enemies you have to wait for them throwing stuff so you can progress... All while this annoying little kid gets hurt because he doesn't even think of running away.\nI died so many times in that level because the little kid wanted to become a punching bag.\n\nThe Boss in form of the Butcher, Raz' father and then the combination of both is also annoying.\n[list]\n[*] The Butcher has hard to read attacks (Or at least very fast ones you barely have time to react on) And unless Ford tells you what to do (or you look up a walkthrough), it's not clear that you have to hit his head instead of his body.\n[*] The opstacle course is absolute pain too, partially due to the aforementioned bad controls.\n[*] The mix is actually okay... But only because you can actually punsh the shit out of the monster while being big and otherwise just have to keep your distance...\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Final words and suggestions[/h1]\nIf Double Fine is ever making a remake of this game, please consider these suggestions:\n[list]\n[*] Make the controls more like the second game as that one had really great ones imo\n[*] Update the graphics (Obviously)\n[*] Either improve the Meat circus or get rids of parts for it.

It might be nostalgia for these old-school games speaking but it hits all the right spots for me. The story is kept simple yet engaging which is commended by the world-building. Each character has a unique personality, the main characters especially shine due to their fleshed-out character dept. The gameplay is unarguably the highlight due to the creative level designs. The concept of entering the minds of other characters allows for a vast variety of level themes, each with a special quirk to it. It felt reminiscent of those dream levels in Spongebob BFBB, only in a bigger scope. What elevates the entering-characters-minds concept in this game is the whole psychological aspect of it. The developers knew precisely what they were doing with the characters and how they wanted to portray them through the different tones in each level. It blends excellently with the story and adds more layers to the characters. Even the humor they go for in this game occasionally got a chuckle out of me. They actually sneaked a Hitler reference into it which had me genuinely baffled the first time I heard it. Something notable in my book is also the voice acting. Not only is it outstanding, but the main character is voiced by Richard Horvitz. Most known for voicing Zim from Invader Zim.\n\nLet's go over some negatives. Certain collectibles, like the Figments, are an absolute pain to gather. Not only is it nearly impossible to rely on a guide since there are too many of them in each level, but they are also difficult to spot due to being transparent. I must have dedicated a couple of hours trying to find one final figment in several levels because of that. Then there is the awful decision of having a point-of-no-return in the game. Because of that, a lot of achievements are indeed missable and you will most likely be forced to start a new game to acquire them. Thankfully, one of them could be cheesed by editing the save file to regain an item in your inventory, otherwise, I would have to replay the entire game again. It goes to show you to what extent people are willing to go because of a dreadful decision on the developer's part. I also have to question whether certain segments in this game were playtested. The final level is especially atrocious. It was only thanks to a generous checkpoint feature that I was able to eventually pass it.\n\nDespite that, I'm overwhelmingly satisfied with the game as a whole. I'm certainly looking forward to playing the sequel. I do wish more games like this would take the spotlight in our modern day and age.

This game is fantastic! I mean, I thought it'd be good, but I wasn't expecting to enjoy it quite [i] this [/i] much.\n\nPsychonauts is a really fun 3D platformer about psychics who borderline physically enter each other's minds to either sabotage or heal them. Of course, Raz (the character you play as) only ever heals them... y'know, cuz he's the hero--but I assume that if a psychonaut so desired, they could sabotage a mind. Anyway, the story sends Raz on a wacky and surprisingly grim adventure with plenty of opportunities for him to enter minds and sort out longstanding emotional traumas. It's pretty fascinating stuff, and is generally quite fun gameplay-wise too. The levels (aka the minds he enters) all vary wildly, which makes the game nice and diverse, but also gives ample opportunity for one or two to not be much to your liking, while others very much [i] are [/i] to your liking. That's how it happened with me anyway--for example, I love the Napoleon level with it's board game references and faux free roaming atmosphere, but the level right after it--the bull level--was a bit too murky and linear for my tastes. Both levels are perfectly fine conceptually, it's just that one happened to appeal way more to me than the other (although both did commit the sin of hiding a few of their collectibles in unfair places--seriously, what the HECK, Napoleon level???). Now, I [i] would [/i] say that because of this, there's likely to be something here for everyone, except that there aren't really enough levels for that in general. So instead I'll say that if you like the core concept of entering people's minds to work out their traumas from the inside (or if you just like 3D platformers), [i] then [/i] you should consider this game. Because I think that's the most interesting thing delivered here. And it's delivered in quite a nice way, too... an absurd, highly creative visual style, robust voice acting (Richard Horvitz, the voice of Invader Zim and Moxxie, as Raz!), and a great cast of incredibly vibrant characters. Honestly, as hype as it is to have Horvitz in the game, a lot of the other voice performances really steal the show--Boyd the paranoid conspiracy theorist, Crispin Whytehead the... just plain creep, Vernon the droning storyteller, Fred Bonaparte the unenthusiastic descendant of Napoleon... they may not be the most main or important characters, by my god any opportunity they get to open their mouths is golden. There's so much personality packed into this game that it's a wonder it doesn't burst out of the screen and ooze onto the floor.\n\nThat being said, I feel like this game doesn't take the story quite as far as it could. Although great on the whole, it never got me quite so invested that I felt like there was any truly impactful climax. I think this is probably because Raz and all the other main characters are... kind of boring. It honestly feels like, for some reason, less creativity was put into them than was put into some of the side characters. Raz in particular is, well... he kinda has main character syndrome. I don't see much in him beyond a generic do-gooder hero. But, on the whole, none of this bothers me very much, because there's still so much fun romping to be had even if there's nothing to get deeply attached to. And anyway there [i] is [/i] some deeply [i] interesting [/i] stuff, it's just not per se the main focus.\n\nAlso have I mentioned just how fun the gameplay is? It's got solid 3D platforming for one thing, and I love 3D platformers (it's my favorite genre, in fact), so there's that. But there's also all the cool psychic abilities you unlock slowly over the course of the game. [i] And [/i] several different types of collectibles to go for?? Count me in! ...Sadly they do get pretty grindy and unfun if you try to get all of them, buuuuut y'know, they're fine if you approach them casually.\n\nI feel like I'm trailing off awkwardly with this review. How about a quick summary? This game is great! Very fun to play, very interesting story, and some of the best voice performances I've heard in any game I've played. I feel like it could've left more of a mark on me, but it's also not as if it left [i] no [/i] mark, so... yeah.

So many people recommended it online & rated it pretty highly. But this is a 5/10 game imo.\n\nThe gameplay, especially the platforming, is janky, frustrating, boring, and not fine-tuned. It makes me appreciate so many other platformers that have tight controls & camera control and have strict rules that make you know you can make a jump on a surface and slide/fall off like I did so many times in this fucking game. The combat mechanics are pretty shallow and boss fights usually come down to figuring out which power the game wants you to use, without much prompting which power that is. They could have used color codes or recurring signs/attacks to telegraph what powers to use, if they wanted to restrict which ones you do use in boss fights. Why all bosses can't be, say, set on fire or picked up with telekinesis? Because the designers had a specific idea in mind and that restricts fun & creativity with such interesting powers.\n\nThe second worst part of the game was that it was trying to be a platformer while also trying to be a \"collectathon\" game. Except the things you are collecting don't make almost any difference in the gameplay & difficulty of the game. I barely felt stronger for collecting so many damn figments and the useless emotional baggage (with a ~7 second cutscene every time that you can't skip). In my opinion, they should have focused on collecting things or on platforming, or if they did both make collecting things have much more impact. And more RPG elements of spending your levels on upgrading specific powers would have made collecting more fun & engaging. As it is, you collect a bunch of stuff to be told a few levels before \"Hey! You'll upgrade invisibility! And then never need to use it!\" Great.......\n\nThe story is on paper somewhat interesting, with psychic secret agents who save the world. But what does the main character do in the game? Go into his friends, teachers, random mental asylum inmates, and villains' minds to solve his problems. He does save the world in the process, but you never feel like the world is in danger, as the entire game takes place in a summer camp & nearby asylum. I didn't care about my actions because I didn't care about the characters. The writing & introduction of each character despite Razputin (the main character) are so weak and random. And there are faaaaaar too many characters for me to care about all of them, which waters down how much I care about each of them in return.\n\nThe music wasn't amazing, and there sometimes was no music during parts of levels. The artwork is interesting, but with the jagged edges and repetitious textures during each level.\n\nI'd say the best part of the game was the humor and some jokes were pretty funny :) Those made me smile.....but there were a lot of jokes that tried to hit that just fell flat and were way too random to be funny.\n\nOverall, I do *not* recommend playing this game. Play a better platformer like Super Mario 64 or a better collectathon game like Donkey Kong 64.

Sin embargo, una vez que le pill\u00e9 el tranquillo, me encontr\u00e9 ante un buen juego. La historia tiene lugar en un campamento en el que entrenan a unos ni\u00f1os para convertirlos en guerreros que defiendan el pensamiento libre, pero estos guerreros no usan la fuerza bruta como arma, sino la mente, son conocidos como los psychonauts. Como te podr\u00e1s imaginar, los diferentes niveles y plataformeo que tiene el juego se desarrollan introduci\u00e9ndote dentro de la mente de los personajes, de forma que podemos ver su vida pasada, sus miedos, sus aspiraciones y sus traumas. Y en este aspecto es donde brilla Psychonauts: nos presenta la mente y la salud mental de una forma bastante interesante (a partir de aqu\u00ed hay spoilers). Por ejemplo, hay una mujer llamada Milla que es muy ca\u00f1era, si nos metemos en su mente, pensaremos que a ella lo \u00fanico que le gusta es la fiesta y el baile, sin embargo, esto solo es una fachada para ocultar sus traumas debido a que no pudo hacer nada para evitar la muerte de unos ni\u00f1os en un orfanato. Tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 Edgar, que padece un trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo por circunstancias de su vida, y dicho trastorno se simboliza mediante un toro llamado El Odio, que corre en un bucle infinito entre los recuerdos del pasado de los que se arrepiente y, para salir de ese bucle, debemos ayudar a Edgar a afrontar directamente la causa de su arrepentimiento y dejar el pasado atr\u00e1s.\n\nEl videojuego presenta diversos enemigos seg\u00fan la mente en la que nos hayamos metido, sin embargo, todas las mentes tienen un enemigo en com\u00fan: los censores. Estos enemigos son unos hombres trajeados que llevan un sello negativo, y atacar\u00e1n al jugador nada m\u00e1s verlo. Los censores representan una especie de sistema inmune del cerebro, se encargan de eliminar los pensamientos intrusivos y de crear fachadas en el pensamiento con el objetivo de proteger al cerebro, como le ocurre a Milla. La falta de censores en una mente es un indicativo de que esa persona tiene problemas mentales, y un ejemplo de ello es Boyd Cooper, la \u00fanica persona de todo el juego en la que no encontramos censores al penetrar en su mente. Boyd padece esquizofrenia paranoide, cree en las teor\u00edas de la conspiraci\u00f3n y siente que est\u00e1 siendo perseguido. Cuando nos introducimos en su mente, vamos a parar a un pueblo que, a priori, parece normal y corriente. Sin embargo, no tardamos en descubrir que la versi\u00f3n distorsionada de la realidad que tiene Boyd se ve reflejada a trav\u00e9s de un pueblo deformado que no sigue las leyes de la f\u00edsica ni de la l\u00f3gica. Tambi\u00e9n vemos su paranoia a trav\u00e9s de c\u00e1maras y esp\u00edas por todos lados, as\u00ed como agentes del Gobierno que buscan a un tal \u00ablechero\u00bb. Estos agentes eran producto de la imaginaci\u00f3n de Boyd y, de forma ir\u00f3nica, su verdadera funci\u00f3n consist\u00eda en proteger a Boyd de s\u00ed mismo, quer\u00edan encontrar al lechero, que era el alter ego de Boyd, su lado mentalmente estable. Durante todo el nivel, no nos topamos con ning\u00fan censor, lo que simboliza que Boyd est\u00e1 totalmente desconectado de la realidad y en su mente hay pensamientos que no deber\u00edan estar (ya que no hay censores para eliminarlos). Sin embargo, en cuanto encontramos al lechero, el lado mentalmente estable de Boyd, empiezan a aparecer censores a montones.\n\nSimbolismos como este me han gustado mucho y llevan a recomendar Psychonauts. No es un juego perfecto, obviamente, tiene algunos defectos como los que ya coment\u00e9 brevemente al inicio, o tambi\u00e9n el hecho de que no est\u00e1 traducido al espa\u00f1ol, pero desde luego no es un mal juego.\n", "timestamp_created": 1673528285, "timestamp_updated": 1673528285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130628196": {"recommendationid": "130628196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117530781", "num_games_owned": 827, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2613, "last_played": 1673433943}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best PS2 era collectathon platformers around!

Collecting stuff is frustrating, sound design is non-existent at times, a few segments are the game are incredibly frustrating, and across the board the boss battles are pretty unsatisfying (the Milkman's boss is probably the best). Maybe most importantly, for a game that is supposed to be a platformer, any sections where platforming is the focus and missing the platform makes you fall to your death, are absolutely horrendous. You can spend 10 minutes climbing up, get hit by something or miss a jump, and fall down halfway again, and have that be repeated until you beat it. I was tempted to quit the game a few times and just look up a Let's Play of someone clearing the game.\n\nThat said, the visuals and the different minds you venture into are amazing and really makes this game unique. A masterpiece in 2005 that has aged very roughly. \n\nThe story is... interesting? If you write out the story it's incredibly short, lengthened by the different individual minds you venture into, however these individuals do not bring the story forward. I'd estimate 75% of the game is helping random, *very interesting* characters that you'll then never interact with again. Perhaps in a sequel, they'll return and bring something interesting to the table, but in this game they could've all been interchanged for any other interesting characters as they don't interact with the plot. It feels like they had a great pitch, only that they weren't sure how to put it all into a coherent story or use all of the fun powers at your disposal.\n\nThe \"feel\" of the game has aged kind of well but is still a bit rough, switching between windows takes a few seconds on Windows 10 for example, and certain controls are unintuitive. I took a pause in playing and didn't know the X button did stuff when I returned because there were no prompts for it (puts away items, cancels menus etc). \n\nConsidering the unique gameplay and visuals, I would recommend it for a one-time playthrough, just keep an eye on your own sanity and *don't* collect everything.", "timestamp_created": 1672785405, "timestamp_updated": 1672785405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130047994": {"recommendationid": "130047994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208092208", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1085, "last_played": 1672040365}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing it for the first time in 2022, I was surprised by how well it stood the test of time.

that when point 'n' click writers apply themselves to 3D platformers the characterisation and narrative development will be fantastic. The humour is wonderful and very reminiscent of LucasArts classics. But the boss fights (looking at you, lungfish) are so unintuitive, unwieldy and utterly bugged that I cannot in good faith recommend this game. In other words, poor mechanics let this game down massively. Huge shame.

The creativity is insane. The characters are fascinating. If it was possible, I would love to go on a tour inside Tim Schafer's brain, because I'm fairly certain it would look something like the Milkman Conspiracy. However, mediocre boss fights and terribly vague gameplay (clearly an adventure game carry-over) persist. 3D platformers don't have to be linear, but: (a) if baddies are present, combat must be fun and well designed and (b) objectives should be easier to decipher than typical puzzle games because the focus is ultimately on platforming.\n\n(2) Boss fights continue to suffer from vague, unenjoyable design.\n\n(3) I am going to complete this game, but the more I play, the less I enjoy it because of how convoluted it is. Started off so well and took a sharp right turn into awful.\n\nSpecific issues:\n\n-Black Velvetopia is a migraine inducing nightmare. These days it would 100% come with an epilepsy warning.

La unica queja que puedo dar es que los controles tienen algunos problemas, pero la verdad solo me dio algo de problemas en una parte en especifico del ultimo nivel, y la verdad no fue tan frustrante que digamos. Y es literalmente lo unico malo que puedo decir de este juego. Todo me encanto \u00a1Todo! El apartado artistico desborda personalidad, asi como cada uno de los personajes, sin falta. Uno de mis mayores placeres en este juego era recorrer todo el campamento tras cada mision para ver cuales dialogos habian cambiado y ver eventos especiales, es increible como un mapa tan peque\u00f1o puede tener una exploracion tan satisfactoria.

The particularity is that every level is an original representation of someone\u2019s mind, and it\u2019s presented in a very creative and colourful way. If the game is very interesting for its aesthetics and its ideas, the gameplay is not always enjoyable as the controls can feel a bit clunky and some of the collectibles are infuriating to collect. \nDespite all this, one should at least try psychonauts to taste the originality and uniqueness of the title but shouldn\u2019t be bothered to complete it as it can quickly become frustrating. \n\n[h1]I.Form[/h1]\n[b]a.Graphics[/b]\nPsychonauts is far from being the best-looking game from 2005. That doesn\u2019t mean that it looks bad. One of the strong elements of the game is its aesthetic. Think of classic 3D platformers such as Banjo&Kazooie meets comic books and Tim Burton. Psychonauts knows its aesthetic and actually offers something well put together, no matter the limitation of the time. \n\n[b]b.Music and Voice Acting[/b]\nMusic is not that special, most of the time you won\u2019t pay attention to it. Nothing is groundbreaking and most of the time the OST doesn\u2019t know what vibe it wants to give to the game. Sometimes typical spy-movie tunes, sometimes western, sometimes melodious. It\u2019s very hard to know. \nThe voice acting is okay, good even but sadly the repetitions of the same sentences over and over again combined with some atrocious voice choices (sheegor for example) makes it sometimes hard to enjoy.\n\n[h1]II.Content[/h1]\n[b]a.Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is a classic collect-a-thon platformer. You go from \u201cworld\u201d to \u201cworld\u201d and collect things withing those levels. The twist that psychonauts wants to offer is that you are a young psychic and you go inside the mind of people to get more powerful. You also get psychic powers along the way and each of those powers allows you to collect new things. \nThe main collectibles are figments (sorts of jpg pictures hanging in multiple places in the level, usually more than 100 are placed in each levels), emotional baggage and vaults. Figments are the reason I never bothered finishing the game in the past, they are very hard to see on screen sometimes and they are just annoying to collect altogether. In some level its just pure torture to look for them. You don\u2019t have to do it but it\u2019s necessary for levelling up your character and of course do the 101% run. \nAlso, I know the game is more than 15 years old now but the controls are sometimes infuriating. I felt the need to stop playing the game at multiple points as they would introduce some weird mechanics or ask to do some kind of infuriating parkour. The jump is neither precise, nor fluid, it\u2019s just stiff. You need to get use to it and when I say need, it\u2019s that it\u2019s mandatory as one of the final level of the game is a super long and very difficult parkour where you can\u2019t stop or make the smallest mistake. \nAltogether the game can be very fun to explore but also incredibly frustrating to navigate and 100%\n\n[b]b.Story[/b]\nPsychonauts tells the story of a summer camp for psychic children. There they are supposed to develop their skills and become psychic soldiers. You play as Raz one of those children and quickly you\u2019ll notice that something darker happens at the camp as you navigate inside people\u2019s mind to get stronger.\nThat\u2019s the strongest aspect of the game; That idea of exploring the mind of people and that it looks like a completely different thing depending on the person personality. You can have a war-zone or a board game or even a whole city. That\u2019s absolutely captivating and motivation enough to put your frustrations aside and keep playing the game to see what\u2019s next. \nThe fact that it\u2019s a camp setting is also super nice because outside of those levels you can do what children in camp do and explore the surroundings, it feels very organic, very believable. It\u2019s definitely something that added to the game for me. I\u2019m curious if the sequel will go back to it and if not what they will offer instead. \n\n[h1]III.Others[/h1]\n[b]a.Replay Value[/b]\nYou\u2019ll need to play a bit more after finishing the game if you want to complete it but after that I don\u2019t see many reasons to inflict that upon yourself again. You\u2019ll probably return to re-experience the story and atmosphere but that\u2019s it.\n\n[b]b.Achievements[/b] \nThe game has 37 achievements and a few are actually missable and unless you know about them it\u2019s very easy to miss them as the game never signal a special event taking place. Also the completion of the game is super infuriating. Finding all the figments is a chore and when a level has more than 200 of those electric-colour things in front of an electric-colored background it\u2019s just insane. \n\n[b]c.Price[/b] \nThe game is 9.99 but goes on sale quite often. I would rather wait for a sale as the game is very not that big nor long. \n\n[h1]IV.Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[Table]\n[tr][th]Pros[/th][th]Cons[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][list]\n    [*] A cool and unique universe and atmosphere\n    [*] Cool characters and worlds\n [/list][/td]\n[td][list]\n    [*] Annoying / Frustrating controls \n    [*] Collecting is draining and tedious \n[/list][/td][/tr]\n[tr][th]Conclusion[/th][td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 [/td][/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1668346427, "timestamp_updated": 1668346513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518963873386383057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125317692": {"recommendationid": "125317692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065926350", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1668630637}, "language": "english", "review": "A great Old School game that I have missed playing.", "timestamp_created": 1668204415, "timestamp_updated": 1668204415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125270890": {"recommendationid": "125270890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153886221", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 375, "last_played": 1668098753}, "language": "english", "review": "One of them curious passion projects that changed it all for the industry.

executes its ideas flawlessly. The game play is, in contrast, is hard to control in some sections, and broken in a few others. The main reason to play this game is for the aesthetics. There is so much love and care poured into every interesting world Raz thrown into, character you interact with, and every goofy trope this game comes across. Fans of cartoons from the late 90s to early 00s then this game is a must pick up. Not only is the voice actor for Raz, Richard Horvitz (the same voice actor for, among others, Zim in \"Invader Zim\" and Billy in \"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy\"), but the designs and interactions the characters have gives such nostalgia for people who grew up with those cartoons. The 2nd game is a worthy predecessor to the 1st. Not only the movement a lot more fluid, but the powers are way more fun to use in and out of combat. Raz's character development is also more thought out. If you played the second game you know what I'm talking about. I would definitely recommend playing the 1st game before the 2nd one. Not only for canonical purposes, but also because it is so satisfying going from the old controls to the new ones. It's also just really fun exploring the worlds in the 2nd game. It's a little bit of a headache getting all the collectibles in the 1st game.

That is something to consider when it comes to judging it based on its design.  There are a number of platforming segments that seem very difficult, and there's some design choices that don't make sense, such as the point of no return at the end.  That said, the game is a funny, charming experience that has an excellent art style.  It's just unfortunate that the game doesn't make the cutscenes look any nicer, and this is mostly an HD port if anything.  I'd say this game is probably a 7/10.  I'm really reluctant to go and collect everything in the game, especially the Figments because most of them are placed in a way that they are ridiculously difficult to get and not even for a fair reason.  It's like they just added in a lot of them in to add artificial length to the game.  That aside, I'd still recommend this game.\n\nHuge downside.

This game shaped my life as dorky as that sounds, and throughout my life I've all but wanted to tie every friend and family member I have to a chair and make them play this game. I legitimately play other platformers and get a feeling in my gut that I'd rather be playing this, and I say that with platformers being my favorite genre.\n\nTo me the best type of game is a 3D platformer collectathon with secrets around every nook and cranny, a game you can fully lose yourself in the world and plot of while also playing for fun or obsessively seeking out every single collectible. This game perfects that description. I always fall into the second category and I like to 100% this game for fun or whenever I'm feeling down. It's important with a collectathon that you never tire of the characters, art, or music, because you're going to be seeing A LOT of them. I first played this game as a child and the world it presents has never grown stale.\nIt's one of those games where you can feel the creators passion for it in every detail.\n\nAs far as story it isn't anything insane or that'll make you cry, but it's a fun set piece for the game to rest on and it has enough to it that you won't be comparing it to overly simple platformer stories like Mario and A Hat In Time.\nThe game's sense of humor is amazing and still makes me laugh to this day, even the way the lines are delivered is perfection. As a teenager during one of my escapades of forcing my friends to play this game, shortly into it my friend asked me if I had been playing this since I was really little, I told them I had, and they replied that it made perfect sense where I got my sense of humor from, which shows the way the writing and delivery shaped me.\nThe game even delves into dark humor at times which I adore, without overly relying on it like a Danganronpa game might.\nEven if you don't 100% the game try to get all of the memory vaults! It's well worth your time for the extra art, addition to the story, and several touching moments in the wordless storytelling that always gets me tearing up.\n\nThe art direction in this game is brilliant, Scott Campbell's work is unique and pulls you in, but I've found that it's not for everyone since some people I show this game to will remark that the art leans more \"weird\" than pretty to them, which might tip some people off. (Not me!) The art still influences me in what I draw to this day, and I always keep art from this game up on my wall to inspire me.\n\nOne flaw the art has in this game lies mainly in its 100% completion requirements. No spoilers but there is a race segment of the game. The walls are very groovy and colorful with fun patterns on everything and it looks pretty as you whiz by it all. The race only takes a minute or two to complete, so you won't be there long, however if you are 100% completing the game you'll find yourself coming back to this race, albeit this time a bit more slowly. Pacing over every inch of the racing track looking for figment collectibles that often blend in to the colorful designs is a NIGHTMARE. You'll find yourself missing plenty and if you want to walk backwards it'll be a pain in the ass since the track is sloped for forward movement only. Whenever I look for figments in the game I save this for last as I detest it, and I quickly get motion sick 10-20 min into exploring the race track. On that note there are a few figments that are overly difficult to find. One of which feels like it's in the middle of nowhere and I've heard many miss that one. I had to look up where figments are placed (Luckily with the game giving you a book of your collected ones it's VERY simple to follow guides for these) and I HATE looking up collectible placement. One I missed was green, see through, and looked like a tree. It was in a backyard area that was hard to center the camera on and in GREEN grass. I was pissed when I finally found it. The game does what I think all collectible games should do and lists how many of each item you're missing in each sub area AND level, but don't feel guilty if you have to look one up!\n\nThe gameplay hasn't changed much since its Xbox/PS2 days, but I love the way Raz feels and controls, the platforming is so much fun to learn and perfect over time, but the game never gets overly difficult, just enough to make you feel proud of yourself for getting through parts without making you angry. I've heard some people say Raz controls \"janky\" and doesn't respond how they want or expect him to, and while I don't notice this it is something that I could have grown blind to over years of playing, though I remember it feeling amazing even as a child.\n\nThe music is charming and expressive though not very emotional. The game wants you to have fun more than cry your eyes out. It's very recognizable as I played through Costume Quest and found a camping store in it that played Psychonauts music, I realized what it was right away and was thrilled. It's not even the only Psychonauts Easter egg in the game, or in games in general, which shows the cult following it has amassed. From Brutal Legend to Alice Madness Returns many games have taken to referencing it.\n\nAll together if you like 3D platformers or even if you just like the art and humor, go check this game out, as I'm sure it'll continue to inspire people for years to come.", "timestamp_created": 1666060481, "timestamp_updated": 1666060481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576696097850799561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123973465": {"recommendationid": "123973465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856871313", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 261, "playtime_at_review": 1213, "last_played": 1700302622}, "language": "english", "review": "100/100\nThe Best classic Action/Adventure Platformer I Ever Played\nA Psychic Odyssey Through the Minds of Misfits, Monsters, and Madmen \nFull of Fabulous ideas", "timestamp_created": 1666015646, "timestamp_updated": 1666015646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123965363": {"recommendationid": "123965363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007888370", "num_games_owned": 471, "num_reviews": 419, "playtime_forever": 1022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1022, "last_played": 1664887594}, "language": "english", "review": "I am the milk man.

For being an Xbox/PS2 title, this game looks extremely good. The graphics have aged well due to how stylized they are.\nThe main campaign will probably average around a good 12-15 hours depending on the person. If you go for 100% you're probably looking at around 24 hours.\nI honestly wouldn't recommend going for 100% unless this game becomes your favorite, there's a lot that goes into it. You'll probably have to do a lot of googling to figure out exactly what you need to do to grab the 3 figments you missed. Figments are scattered through each main level, and count towards 100%. Once you get farther into the game, you can be finding 100s of them in a single level, some extremely difficult and taking precision to grab.\nI personally had wanted to play this game for years before going for a Steam copy, I hunted for the PS2 version through some of my teenage years, but never managed to find one. So my expectations for this game were fairly high.\nThis game floods personality and charm, and honestly that right there was enough to give this game an easy recommendation. Most of the platforming is fun, and the puzzles range from very simple to, \"I would have never figured that out on my own.\" Using your psychic powers to solve puzzles is one of the many things that made this a fun experience. The story, while by today's standards has a few slightly predictable elements is cute. Even with the predictability it still had a ton of unique elements that I adored.\nI think the only main con with this game is how it runs, it's from 2005. I ran into some glitches and bugs that could only be fixed with a reinstall. I had a small amount of crashes, but nothing in the vain of playing Fallout New Vegas. It runs decently on Windows 10, but not perfectly. Luckily there's a FAQ pinned to the official forums, that the creator of the game posted. Most of the time, that will give you exactly what you need to know. \nFor $10, this game is definitely worth your time. It's become a bit of a cult classic, especially when considering the Xbox's game library. Plus, last year we got a sequel so there's no better time to pick this one up. I consider this one to be worth the years of waiting I did to see it, and what it has to offer.

It mixes 3D platforming with elements of exploration and inventory puzzles from the adventure game genre. This is from Double Fine's staff at the time of development mostly working on Adventure games in the 90s.\n\nThe result is there's a lot of unique dialogue for showing your inventory items to every character possible. The dialogue and writing are stellar and the true selling point of this game. There's a unique premise that psychics exist, they have a pan-national spy agency, and your player character breaks into that organization's summer camp for psychically gifted children. You have a cast of campers and councilors who are distinctly written and well voice-acted. The hub world is the camp itself and manages to feel big and full of secrets without actually being that big. The individual levels are the minds of different people around the camp. Going into the brain of a person allows for stylization of aesthetics and a focus on how that person perceives the world.\n\nOn a technical level the platforming can be a bit on the easy side. Once unlocking the ability to levitate, many of the levels and sections of the overworld open up and make collecting hard-to-reach objects much easier. Some in-level collectibles have a color palette similar to their backgrounds that can make seeing them difficult. These collectibles also float along a track which can means spending extra time per collectible.

But that doesn't make it fun to play.\n\n\nI don't think its too controversial to say the game's level design is awful.\nEvery single mindscape is full of back tracking and wonky platforming, Raz just doesn't control well. His jump feels stiff, he's very slow and don't even try to attack enemies it just feels like crap. Even with a controller.\nNavigation is a pain. Despite being psychic Raz has no compass or map so figuring out each objective is something of a journey in discovery. Which sounds good in theory but again, its slow and awkward and just not fun.\nPlatforming is awful, physics based sections like the trapeze feel VERY stiff. There's no flow for momentum at all. Raz's double jump is just useless. You can't really change your direction or alter your jump length. There's no reason not to just mash out a double jump every time because you never need a single jump. It makes platforming feel less a challenge of judgement and reflex, more like you're just walking down a funny shaped hallway. \n\nBy my count the best part of the game is also the worst. The first three hours are one giant over long very hand-holdy tutorial but also the minds you explore during this time are not only richly detailed and oozing with good foreshadowing and subtle world building. They are also the easiest and most navigable. Even if the course of action devolves into a \"Get item C from mind B so you can get item D for mind A\" kind of Spongebobbing fetch quest stuff. \nBoss fights are a pain, its the standard kid friendly wait five minutes for them to expose a glowing weak spot then hit it once and repeat about 3-4 times. \n\nAs for the writing well, Psychonauts is at its best when its trying to be serious. \nThere is some great foreshadowing, even many throw away lines contain a hint about whats to come next or about a character's inner struggles. Every single mind you enter is full of detail and metaphor, which makes for interesting speculation in a very thought provoking story.\n\nHowever humour is a difficult thing to get right and Psychonauts fails hard. \nIts a good dozen steps above video game humour There's no \"Gamers don't die they just respawn\" type jokes, but Psychonauts forgets the two most basic rules of comedy. Timing and shock. Many of the jokes drag on just a little too far or simply aren't shocking enough to get your attention. \nDespite having a fantastically written cast there's precious few character jokes, most of the humour boils down to \"Wouldn't it be funny if the main villain's astral form was a Ultraman reference?\" a joke that was probably lost on all the players back in 2005.\n\nI am willing to admit it might just be an issue of taste where the humour is found and not really something quantifiable. \n\nGraphics might be a point of contention for some but not me. Sure the game looks ugly but I've seen far worse. Psychonauts is definitely a triumph of art direction over pure graphical power. Its far more interesting to look at a character like Sasha Nein or Coach Oliander and see the unique personality in their designs or in their mindscapes than anything game like Control that just showers you in fancy high end particle effects could ever offer.\n\nSound on the other hand...\nI'm not sure why everything is so compressed but its kind of funny to imagine the whole game's story being told through a 2008 Xbox 360 party chat. \nJokes aside all the sound is very compressed and it is genuinely awful. \n\nOverall Psychonauts as a story or setting is interesting. The way it portrays mental illness is something I wish more games would do. The mindscapes are all beautiful and fascinating absolutely rich with symbolism and detail. But its just not fun to play. It would be better suited ironically enough as something more like Rhombus of Ruin, a linear point n click style experience. The platforming doesn't add anything it just makes me want to play the game less. \n\nWhile I didn't personally enjoy it perhaps someone who doesn't already know the story of the game might.", "timestamp_created": 1663880155, "timestamp_updated": 1663880155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497017860412597656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122605771": {"recommendationid": "122605771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063465553", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1668, "last_played": 1600584304}, "language": "english", "review": "A charming and wonderful game; Best played with a controller.", "timestamp_created": 1663806492, "timestamp_updated": 1663806492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122568115": {"recommendationid": "122568115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315167637", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 915, "last_played": 1631477078}, "language": "english", "review": "Super creative 3D platformer with some really cool ideas.", "timestamp_created": 1663733939, "timestamp_updated": 1663733939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122550627": {"recommendationid": "122550627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368781832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1571, "last_played": 1663705999}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

I've never played a 3d platformer with this amount of originality and creativity before. The concept of the game is incredibly cool. Collecting the pieces in the worlds are so fun, the missions are so creative, I might use this word a lot but this game just oozes creativity from everywhere. Characters and the campground is so charming. Razputin is one of the most likable protagonists I've ever seen. He's a 10 year old kid. He's very smart, skillful, funny and a nice person. Even though he takes his missions seriously and very smart, he still is a child, so It is very entertaining to watch his reactions with the other characters.

This is why this review will include my general opinions about both 1 *and* 2, while pointing out some differences between them. Generally though, if I didn't mention which entry I'm talking about, then I'm talking about both.[/i][/b][/h1]\n\n[h1]Story & Writing:[/h1]\n\n[b]This is the series strong-point by far. Every aspect of the game feeds into the story, including: level-design, combat, abilities, etc.[/b]\n\nThe story itself in it's base form isn't something we've never seen before: superpowers, gadgets, spies, etc. [u]It's the way the story bleeds into every nook and cranny of this game[/u], the way the writing can pull off seem-less transitions between childish humour, adult drama, or sometimes in between with adult comedy.\n\nAll the characters are well written, and are some of the most memorable I've seen in any movie, show, or game.\n\nAfter playing this series, All other similar games' stories (Jack and Daxter, Ratchet and clank, Sly Cooper) feel one-dimensional and basic. Especially after playing Ratchet and Clack: Rift Apart, which felt very child focused and not very enjoyable or engaging for anyone above the age of 10.\n\n[i]Between the first game and the second , I feel both are as strong as one another writing wise, and although the first one has a very good story, the sequel ups it by just a bit.[/i]\n\n[h1]Level-Design:[/h1]\n\nSince most of the game takes place in different people's minds, [b]the level design feels like a continuation of the story[/b], but without the writing. You can see the world through the person's POV and delve into his psyche to figure out what are his internal problems, motivations, etc. [u]Everything in the level is a hint into the subconscious[/u]: the characters, the walls, the gimmick....\n\n[b]every level has it's own unique gimmick which can be minor or major.[/b] It can range from for example: 1-the floor is lava, 2- giving you a new ability and the whole level is built around this ability (which you can now use in other levels of course), or 3- completely changing the way you play the game.\n\n[i]In this aspect, I think both 1 and 2 are equal, though 2 is bigger and offers more.[/i]\n\n[h1]Combat & Powers:[/h1]\n\n[b]Combat is serviceable[/b], [i]although there is a definite improvement with the second game[/i] with more enemy variety, while the first game only had censors of the small, medium,  large and range variety, three of them basically occupying the same role.\n\nAlthough, with the introduction of more enemies in the second game, some of them have a specific way to fight them and although I didn't mind most of them, some take almost no damage expect with pyrokinesis which is very slow and tedious.\n\n[b]Lock-on was extremely well-done in the first game, and it's absolutely horrendous in the second one, you might as well not use it in 2.[/b]\n\nas for powers, both games have the same core abilities with a few specific powers for each game. The main point I would like to talk about is the differences in 3 of the main abilities between the first and second game.\n\nPsi-blast: Is a basic shoot ability in both games with a charge mechanic, in the first game it's ammo based, while in the second game it's 3 shots (you can also upgrade to 4, feels pretty much the same) and then a cooldown. Both have their negatives, in the first one when you have a lot of ammo you basically dont need any other power, but when you're out you have collect drops one by one which is tedious and breaks flow. In the second game, it's rechargeable so it can be used in the platforming like the other abilities, but it has more down-time than shooting. I feel there is a middle ground here.\n\nPyrokinesis: in the first game it was lock on based, which makes it free-range, as long as you can lock on you can use it, but it was also mostly a single target attack, in the second game it's an AOE with well defined parameters but only a fixed range. Also both require a wind-up. I feel also, there is a middle ground here and you can also remove the wind-up but give it a slight recharge time.\n\nLevitation: It was by far, way more fun to use in the first game than in the second game. It had higher jumps, more control and just better movements in the first game. While I understand why they nerfed it, since you can break the game with it and they had to be very intricate in their design with the first game to make sure this doesn't happen for the most part (it still did), but in the end, it is less fun to use in the second game.\n\n[h1][b][i][u]TL;DR: Fantastic action-platformer with genre defining story, writing and characters.[/u][/i][/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1659905391, "timestamp_updated": 1674425240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613275229930877686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120225824": {"recommendationid": "120225824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151727717", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1229, "last_played": 1659887818}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game but FUCK the milkman level", "timestamp_created": 1659886309, "timestamp_updated": 1659886309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48571428656578064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120190032": {"recommendationid": "120190032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268010541", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1395, "last_played": 1660156200}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Psychonauts is what games should be.[/h1]\nWhenever i felt down i came to play games that i enjoyed, \nand games like this gave me good memoriess and good friends to talk to about it.\n\nGames like Crash bandicoot, Mario oddesy, Spyro and Banjo-kazzoie\nhave that charm of a 3D level based story with 1 goal and optional objectives.\n\nTo sit down and just relax en enjoy a good casual story game is very refreshing in a market filled with: \n [b]17[/b] Call of duty, \n [b]12 [/b] assasins creed \nand  [b]30 [/b] fifa games.\n\n[u]I just need 1 Gem to be happy![/u]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1659830390, "timestamp_updated": 1659830461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120130792": {"recommendationid": "120130792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191384362", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1065, "last_played": 1659738212}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphically a bit dated of course, but the platforming and creative writing and gameplay make this game worth checking out!

It nearly ended where it begun until the recent miracle revive of there series with its new sequel. The game takes you through cool worlds that bend and wrap around representing the many minds of those you jump into. These worlds are surreal and one moment youll be in someones war zone in their head, or maybe their own city of thoughts. There are multiple abilites and they are all super fun to use. If you love these type of platformers, and you were one of the unfortunate to sleep on it you cant miss out on it. Its aged like fine wine and is still a classic more should play.

Back a few months ago, when Double Fine released Psychonauts 2, the second-generation work seemed to have attracted a lot of attention from players. Double Fine's innovation in the second generation of works almost made players praise this game. There are many people who paid attention to the first generation of Psychonauts because of the second generation of works, and this includes me. It's also because I paid attention to Psychonauts 2 that I gradually became interested in the first generation. So driven by interest, I downloaded the game.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was a very, very old interface, indeed, because it was a game from more than ten years ago. Then I started to choose, which seemed to be the place where the characters sleep. At this time, I met Raz, who I am very familiar with. He is the protagonist of Psychonauts. After making some choices, I officially started the game. The game process is very good, very fun, and the plot is very interesting, but there are some small problems. First of all, it is a problem of the times, and the picture quality is not very good. Since it is a picture quality problem caused by the times, then I will not say anything. But the second is that the key position indication is not so clear. The key position icon of this game is not very clear, which caused me to sometimes not know which key to press. These two questions made my interest in this game shrink a little bit, but they are not a big deal and don't affect the game experience. After two hours of experience, I think this is a good game, although there are a lot of time problems, but it is still a very fun game today.

I liked it quite a bit, and yet found it a slightly disappointing narrative relative to Grim Fandango, even though it\u2019s a better and more enjoyable game. Part of this was simply that I was never that into platformers, and part of it was that the game felt lightweight; it\u2019s very much working within the summer-camp-movie genre, and lacks the pathos that Full Throttle and Grim Fandango channeled so well.\n\nIn 2021, I replayed it with a friend (who struggles with platformers) in preparation for Psychonauts 2, and I liked it more than I did the first time around. The art style has aged wonderfully\u2014this is probably the best-looking Xbox game there is, precisely because it avoids graphical realism. This was also one of the last prominent \u201ccharacter platforms\u201d outside of Mario, and so the gameplay felt fresher than it did when it was released. More than anything, I appreciated just how ambitious the game was, how each level substantially changed the formula, how it seems to have a faith that its audience will go along with a lot of weirdness as long as it\u2019s charming and well-executed. And it is: in fact, the levels probably get better as the game goes on. There are a million retrospective odes to The Milkman Conspiracy, but while it\u2019s a great level I don\u2019t think it stands head and shoulds above the rest, and it isn\u2019t even my favorite (that would either be Lungfishopolis or Waterloo World). And what I saw as slightness back then, I now see as a light touch, an excellent genre ode that is full of delightful characters who are fun to spend time with.\n\nPsychonauts isn\u2019t a game that needed a sequel\u2014a last-minute cliffhanger aside, it\u2019s wonderfully self-contained and does everything it needs to\u2014but it certainly deserved one, and I\u2019m heartened it found a bigger audience in the years after its release.", "timestamp_created": 1655759260, "timestamp_updated": 1655759260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626713693141937256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117252845": {"recommendationid": "117252845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198439098493", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1324, "last_played": 1653782068}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es tan interesante cada elemento del juego.

It should be obvious that the graphics have aged here. Characters look weird because of their low-poly models and cutscenes are blurred. Some of the in-game scenes might not look as blurry, but they still aren't as sharp as in recent games. That being said, I liked the game's theme. Dungeons feel unique since you are exploring a person's mind instead of a natural environment. Expect to see surreal and bizarre occurrences that are caused by the chaos in the person's mind.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story follows Raz, a boy that runs from his home to learn how to use his psychic powers in a summer camp. You'll get to know other people who are joining the camp, whether it's about their love interests or hobbies. Everyone is carefully designed, giving details to their character from your conversations or their personalities. That being said, the details are as shallow as they can be; you can see that they only have one thing in their mind, and that's what's good about it. The game never forgets to make a cutscene that showcases this trait.\n\nThe main story is unpredictable. Besides the predictable part when you have to explore someone's mind in the end, the story never has a set goal except for Raz to learn as much power as he can before his time at the camp ends. The story isn't revolved to keep the story mysterious for a twist, but it's still fun to see the interaction between the characters. It's a kind of story that will get you immersed because you enjoy the worldbuilding so much, especially because of how silly the characters are.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAs I said before, the game is a mix of adventure and precision platformer. You can explore the camping grounds, traversing through the platforming sections with your psychic ability to get the collectibles. The game is also a part collecthathon, forcing you to collect a lot of objects, both in the real world and in the mental world, to increase your psychic skills. You'll explore a lot of dungeons, all with a unique theme, where you have to follow the rules to finish. Although most of them are as straightforward as clearing the dungeon, others can be more unique, requiring you to either collect certain key items, move a pawn in a board, and others.\n\nPlatforming sections are tricky. You need to do acrobatic skills like walking on a rope and using a trapeze to jump. The thing is, it's hard to measure the depth between the rope and your position, making it hard to figure out where you need to land. You need to do trial and error several times to figure out how to jump properly, and this can cause another problem when you are pressed with time or had a long way back up if you fail the jump. As for the trapeze, it can take a while before you figure out how to use them effectively - I thought that I only need to hold a key in one direction to gain momentum, but it turns out that you need to move back and forth to do so. Moreover, jumping also can be tricky in some places. There are many times when you can't do a double jump if you are not doing it fast enough. Although it doesn't cause many issues in earlier dungeons, the very last dungeon becomes so problematic to finish because of them, especially since you need to traverse the area within a time limit.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2345562054\n\nCollectibles are abundant. Some might even be placed in the trickiest places that you can imagine, requiring you to utilize your platforming skills. You'll need to redo some areas several times to get some collectibles, but it will be worth it in the end, especially since it will reward you with upgrades. To be honest, I don't think I will be able to finish the last dungeon without some upgrades.\n\nBoss fights are unique. As you can see, each dungeon has a unique theme that is related to what the target cares about. Someone obsessed with art will have a gallery-themed world, while someone obsessed with a party will also have a party in their mind, and the same also applies to boss fights. Unlike other games, you don't have to spam your attack button to hit the enemy - you need to figure out how to beat them first. This will use your psychic powers somehow, both direct and indirect. You might need to fly to a certain place that allows you to beat the boss, or throw an object to hurt them directly. Each boss has a different weak point to exploit, so you need to learn their weakness as soon as you can. However, the game won't give any hints to beat them save for a few bosses, and you might get stuck in a boss fight if you don't figure out a way to hurt them soon.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2814448390\n\n[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]\nI finished the game in 24.7h, but I admit that I left the game open from time to time since I was also doing other tasks. The game has some annoying platforming sections, one that requires you to retry the same areas over and over if you fail. The thing is, you won't respawn in the same area as where you died - instead, you'll respawn in a certain checkpoint. There is a chance that you need to redo some areas that you have cleared several times because you didn't manage to finish the next one.\n\n[b]Others[/b]\nThe camera movement is annoying in the last dungeon. The game will rotate the camera around automatically, and this might happen when you are jumping, making it easy to fall on the ground.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAlthough the graphics have aged, [b]Psychonauts[/b] is still enjoyable as it is. The concept of exploring human minds is unique, and boss fights always feel different due to their theme. The platforming section might need some work, especially on the camera and mechanics, but it's good enough as it is. If you like adventure games with platforming elements and want to try out new things, be sure to play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1654426474, "timestamp_updated": 1655230414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786119818687438965", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116513785": {"recommendationid": "116513785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029082033", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1391, "last_played": 1654417625}, "language": "english", "review": "Spectacular game.

My biggest complain honestly is wanting more content so now I'm heavily debating buying Psychonauts 2 whenever it goes on sale or even buying game pass ultimate for a month to play it.\n\nAs far as common sentiments in negative reviews, I generally disagree. First, for a 17 year old game, it looks pretty good - especially the character models (the only time you really notice low definition is during cutscenes and some terrain, from my experience). And while it does have issues sometimes picking up a controller, it usually works on the second try if you don't touch your keyboard/mouse and have a controller config for steam (or I assume use big picture mode) when I tried it. And yes while there are some annoyances here and there with the game letting you know some information or certain areas registration, they are all minor and generally unnoticeable.

is a masterpiece of 3D platforming, and is an instant recommendation for me.\n\nHowever, it is not in a playable state on Linux. Attempting to use Proton compatibility layers causes the boot-up logo screens to bug out, forcing the game to be exited. The native version is smooth for 95% of the game--but it is the other 5% that I have a problem with. The game starts in a windowed mode, does not accept controller input normally, and when trying to make it full-screen, does not have the cursor's position line up with what the cursor is selecting, resulting in a guessing game of where the cursor needs to be to select something in the options. The game grinds to a halt when it has to render in footsteps on snow, sand, etc., which makes the first level's portion which features snow incredibly slow. (An observation about this is that sometimes the graphics would glitch out and create a wide square of footprint patterns, which ironically solves the problem of the footsteps). This makes the soldier-killing and tank-approaching sections very tedious. The final boss is completely unplayable, as it literally progresses at about 1 frame per second, even when the graphical quality is at its lowest setting. I can run Ori and the Will of the Wisps on this computer at 1080p 120fps with no problems, yet a game made 16 years ago can't stop chugging in certain sections of the game.\n\nI had to watch the final part of this game on YouTube, which is never something that I want to have to do. Fortunately, this game was $1 on sale and I think that I did in fact get more than my money's worth, even if I had bought it at the full $10. That being said, a game which is supposed to \"perform well\" on the Steam Deck and isn't Verified only because of some icons not being exact, should be performing just fine on a computer and system designed for gaming. \n\nPlease implement a fix for this, or please state somewhere that this game is not yet ready for a full Linux experience.\n\nEdit: Psychonauts 2 runs perfectly on my Linux setup using Proton v8--not even a single frame drop or stutter anywhere!

And Psychonauts is a fucking ass video game. I can not in good conscience suggest Psychonauts to anyone without some serious caveats \n\nFirst, the GOOD:\n\nPsychonauts visuals and style are the forefront and man are they really the best part of this game. The varied environments of people\u2019s mindscapes, from a men in black riddled suburbia to a neon fluorescent Spanish decorated street front, every single mind you step into as a psychonaut is visual bliss. Some are stronger than others in their presentation but it's undeniable the amount of effort and charm put into these environments to not only make them functional but also interesting to look at and play in. Each environment or I guess \u201clevel\u201d lends it self so well to the inclusion of gameplay because while it may be slightly varied from what previously was faced, its almost always utilizing something unique to that person\u2019s psyche. Its fun.\n\nStory too. Surprisingly enough, I found the writing to be a serious highlight. It never felt forced or like it was trying to make me laugh. It always managed to surprise me in the weirdest ways. WHether it was idle dialogue from fellow campers or Rasputin spouting some of his rambling nonsense when he found a clue or got confused. Little stuff that managed to charm me enough to care about the characters and what was going on.\n\nNow the BAD, and the UGLY:\n\nPsychonauts to its very core is an extremely clunky game. I chose to use a controller for ym play through. SO often i found myself glitching out on geometry during platforming, or getting just too high up on a pole to get shot off and have to climb all the way back up. Or maybe I'd be climbing on a  wall and the game wouldn\u2019t let me prompt a double jump so I fell down however far just to redo a heaping sshit ton of platforming and climbing i just barely managed to scrape by 15 minutes ago. Other times because of the lack of guidance (which was actually mostly welcome) I had ZERO CLUE where I was meant to go, and either had to look up a fucking IGN tutorial (yuck) or finesse my  way over an obstacle by way of elaborate parkour, that I know for certain was not the way i was meant to progress! Combat too was an anomaly. I know that it was mostly my end but combat behaves in such a weird clunky and bad way. One trigger is meant to lock on while the other lets you shoot or use an ability, but so often i\u2019d be just out of reach of what i wanted to hit the game wouldn\u2019t lock on and instead turn my camera so i\u2019m facing the other way!?? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more i\u2019ve forgotten to mention here but that\u2019s just a handful of stuff that really got me cleaving for the gun in my drawer.\n\nPsychonauts is a really tough game to love, and I'm sure the ones who do are honest fans who can overlook the flaws and enjoy a fun time in an interesting universe. As for me, as much as i enjoyed it, there was just too much that ruined the experience for me. And with the sequel getting such great reviews and not requiring a pass on this game to understand, AND a serious visual uplift taboot, I\u2019d have to say for this game, you should absolutely pass it up for the sequel.\n", "timestamp_created": 1653189854, "timestamp_updated": 1653189854, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115796732": {"recommendationid": "115796732", "author": {"steamid": "76561199106636217", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1473, "last_played": 1653150941}, "language": "english", "review": "Just as good as the first time I played it.", "timestamp_created": 1653151033, "timestamp_updated": 1653151033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115748985": {"recommendationid": "115748985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063624929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 1128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1128, "last_played": 1630532241}, "language": "english", "review": "You know this game got popular after the sequel came out.

The humour is a bit old-school and might not be everyone's cup of tea, but the general tone is witty at least and never goes too low. Some of the collectables might be annoying to find if you want to complete the game 100%, plus there are some secret achievements that are unlocked by doing stuff that probably no sane person would ever think about, but I've seen much worse.

The cartoony aesthetics keep the graphics from getting too dated, though you can definitely tell it's an older game.  \n\nThe music is just as fantastic as I remember it being.  I especially love the Meat Circus theme.  If you like Danny Elfman/Star Wars type music you will probably enjoy this.  \n\nThe best part of the game is the writing.  While the overall story is pretty simple, the stories you uncover inside each levels are great, especially the one involving the Milkman character.  While Psychonauts is meant to be a humorous game,  it does delve into darker areas at times.  The blend of these moods is what makes the story so appealing.  \n\nThe level design is some of the most creative I've ever seen.  Each one really emphasizes the personalities of the characters' minds you enter.  \n\nThe gameplay is decent enough to be enjoyable, but it does have some problems.  For starters, telekinesis can be a pain to use sometimes, so most of the time I would stick with PSI blast if I could get away with it.  Sliding on rails is also clunky because I've gotten stuck a couple of times and it's easy to fall to your death when that happens.  The powers are mostly useful, though there are a few that are situational.  Lastly, there is a lot of collecting to do, and while I enjoy that, some of the figments can be a real ball ache to collect because they blend into the scenery and are in difficult to reach areas.  \n\nI also ran into a save breaking bug.  I sped through the dialogue through the first shooting level and I ended up breaking progression and resetting didn't fix it.  I also got stuck into a wall once.  At least I didn't have any crashing issues.  \n\nThe difficulty isn't too hard.  I'd say it's one of the easier platformers out there, but it's still enjoyable for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  \n\nThis game totally deserves to be a classic and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1652605037, "timestamp_updated": 1652605037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115480896": {"recommendationid": "115480896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402471451", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1475, "last_played": 1652830438}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolute treat from start to finish.

It well.. Started & I was immediately met with a 800x600 resolution. With that said the game is 17yrs old+, so that's not really a problem. The problem is that my mouse literally could not select options in the menu even if hovering directly over them & I had to do some hovering voodoo to get get what I wanted highlighted which was like a solid 15-30min already.\n\nI get 2160p enabled & from that point things work within a tolerable range, menu icons still have issues highlighting, but the menu scaled relatively & thus no voodoo was required. It did detect controller inputs, but that was the least of my worries. [b]Said button prompts were pretty ancient using only numbers instead of Standard ABXY[/b]. So I spent time configuring the setup to what seemed appropriate for the game.\n\n[h1]Extra 15-25min.[/h1]\n\nCool, I play through to the training camp where they teach you how to play the game, Button prompts don't even show in the numbers of old you just configured, they still show the key bindings. Regardless I made a discovery & that is that R2/RightTriggger is not binned to anything to my limited knowledge & if you try to assign it a key or use it while the program is open, you'll encounter [b]a dreaded camera angle bug where it will act as if you are inputting the camera in any which or one specific direction hindering gameplay & making the game unplayable imo.[/b]\n\nI start troubleshooting accordingly & long behold.. I'm actually using the Linux Native version of the game. Wow, I see why Valve originally did not care to test Linux builds for games. The experience varies and can often depending on the game, [b]offer subpar quality compared to using the .exe + Proton.[/b]\n\nSwitching over to Proton Experimental solved Menu issues, so now using my key/mouse requires zero thought, just do.\n\n[h1]Cloud Saves do not automatically work with the Linux Build of Psychonauts[/h1]\n\nI'm actually dumbfounded by this one, maybe they use different ways to save the game, this is a Linux build from 2005, but Steam didn't even try to save the file. [b]I'm actually speechless[/b], I either don't know enough to form an opinion or Valve just didn't offer Cloud Saves for that particular build for some reason. I did have space for the save but it showed as 0 kbp written despite .04 kbps being available.\n\n[h1] Controller is not detected with Proton [/h1]\n\nThe icing on the cake.\n\nOn-top of not having my save files so I have to start from scratch(I barely finished training, so not a big deal), redo all of my settings & then [b]I have to manually EDIT my controller layout to effectively use Keyboard Inputs[/b], when I barely have any idea of a good profile for the game due to its out of date button prompts.\n\n[h1]DoubleFine should just remake Psychonauts & pull this version.[/h1]\n\nWith them investing so much in Psychonauts 2 & the success it has been, i'm shocked they haven't atleast considered it; publicly.\n\nSo yeah my first 2hrs have been me basically setting up the game. This review does not reflect on the game's story, merely flaws in it's Linux/Windows builds for Proton users.\n\n[b]TL;DR / / If you're using the Linux build do NOT press R2/RightTrigger, you know what. Outright abandon the Linux Build and just use Proton Experimental, it's more reliable. If you do use proton, you'll need to setup a custom controller config to the key bindings if your controller is not detected in-game.[/b]\n\n[b]I'll probably release a Community Controller Layout, and call it \"Unplayable Psychonauts: Controller Fix\". Because honestly trying to run this game was more trouble than it was worth.[/b]\n\nI'm sure it's a fine game, but this basically robbed me of my time before work, spent [b]basically not having fun.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1651832026, "timestamp_updated": 1651832147, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534969568252563477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115022126": {"recommendationid": "115022126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062038911", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 732, "last_played": 1652238153}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me tell you this story.

"review": "Is this a perfect game? No\u2014 there are many flaws. However, the idea, the pure essence of the game is so endearing and well executed, that I think it's worth looking past its issues.\n\n[b]So, why is it a good game?[/b]\n\n Maneuverability is [i]very[/i] fun. The levitation power carries the gameplay hands down. You basically get a ball that rolls on slopes, increases your jump height, and allows you to glide; this drastically changes the pace of the game, and allows you to experiment and zoom through many sections of the game.\n\nMany games have very generic areas, where it's a forest, maybe some plains, a castle. Psychonauts just goes wild; each level is a character's mind, and not everyone is mentally stable. So what happens when you have a man whose lost his mind and is battling whether he thinks he's Napoleon or not? You end up playing as a piece in Catan, fighting for this guy's sanity. It's less the moment to moment gameplay that stands out, but the thematic storytelling that really sells all of the locations.\n\nThe overall style of the game is also very nice; the artstyle complements the humor, and it's good enough to delve into mental health while staying humorous but (sometimes) serious.\n\n[b]So what sucks?[/b] The grind for currency at one point to actually progress, the boss sequences (especially the ending) feel off, the lack of common sense in some puzzles, the bland hub world, and the bore of completionism,\n\nThe puzzle design in Psychonauts is a bit all over the place. For example, there's a puzzle that requires you to look through the bird's view, and then go through a tiny gate so that another gate will open. Is there any indication that that's what you're supposed to do? No. There [i]is[/i] a tip system included in the game, which comes in handy, but it feels bad when you don't even see how it makes much sense.\n\nThe hub world is lackluster; you're jumping into these awesome levels that are super unique... and then you're in a forest with one real building that's just a log cabin. It feels disconnected in a way that threw me off early in the game; don't expect the kind of exploration in the hub to be much like the levels, because they are quite different in how they functionally play.\n\nFor completionists, there are many missable achievements and collectibles. You definitely need a guide to make sure you don't miss anything in the game. Along with that, there are many \"figments\" or pictures in every level (100-200) that are just scattered absolutely everywhere, and there's so little reward/guidance that it never felt good collecting. \n\nIf you can, definitely play this game with a controller. I played with keyboard and mouse, and it was kinda difficult to use not because it was non functional, but because it just felt slightly off\u2014 it certainly was not designed for it.\n\n[b]So, should you play Psychonauts?[/b] If you like platformers, yes.

It's story, characters and gameplay are so unique that it's hard to compare it to any other game. Psychonauts came out around the time where platformers were still a huge genre and at the I ignored this game because of that. Barring Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie and maybe a few others the platforming genre was one that became almost instantly stale; boring collect a-thons, lame anthropomorphic characters, jarring color palates and storylines seemingly taken from children's cartoons (which I guess makes sense since these games were aimed at children). But Psychonauts has a more serious (and sometimes funny) story that deals with mental illness, super unique and varied worlds to explore and collecting thats more reigned in.\n\nIt's not perfect of course, some of platforming (Meat Circus) is really dated and had me frustrated but it's nothing that brings the game down overall. I was able to 100% this game and enjoy it throughout.\n\nSo if anyone reading this is on the fence about whether to get the game I say take the plunge, it's well, well worth it!", "timestamp_created": 1650159285, "timestamp_updated": 1650159285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567196428775787354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113977714": {"recommendationid": "113977714", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089135080", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1664506375}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegaaaazo!!!", "timestamp_created": 1650152254, "timestamp_updated": 1650152254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113977442": {"recommendationid": "113977442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053481801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 857, "last_played": 1577169686}, "language": "english", "review": "peak SOVL", "timestamp_created": 1650151757, "timestamp_updated": 1650151757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113949644": {"recommendationid": "113949644", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962295522", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1012, "last_played": 1649172036}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that both have aged well, and not aged well.\nThe story overall might not shock you, but the writing, dialogue and creativity at display is the very best you can get.

Utilizing psychic powers to plunge into crazed minds and solve their mental traumas, this game is a dark children's game with a lot of nostalgia to offer older players too. A progressive power-up system tied to collectibles rewards explorative and repeat play, while the zany cast and striking design will keep you pining for more. The game does have some weaker levels and aged graphics, but if you're in the mood to try an indie classic than check this out.\n\nYou play as Raz, a young prodigy attending a summer camp to train kids in the basics of psychic warfare, in the hopes of becoming a titular Psychonaut. To do so, Raz must earn merit badges demonstrating his skill in an array of psychic abilities useful to combat and mobility. All the while, he must get to know a quirky cast of fellow campers and adult teachers, all the while uncovering a sinister conspiracy underfoot at the camp...\n\n[i]Psychonauts[/i] brims with delightful, chaotic energy. The game's looks apply Tim Burton's aesthetic to different classic dark cartoons like [i]Invader Zim[/i] or [i]The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy[/i], and the writing follows in that stead. This title plays out like a kid's cartoon, complete with simple dialogue, inscrutable adult characters, and basic humor you'd find in any Nicktoon - it just so happens that the premise twists all of that into a unintentional self-parody of the genre that adult players may find nostalgic amusement within.\n\nGameplay largely consists of platforming, with some minor combat and exploration elements. Each \"level\" involves delving into a character's mind, with the enemies and obstacles all representations of their psychological trauma. Raz can employ additional psychic powers that he learns over time to help overcome obstacles, and often there are multiple paths forward allowing for mandatory or optional abilities to be used, ensuring players who invest time to power themselves up feel rewarded. Levels also contain a ton of collectibles, each important either by providing opportunities to share backstories or further upgrade the player, greatly incentivizing careful exploration and multiple replays.\n\n[i]Psychonauts[/i] does show its age in a few places. The graphics are closer to [i]Super Mario 64[/i] than modern AAA standard, though it does help the game feel in place with its generation of animated works like [i]Monster House[/i]. The many powers available to use can also at times leave players unsure of how to proceed through the game's puzzling levels - some particularly combine this with tight, unforgiving platforming to make for an annoying experience (lookin' at you, a certain history-themed level). Fortunately the good outweighs the bad of the levels, and there are a number in here that make for iconic, memorable experiences.\n\nThis game permeates with what I can best describe as an aura of \"carnival madness.\" The variety of levels and themes at play makes this a worthwhile purchase alone, though the simple-yet-clever writing really seals the deal.

I am amazed by what I found out. I can't properly describe how great this one is. \n\n-The whole premise is original and the game pushes it as much as it can. What starts fairly straightforward unfolds into several twist and turns that engage you from the go.\n-The graphics are weird but don't fall into \"ugly\" territory. It even makes some of the mind sequences memorable. It's unique in a very good way\n-The characters and dialogue are great. There's a case to say that, if you don't divert from the main path you won't interact with some of them and you won't really care for them by the end but if you stop in between missions and walk around to meet them you'll get good conversations and laughs out of them\n-The combat and powerups are on point. You're never overpowered and you'll find usage for everything in your arsenal\n-The approach to the mental issues some of the characters have is incredible. Trauma, nightmares, personality disorder... Every mind you visit is unique but has layers of secrets and privacy that makes you rethink everything you're seeing and what you thought about the people they belong to. There's a \"cute\" feeling towards the graphics but some of the things you discover can get quite dark\n-All the levels are original and fantastic. No two of them are the same and some, like the Milkman level, will stay with you for one reason or another\n\nThe only complain that I'll say about the game is that I'm not a fan of the camera. It's one of those that's mostly very close to your back and I prefer it to be a little farther away to better see my surroundings. In some specific parts where there's some precise platforming I got frustrated a couple of times but overall doesn't hurt the whole experience\n\nAll in all I'm speechless about this one. Probably the best gaming experience I've had this year so far\n", "timestamp_created": 1647825476, "timestamp_updated": 1647825476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112566726": {"recommendationid": "112566726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165338304", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 393, "last_played": 1649715246}, "language": "english", "review": "its like im an astronaut but with brains", "timestamp_created": 1647818031, "timestamp_updated": 1647818031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661330044269561768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112565953": {"recommendationid": "112565953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208835136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1647816553}, "language": "english", "review": "No.", "timestamp_created": 1647816699, "timestamp_updated": 1647816699, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427135676145553589", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112500473": {"recommendationid": "112500473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312078727", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 784, "last_played": 1647327819}, "language": "english", "review": "Psychonauts has imaginative level concepts for a genre that is usually content with recycled level themes, but the movement and platforming controls are clunky - even for a game of its vintage.

Now instead of throwing you into a menu where each level was someone's mind, you are put into a learning environment where you are trained on how to be a [i]Psychonaut[/i] and you enter people's minds by going to them in the real world and affixing a mini-door (the Psycho-Portal) on their forehead.\n\nInstead of upgrading your abilities via a Skill Tree, you have a Skill Wheel where distinct powers can be added to your kit in the form of [i]Merit Badges[/i] like in Scouts. You earn these merit badges by completing each of the training courses, or by an overly complicated procedure of: [i]ranking up by collecting figments and cobwebs inside minds, collecting spinning cards and arrowheads from the real world, spending arrowheads to buy PSI cores in the camp lodge, then traveling to Ford's lair and using both machines at the bottom that serve the same purpose...[/i] and every couple of ranks, you get New Skills and upgrades to pre-existing skills just to avoid a skill tree.\n\nIn terms of platforming, there is:\n\n[list]\n    [*]Gliding from Breath of the Wild (the Levitation Balloon)\n    [*]Ground Pound from Mario but with splash damage (Melee after a jump)\n    [*]Double Jump to correct false distance judgement (Base Kit)\n    [*]Moon Gravity Jumps (the Levitation Ball)\n    [*]Climbing, Swinging, and Rail Grinding.\n[/list]\n\nHowever, there is clunk. For example, the rails can't properly figure out gravity and start pushing you randomly to either side. You just lose your grip randomly while climbing poles, swinging beams, grinding rails, etc and either fall off or start clipping awkwardly as you spam your jump button in order to fix it. \n\nThe collectibles are very loosely tied to the core of the game. Figments are just supposed to be expressions that you'd perform whilst in the place it's meant to be collected (like a person climbing a ladder or playing music on stage) but these act more like guiding lines similar to the coins in Mario to show what way you need to go. Mental Cobwebs were honestly unnecessary and just gives you a purpose to revisit older levels after unlocking the 'Cobweb Duster' later down the line after grinding for Arrowheads by button mashing with a Dowsing Rod (another over-complicated system that just takes the focus out of the interesting part of the game (inside minds) and makes you waste time in the real world/ camp. So many collectibles are flat, you don't know how to get them properly cause they're literally invisible when viewed from the side especially since they're translucent too. The only good collectibles are the [b]Vaults[/b] because they show a summary of a person's happy moments and their divulgement into troubles in the form of caricature sketches.\n\nThe game makes you feel smart for playing it, unlike other brain-numbing games like Borderlands, and it does it without making the puzzles complex at all. When solving a puzzle, it emulates a feeling as if you've identified the crux of a person's mental issue and could relate to it in its creative expression. The art style may seem like an excuse for making imperfect models, but it fits the 'Caricature Nature' of it very well.\nMobility and offense aren't the only part of your kit because you also have puzzle-solving-centric abilities. But even though they work on a wide range of NPCs, they aren't as fleshed out as I thought they'd be (Invisibilty, Clairvoyance, Confusion, and Telekinesis)\n\nAgent Cruller's bacon guides are useful and the fast travel system is super convenient because there's always a log when you need one.\nit was not as painful to play as other older games like Half-Life as I did in the past because of its forward-thinking design.\n\nI had trouble setting up my controller cause Steam Input wouldn't work from the get-go and kept detecting my keyboard as the primary input which the game kept defaulting to. There's a long opening cutscene and you can't change settings or resolution until then. The switch from QHD 160fps in-game graphics to SD 30fps cutscenes is quite jarring but at least they are in widescreen I guess... Flipping the camera makes the right joystick inverted in menu/selection wheels too (the left joystick is fine though).\n\n[spoiler]When we normally enter someone's mind, we have to face censors that fight back against things that aren't supposed to be there, to prevent the mind from going into insanity or having weird thoughts. But in Boyd Cooper's mind, we see a complete lack of censors because his mind has been twisted by society and has placed him into a conspiracy-head, and the censors in his mind are fighting against himself to keep itself sane.[/spoiler] Some of the other levels I liked were [spoiler]Sasha's Shooting Gallery, Black Velvetopia, and Waterloo World[/spoiler] Unlike other levels, the collectibles actually helped me find the right path than disturb me.", "timestamp_created": 1645912787, "timestamp_updated": 1645912787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111097168": {"recommendationid": "111097168", "author": {"steamid": "76561199176352682", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4281, "last_played": 1680465061}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my favorite games of all time.

It works quite well on PC, and scales up to higher resolutions quite well - though the cutscenes and user-interface elements don't scale as well, it works.\n\nYou follow Razputin - a boy who ran away from the circus in order to fulfill his dream of becoming a Psychonaut. He arrives as a camp for gifted psychic children, which doubles as a recruiting place for the Psychonauts themselves. The Psychonauts fight with the power of psychic powers, using them to dive into the minds of others or to defeat them more conventionally.\n\nThe game therefore follows you as you basically explore the minds of a number of interesting cast members. You defeat their inner demons, and through that learn a great deal about the characters. Each world is unique and has unique mechanics, and the voice acting and characters are all very charming and fun.\n\nThe core gameplay is a platformer puzzler. Every boss and every area has puzzles that you must figure out to progress, and you gain new psychic powers - useful in specific ways - as you progress in the game. Strong enemies for example might be easily defeated by lighting them on fire, while the shield you gain later in the game can protect you from otherwise impossible to dodge abilities. The puzzles and such are not extremely difficult, but are challenging and fun - so definitely still engaging.\n\nIt took me around 11 hours to beat, and I ended at level 75 of about 100. If I wanted to 100% complete it, I probably would have needed about 15 hours and to have taken a bit more time to get all of the collectibles and such.

The last time I completed this game was a good...10 years ago, or something along those lines. I struggled with a few of the bosses and mechanics, however I'm not sure if that's just because I was \"bad\" at games when I played it initially.\n\nWith the release of Psychonauts 2 - the re-awakening of this fandom & the first game itself has been awesome. \n\nThis game - the first Psychonauts - has so much personality that even the few janky controls and weird boss mechanics makes you come crawling back for more. The characters are all so charming and funny! The story for the game itself is a little weak at times, more of just a \"go here, do this, do that\" especially on your first play-through if you aren't focusing on collectables.\n\nThe game is, and I continue to say this to this day, one of my favourite single player story games. It's dated, it's a little ugly, but the graphics work due to the heavy stylisation put into designs (characters, atmosphere, level) which I personally find to be a really interesting style. \n\nThe visuals are gorgeous. I remember just running around in Black Velvetopia for hours on end just soaking in the colours and sounds & mechanics. Not ONLY are the visuals gorgeous, but so is the soundtrack and sound design itself! It's so..fun! Unique! It fits the game PERFECTLY. I CONSTANTLY have the campgrounds theme going on in my head.\n\nI would definitely say this game is harder than the second one, if anyone is coming here from there, but it's mostly due to the more outdated and janky mechanics.

Considered an underrated gem, Psychonauts delivers a unique experience for players while retaining many aspects of what make 3-D platformers fun.  While I agree with the notion that the game is underrated, I also believe that the game receives slightly more praise than it deserves. Let me break it down.\n\nStory: 8/10\n\nStory is simple, which is a good thing for this game. Not gonna spoil anything, but it has a lot of funny moments and quirky scenarios. The game understands itself well and knows that it doesn't need an intricate plot to provide an enjoyable tale to the player. The writing is probably the best part of the game, having some really crazy moments. \n\nGraphics: 8/10\n\nConsidering this came out in the PS2 era, the game's graphics are obviously outdated by today's standards. However, the art design behind the game is excellent and really fits the weird aesthetic the game delivers. During gameplay, the graphics are crisp and retain their cartoon-ish charm. Unfortunately, cutscenes are horribly rendered and look blurry, grainy and very unappealing at times. Other than this, the levels are colorful and creative, while the characters are funny and their looks fit their personality. I believe the game could have looked slightly better considering how small the game is, but overall, the graphics are great. \n\nGameplay: 7/10\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Psychonauts is generally fun. There are many abilities and skills that you learn throughout the course of the game. You level up and gain new power-ups for your moves, giving you somewhat of a sense of character development. There are plenty of collectibles scattered around the map and some require certain moves to acquire them, much like Zelda games. Unfortunately, most of the moves are useless and you will probably only use the same 2 or 3 for the whole game. Another issue I have with the gameplay is just how clunky the platforming feels. Jumps feel delayed, and the lock-on feature is useless most of the time due to Raz's slow dodges. Some segments of the game can be quite annoying because of the inconsistencies in jumping and swinging. Luckily, with a bit of practice, it can be quite manageable. Another gripe about gameplay is the lack of information the games gives you about what you're supposed to do or where to go. There were many instances where I found myself wandering the map for a long time trying to find my next objective. There is a lot of trial and error, especially with certain bosses. The most annoying part of the game is the need to collect a currency called arrowheads to progress in one of the levels. I had 100 arrowheads by the time I realized that the game wanted me to buy an item for 800 before I could proceed. But the worst part was that I had to spend my 100 arrowheads to buy a different item that would let me find more arrowheads to then be able to buy the item I needed to continue the story. I actually almost uninstalled the game because it's ridiculous that I would have to stop what I'm doing, leave the level, and go on a crusade for 30 minutes finding more arrowheads. This happens again in another level where you have to buy paintings to continue the story. This was a horrible design choice since it ruins the flow of the game and wastes time. Overall, the gameplay is okay and can occasionally be fun but definitely expect to be lost and possibly looking at FAQ's to find out what to do. \n\nSound: 9/10\n\nSounds are fantastic! Music is great, sound effects really suit the vibe of the game and the voice acting... is...AMAZING. Never expected such high quality voice acting in a game so old. Every single character is perfectly portrayed with excellent delivery from the voice actors. The only reason I'm giving it a 9/10 is because, for some reason, the game's audio stutters whenever I used headphones -- so I had to play using my computer's speakers. This is just my experience so I'm not sure if others share the same problem. \n\n\nControls: 7.5/10\n\nControls are relatively fine. Moving around isn't too much of an issue since it plays much like most games of its kind. However, the UI is really annoying. Selecting the map, items and collectibles is extremely cumbersome and takes more time than it needs to. Having a collectible equipped doesn't let you interact with anything and the button layout for moves is somewhat awkward. Not much more to say here. \n\nVerdict: 8\n\nPsychonauts is an enjoyable game for hardcore fans and casual gamers alike. While it doesn't come close to matching the quality and prestige of other titles of the same genre, it does retain a unique identity and a creative world that manages to remain original in its concept. Despite its many problems with the gameplay, the game still provides a fun adventure that is worth playing, even if it's just for a few hours.", "timestamp_created": 1644215121, "timestamp_updated":

fallo, y tambien tiene algo de humor negro, aunque no es lo habitual en este juego.\nEn cuanto al gameplay, es bastante comodo de manejar, y las habilidades psiquicas son bien aprovechadas, dando habilidades variadas que te permiten jugar de varias maneras, tambien tienes a tu disposicion algunas herramientas que te ayudaran en tu aventura.\nLos coleccionables van repartidos por mapa, y aunque puede parecer que ser\u00e1 dificil encontrarlos todos, como cegato profesional que soy les puedo asegurar que no habra muchos problemas, aunque si habr\u00e1 alguno muy pu\u00f1etero.\nPor la parte de los graficos, son muy buenos para su \u00e9poca, y destaca muchisimo artisticamente, teniendo mapas de dise\u00f1os muy variados e interesantes, lo cual me sorprende, ya que no cayeron en muchos cliches de los juegos cuyo escenario fuese la mente.\nLa banda sonora tambien est\u00e1 muy bien, tiene temas bastante memorables, aunque no es perfecta.\n\nLa primera aventura de Raz es sin duda una de las que considero indispensables de jugar su eres fan de los plataformeros, pero incluso sin ser fan te recomiendo mucho probarlo, ya que es un juego muy divertido de jugar y con una trama que pese a su simpleza, logra funcionar lo bastante para no aburrirte.\nRecomendado sin duda.", "timestamp_created": 1644165067, "timestamp_updated": 1644165067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny":

Not flawless, but enjoyable enough for me to WANT to play through it, instead of forcing myself to.\n\nThe opening does a lot of good jobs at once - it establishes the premise (secret agents with psychic powers), eases the player into the mood and aesthetic of the game, and even sprinkles in some foreshadowing for what's to come. \nAdmittedly, the aesthetic was pretty tricky to get used to for me at first, but I eventually learned to love it - it's basically an amazing 2000s kids media capsule, reminding me a lot of properties such as Spy Kids and Invader Zim. The game's visuals have aged considerably, a lot of models stand out as extra low poly with blurry textures, and the cutscenes are low-res beyond expectation, but the game still holds up pretty strong in the art direction departament, which makes some locations stand out even by modern standards.\nThe mood and the ambience also deserve praise. The music loops are rather short, but they seem to really try and max out the creativity to compliment whatever is currently happening (though there are some misses, the \"Basic Braining\" theme is rather tiring to listen to for example).\n\nAs a lifelong Rayman fan, I felt right at home in this package of a game. There's platforming that involves jumps, double jumps, hovering, ledge-grabbing, ladders, rope-walking and trapezium swings, and you learn most of these mechanics in the first tutorial. It felt a bit bloated and gimmicky, and I never shook the feeling off entirely, but in the end all of Raz's abilities ended up serving a thematic purpose in the plot, which is very neat and even a bit surprising.\nAs all the well-made 3D platformers do, this game includes a permanent dot shadow fixed directly under the character, helping you navigate space mid-air and know exactly where will you land, which is very helpful considering how weird movement in this game can get. Not only because you can mix and match abilities and the maps can twist and warp in numerous occassions, but also because sometimes the camera decides to become your mortal enemy.\n\nThe combat felt a bit mediocre, mostly due to major clarity issues, but that might be my \"being spoiled by Dark Souls\" talking. Clarity issues are a major flaw in the game in general - sometimes it's hard to tell what's an insignificant background element and what's not, and sometimes the game expects you to use such elements without ever easing you into the idea, so prepare to look up \"what do I do here\" a few times along the way. But maybe that's entirely my fault for under-utilizing the power of [b]Bacon[/b].\n\nIn the end, this is a great game. 7-12 hours of a solid, pretty much no-filler experience, with a very original aesthetic, pretty fresh subject matter (portraying mental health in a lighthearted, family friendly way without trivializing the issues portrayed nor making ill people the butt of the joke) and a feel good plot full of sassy characters. It can get a bit annoying at times, but most of it are just good memories in the making. Worth a buy? Yes.\n\nNow excuse while I go and play the sequel, finally armed with context.", "timestamp_created": 1643752065, "timestamp_updated": 1643752065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109254787": {"recommendationid": "109254787", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995903859", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1198, "last_played": 1643728175}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most creative games ever made.

And yet playing them usually speak otherwise, that is until it finally starts to tire you out; this is what I call the early 2000s 3D platformer effect, you have fun until the thought of playing it drains every inch of mental energy that you have. Mario Sunshine, Battle for Bikini Bottom, etc, all suffer from draining the player and not making them want more.\n\nPsychonauts is the exception to this, and is one of the few platformers that after it\u2019s over, you actively want to go back to try and finish everything. It\u2019s such a creative & wonderful game, the levels are inspired, the world is nice, and I swear this is one of the funniest games I\u2019ve ever played because it pulls no punches. \n\nAnd having a game that focuses so hard on mental issues in a delightful way is so nice. It\u2019s never too depressing, but it\u2019s never takes away from these issues with it\u2019s humor.  Not only that, part of me can relate deeply with some of these characters (*cough* Edgar *cough*) and minimal spoilers but the final bit that has you helping a character overcome deep seated trauma is so beautifully done.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect though, it takes a moment to get to the really good levels, and the final level is disappointing considering that 4 of the last 5 levels before it were masterpieces, combat is underutilized and never that great, and apart from like Raz, Sasha, and a couple other characters - the character design sucks. \n\nRegardless of all those this game is one of the best 3D platformers of all time, and my second favorite from the 2000s era (Mario Galaxy is unbeatable in my eyes haha)\n\nOn a scale of Messy Divorce to \u2018Till Death Do We Part I give this game a Happy Loving Marriage.\n\nIn other words 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1643572867, "timestamp_updated": 1643572867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552845537662506104", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109131113": {"recommendationid": "109131113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323028496", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 839, "last_played": 1643572223}, "language": "english", "review": "The indian arrowhead joke gets me every time.", "timestamp_created": 1643572302, "timestamp_updated": 1695489904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109081198": {"recommendationid": "109081198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031599084", "num_games_owned": 2093, "num_reviews": 492, "playtime_forever": 2227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1663284516}, "language": "english", "review": "[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38888018-United-Critics/] Please follow [b]United Critics[/b] for quality reviews[/url]\n\n[h1]Psychonauts Review[/h1]\nBefore I start with the review, let me save you some time, if you are not ok with outdated graphics and some game mechanics, this game is not for you.\n\nPsychonauts tells the story of Rasputin, a young psychic that wants to become a Psychonaut (a secret agent with psychic powers). The game takes place during the span of 2 days in a secret training facility that looks like a summer camp full of kids with all kinds of wacky powers and weird personalities. And that is all I will tell you, I went blind into this game and I have to say that the less you know about the lore, the more you\u2019ll enjoy it.\n\n[h1] Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it: [/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*][b]What is it exactly that you do in the game?[/b]\nIf you know about classic 3D platformers from the early 2000\u2019s, you will get what Psychonauts is all about. If not, it\u2019s basically a game mostly oriented on traversing the levels jumping and collecting all kinds of junk in order to gain or improve skills.\n\n[*][b] Will it make my eyes bleed?[/b]\nIt\u2019s a 20-year-old game, so yes\u2026 but not quite\u2026 As low quality as the textures may look for modern standards, the art style and cinematics alongside the in-game animations still hold up surprisingly well.\n\nI personally love how stylized the in-game models are. From a character design perspective, they are easily recognizable and you can tell who they are just by how they look, they did an amazing work.\n\nI\u2019m a person that thinks that graphics are the least important aspect of a game and I really don\u2019t mind old graphics, but if you are sensitive to \u201cugly\u201d graphics, you will hate this game.\n\n[*][b]Does it have a good story?[/b]\nNot really. The story is fun but predictable. The game has a huge plus in its favor: it has a ton of enjoyable characters and an amazing sense of humor.\n\nI would say that the story of the game is enjoyable but nothing fantastic.\n\n[*][b]Does it have a good soundtrack?[/b]\nThe OST helps to compliment the theme of each level very well but is not memorable or catchy. It\u2019s a decent OST that doesn\u2019t do anything special, It\u2019s like the background music in the Saturday cartoons.\n\n[*][b]Does it have replay value?[/b]\nGameplay-wise: If you want to replay the levels to pick up every single collectable, then yes. Beyond that it has no replay-ability.\n\nBut from the thematic aspect of the game, it\u2019s worth replaying this game to see all the little details that the devs put into each world and how everything connects with each other. There are so many cool little details that you can understand in a second play-through that it truly makes a revisit worth it.\n\n[*][b]Does it run well?[/b]\nYes. It does have some minor bugs and glitches, but nothing game breaking. For being a game from the early 2000\u2019s it runs flawlessly in modern systems without you needing to mod or tweak something. This is a thing that is rare among older games.\n\n[*][b]Is it fun?[/b]\nYes! This game is so funny and creative with how it implements their themes and ideas. Gameplay-wise is just another early 2000\u2019s 3D platformer, nothing bad with that, but this game shines on how the world, the characters and the subtext is presented to you.\n\nGameplay wise it's your standard 3D platformer, but thematically it\u2019s easily one of the richest and fun games that I have ever played.\n\nThe parts where the game makes you deduce what to do next having new abilities at your disposal are hands down the most enjoyable.\n\nBe aware that the last level is a glorified escort mission and it is annoying as hell, this may be a game that you will enjoy playing but not finishing.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] So what is Psychonauts?[/h1]\nThe term that I see a lot of people use for this type of game is \u201ccollectathon\u201d, for those that don\u2019t know a collectathon is a game that requires you to pick up lots of random collectables to progress the main story, usually it\u2019s a 3D platformer. Psychonauts asks you to only get some of the thousands of collectibles to finish the game with the basic set of skills, but the game becomes way easier and definitively way more enjoyable.\n\nOne of the things that really impressed me about this title has to be how it presents their themes about the mind and how it feels to be inside another person's mind. I\u2019m not going to write an in depth analysis about it here, but I would like to highlight some spoiler free concepts that may help you to understand what I mean:\n\n-There is a world halfway through the game that represents the broken mind of a crazy man, which is composed of 3 sub worlds. The first world exists inside the second world, the second world exists inside the third world and the third word exists within the first world. Besides being an amazing concept of a level to explore, it helps to reinforce how this crazy person is trapped inside his own mind.\n\n-Most levels are dedicated to explore and (most of the time) help people overcome their problems. Almost everything inside each mind is unique, including the collectables that tell you small bits of that person's life. Once you figure out what they are all about, you start to see how everything fits, it\u2019s brilliant.\n\nThe game is not perfect; the controls are where the game feels the most outdated. Some animations take too long to complete and certain elements of the levels or the design of the enemies can and will stun-lock you.\n\n[h1] Things that I like about this game:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It\u2019s an almost bug free experience. This game is so polished!\n\n[*]The boss battles are amazing\n\n[*]One of the most creative level designs that I have ever seen in a game.\n\n[*]The animations are amazing.\n\n[*]The difficulty curve is perfect.\n\n[*]The powers are fun to use and they affect gameplay in meaningful ways.\n\n[*]One of the most funny games that I have ever played. This is not hyperbole, it truly is.\n\n[*]You can skip all cinematics, be mindful that for older games this is a huge plus.\n\n[*]Works perfectly with modern OS.\n\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Things that I dislike about this game:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The platforming is a bit too stiff and updated for my taste.\n\n[*]For the most part it is not that hard, but when you hit a wall this game can be so frustrating.\n\n[/list]\n[h1] Is this game worth my hard earned money?[/h1]\nIf you came this far I assume you don\u2019t mind old and \u201cugly\u201d graphics. So if you are intro 3D platformers, or you are looking for a weird and creative game this is an easy buy. I can see why this game has a cult classic status, it\u2019s a surprisingly mature and funny experience.\n\nThis is the kind of game that everyone can enjoy, but not everyone will play.

If you missed out on collectibles it's too late, new game. The biggest issue here is that the game first establishes this camp as an open world, in-between levels area. Which on it's own is fine... until you accidentally reach a point where you can't go back? like seriously who designs a game like that? There is a way to go back to each level and retrieve those items, why not the open world part? this is so dumb it actually hurts my brain.\n\nThe hint system is an absolute joke. The hint you get is the over arching suggestion for where to go next or what you need to do. The problem is if you know you need item x to do this, but you have no idea where item x is, or how to go about it, you get 0 help.\n\nThere are a number of enemies in the game that are more tedious than anything. Most notable being the rats that explode and do a wack ton of damage, if you mess up and get hit by one, since you're disoriented, its extremely likely that they'll all damage you. It's the worst.\n\nLevel design is amazing. Each level is unique, fun, sometimes too challenging to know what to do (see earlier comment) but they all have a unique spin to the characters personality which I absolutely loved. This game has some of the most memorable moments of any platform game I've ever played. Most games lack these elements which is sad that the only thing holding this game back is some terrible decisions as I outlined above.\n", "timestamp_created": 1642985122, "timestamp_updated": 1642985122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108638401": {"recommendationid": "108638401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004865626", "num_games_owned": 776, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1642965840}, "language": "english", "review": "If you grew up on Rocko's Modern Life, KABLAM!, Invader Zim, Chowder, etc. you owe it to yourself to at least give this a try.

The problem is that it's almost perfect, but there's like a 1 out of 10 chance that your character gets stuck in some geometry, air control would feel inconsistent, double jump not working at all, or lifting yourself up from a zipline having an annoying delay. This can lead to some frustrating deaths, especially in the last parts of the game. But if you can weather through that, you'll be treated to one of the best gaming experiences that harken back to the old Nick cartoons.", "timestamp_created": 1642967014, "timestamp_updated": 1642967640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108602331": {"recommendationid": "108602331", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986187850", "num_games_owned": 2113, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1642930960}, "language": "english", "review": "The best of two worlds: A mix between a 3D platformer and the classics point-and-click adventures.\nThis game is the epitome of game design.", "timestamp_created": 1642931050, "timestamp_updated": 1642931050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108601816": {"recommendationid": "108601816", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976855149", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 267, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 100, "last_played": 1685521720}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING:  Invest in DS4Windows or similar alternative prior to playing with PS4 pad.
