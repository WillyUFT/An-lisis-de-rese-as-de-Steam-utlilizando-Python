I loved the multiple girls you could try to date, and I especially loved the multiple endings this game has to offer. It does have a lot of references to Kio's Adventure, so I found them funny and made the game a bit more enjoyable in my opinion. The art style was kinda simple but cute and I liked the comic book aspect. Some of the minigames was a pain in the butt for me (like trying to do the shooting or alien fighting ones without losing any health was hard). Just like Kio's Adventure, this game does have a lot of typos, but it does add to the humor of the game. My biggest issue with the game is the lack of a skip button (even a skip for only seen text would have been nice). A lot of my time was spent trying to quickly go through text I've seen just to find all the endings. A skip feature for text would have been very, very appreciated (and not just a skip feature for already seen endings...).\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game if you enjoy VNs/dating sims or finding multiple endings in games. It's not necessary to play Kio's Adventure first, but I do recommend playing it before doing this game just to fully understand all the Kio references.", "timestamp_created": 1591030196, "timestamp_updated": 1591030503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516587316989898682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69738033": {"recommendationid": "69738033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198990899449", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 484, "last_played": 1590342512}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good game, nothing more needs to be said.", "timestamp_created": 1590342555, "timestamp_updated": 1590342555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488740116357803345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69429717": {"recommendationid": "69429717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198407882457", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1590004617}, "language": "english", "review": "HA, THANK GOD I CANT RELATE!

In my original review, I was a bit more critical, but after playing more visual novels and dating sims then coming back and seeing what the DLC has to offer I found myself really liking it and being nostalgic for my last playthrough. \n\nSo as far as gameplay goes it does offer your standard fare visual novel choice system, but this is often quite limited. The choices you are given usually are between just two and they are few and far between, so in that way, this game is weaker than some other offerings. However, what makes up for this lack of choice is its mini-games. Unlike other visual novels, this game has a plethora of mini-games to break up the monotony and make the game actually feel like\u2026 Well, a game! The DLC did a really good job of offering a whole lot of mini-games with its storyline. Beyond the mini-games, there are also moments where the game is more akin to a point-and-click adventure. Still, I think the most impressive part is that there is a small RPG with turn-based combat and everything just built into it. This melding of gameplay elements makes each story path that much more exciting to explore and sets it above many other visual novels in my eyes.\n\nThe core of the game though is the story and writing and I must say that I think it really makes the game shine. First off, this game is funny. I chuckled out loud many times which for me means that this game was downright hilarious. I thought the cringe would be too much, but it is not too bad all things considered. I did not like the bathroom/crude humor (I have never been a fan of anything like that), but it is not excessive, so it receives a pass. As for all the different storylines, I found all of them to be compellingly written and filled with endings (both good and bad) that are worth seeing. It used to be that one of the endings was far weaker than the other two, but the DLC fixed that, though it doubles down on making that story far longer than the others which makes the other two a bit more neglected. Nonetheless, I appreciated the story and all that it had to offer. One criticism though is that because this game was not originally written in English it does have some spelling errors. It does look like that after the DLC was released they were less frequent (I only found one in my replay, it was far worse before it). I highly recommend getting to all good endings, I enjoyed them (the fantasy one is especially worth seeing). What great writing!\n\nThe sound design in this game is also pretty good. Yeah, some of the sound design feels like it is from a stock sounds collection (probably because they are), but it all works well together so I find that acceptable. What I did find that I loved though is the music, a lot of it is simple, but it plays well to the mood and setting the game is trying to enhance. The best one by far though is from the DLC and it convinced me to buy the soundtrack because I liked it enough. The song is The Otherworld Winter, and the emotion it gave me was something special, hopefully, others feel the same way. Overall, Otaku\u2019s Adventure has good sound design in my opinion.\n\nGraphically I immensely enjoyed this game\u2019s style. I swear every anime visual novel has essentially the same visual style nowadays and it is so boring. This more simplistic style fits the vibe and makes the game stand out. I could see a lot of people feeling like it seems too much like a flash game, but that doesn\u2019t matter, all that matters is that it looks good. There are plenty of times when the scenes are artistically impressive, art styles are changed slightly to change tones and add emotions, and the emotions of the characters are properly portrayed visually. All-in-all I am a fan of the look.\n\nOtaku\u2019s Adventure is worth purchasing even at full price. As a completionist, spending $9 for a game and its DLC (which you should definitely get along with the base game) that I spent just shy of 11 hours of gameplay is a good deal. Seeing as how this game has a wonderful story, a strong variety of gameplay, great music, and a style that I appreciate. So, I think I can say that I recommend paying full price for it instead of waiting for a sale. The care and creativity that this game received deserves to be rewarded. Otaku\u2019s Adventure may not be for everyone, but as far as I have played I think this is my favorite visual novel and dating sim, despite how cringe that may be.

As many other people have said getting the good endings is pretty hard and haven't gotten any of them myself but thought i'd review right now. The English subtitles are janky, hilarious and help add to the charm of the game. Overall its a pretty charming game and way more than i expected for 5 bucks.
