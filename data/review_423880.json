The game, which is essentially a prequel to [i]Carpe Diem: Reboot[/i], presents itself as a mundane slice-of-life story in which you play as Jung, [spoiler]a programmer who has created an artificial world[/spoiler], who spends the day with his \u201cperfect girl,\u201d Ai. Unfortunately, due to [spoiler]Ai being actual artificial intelligence (AI)[/spoiler], you have limited time to spend with her and can only attend 2 of the 3 locations within 1 playthrough ([spoiler]Mall + Arcade, Park + Mall, or Arcade + Park[/spoiler]) \u2013 which enforces the idea of strategically allocating your time with activities you want to do and wasting none of it on trying to do everything.\n\nRegardless of how Jung chooses to spend their day with Ai, the path chosen is ultimately irrelevant as the ending is the same: an unsurprising reveal that [spoiler]Ai is AI[/spoiler] accompanied by a lackluster explanation of [spoiler]the Turing Test[/spoiler] ([spoiler]an \u201cevaluation of a machine\u2019s ability to exhibit intelligence and whether it can act or speak like a human\u201d[/spoiler]). Somewhat shamefully, the game does itself a disservice by foreshadowing too obviously that the content will examine [spoiler]artificial intelligence and philosophy[/spoiler]; whereas if the characters had different names and players were unsuspecting than perhaps we would\u2019ve had the genuine \u201cWOW!\u201d moment that the developers seemingly hoped for. Much like other forms of art and expression, if a game needs to explain its point and purpose in the end, then it failed to convey its point and purpose throughout the game itself.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n[i]Carpe Diem[/i] is an incredibly short, free-to-play kinetic visual novel that sets the stage for [i]Carpe Diem: Reboot[/i].

You set off and get to read along to the story and advance with clicking (or enter maybe, but I don't know; I didn't test it). \n\nShortly after the gaming adventure, my story went to food, then the park. Hanging out and sharing what they've been up to since they haven't seen each other for awhile. \n\nYou get to experience a small romance (jealousy included - even if minor), the positivity and happiness of a good friendship. \n\nThe only thing left is the twist - which I can say for once actually surprised me - even with it being so obvious! My baaaad!\n\nI really enjoyed this; it was cute and pleasing for such a short game. I recommend it if you want to take a few minutes and get a story in, or just like to play visual novels!\n\nGraphics were great - I LOVED the starry sky - and the music was a nice additive.

You start this game being told to spend your time wisely. The episode begins with Arthur's friends rejoicing at Arthur being a big loser. Arthur says \"You can be a big loser too!\" and he asks the viewer a riddle: \"When is it better to be a loser than a winner?\" The rest of the episode is Arthur in a game show. At the end of the Carpe Diem the common reaction is either \"Wow\" or \"This game trolled me.\" Near the episodes' end Arthur asks if the viewer got the riddle right. The episode then ends with Arthur saying: \"I hope not, because if you did, you're watching too many game shows!\" And then the viewer remembers that Arthur said \"You can be a big loser too!\" Therefore, either way, the viewer is a big loser because either they got the riddle wrong and was a big loser in regards to the riddle (And they don't watch too many game shows) or they got it right (and they have been watching too many game shows so they are a big loser). Either way, both Arthur and Moonlit Works/Eyzi (the developer) is right and the viewer is wrong but it is good because not only does the viewer learn something but real life and reality is shown. In short, lesson learned, like it or not. Better learn the lessons than not - for they are true. That's why its called reality. I was grateful at the end of this game and I liked the ending of that episode of Arthur.

You are a character named Jung who is on a date with a girl named Ai. You could go to the mall, park or arcade. The choice is yours. [spoiler]But does it all matter since she isn't real? What are you doing with your life?[/spoiler] How will you spend your day with Ai? What will go on during your date? [spoiler]Do these questions even matter?[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\nSince this is very short, we don't really get to learn much about the characters. However, they play their part well. While all we know of Jung is that his living conditions are that well, Ai is a girl who likes spiders, is very talkative and competitive. While the title screen isn't much, I do like the clever use of the \"a\" in Carpe and the \"i\" in Diem to spell her name out. That was clever. The choices are nice, though you will have the same ending. The backgrounds look nice and the background music is good. Ai's art is good and she has a few expressions, so that's neat. [spoiler]The ending got me. I wasn't expecting it all to be a test and Ai wasn't real. It was really unexpected. I get her name was Ai which is almost the same as AI or Artificial Intelligence, but I never thought of that. Very clever, game devs. Very clever. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Negatives/Nitpicks[/h1]\n- There was no save button in sight. The only thing is a quicksave button. Even though this game is very short (for me, it was shorter than Adolescent Santa Claus, a VN I completed in 33 minutes. I took even less time with this one), it would have been nice to have it.\n- We don't get to learn much about the characters, but...\nare we supposed to?\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nCarpe Diem is a nice VN. While the characters aren't developed and the length is very short, it's fine for what it is. It's a free VN to put some free time into when you have the chance.

I mean like 10 minute short. It's a tiny game tho, so can't complain. \nSo, what is it like? \nI will try to avoid spoilers \nGood Points: \n* Game just looks good. Ai is very nicely painted, not many details, but it works! \n* Music, even tho it feels like it's very generic, I think it's actually very good for this game. Just gives that extra something to the ending.\n\n*** Plot Twist, it's not like the biggest one I've ever seen, but it hits you when you don't expect it. Many in comments say it makes them think, about life, and how they are and all that stuff... And I'm not gonna lie, I can imagine that as it's definitely a game that makes you question, \"what I'm doing with my life?\". Even tho I'm not really into VNs or anime games, or even games in general, and I'm looking for something to do during quarantine (corona lol), but it still makes me think about life. \n\nBad Points\n*Tbh, I don't think there are any... Fact that it's extremely short? Some could say that it makes them feel like a looser... but let's be honest guys... If you feel like a looser after playing this game... Than maybe you should consider a change? Cuz after all, that seems to be the whole point of this novel. Get out, enjoy life... find new hobbies. \n\nOverall?\nWell, I love it me... Good story, character is cute and etc... I guess it's hard to fuck up 10 minute game. But it's brilliant. \nI believe it can hook you into the world of VN.\n\nNow, play it... and go get a life lol", "timestamp_created": 1584983774, "timestamp_updated": 1584983774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65431069": {"recommendationid": "65431069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063142201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1588302248}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a cute little game that could more or less serve as an introduction to visual novels for people who haven't played ones before, especially being free. If you enjoyed this one and want to continue the story, Carpe Diem: Reboot tells a great story that may be enjoyed by people who liked this one.\n\n[b]Visuals[/b]:\nThe graphics are pretty nice. With the 2020 update, they add a nicer feel to the game, and make it seem a little better than it was prior.\n\n[b]Voice Acting[/b]:\nThere is no voice acting in this Vis Nov\n\n[b]Characters[/b]:\nAi is a pretty cute character, and you get to know her a little if you pay attention.\nI've seen a lot of reviews comment on this, so I figured I'd put my input on it as well. While the name 'Ai' could be read as AI, Ai is a common Japanese name meaning 'Love,' and with the little context in this game alone, could be a perfectly valid name.\n\n[b]Story[/b]:\nShort, sweet, and to the point. It follows the 'cute' theme that I noticed through the whole game.\n\n[b]Comedy[/b]:\nThere's not a whole lot of comedy, but it's played in a natural way. If you're picky about your comedy like I am, I wouldn't get this game for the comedy.\n\n[b]Music[/b]:\nIt's not fantastic, but it gets the idea across, and doesn't get annoying.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]:\nThis is a cute little vis nov that I recommend for people who are new to vis novs, kind of like a trial, or dipping your toes in.

I originally played through this game three weeks after it\u2019s initial release back in December 2015, nearly half a decade ago now. The story isn\u2019t great by any means, it has it\u2019s flaws granted but that doesn\u2019t get in the way too much of the overall story it has set out to tell, it\u2019s overtly simple and has a twist that I have still yet to see replicated elsewhere, which does give it a flavoured stroke of uniqueness. I do have to say I am terribly thankful for the 2020 update towards the art assets and music as from what I can recall each of those were positively ghastly upon release, especially when compared to most visual novels available on the market at the time. Now with the improved art assets an updated music I am much more inclined to recommend this product to others, I personally believe that this update was far too much of a long time coming in fairness however the new musical score makes it worth it as it is no longer a blight on the ears, seriously that monotonous loop every minute and a half was terrible. That being said I do have to note that the dialogue within this project is still quite dull, personally I cannot shake the feeling that the developer had never actually engaged in a conversation with a woman in his life, but this does lean in favour and actually help the main character and his goals towards the end. On top of that the dialogue options are essentially pointless and offer absolutely no sense of proper replayability to the table which is a shame in and of itself realistically speaking. It is to my understanding that the reason for this to an extent is due to the fact that this story is a prologue of sorts, which at the time of writing I have yet to play, so I can\u2019t say anything about it\u2019s relations towards its sequel of sorts I am sorry to say. All in all I really liked this game, this is mostly due to that 2020 update the devs decided to give it in fairness, but being a veteran of sorts to this genre I can say the uniqueness is also a factor into my initial settlement on a recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1580889763, "timestamp_updated": 1580889763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594262301921844482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62988990": {"recommendationid": "62988990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359673053", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1493, "last_played": 1625353276}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego tranquilo y pasivo que te relajar\u00e1, tiene un hermoso final que concuerda a la perfecci\u00f3n con el nombre del juego, 100% recomendado para relajarse un rato.", "timestamp_created": 1580872273, "timestamp_updated": 1580872273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62639826": {"recommendationid": "62639826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201495963", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1688189639}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet.

melancolica ya que me parecio agradable y divertida, debo decir que me encari\u00f1e con el personaje de Ai y pues cuando vi el final que bueno mejor no lo cuento ya que no dare spoilers de esta gran

It has its flaws, (forced feel to the story, a little linear at times and only truly free and sandboxy when you complete the game, and this is most definitely the game I've had the most trouble launching as it freezes a lot on startup with discord overlay enabled) but I still love it. A lot. Once the story is all said and done, (story is well done by the way, just takes away some of your freedom if you want to make another character and have to sit through it again) it's incredibly open ended. Wanna go explore some caves? You can do that. Wanna go explore the one or two kinds of planets you don't encounter by doing the story? Strap on a appropriate EPP for the weather and go crazy. And the mods. My god, this community is up there with Team Fortress 2 and Garry's Mod with the quality of the workshop items. Some fans have even done what Chucklefish hasn't bothered to. Patched bugs and glitches that were a hindrance to the overall experience. Overall, even with the flaws that this game has (including one I forget to mention, Chucklefish seems to have forgotten about it and have since stopped pushing updates as far as I know), it's still an enjoyable experience. The story is well written (though sometimes drags along), and once you're done with the story, the entire Galaxy is yours to explore. Replay value on different characters doesn't really exist, but staying with one you like and staying in that world, never gets old.

The main character's interest is in Ai, which is clever in that it is both pronounced \"I\" as in self (the ego) and literally the letters A.I. for artificial intelligence. It's a little on the nose, but it works well with the in medias res approach.[/spoiler]\nThe interchange between the characters is fun, although the format leaves a bit to be desired in terms of expressing the emotions behind the words. The visuals consist of a static background to indicate the location, and a semi-static image of the girl Ai in that location. Her facial expressions change to broadly suggest her feelings at each line's delivery, but you get no such clues for the main character, Jung. So there's more work to try to fathom whether he's being sarcastic or literal, teasing or oblivious. The clues are there in the text - it's written pretty well - but it's like watching a movie for one character's part of the conversation and having to read a script for the other character's lines. To put it another way - in the context of video games - Ai's dialogue is like playing \"7th Guest\" while Jung's lines are like playing \"Zork.\" That may not be unique to this visual novel - it may be a common feature of the genre - but it's still strange and new to me. But I liked it; deciphering the intent of the text was a bit like a puzzle to me. And the puzzle was made more complicated by the nature and context of the conversations, as they are so foreign to me, being a married father. [spoiler]Though of course, there's a reason for that: the theme of alienation is very strong in this story; it is central to the plot, after all. So it would be a little weird if someone were to play the game and think \"This is just a slice of life story. I just had a date with my imaginary computer girlfriend just like it.\"[/spoiler] Overall I enjoyed this game more than I feared I would. It encourages me to try out other visual novels to see how others approach the format.", "timestamp_created": 1556509250, "timestamp_updated": 1556509250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622888684272766113", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50362533": {"recommendationid": "50362533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880428649", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1556419523}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and thought-provoking", "timestamp_created": 1556419554, "timestamp_updated": 1556419554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50343950": {"recommendationid": "50343950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157714836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1556336203}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would neet again", "timestamp_created": 1556336257, "timestamp_updated": 1556336257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466030299663543701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50296843": {"recommendationid": "50296843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147775683", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1686999272}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not crying.

I'm so sad I ever knew of the existence of this game ever. Here's why.\n\nThere is a single choice that you make in this 10-20 minute game. It's just the one showed in the trailer, where you want to take \"Ai.\" Then, you get a total of about 3 backgrounds and 3 different and reused facial expressions for the rest of the game. There was no backstory, no storyline, had no idea throughout the duration of the game why I was there, who I was, who she was, how we knew each other, why we knew each other, nothing. You're just thrown into this \"universe\" (more of a poorly drawn background of a park that's literally reused later on) with no context whatsoever. The dialogue is disgusting. So cringy, so forced, so easy to come up with, EXTREMELY cliche lines. Not to mention I literally predicted how the game would end before I even pressed play.\n\nI had a friend play it, even got my MOTHER to play this game. It wasn't even a means of torturing them, so I kinda feel bad, but I needed someone to feel the pain that I did. Both of them absolutely hated it and felt disappointed, saddened, and frustrated. This game truly was an insult to my intelligence. To see how far I could make it before I just quit and started sobbing. But I persevered through this horrible story and lived to tell the tale. Despite all this, and despite that I do not recommend it, maybe you should play too, because now I probably have caught your curiosity as to why this game is such an abomination to everything we once knew. Hopefully you live to tell the tale.

Cute anime art style\n2. Easy to read writing which also happens to be interesting and fun enough to keep reading.\n3. It's free.\n\nNeutral Points:\n\n1. Only one ending. This isn't really good or bad, so I'm putting it here.\n2. Very short.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The ending may be somewhat predictable, with  [spoiler] Ai being an A.I. as the name suggests [/spoiler]\n\nOverall opinion: While I'd like to see this game expanded upon, it's still fun on its own.

Storywise, it's pretty decent and solid but to others and newcomers, it may feel like the story is rushed and not much story-branching is not really impacting the story especially when the ending does not change at all (as mentioned on the store page). Some players might also feel that, the ending, although sad to hear, feels abrupt and out of nowhere. For the developer's first step, it's a fine step (coming from someone who doesn't develop games LOL) for the developer, however visual novel die-hards may find this to be rushed. Overall, story is fine except that it can feel really short and abrupt, especially towards the ending. And no, the ending does not in a cliffhanger so you don't need to play the sequel, Carpe Diem:Reboot.\n\nVisuals\nVisuals look pretty good, especially for the developer's first visual novel.The colours give the locations a personality and definetely make Ai look very pretty. Other than that, there's not too much to say for a game that's very short, So yeah, visuals look good and nice.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe music sounds very calming and relaxing. However, after listening to a couple of times, it may get pretty repititive and somewhat annoying. There isn't much in terms of music. 3 Soundtracks in total: Main game, ending and the menu (I think, if there's one;cant remember lol). Overall, nice music but can get pretty reptitive (which shouldn't be the case for a very short game).\n\nConclusion\nCarpe Diem is a solid direction for the developer's first visual novel, which makes it interesting for casual visual novel players to join. However, its short story and abrupt ending can turn serious visual novel players off. But regardless, it shows a message to players that it is important to keep your \npriorities to your loved ones.\n\nPros\n+Nice visuals\n+Relaxing soundtrack\n+Short to complete\n\nCons\n-Very short\n-Abrupt ending\n-Music can be repititive\n\nRating\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1532189393, "timestamp_updated": 1532189393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43656839": {"recommendationid": "43656839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305413725", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1532158411}, "language": "english", "review": "deep", "timestamp_created": 1532158560, "timestamp_updated": 1532158560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43651479": {"recommendationid": "43651479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142290491", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1532127937}, "language": "english", "review": "jebaited", "timestamp_created": 1532127970, "timestamp_updated": 1532127970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491997301578521729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43636565": {"recommendationid": "43636565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400129985", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1558739359}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es una novela visual corta, de no mas de 15 minutos, que te da un giro increible en la trama.

What it fails to realize is that just invoking such concepts doesn\u2019t actually mean that they\u2019ve been effectively incorporated into the game. It signals the intelligence of its creators but it does not translate well to art which is where intelligence is implied through execution.\nThis was furtherly annoying since the prose itself is littered with casual euphemisms and banal speech that didn\u2019t elevate the subject matter at all.\n\nThe characters are uninteresting, the protagonist, as a blank slate is particularly frustrating as his (or the players) reaction to Ai is not tinted with any level of understanding. It is pedestrian in its own mundanity. Whether this is an issue of playing across a cultural line I am not sure, but somehow considering the bombastic characters that proliferate in other asian stories the character of Jung did not live up to his namesake. \nAi is also rather dreary, and is no more interesting than a short raising of the eyebrow at the ambiguity implied by her name.\n\nThe character interactions are plagued by paradoxes.. this begins at the first meeting where Jung is reprimanded for saying how long he waited (she kept him waiting half an hour!, which he doesn\u2019t even display irritation about) She then informs him he shouldn\u2019t have mentioned how long he waited in an obnoxious display which Jung just seems to allow. She then further insults him by saying of course he couldn\u2019t follow her obnoxious protocol of not mentioning her rudeness since he \u2018wouldn\u2019t follow it anyway\u2019. So she about faces from saying he is rude to simply accepting that he did mention her tardiness. I\u2019m not sure if this is normal behavior at all, but as far as I can see its not\u2026 the overall tone and seriousness of the characters expressions don\u2019t convey the feeling of light banter, so from the outset the impression of the game is one of jarring discontinuity between actual circumstances and characterization.\n\nThe game itself is incredibly short, choices are limited and the story arcs are extremely linear diverging completely and never overlapping or reconverging. It is very simple and somewhat boring to read. There is no tension or conflict to add impetus to the narrative, it is in effect merely describing the meeting of two friends. And the great reveal, holds no weight due to the lack of observation on the aspects of life that should be there.\n\nThere is no theme really other than the simple wish fulfillment of a lonely man. There\u2019s no nuance or subtlety in the text to make its audience feel compassion or empathy. This subject matter has been done far better elsewhere. And despite the irony of the title there is really nothing of importance that the game has to say.\n\nThe artwork is simplistic. The character of Ai looks quite flat, despite the tones added to her sprite. There is a lack of emphasis to her colour tone that seems sterile, perhaps appropriate considering her role but does not make her interesting. \nBackgrounds are drawn and suffer from irregular perspective lines, lack of texture and at times what looks like a job done in MS Paint. The overall feeling is one that is amateur, and lacks polish and attention to detail. \n\nCarpe Diem is free, and perhaps its hoping that this should give it a free pass to a recommendation however quality is not always congruent to what one pays, and although this game is free, it is most definitely lacking in quality.\n", "timestamp_created": 1530466774, "timestamp_updated": 1530466774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676981329917907715", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43206005": {"recommendationid": "43206005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025515233", "num_games_owned": 442, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1530400321}, "language": "english", "review": "A boring, pretentious piece of crap.

She exists only in a program that the protagonist, Jung, is developing. The game ends when it crashes again and he wonders what he's doing with his life. Oh, gee, what a surprise. Yeah, the game tries to be all deep and shit when it's just... not. The description for this visual novel claims that it's \"a free short visual (kinetic) novel made to show the importance of setting the right priorities in life,\" but here's the thing: it never actually [i]shows[/i] the importance of setting the right priorities in life.\n\nWe never get to know Jung or the kind of lifestyle he lives beyond being told that this is all a program he develops. But that's far too little information to go on! Is it just something he works on in his spare time? Has he quit his job to devote more time to working on the program? What circumstances led him to begin development on this program? Does he have any friends, family, or other loved ones? Is he does, are his relationships with those people suffering because of the program in some way? We're never told any of these things. All we're told is that he's developing this program to talk to a fictional girl in it, and apparently, that's supposed to be an inherently bad thing.\n\nIf you're going to argue that that sort of behavior is ultimately harmful, then at least try to make a convincing case for [i]why[/i] it's harmful and maybe offer some alternatives, rather than just condemning people for having a hobby you don't like. But Carpe Diem doesn't do this. All it amounts to is saying \"your waifu isn't real.\" Oh, gee, I didn't know that. Thank you so much for enlightening me.\n\nNow, to give credit where credit's due, the art is decent, and the music is... Well, it's generic, but it didn't actively make me want to stab my ears with an ice pick. But with visual novels, I like to think of these things as the icing on the cake; they're nice when they're well-done, but they're not going to save a terrible cake from being terrible no matter how good the icing is.\n\nIn short, Carpe Diem is a judgemental, pretentious waste of time.", "timestamp_created": 1530419883, "timestamp_updated": 1530419883, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56115800142288208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43198064": {"recommendationid": "43198064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197663687", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 231, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1690052926}, "language": "english", "review": "Player Bases.\n\u2610 Kids.\n\u2611 Everyone.\n\u2610 Mature.\n\u2610 Casual Players.\n\u2610 Pro players.\n\nGraphics.\n\u2610 Potato.\n\u2610 Really Bad.\n\u2610 Bad.\n\u2610 OK.\n\u2611 Good.\n\u2610 Beautiful.\n\u2610 Masterpiece.\n\nPrice.\n\u2610 Full Price.\n\u2610 Wait For Sale.\n\u2610 Refund It If You Can.\n\u2610 Don't Buy It.\n\u2611 Free.\n\nRequirements.\n\u2611 Minimum.\n\u2610 Medium.\n\u2610 Fast.\n\u2610 High End.\n\u2610 Super Computer.\n\nDifficulty.\n\u2611 Easy.\n\u2610 Medium.\n\u2610 Hard.\n\u2610 Very Hard.\n\u2610 Death March.\n\u2610 Dark Souls.\n\nGame length.\n\u2611 Really Short.

Not bad for the solid price of 0$. \n\n(Trust me, I've played WAYYYYYY worse games, even ones that falsely claim to be actual \"game\" games.)\n\nMy favorite part about this story is the fact that it makes no effort to make it seem any more grand or important than it actually is; it's a short, simple mini-story leading up to the real story that is still under development. They didn't try to hype it up as something fantastic, because, to be honest, it's not.\n\nThe dev(s) said, and I quote; \"This is intended to be a single playthrough kind of novel. The choices all lead to the same ending, just taking different routes.\" They don't gloss it over by slapping on the pizazz lines like \"with a multitude of branching paths for limitless replayability!\"\n\nThey literally tell you, it's got only one ending, so don't replay it over and over cuz yer not gonna find much of anything new. And by the way, the ending was also kinda funny, and more 4th-wall-breakingly amusing than certain other, more professional titles [spoiler] *coughcoughdokidokiliteratureclubcoughcough* [/spoiler] .\n\nAs it stands, in it's current state, this story is terrible, I'll admit. It's a novice work made by a novice dev. But you know what? As a fellow game dev in the making, I fully respect the hard work, determination, and devotion that it takes to produce a truly great videogame. But with time, hard work, determination, and willpower, Carpe Diem could become something great.\n\nThe art style is simple, but that adds to the overall atmosphere of simplicity and \"budget-title air\". The music is peppy, perky, and cheerful, but also sad and mournful, but also calm, at the end. \nThe character development is interesting, though could use more time to really flesh them out more. \nThe \"twist\" was not surprising at all, but still. It was slightly emotionally moving, so I'll say good job, cuz it's not easy to forge an emotional bond with a character in such a short time. (Trust me, I've tried to do so with my own short stories before; not as easy as it sounds. Then again, I've got a knack for longer stories and sagas, not short stories.)\n\nPROS:\n-It's free\n-It takes less than a half hour to finish\n-Takes only a second or two to completely download\n-Funny \"Hidden achievement\"\n-Ai is kinda cute at times\n\nCONS:\n-Insanely short; not even worth the amount of time it takes to look through the options menu\n-Feels like a snippet of a demo\n-Weak plot shocker\n-Cruddy, lackluster environments (not that big of a problem. Again; this isn't a triple-A title, it doesn't really have a fanbase yet, and it has no real consequence for said field's lack thereof. So yeah, not a problem.)\n-Only two songs (So far as I remember hearing; again, it just sorta whizzed by me so fast I didn't really stay awhile and listen...)\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n4 of 10. (Needs some work)\n\nI would've given it a lower score, but the dev(s) straightforwardness regarding what this short mininovel truly is is admirable. Plus also, Ai's fighter-mode is adorable.

But, for a free visual novel that seems to be a first attempt it's alright. It's nothing big but it's cute and fun and I enjoyed my time playing it, even if it was short. So, I'd recommend it.

Como jugador tienes el papel de novio, pero tranquilo, no es un juego que pase m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de un sentimiento rom\u00e1ntico que no consigue narrar bien del todo. Moralista, la novela pretende inducir a la reflexi\u00f3n sobre el \u201cCarpe Diem\u201d y temas relacionados que no puedo explicar para no hacer spoiler. Pero fracasa completamente al tener una trama mal atada que carece de todo inter\u00e9s.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos y Tecnolog\u00eda >>> POBRE + 0,7 puntos\n\nTan s\u00f3lo la protagonista femenina Ai tiene dibujo en esta historia. Su dise\u00f1o es bonito pero como muchas visuals anim\u00e9 ya est\u00e1 muy visto, adem\u00e1s, apenas tiene cuatro cambios de expresiones faciales y resulta demasiado est\u00e1tica. Pero el problema del dise\u00f1o del juego es con los escenarios y las acciones narradas, o tiene demasiada narraci\u00f3n o demasiadas pocas ilustraciones, y atendiendo al hecho que muchas acciones distintas pasan sin cambiar la imagen de fondo... hubo desgana para ilustrar el juego, parece un libro m\u00e1s que una visual novel. Punt\u00faa algo por ocupar solamente 111 Mb, pero pudo ser mucho mejor.\n\nHistoria y Niveles >>> MUY MAL  0 puntos\n\nSolo hay una decisi\u00f3n en el juego, y cambia un poco el recorrido para llegar al mismo final sin ning\u00fan cambio. Hay solamente tres recorridos posibles, y cada vez que juegas visitas dos.. muy mal, la novela incluso le\u00edda despacio dura diez minutos, aunque se esfuerza por que empaticemos con los personajes no lo consigue y el final aunque sorprendente lo es por tramposo, abusando de situaciones que lo hac\u00edan imposible (atentos a como Ai interacciona con lo que VE, por ejemplo). Final mal resuelto, historia demasiado corta, se supone una visual novel pero saca un CERO en el apartado de historia, nada m\u00e1s que decir.\n\nM\u00fasica y Sonidos >>>  MUY MAL 0 puntos\n\nNo hay efectos de sonido a pesar que suceden acciones que podr\u00edan incluirlos, al menos predise\u00f1ados, pero lo peor es que la historia se ameniza con un bucle musical de fondo un poco cansino y molesto que se beneficia de la corta duraci\u00f3n del juego. Otro aspecto descuidado y hecho con prisas, la banda sonora no ha recibido atenci\u00f3n alguna por parte del desarrollador.\n\nControl y Jugabilidad >>> BIEN ! + 1,5 puntos\n\nMal com\u00fan en Steam, reciclar motores de visual novel de unos juegos a otros para otorgar solidez y funcionalidad a cambio de perder originalidad y m\u00e9ritos. Como muchas visuals, utiliza una base predise\u00f1ada de controles para ese tipo de juegos que incluye buenos controles de avance y omisi\u00f3n de texto, guardar y cargar partidas... lo t\u00edpico. Funciona correctamente y dado que el juego tiene una duraci\u00f3n escas\u00edsima y nula rejugabilidad, cumple con su cometido. Adem\u00e1s, un entorno limpio de bugs ni problemas, adem\u00e1s de disponer la historia en varios idiomas, hacen que Carpe Diem punt\u00fae alto en este apartado.\n\nIntegraci\u00f3n en Steam >>>  BIEN ! + 1,5 puntos\n\nExiste un logro por finalizar la historia, es necesario (penalizo las visuals sin ning\u00fan logro ya que Steam no las cuenta nunca como completadas) pero la descripci\u00f3n del logro tiene un brutal spoiler (si no lo has le\u00eddo, no lo hagas). Como juego gratuito no puede tener Cromos de Steam, y los marcadores no tendr\u00edan sentido. No obstante, debo bonificar su coste cero ya que invita a vivir su experiencia al menos una vez, sin perder nada por ello.\n\nCONCLUSI\u00d3N FINAL >>>  3,7 desarrollador, qu\u00e9 est\u00e1s haciendo con tu vida?\n\nDespu\u00e9s de leer mi an\u00e1lisis reflexionad que tan malo debe ser el juego para que a\u00fan siendo GRATIS y funcionando bien mec\u00e1nicamente ni siquiera alcance el 4 sobre 10. \u00bfvale la pena leer Carpe Diem? Siendo gratis te dir\u00e9 que da lo mismo, si te sobran diez minutos lo lees y si no no, no tiene m\u00e1s inter\u00e9s. El final parece adem\u00e1s una especie de burla por jugar el juego en s\u00ed. \u00bfqu\u00e9 pod\u00edan haber hecho? Dibujar m\u00e1s, o poner m\u00e1s ocpiones, o hacer un final COHERENTE con los hechos de la trama, o reforzar que nos importe algo m\u00e1s que cero Ai y su novio... No lo juegues, es desperdiciar tu vida como el desarrollador insin\u00faa.\n\npd. Hay un DLC de pago para apoyar al desarrollador? en serio? Qu\u00e9 cara.

:)\nBack to the game, well, when you see that it had 10.000 reviews or little less, there aren't many words to add. \nFor sure it's very short, but pleasing under every aspect - nice artwork and backgrounds, good music, and a simple but enjoyable plot that will require you half an hour of reading and relax :)\nIt's not a life changer, but it will definitely have its importance with the bond that you'll create with the main character.\nSo, we'll play as a young boy called Jung - I forgot to mention that this game, being so famous, has also lots of translations but I keep on playing them all in English - and you'll see everything under his perspective. \nHe's sort of a calm guy who'll encounter Ai, the female protagonist of the story, whose name also means \"love\" in Japanese among the other meanings if I remember well, but anyways.. that's of course the point of change.\nShe'll somehow manage to make Jung's life a little different, and the two of them are definitely a nicely developed and written thing together.\nSo, there'll be anyways in such a little time many deep meanings connected to Ai's life and her role in the novel and in every way you and her will behave during the small novel.. ok, it won't be your choice, but it'll be nice and touching xD\nThe message that this indie developer wanted to convey relies in the novel's title - carpe diem, which for an Italian like me is something we often hear, and it means something like, seize the present, catch the moment, do the right thing in the small lapse of time the nature's given to us.. diem stays for \"day\" of course, carpe, \"capture\", \"pick\", and even \"make use of\"..\nAnd I really didn't find that convincing the other view that many reviewers took - like, if this game wanted to make us think what we're doing with our life with a precise link to Steam and computer gaming in general.\nI'd prefer to stick with the game's artwork, Jung+Ai relationship/bond and everything in-game, without trying to find other meanings.\nIt's a very short and free visual novel, the DLC is worth the price, and it should be enjoyed as it is. If you like to draw your conclusions, that's great.\nAnd anyways, I really recommend it.\nIt may be sad. It may be relatable for what concerns the whole computer/\"otaku\" thing, the \"girlfriend\".. you'll see what I mean in a couple of minutes, anyways.\nIt's a great visual novel, it's deep, it has limited but nice artwork and should be taken as it is, nor glorified neither too regardless criticized.\nAnd then, you can go on with the second part of this visual novel.. way longer and improved.. if you had liked of course all the meanings of this one and all the \"virtual\" setting that's relatable and matches what we're living, maybe :P", "timestamp_created": 1521740893, "timestamp_updated": 1521740893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754281222820281982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40957164": {"recommendationid": "40957164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150051068", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1673685746}, "language": "english", "review": "What a cute little game we ha- BAM!

Storywise, it's pretty decent and solid but to others and newcomers, it may feel like the story is rushed and not much story-branching is not really impacting the story especially when the ending does not change at all (as mentioned on the store page). Some players might also feel that, the ending, although sad to hear, feels abrupt and out of nowhere. For the developer's first step, it's a fine step (coming from someone who doesn't develop games LOL) for the developer, however visual novel die-hards may find this to be rushed. Overall, story is fine except that it can feel really short and abrupt, especially towards the ending. And no, the ending does not in a cliffhanger so you don't need to play the sequel, Carpe Diem:Reboot.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nVisuals look pretty good, especially for the developer's first visual novel.The colours give the locations a personality and definetely make Ai look very pretty. Other than that, there's not too much to say for a game that's very short, So yeah, visuals look good and nice.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe music sounds very calming and relaxing. However, after listening to a couple of times, it may get pretty repititive and somewhat annoying. There isn't much in terms of music. 3 Soundtracks in total: Main game, ending and the menu (I think, if there's one;cant remember lol). Overall, nice music but can get pretty reptitive (which shouldn't be the case for a very short game).\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nCarpe Diem is a solid direction for the developer's first visual novel, which makes it interesting for casual visual novel players to join. However, its short story and abrupt ending can turn serious visual novel players off.

Buying the soundtrack is highly recommended if you would like to listen to some calming music and supporting a creative developer in the process.\n\nGameplay: Smooth & simple dialogue based interactive comic-book/anime style.\nGraphics: Polished 2D anime-like. Looks gorgeous.\nMusic: Calm and melodious. \nGlitches?: None discovered so far.\nBang for buck?: Yes, because it's free and provides some good insight into creative storytelling.\nSuggested improvements?: Length could be longer but since it's free, I think we can expect it in a paid expansion. The choices, has effect on locations and dialogues, ultimately lead to a similar place.Also, more choices would have been nice.  Maybe the future title can add mulitple endings. Here, to have a good impact and to deliver a message, multiple endings seem to have avoided. Which was a good intention perhaps.\nOverall: 4.5/5 Almost perfect for a short free game.

On a technical level, this game is very dissapointing. Characters will block entire views of the usually good looking landscapes. What was once a novelty becomes a distraction. \n\nThe story can't help itself from collapsing upon itself during the second to third act. DICE is desperate to meet the usual story beats that of a blockbuster, setting up conflicts in which there is no time, effort, or emotion devoted to. Yet another example of triple A devs milking their franchise. When a story's opacity is so low that you can see the desperate money laundering thieves behind it, you know that the story is about to end, with a not so subtle \" THUNK \"! \n\nThis series will always be remembered for pioneering RTS and Platforming as we know it. However, a table to stand on does not make the food on top of it good. \nIf Ai has taught me anything, it's to avoid social interaction and talk with a retarded woman who cannot close up her own shirt. \n\nSuch a shame.

Only a very small percentage of otakus really overdo it with getting in debt because they need to buy ever single merchadise of her as a proof of love or cooking for two persons and so on.\nSome otakus like a specific anime girl, buy 1-2 figures of her, but still perfer 3D over 2D. Other otakus prefer having a virtual girlfriend because it's too hard finding a real girlfriend in a society that judges people from the get go and everyone who isn't part of the norm gets excluded. Also people who have huge problems with social interaction due to some mental illness can usually only get comfort and affection through virtual girlfriends.\n\nEither way a 2D waifu will make someone happy and as long no one is suffering, in my opinion there's nothing wrong with having a virtual girlfriend.

The title of the visual novel is good to the whole story, because after all.Of course, not all can to like it, although that I grew fond of this title.", "timestamp_created": 1498333595, "timestamp_updated": 1606830206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32719923": {"recommendationid": "32719923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102968340", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1498297020}, "language": "english", "review": "I know, I know, I'm not supposed to hold too high expectations for free games, especially when they are individually developed.\n\nBut this game does not have much to offer. With a fairly limited number of backgrounds, character arts, and soundtracks, it does not provide a satisfying gameplay. As such a short game, the plot is poorly developed (the useless and repetitive dialogue does not count) and the ending consequently appears very abrupt. \n\nThe central message the game maker is trying to convey is made clear by the title: \"Carpe Diem\" -- enjoy it while it lasts. The short gameplay ([spoiler] the short life of Ai [/spoiler]) is a metaphor for life. Our life isn't really much longer than this short gameplay. \n\nAnd then, the game conveys another message through the game ending and the only achievement: [spoiler] What are you doing with your life? Should you really be spending time on Steam? [/spoiler]\n\nThe game reminds me a little of [spoiler] the greek story [i] Pygmalion [/i], where a king makes himself a sculpture of a perfect girl which he falls in love into. He came to treat the sculpture as a real girl, like kissing her everyday, etc. You get the idea. And then the great Aphrodite was moved and turned the sculpture into a real girl, and they had a good ending. [/spoiler] Similar stories are being developed in the internet era because of you-know-why, but this game, as one of them, does not explore it enough, if at all.\n\nThe game does trigger some thinking, which almost wants me to change my opinion from \"No\" to \"Yes\". But then again, the game is unqualified at its job: being a game. The fact that there are 10 pages of save slots amuses and bemuses me -- you don't need any.\n\nThe thank-you screen mentions that this is only the first project of the game maker. So maybe this game works as a test for the game mechanism, which explains the 10-pages save slots. I am expecting the next games of the game maker, and hopefully the mentioned problems will be solved. I suggest expanding your team.\n\nSumming up, this is a poor game with a clear message. If you have a few minutes to spare I guess it doesn't hurt to play it. But again, it isn't really fun. It's a pity that there are no middle grounds in the review system of Steam, because that's where this game falls into.\n\n4/10\n\nI spent more time writing this review than playing the game.\n\n\n\n[spoiler] What am I doing with my life?

The ending just pops out of nowhere, making little to no sense, because there's no (I mean it, NO) motivation stated. Did previous GF die in a car accident, cut her veins or was eaten by rabies hamsters? Is the protagonist an obsessed scientist or just a smart otaku? \n  Why the hell should I sympathize someone with no logical reasoning?\n  Adding even a single flashback screenshot or a little item on the table would make everything MUCH better\n\n\nHere is an unusual one:\n\n  - [b]The title[/b]\n  \"Carpe Diem\" can be translated from Latin as \"seize the day\"... Which makes no sense to me, taking a look at the plot\n[spoiler]When did attempts to create an AI capable of passing the Turing test become a waste of your life? Does the creator realize what a breakthrough it will become or just use intelligent sounding words to... sound intelligent?[/spoiler]\n  The original message (jumping back to the lack of exposition) would make MUCH more sense if I felt ANY emotional impact and knew the motives. But at this state, a single question \"Why combining science and girly girls wouldn't work?\" ruins everything\n\n [i]\"But hey, bro, take a closer look at the title, that's some smart move\"[/i]\n\n Just like the Wachowskis' lazy letters juggling in Matrix Revolutions with \"Mobil Ave\" being an anagram for \"Limbo\"? No, it isn't\n There are loads of much smarter visual symbolism examples in movies and games\n\n [i]\"But the protagonist's name gives us...\"[/i]\n\n *sigh*\n Putting the name \"Jung\" and some symbols and references together gives you nothing, but a reference to Carl Jung's theory. Does it affect or improve the story and characters? Or is it somehow speculated on?\n\n\n - [b]Uninteresting story telling[/b]\n  Dialogs are the core of any VN (Captain Obvious breaks in through the window)... And they are lame.

If someone else wants to go have real relationships then that's fine, but not everyone wants that. Then there are people like me who do a little of both, so the message is useless because I already do what the game's dev wants me to do. So who is this directed at?

What the hell? Some poor written scenarios? That\u2019s it? The graphics and the textures are simple and neat. The atmosphere happens in 3 places: mall, park and arcade. Each one of them has 3 scenarios, but all of them has the same uncreative ending. The audio and the music are decent. The gameplay is very poor, all you have to do is to click further and further on the dialogues\u2026 ha, ha, ha. The story\u2026 is an epic failure. Won\u2019t even comment about it. The user interface is simple and OK. The controls are very simple too, just your mouse is needed. The engines are alright, I haven\u2019t found any haven\u2019t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are very simple, and cartoonish style. I don\u2019t like them.

But, i'll give it a try. I haven't played many visual novels in the past, but after Carpe Diem I'm seriously considering them. Quoting Wikipedia \"Carpe diem is a Latin aphorism, usually translated \"seize the day\", taken from book 1 of the Roman poet Horace's work Odes\". And it means that you have to live for the present, to make the most of your time. At least that's what i got from googling.\n\nIt took me exactly 12 minutes to finish the game. I guess I'm a fast reader, because most people say it took them more than 20 minutes. There is no interaction besides pressing [space], [enter] or left-clicking to progress through the dialogue. Oh, actually there is one point, near the start of the game, where you get to choose where you wish to go. From that point, the story unfolds in three different ways, each and one of them being slightly different from the others. The simplicity of that brings lots of haters who complain that these kind of games aren't even games. I disagree, because they are meant to be like that. A different movie-like experience. Moving on, the game also has a save system. I really appreciate the fact that the devs included it, even though i didn't use it a single time (like most of us). Apart from those, there aren't many noteworthy mechanics.\n\nSo, the game is mainly focusing on the two main characters, the boy and the girl. The boy, who remains unnamed and the girl named Ai meet at the park. The dialogue seems fluid between them and you can easily get attached to the characters. On that matter, it's more likely that you'll start attaching yourself to Ai, because she's the only one whose face is shown in the game. It gives the feel that you're participating in the events through the eyes of the male character, because Ai is always facing the player. The visuals are great, i personally love the arwork. Aside all that, what really matters are the characters themselves. The development is great, but if were given more time to understand the characters it would be awesome. Within the range of 15 minutes, it's hard to make something really good. But, by giving us a taste of what the characters seem to be and then, twisting the reality that we were slowly getting into is... awesome! I loved the twist at the end and i believe it's one of the main reasons that people loved this game.\n\n[h1] Good Points [/h1]\n- Nice visuals\n- Saving system\n- Awesome plot and character development\n- Value for price (free!)\n\n[h1] Bad Points [/h1]\n- Too short\n- Not much interaction compared to other similar games", "timestamp_created": 1468077306, "timestamp_updated": 1468509381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570797383785247803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24171516": {"recommendationid": "24171516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268870390", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1450495571}, "language": "english", "review": "this game had no purpose lol", "timestamp_created": 1467941813, "timestamp_updated": 1467941813, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476603955030441284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24169530": {"recommendationid": "24169530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086930377", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1482087849}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great, short, comedic game!", "timestamp_created": 1467934317, "timestamp_updated": 1467934317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24151192": {"recommendationid": "24151192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081125300", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1615014629}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Corta pero hace que te preguntes \u00bfque estas haciendo con tu vida?\n\nFinal Inesperado.

Iniciando sesion en Steam, me autocargo la tienda y vi abajo este juego \"Carpe Diem\" y dije: \"Wow, interesante\" entro a la pagina, y veo 4.000 analisis positivos.. Mi reaccion fue \"\u00a1\u00bfQue?!\" no dude en nada en instalarlo, sin guiarme por los analisis que no siempre definen una opinion central, ya que para gustos colores logicamente, y no es lo mismo leer una analisis y probarlo. Pero me llego la intriga de pensar, 4k de analisis positivos, algo bueno tiene que tener este juego que supuestamente dura nada. Y en difinitiva, tiene algo muy bueno que me gusto, pero nada del otro mundo desde mi punto de vista. El juego solo pesa 64MB de descarga, y 100MB instalado, y viene totalmente al Espa\u00f1ol, tanto el menu como los subtitulos, algo que me sorprende y que por su puesto agradezco.\n\nA PARTIR DE AQUI, HAY SPOILERS\n\nPeque\u00f1o resumen de la trama:\n\nLa trama de esta novela grafica trata sobre una cita con tu novia llamada AI. A simple vista, se ve como una cita normal, comienza contigo (Jung) esperando a verte con ella en un parque. AI llega un poco tarde y te pregunta que si te ha hecho esperar mucho, automaticamente respondes que al rededor de media hora y tal, despues de mantener una charla de pareja, te pide de pasear para seguir charlando ahi es cuando tu tienes la opcion de quedarte en el parque, ir a un centro comercial o a un salon recreativo. Yo en lo personal, decidi quedarme en el parque, a simple vista ves que rumbo va tomando el juego, y aqui es donde profundizo un poco mas, porque IA curiosamente, como algunas chicas de hoy en dia, no sabe cocinar y esta aprendiendo para cocinarte a ti, ella tiene un trabajo duro como cualquier persona normal y corriente. En una parte concretamente van al centro comercial y despues de hacer la vida de pareja de siempre, comprar ropa ect, Jung es un tipo medio amargo y muy egocentrico, como que si todo en la pareja depende de ella que siempre se comporta muy amable contigo a pesar de lo que eres.. Y en cierta parte despues de que AI te comprara un par de camisas para Jung con su dinero.. Y de que el solo le regalase un llavero de bajo costo, Jung le dice a ella que quiere pasar por una parte donde venden cosas de informatica, porque el programa que estaba creando requeria mas espacio y no tenias un disco duro con tanta capacidad. Ella lo acompa\u00f1a en silencio, y despues de realizar una compra muy cara... Ella escucha a las personas hablar de que hay un festival con fuegos artificiales, Jung y AI se dirigen a un lugar elevado para ver como se esconde el sol y se muestra la ciudad desde lejos, y todas las personas espectantes para ver el espectaculo. En una parte concreta, mientras AI mira los fuegos artificiales, con tristeza le dice a Jung que no falta mucho para que termine, y que desearia que ese momento durara para toda la vida, Jung le dice a AI que no pasa nada, que no falta mucho, y AI le responde que Jung no deberia molestarse en quedar con ella, porque despues de todo ella es solo una Inteligencia Artificial.\n\n[h1]Mi interpretracion:[/h1]\n\nComo veran, a simple vista para los mas entendidos, este juego es facil deducir de que va, pero aun asi a mi me agarro de sorpresa, crei personalmente que era como todas las novelas graficas Japonesas, melosas y mucho de amor. Me encontre con la sorpresa que es eso, pero solo que usa este concepto para explicarte que hagas lo que hagas no podras hacer real una inteligencia artificial que crees. El unico logro que tiene este juego se llama \"\u00bfQue estas haciendo con tu vida?\" el juego intenta explicarle la vida de una persona comun y corriente, una persona solitaria egocentrica y adicta a la programacion informatica que vive en un ordenador y esta enamorado de un AI que no tiene vida. Al final de la novela grafica, te explican preguntandote:\n\n \"\u00bfHas oido hablar alguna vez del test Turing? Es una evaluacion de la habilidad de la maquina para demostrar su inteligencia. Tanto si puede actuar o hablar como un humano. Pero a pesar de lo buena que pueda volverse la maquina... Sin importar lo indistinguible que sea de los seres humanos... Nunca sera en realidad un ser humano.\" \n\nY al final de todo, Jung dice: \"Ha. El programa ha vuelto ha colgarse. Tal como lo esperaba, no podia ir mas alla de eso, realmente tengo que hacer un parche estable pronto. \u00bfQue estoy haciendo con mi vida?\"\n\nLo que mas me sorprendio es ese mensaje que quiere transmitir, no es nada de otro mundo claro, pero me gusta en la forma que intenta dartelo a explicar, a simple vista es una novela grafica muy simple de 15, 25 minutos maximo, con un soundtrack muy monotono pero relajante. Entre al juego con espectativas bajas pero sali pensativo, porque esto es algo que a muchas personas les suele pasar hoy en dia, incluso con nuestros pensamientos creamos personas que no existen tanto de pepe\u00f1os como muchas veces de grande, ya sea por problemas, limitaciones o la constante necesidad de que alguien este pendiente siempre de nosotros le hagamos lo que le hagamos, por eso digo que la forma en la que te cuenta simple la trama, me parece muy interesante.", "timestamp_created": 1466563146, "timestamp_updated": 1479987868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23694529": {"recommendationid": "23694529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011995050", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1466548272}, "language": "english", "review": "Why\n\n:c", "timestamp_created": 1466548299, "timestamp_updated": 1466548299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23682758": {"recommendationid": "23682758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062301817", "num_games_owned": 740, "num_reviews": 271, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1459289055}, "language": "english", "review": "Well... this was something.\nStop reading reviews now, and go play it.

Otherwise, judging by overall graphics, they're okay.\n\nMusic:\nThere's only two pieces of music in the game. The one that plays in the start of the game and during the game, and then the ending. While I enjoy these lullaby pieces, it gets tiresome to hear the first one repetably.\n\nStory:\nThe story is really short. Basically, you spend your day with Ai, a love interest.

Jung is a programmer by trade that is focused on his work (not unlike myself back in the 1990s when I was developing database applications for credit reporting customers).  Ai is the person whom he was dating in the story.  The name Ai is also an acronym for \"artificial intelligence\", as we find out at the end of the story.\n\nThe intent of the story as described in the \"Background\" is true to the description.  Getting priorities straight goes a long way in real life, not just in the dating scenes in this game.  For that, I would give this game an \"A\" for the storyline and intent.\n\nI loved the music the developers chose for this game, though I would have chosen different pieces for each of the three choices you get at the first menu.  For example, I would have chosen for the mall scene a piece music that was commonly heard in shopping malls over the past 50 years.\n\nOverall, I liked this game so much, it gives me an idea for a visual novel.\n\nOverall Rating:  \"A\"\n", "timestamp_created": 1463884792, "timestamp_updated": 1463884792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553378462791442871", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23127896": {"recommendationid": "23127896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127088615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "When the ending comes.....

El protagonista es soso, algo desali\u00f1ado y bastante olvidable y mientras tanto la chica es todo lo contrario, se podr\u00eda decir que hacen un buen contraste.\n\nEl gameplay, de entre 10 a 30 minutos si quieres explotar todas las opciones, es corto y es casi como si estuvieras leyendo un folleto sobre un evento de fuegos artificiales. No es que las opciones sirvan de mucho m\u00e1s que para darnos una ligera diferencia entorno al desarrollo de la cita, pero elijamos lo que elijamos tendremos una buena dosis de historia.\n\nEl soundtrack est\u00e1 llevado a la monoton\u00eda. Creo que apenas distingu\u00ed 3 o 4 canciones en toda la banda sonora, pero no digo que sea algo malo. Es olvidable, pero te llena mientras juegas, no es algo que intentes evitar o no te guste del todo, simplemente est\u00e1 ah\u00ed y cumple su funci\u00f3n, trasmitirte la situaci\u00f3n.\n\nSi hablamos de la historia\u2026 Es algo compleja y f\u00e1cil de entender. Lo he tomado como una cr\u00edtica y una reflexi\u00f3n. No quiero revelar cosas y en cierto modo es una experiencia que mucha gente no entender\u00e1, pero una vez llegues al final, un trocito de tu coraz\u00f3n se quedara con ganas de m\u00e1s, se quedara con ganas de un \u201cContinuara\u2026\u201d mientras en el fondo sabes que una segunda parte solo romper\u00eda todo lo que est\u00e1s viendo y todo por lo que has reflexionado.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, se trata de una obra simple, compleja, vac\u00eda y llena. Todo cargado de ant\u00f3nimos para darte una obra que si indagas un poco en ella y reflexionas puede darte pie a cambiar un poco tu modo de pensar. Eso si, no tiene fallos por que te da exactamente lo que te dice que te va a dar, no se trata de una obra que vaya a ir a mayores, simplemente disfruta de su propia simpleza para entregarte un buen trabajo.\n", "timestamp_created": 1462374425, "timestamp_updated": 1462374425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22791738": {"recommendationid": "22791738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034306697", "num_games_owned": 1390, "num_reviews": 608, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1593337296}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a short VN without much depth and a few choices that don't change the outcome.
