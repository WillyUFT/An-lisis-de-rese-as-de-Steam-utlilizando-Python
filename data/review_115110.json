Imagine, if you will, a world where nesting dolls hold the key to solving puzzles and embarking on a grand adventure.\n\nIn this enchanting realm, you step into the tiny shoes of Charlie Blackmore, the smallest in a family of matryoshka dolls. A humble lad, no taller than your thumb, he possesses a unique talent \u2013 the ability to stack inside larger dolls, each with their distinct abilities and quirks. It's a world where size does matter, but not in the way you'd expect.\n\nNow, picture a bustling, steampunk-inspired world, a wondrous place where each doll represents a character with a story to tell. From chimney sweeps to stern schoolteachers, each doll is a vibrant personality waiting to be discovered. As Charlie, you'll need to use your stacking prowess to navigate this intricately detailed world and uncover the secrets hidden within.\n\nAh, but what sets \"Stacking\" apart, you ask? Well, dear audience, it's the puzzle-solving that forms the heart of this narrative. You see, to progress through this charming world, you must stack into the right dolls to harness their unique abilities. Want to infiltrate a secret society? Choose the right doll, and you'll be granted access. Need to mimic a group of musicians to start a parade? Stack the musicians, and the streets will come alive with the sweet sound of success.\n\nBut here's the kicker \u2013 the puzzles are not merely mechanical conundrums; they're stories in themselves. The solution to each challenge unfolds like a miniature play, filled with humor and heart. As you stack and unstack, you become a puppeteer in this whimsical theater of life.\n\nAnd what would a tale be without a sense of humor, you might wonder? Fear not, for \"Stacking\" is adorned with Double Fine's signature wit. The dialogues are laced with clever quips and charming exchanges, ensuring that laughter is never in short supply.\n\nAs our pint-sized hero, you'll embark on a quest to reunite your doll family and thwart the dastardly Baron, who's up to no good. Along the way, you'll delve into the lives and stories of the dolls you encounter, uncovering their dreams, aspirations, and even a touch of melancholy.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Stacking\" is more than just a game; it's an enchanting narrative experience, a whimsical journey through a world of nested wonders and endearing characters. It invites you to think outside the box, or in this case, inside the doll, and revel in the joy of storytelling through puzzles. So, my dear audience, if you seek a game that combines charm, humor, and ingenious puzzles into a delightful tapestry of adventure, look no further than \"Stacking\" by Double Fine Productions.

In \"Stacking\", you're playing as Charlie, an investigative Sherlock type of dude looking to find his own sister, that was abducted into child labor efforts atop of a... blimp? You're helped by a bunch of other... ahem, Russian Stackdolls to find her.\n\nThe plot is so childish and nonsensical that you won't be paying much attention to it anyways; the real premise of the game is that you'd have to think outside the box to find innovative ideas to solve puzzles that the game refers to as Challenges. Each map has got a bunch of those challenges, and each challenge has a bunch of ways to solve!\n\nTo solve these puzzles you'd have to stack into unique nestdolls; however, you can only stack into a size that's bigger than the doll you're into right now... Ouff, that came out so wrong! Anyways, moving on... Each Stackdoll has got an ability, ranging from writing an obituary to shooting the other dolls' heads off, to... farting into a line of train passengers? \n\nThis game gets a [b] 6/10 [/b] simply because I am with the opinion that with voice acting, a videogame becomes much more captivating than it is. Stacking lacks voices; it's got a great train-station western era soundtrack, but other than that the game's own greatness lies in how much thinking you'd have to do to figure out a puzzle. It's a great Puzzle Game but not so great a videogame overall, to be honest. Also, worthy of note that I encountered a game-breaking bug where I was stuck into a doll I could not unstack of or stack from, the problem is it was a huge doll and to proceed I had to be little old Charlie to get into a hole in a door...

Each doll has its own strengths and weaknesses, and combining different abilities is the key to solving the puzzles.\n\n2. charming atmosphere: The beautiful handmade settings and the lovingly designed dolls create a fantastic retro atmosphere that I absolutely love. The story is also very charming and humorous, which makes the game even more enjoyable.\n\n3. varied puzzles: The puzzles in Stacking are very varied and provide a good challenge for players of all skill levels. There are a lot of secrets to discover and many hidden ways to solve the puzzles.\n\n4. no pressure: One of the best things about Stacking is that there is no time pressure. You can take your time exploring the environment and trying out the different dolls without worrying that you will make mistakes.\n\n5. entertaining fun: Stacking is a relatively short game, but it has a high replay value. There are many secrets and achievements to discover, which makes the game a pleasure to play over and over again.\n\nOverall, I think Stacking is a fantastic game that combines unique retro atmosphere, excellent gameplay and challenging puzzles.

This game is original and innovative. You play as a small Matrioska (Russian Doll) that can stack into bigger ones to possess their abilities. The whole game mechanics is based on this simple idea. Almost every doll you encounter becomes playable, and replaces items and actions in classical adventure games. The result is a more intuitive, direct and fast paced gameplay.\n\nOne of the best aspects of this game is the storytelling and humor, which is classic Tim Shafer. The writing is funny and full of quirkiness, making it an enjoyable experience from beginning to end. Additionally, the art style is simple but fantastic. The game feels like a great indie game, and it was obviously made with a lower budget compared to other Double Fine products.\n\nThe puzzles in \"Stacking\" are on the easy side, but each of them has multiple solutions -great idea!. It's easy to see the end of the story, but it might be hard to complete 100 percent without a walkthrough, making it a great game for gamers of all levels. The game can be completed in under 10 hours, a quick but enjoyable gaming experience.\n\nHowever, there are a few cons to the game. The camera can sometimes work against you, especially is smaller rooms, which can be annoying. Additionally, in the last level of the main adventure, some objects that you can interact with were difficult to notice due to the dark colors used in that level. There is also one bug that I encountered where an achievement would not unlock even if I completed the game 100 percent. The lack of voice acting may be because of the low budget, but it's not a dealbreaker: they found a cool way to hide this aspect doing cut-scenes in the style of mute movies from the '30s (the result is super quirky since the characters do not have limbs and very limited facial expressions).\n\nThis game has no deep, rich story (it's nothing like Grim Fandango), it's a lighter take on the genre, characters are hollow and flat - but they are intended to be so. The game talks about serious themes child labor, capitalism, but in a humorous way. \n\nOverall, \"Stacking\" is an enjoyable and original game that is definitely worth playing. It's a small little pearl from Double Fine that showcases their talent, their love for adventure games and their will to reinvent the genre with new mechanics.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1681528347, "timestamp_updated": 1681528347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135907169": {"recommendationid": "135907169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983909159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 704, "last_played": 1690626416}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it!

I am not a trophy hunter but in this game I wanted to explore every corner , talk to everyone and read everything. This is a puzzle game that has some wonderfully crafted puzzles, a world that is not large but full of life and detail and a strong message.\nI don't want to spoil anything for you so I won't talk about the messages. The puzzles are for the most part good and if you solve only the minimum required you will finish this game very fast. There are some puzzles that are just waaay outside the box and when I gave up on them and used the hint system I didn't say -Oh , I am so stupid- because to be honest you would have to get into the brain of person that designed these crazy puzzles and even then I think you wouldn't understand them. Thankfully these poor puzzles are rare so I would say that you will find 6 or 7 of them in the main game and DLC.\nBeautiful game with great presentation, very good puzzles, great music and a strong message.\nHighly recommend this one, it is a great game.

You roam around levels trying to figure out the various puzzles scattered throughout, but for the most part it isn't so much about solving a puzzle as it is finding secrets.\n\nThe game has a charming and fairly unique aesthetic. It takes place during the early 1900s with steam engines, barons and references to silent films, and the world is entirely populated by Russian nesting dolls. There are a lot of dolls to interact with and there are little cutscenes throughout the game to tell a story and let you know what is going on.\n\n The gameplay gimmick is that you are the smallest possible doll and can jump into larger dolls to control them, and each dolls comes with an ability to help you solve puzzles. Throughout each level are various challenges that can all be solved in a variety of ways. You can find just one solution and move on or stick around to find all possible ones. There are also various \"hi-jinks\" you can get into which usually involves using a doll in a humorous or unique way.\n\nOverall the game is mostly carried by its charm and sense of exploration, as most puzzles are fairly easy to figure out once you have discovered the right doll. You will often find a puzzle and have no idea how to solve it, but then find a doll somewhere further away and immediately know what to do. Levels start of fairly contained but become large and sprawling. While it is possible to beat the game fairly quickly, in an hour or two, most people seem to take closer 6.\n\nAnd this is where I admit I never actually finished the game. I had a good time in the first two levels, but by the third level the gimmick and gameplay started to feel pretty stale to me. The puzzles didn't really challenge me and while charming, I also grew tired of the setting. The sound is pretty bare bones and while the russian dolls feel like russian dolls, that means there is also not much in the way of animations. What I am trying to say is, yes the game has charm but not much else.\n\nThat said, because I got the game on sale and had a good time with it for several hours, and it is unlike most games I have played, I will still recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1653069550, "timestamp_updated": 1653069550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528432011604309082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115233452": {"recommendationid": "115233452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098570390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1652149906}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, but definitely for children.

It is easy to achievement hunt, which is a pleasure for a completionist like me, has a great OST and aesthetic, and is so quirky, well-written, hilarious, charming. The list goes on. A casual playthrough (without hints) took me 5 hours, the remaining 6 were of me taking my time achievement-hunting and completing the Hobo King DLC.  The hint system is a wonderful component to jog my puzzle-solving abilities, the dozens of in-game achievements incentivize creativity and exploration. If played \"correctly\" every inch of every level is interacted with and I find that a hallmark of a good game to not waste *any* time or space.\n\nStacking is honestly a perfect game.

Cuando escucho el nombre de esta empresa, es lo primero que se me viene a la mente, creatividad en su estado m\u00e1s puro, y este t\u00edtulo me record\u00f3 porqu\u00e9.\nStacking es otra de las genialidades tra\u00eddas de la mano de [i]Double Fine[/i]. Quiz\u00e1s no sea la m\u00e1s conocida, pero tiene una calidad y originalidad que la hacen digna de estar en lo alto junto a otras de sus obras.\nEs una aventura de puzles en donde todos los personajes son [url=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka][i]mamushkas[/i][/url]. La principal peculiaridad o llamativo de estas mu\u00f1ecas rusas es el anidamiento, es decir, que unas mu\u00f1ecas contienen otras. Esta caracter\u00edstica es el pilar base del juego y te va a servir para infinidad de cosas. Desde resolver puzles hasta camuflarse.\nTodos los personajes tienen una habilidad que los distingue, que si bien individualmente no son la gran cosa, o algunas pueden parecer in\u00fatiles o demasiado espec\u00edficas, la gracia est\u00e1 en descubrir d\u00f3nde y cuando usarlas.\nA lo largo de sus niveles, el juego nos ir\u00e1 presentando situaciones curiosas a las cuales llama \"desaf\u00edos\", que tendremos que resolver haciendo uso de nuestro ingenio, el anidamiento y las habilidades de los personajes que vayamos viendo por ah\u00ed. Lo genial de estos desaf\u00edos es que pueden ser resueltos de varias formas, y esto el juego lo tiene en cuenta marc\u00e1ndote las distintas soluciones que vayas descubriendo.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2603421485\nMe pareci\u00f3 muy ingenioso este sistema, porque encontrar una soluci\u00f3n no te deber\u00eda costar demasiado (generalmente hay una que es relativamente sencilla para que no te pierdas y puedas avanzar con fluidez), pero encontrarlas todas (que es lo opcional y complicado, y que cada jugador decidir\u00e1 si hacerlo o no) te va a aportar unas cuantas horas de diversi\u00f3n y de mucho pensar. Si bien es verdad que las recompensas por encontrar las soluciones son min\u00fasculas, lo divertido est\u00e1 en el proceso de coleccionarlas todas.\nLas habilidades de los personajes y el anidamiento es algo que el juego sabe aprovechar bien y de distintas formas. Como bien dije, individualmente las habilidades son algo simples, pero van a tener distintos efectos en el escenario o en otros personajes y merece la pena ir vi\u00e9ndolos. Adem\u00e1s hay decenas de personajes distintos con sus propias habilidades, siendo algunos \u00fanicos (es decir que solo hay uno de ellos y no vas a poder encontrar copias por ah\u00ed, como ocurre con el resto). Estos personajes \u00fanicos quedan registrados y pueden ser vistos desde el men\u00fa, por lo que tambi\u00e9n habr\u00e1 presente cierto componente de coleccionismo.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2604852117\nNo importa lo rid\u00edcula o in\u00fatil que parezca una habilidad, ninguna queda en el tintero y tarde o temprano el juego le va a dar su protagonismo, ya sea para resolver puzles o completando travesuras (que son tareas opcionales en forma de acertijos). La habilidades tambi\u00e9n se pueden combinar (aunque esto ya es casi al final del juego), por lo que todo esto la vuelve una experiencia variada y completa.\nNo es que lo haya echado en falta, pero repasando las habilidades conforme escribo esta rese\u00f1a, se me vino a la mente lo interesante que hubiese sido ver un poco m\u00e1s de \"flexibilidad\" en el uso de las habilidades. Generalmente una habilidad la us\u00e1s para una travesura, o lugar muy concreto y listo. No hubiese estado mal que algunas habilidades se usasen de formas distintas y en lugares distintos. Por ejemplo, los pedos de Meriwether Malolor se usan para completar una travesura, un puzle e incluso pueden ser combinados con la habilidad de otro personaje. Ver una habilidad que puede ser aplicada en situaciones distintas no es algo habitual en este juego, pero que s\u00ed me gusta bastante verlo, ya que me da la sensaci\u00f3n de que se est\u00e1 aprovechando bien cierta mec\u00e1nica, y de que sus creadores le est\u00e1n poniendo creatividad. En este juego no es tan relevante por la cantidad de habilidades distintas que hay, pero tampoco hubiese estado mal.\nSu historia es muy simple pero me encant\u00f3. Encaja perfectamente con el estilo del juego y con la \u00e9poca y el marco hist\u00f3rico de donde se origina. Su eje principal son temas peliagudos como pueden ser la explotaci\u00f3n infantil o la esclavitud, pero siempre las trata de una forma desenfadada, superficial y con mucho, mucho humor. Esto da pie a situaciones muy curiosas e interesantes, pero lo que m\u00e1s destaco es su final. No pudo terminar este juego de una forma m\u00e1s \u00e9pica y divertida. Hasta en el \u00faltimo minuto supo sacarme una sonrisa y sorprenderme.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2604853835\nArt\u00edsticamente es una delicia. Busca recrear el estilo de las antiguas pel\u00edculas mudas y lo vas a notar mucho en sus cinem\u00e1ticas, m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sica y efectos de sonido (es verdad que esas pel\u00edculas no ten\u00edan ning\u00fan tipo de sonido o m\u00fasica, pero si lo hubiesen tenido, no creo que fuese algo muy distinto de lo que suena ac\u00e1 en Stacking). Gr\u00e1ficamente se ve muy bien. El brillo de los mu\u00f1ecos y el estilo que tienen todos me encantaron, hay algunos muy originales. Lo \u00fanico malo es que me pareci\u00f3 un poco oscuro y s\u00ed hay veces que el silencio se nota muy presente (por ejemplo en los cr\u00e9ditos finales). Incluso un sonido de est\u00e1tica hubiese venido bien para contrarrestarlo un poco. Tambi\u00e9n en alg\u00fan nivel puede que notes fallos en el audio del juego muy sutiles.\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n[/h1]\n[i]Double Fine[/i] es una empresa que arriesga en pos de traernos experiencias frescas, distintas.

In a world of Russian dolls, in the early 20th century, we play as Charlie Blackwood, the smallest Russian doll in the game, and have to free every other members of our Hobo family from the clutch of an evil Baron.\n\nThe game also offers a free DLC with a new story where Charlie will have to free 3 blacksmiths in order to forge the crown of the lost Hobo king.\n\n\n[b]World[/b]\nThe game world is inhabited by Russian dolls of all sizes and looks, and each different looking doll has a very specific ability that can be used on other dolls or objects.\n \nThere is one central location, the train station, from where we can travel back and forth to 3 other locations. \nThere are also 2 other small locations at the end of the game, but those are plot related only and are visited only once.\n\n\n[b]Animations[/b]\nThe whole animation process of all the wooden dolls, stacked or not, is extremely well done. The devs really showed great expertise in giving life to all those rigid hollow dolls.\n\nThe game has no voice-over, but as we progress in the game, the story is told to the player through silent movies cutscenes. The animation is so well done that we really felt a doll was actually talking despite its unmoving face.\n\n\n[b]Soundtrack and sound effects[/b]\nA wonderful soundtrack of classical music accompanies us as we play and fits extremely well the gameplay. And even if dolls do not have a voice, all kind of sound effects, onomatopea, crowd noises... really make this dolls world into a vibrant and lively place.\n\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAs the smallest doll, Charlie is able to stack into any one size bigger doll in the game (as long as they are not facing him) and so on, to then be able to use their unique ability.\nIn order for the plot to progress, in each location we visit, we are given several mandatory challenges to complete. Those challenges, or puzzles, require to figure out how to use the abilities of the dolls at our disposal to complete all kind of more or less zany tasks (such as fixing a clock, close down an Egyptian exhibit or disabling a sickly guard). \nStacking into all those dolls and testing abilities was really fun. The extent of the available abilities was really funny at times as some of them really tend to be quite silly.\nThe game fully encourages the player to try and test any abilities on everyone and anything.\nAnd if we are stuck, each challenge has an in-game hint system that will guide us on what to do next.\n\n\n[b]Controls[/b]\n- WASD to move.\n- Left click to stack into a doll.\n- Right click to unstack.\n- Q to talk to a doll.\n- E to perform the current stacked doll ability.\n- Space to show the way to the next plot related task.\n\n\n[b]Optional content[/b]\nThe game could be completed in a few hours, but where it really shines is with its optional content that may add a good 10 hours of fun gameplay:\n- Each location has a number of unique dolls to find and stack into, in order to collect them all.\n- There are also Hi-Jinks, in-game achievements, where we have to complete a certain number of actions with (a) certain(s) doll(s).\n- Each challenge also has between 3 and 6 possible solutions. Even if finding only one is enough to progress with the story, finding all of them is quite fun and unlocks some unique dolls we could not have stack into otherwise.\n\n\nIn all, Stacking was an extremely fun game that I recommend to anyone.

Which means it still has some excellent qualities. This time though there are also some glaring issues.\n\nThe visuals and art style are as so often imaginative, detailed and just lovely. One of Double Fines greatest strength, imagining and realizing a interesting and visually engaging world is here clearly in display.\n\nHowever, gameplay has always been one of their issues, either only being halfway realized or somewhat unbaked.\nThis is here even worse. The actual gameplay is at the start interesting due to the novelty of the ideas and world. But soon the player will realize that they translated Pint and Click Adventures greatest weakness into this game. The gameplay comes down to grabbing the next somewhat logical character and then rubbing them against the Challenge or Mission.\n\nEven worse, beyond the visuals the games other elements like the sound and how the game feels to play, are so muted that even the very whimsical designs could not safe me from being bored. The game also offers you to scour the levels for collectibles like more unique dolls or little tasks like push 10 people with a certain character. You could do that either by first play trough of a level or by coming back later after the story completion.\n\nBut i will be brutally frank here: i was so bored of the tedious back and forth that by the third level i just wanted to finish the story and pushed trough the game to at least see the great artstyle.\n\nThe story sadly does not do anything to endear itself. Its story feels whimsically forced with some really awkward passages in the dialogue that feels like it is written by a first timer. The way it is presented, in the Silent Movie style (scene, then some text displaying the dialogue, then next scene and again dialogue and so on), only adds to the tedium, stretching every scene unnecessarily in the length. Even worse is that towards the end you nearly have more of these stretched out scenes than there is gameplay, exacerbating the issue of tedium and boredom even more.\n\nI appreciate the craftsmanship and the love to detail that clearly shows Double Fines expertise here. However the rest is sadly far under what i once expected of the studio. I personally would therefore not recommend this game. However the prize is rather fair so if this sounds like something you might like it definitively has some artistic quality to offer.", "timestamp_created": 1598566748, "timestamp_updated": 1598566748, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482014387845993042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74697067": {"recommendationid": "74697067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094803808", "num_games_owned": 3796, "num_reviews": 4908, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 477, "last_played": 1599770278}, "language": "english", "review": "what in the hell did i just play? 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1598060954, "timestamp_updated": 1598060954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.259462535381317139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74696922": {"recommendationid": "74696922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202989419", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 592, "last_played": 1598060630}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game went it first came out on console and I enjoyed it then.

An adventure puzzler (which means you go on an adventure and solve puzzles along the way) unlike any other game on the market, this game is oozing with charm as many other Double Fine games. \n\nWrapped in a fantastical diorama setting with silent movie-style cutscenes, Stacking actually tells a rather depressing tale of child labor. Solving the primary challenges to progress the plot is only part of the gameplay, you'll actually spent far more time exploring the environments and experimenting with different doll abilities. \n\nEach world has a cast of unique dolls to find and collect, some standalone and some that come in matching sets. In addition, various of them have \"hi-jinks\" goals that you can find by experimenting with their abilities. Challenges ( aka puzzles) all have multiple solutions too, so you can redo them until you find all the possibilities. This version also includes the DLC published on other platforms.\n\nFrom a strictly technical perspective, you could call a lot of these extras filler, because they do go far in padding out the play time. But does it matter if something could technically be considered filler when it's so fun? \n\nFrom the very begining, Stacking very well win you with its charming presentation. If you are reading this, it's time to stop now and play the game.\n\nThanks [b]GGPlayers[/b] site for this awesome gift! <3", "timestamp_created": 1597007454, "timestamp_updated": 1607201408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73993943": {"recommendationid": "73993943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014698888", "num_games_owned": 907, "num_reviews": 236, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 344, "last_played": 1474727213}, "language": "english", "review": "You play as Charlie, the smallest of the Russian stacking dolls, as he attempts to rescue his older siblings from child slavery subjected by the Baron. Charlie's adventures take him to a train station, cruise liner, and zeppelin as he attempts to find all his siblings. Each area offers quite a lot of content to explore and a number of puzzles to solve in order to rescue Charlie's enslaved siblings.\n\nEach area contains a number of different Russian dolls, and each type of doll has a specific ability. Some of the special abilities are used to solve puzzles, but many are included merely for added variety and fun. There are about 30 different types of dolls in each area, most of which are one-of-a-kind. Charlie can hop into progressively larger Russian dolls in order to use the abilities of the various dolls. This core mechanic offers not only a unique gaming experience, but also merges seamlessly with the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles in each area arise as Charlie learns where his siblings are being held and what needs to happen in order to set them free. For example, one sibling is forced to clean the smoke stacks on a luxury cruise ship and Charlie knows his sister will be set free if he can end the cruise. He then sets out to upset the VIPs on the ship and get them to complain to the ship's captain. Without this merging of story and puzzles, I doubt the game would feel nearly as enjoyable, but by merging these two aspects together, I actually felt like my actions were having a worthwhile impact on Charlie's quest.\n\nThe story and writing are okay. The story seems to rank second with the primary focus clearly placed on the puzzles. A lot of the roaming doll dialogue is repeated, but you don't spend a lot of time talking to the other dolls so I don't consider that to be a problem. There is an appropriate amount of humor mixed in, to include well-placed references to both popular and esoteric historical and pop-culture material. I recognized Lord of the Rings, Shakespeare, Poo-pourri, and the Spice Girls to name a few.\n\nArt direction in this game is fantastic. The environment and the dolls are highly detailed and animated, which really enhances the doll-stacking aspect of Stacking. The scenery in each level uses life-size items like dice, playing cards, salt and pepper shakers, popsicle sticks, thimbles, and bananas, which strongly give the feeling that the dolls you encounter are actually doll-sized. Every doll is painted with exquisite detail and has a distinct personality. This detail combined with the small animations added to each doll and their special abilities makes them feel real rather than feeling like two pieces of wood wobbling through the world. I found the concept of possessing different dolls in order to perform specific actions very unique and enjoyable, and this is only improved by the design and animations. I also really enjoyed the silent film style to the cutscene videos which really helped to set the atmosphere for game set in the 1930s era. Everything merges together for a truly immersive experience.\n\nThe puzzles themselves were not very challenging and many simply required you to roam around the map and find a specific character that could cause something to happen. This type of solution could occasionally be tedious if you hadn't yet seen the appropriate doll, but most of the time I felt like I already knew what I needed and then set out to find that doll that I suspected would solve the puzzle. Each puzzle also has multiple solutions, so you could quickly advance through the game if you settle for the first solution. I preferred to find as many solutions as possible, but ultimately gave up on many puzzles when I simply could not discover the final one or two solutions.\n\nI played using both keyboard/mouse and gamepad controls. I personally preferred the gamepad controls, especially since I felt that provided better camera management. The controls are incredibly simple though so it really doesn't matter which setup you use.\n\nThis is a charming adventure game with a ton of personality but not a lot of depth. If you stop to examine what you're actually doing as you play the game, stacking dolls is really the only mechanic here. Fortunately the game is short enough and the environments varied enough that I never grew tired of the game. Some of the puzzle solutions can require a bit of a stretch in imagination, but that will only slow you down if you want to find every possible puzzle solution. For those struggling with finding even one solution, an in-game hint system will give you anywhere from a nudge in the right direction to outright step-by-step instructions if that is what you need. This isn't the greatest puzzle adventure game available, but it is certainly a unique and enjoyable game.\n\nIf you enjoy Stacking don\u2019t forget to also play the free additional level, The Lost Hobo King.

It also shows the dark side of the era with child labour in dangerous conditions of mines and factories, crushing poverty and exploitation of the workers. But with charming Russian Dolls. It keeps a cute aesthetic throughout this though so it is suitable for all ages. I think the art style is gorgeous. I prefer stylised animation to super high-definition graphics.

The gameplay basically consists of hunting down the right doll, stacking into it, and then pressing A at the right location. This basic gameplay loop got old almost immediately and I found myself wondering if this was all there was to the game. The fact that it lacks voice-overs takes away from its sense of charm. I probably might've enjoyed this more if I had played it at another time but I came into this on the back of Valiant Hearts, and thus, this was quite a down turn for me.\n\nEither way, I'd still recommend you try it out for yourself but it just didn't do it for me.

The game never picks up on difficulty either, it all feels the same just with a different story and setting, which is quite repetitive. The different abilities are crafty, but they could had a much larger use, and many are never even needed to get through the game. It seems like you are only ever looking for one doll at a time. Instead they could of had it where you needed to stack strategically, in other words you would need a certain combination of dolls. Also the game as whole is very very short. The game can be completed in only a small handful of hours. The look and feel of the game is great! It just begs to be something so much bigger and more sophisticated, but instead it is simplified and just kind of boring overall. Even the story hardly does any justice. I found the story pretty dull, and not very exciting. The cut scenes were annoying if anything.\nOne thing that does make this game kind of fun is finding all the unique dolls and trying to figure out all the little achievements called Hi-Jacks.

Desarrollado por Double Fine Productions, con el siempre genial Tim Schafer a la cabeza, esta propuesta del g\u00e9nero puzles nos lleva hasta la revoluci\u00f3n industrial en una suerte de universo habitado por matrioskas \u2014mu\u00f1ecas rusas\u2014 en la que deberemos ayudar al joven Charlie Blackmore a encontrar a su familia secuestrada.\n\nCon un tono siempre desenfadado y simpatic\u00f3n, envuelto en el sentido del humor tan caracter\u00edstico de Schafer, se nos presenta una historia de \u00e9poca con injusticias de clase social y precariedad laboral. Se aprovecha este fil\u00f3n para adaptar el humor al concepto jugable y as\u00ed ofrecernos situaciones como manejar a una [i]femme fatale[/i] para distraer a un guardia o atraer unas ratas a la cocina de un restaurante de alta clase vestidos de flautista de Hamelin para desalojar en lugar. Como descubriremos al poco de jugar, una de las gracias del juego es hacer gamberradas con las habilidades de cada personaje e ir descubriendo las formas alternativas que nos presenta el juego de resolver los puzles a partir de ello.\n\nEn nuestra aventura deberemos pasar por toda una serie de diferentes escenarios, todos ellos representativos de los avances en transporte de la revoluci\u00f3n industrial, que har\u00e1n las veces de niveles de estructura abierta donde resolver los puzles que se pongan en nuestro camino. Cada nivel sigue la misma estructura de desarrollo que se resume tal que as\u00ed: introducci\u00f3n cinem\u00e1tica con el conflicto del nivel, se nos pedir\u00e1 que busquemos a unas matrioskas concretas, investigaremos el escenario en busca de puzles que resolver, tras resolver cada puzle se liberar\u00e1 a una de esas matrioskas, cuando encontremos todas podremos acceder al final de nivel. Por el camino, y para hacer m\u00e1s variada la aventura, se nos plantean siempre tres objetivos secundarios: encontrar un n\u00famero de matrioskas \u00fanicas con habilidades especiales, juntar una pila de mu\u00f1ecas de la misma tem\u00e1tica y realizar una serie de travesuras que iremos descubriendo conforme interactuemos con los personajes y escenario.\n\nLa propuesta jugable no es especialmente complicada, de hecho no pretende serlo, y nos ofrecer\u00e1 la posibilidad de acceder en cada puzle a un total de 3 pistas, a cada cual m\u00e1s evidente. De igual manera el dise\u00f1o de los escenarios dar\u00e1 pistas a los jugadores m\u00e1s observadores y al conversar con las mu\u00f1ecas recibiremos sutiles pistas para los puzles desperdigados por el escenario.  En total terminar el juego nos llevar\u00e1 alrededor de 5 horas y 10 si queremos sacar el 100% del juego. Si a\u00f1adimos el DLC que se incluye con el juego podemos sumarle otra hora m\u00e1s de diversi\u00f3n.\n\nEl apartado de arte, como ya se ha mencionado, evoca la \u00e9poca de la revoluci\u00f3n industrial bajo el prisma de un universo hecho de mu\u00f1ecas rusas y reconstruido con objetos cotidianos como cajas de cart\u00f3n de huevos o enseres de cocina. Todo ello en forma de homenaje a los inicios del cine simulando una pel\u00edcula muda, con el sonido del cinemat\u00f3grafo de fondo, el ligero ruido en la imagen y las esquinas oscurecidas de la proyecci\u00f3n. En el apartado sonoro la banda sonora resalta por las melod\u00edas de \u00e9poca a piano del cine mudo y los efectos sonoros de las mu\u00f1ecas, muy divertidos y c\u00f3micos.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n Stacking es una propuesta muy recomendable dentro del g\u00e9nero de los puzles, bastante asequible y que no es especialmente complicado, y que encuentra su miga jugable al invitarnos a tratar de encontrar todas las formas alternativas de resolver los puzles que se nos presentan en el trayecto.

Stacking into other dolls gives you a new ability to help you solve that problem. That's pretty much the game. Your ONLY abilities are \"Talk\" and stacking into other dolls to get new abilities. Late in the game it opens up a bit and forces you to start combining abilities, but only at the tail end. \n\nThe few problems I had? The controls are a bit sluggish. Stacking works fine, but moving around (you sort of just bounce since you're a nesting doll) is a bit of a chore. The game's style is also unique, but may put some people off. It's done as a silent movie, with all text coming up as cards between scenes. Beyond that there really isn't much in the way of audio besides a few sound effects, ambient noise and piano to accompany the game play. \n\nThere's also a fair bit of backtracking and the field of view when you're the smallest doll (Charlie) is sometimes a bit of a pain. \n\nOther than those gripes it's not bad, just know what you're getting in to. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1535328841, "timestamp_updated": 1535328841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682336151599884033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44351740": {"recommendationid": "44351740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160965554", "num_games_owned": 667, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 665, "last_played": 1496427057}, "language": "english", "review": "Such an original concept, very fun game, loved the story and the playthrough ^^\n\n10/10 <3", "timestamp_created": 1535122241, "timestamp_updated": 1535122241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44265426": {"recommendationid": "44265426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258622582", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1482299484}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game.

Doing so lets you control the larger doll and enables you to hop inside of bigger dolls. Each doll you can control has its own unique ability, some of which can be used to solve the various challenges the game throws at you. The game puts Charlie in various locales where he is tasked with solving a few puzzles in order to complete the level.

In addition, no puzzle in this game has a set solution. You're given multiple options to overcome an obstacle, which makes the game so much more fun.

It's also quite slow to start, and you don't really get to start playing until 15-20 minutes in. This is mostly becaues the cutscenes are styled like a silent movie; this is cute at first but becomes unbearably slow at times when you just want to get back to puzzle solving, as the scenes are unskippable.\n\nThe game is based around being a stacking doll, nesting into other dolls to change your size and ability. Each level features several problems that can be solved by using certain dolls. Nothing feels to repetititve, as each problem features multiple solutions, from the obvious to the hidden and clever. One thing I really appreciate is the structure of the hint system. If you can't figure out a way to solve a problem, or you've only found some of the solutions, you can read a hint with no deductions, demerits, or punishmnet whatsoever. Each solution features 3 hints: One to give a vague concept that might spark an idea of the doll to use, one to provide a bit more clarity, and the last one all but spells it out for you. The hints are on a timer, so you have to wait about 10 seconds to see the next hint, but I feel that this encourages me to think about what the hint says and solve it myself before just clicking through to see the solution.\n\nEach level also features Hi-Jinx, fun little 'side-quests' to do with the less important dolls. Maybe you need to stun 10 other dolls with the photographer's flash, or fart on 5 passersby. These aren't required, but they're fun to find and grant the doll used a special gold accessory.\n\nOverall, there are some small flaws, but I think that especially for the price, this is a solid puzzle game with interesting concepts that can be a quick breeze-through in 3-4 hours or can be played for longer, exploring every area, every doll, and every Hi-Jink.", "timestamp_created": 1527579152, "timestamp_updated": 1527579479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647543489933013916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42222588": {"recommendationid": "42222588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025286003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 331, "playtime_forever": 2010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1699828325}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun short Kids game.

Your goal is to use the mechanics of the game to solve the puzzles ro go forward, but also highly encourages you to use the doll's abilities for some mischievous fun along the way. Some of the puzzles might get a little tricky, but even a small child could finish the game if they can read. Each objective has the option in the menu to receive 1, 2, and 3 hints.

I've not seen another game out there quite like this one, from the graphics to the gameplay. It is a charming adventure full of humour and silent-movie-like cutscenes, and overall fun. If you're like me and enjoy a good story tied to great visuals, you'll probably get hooked by the many videos you may find of gameplay and trailers, and then buy it.\n\n\n[b]Story?[/b]\nCharlie Blackmore thinks he's a doll. He sets out to try and rob the personality of other \"dolls\" by incorporating them. In the midst of this he thinks his doll family has gone missing and sets out to \"find them and destroy them\" (Matrix fan much?). He finds his family (let's call it that!) being enslaved by a corporate industrialist whom he sets out to also destroy. His family is now no longer poor, so Charlie abandons them to go play with trains.\n\n\n[b]Gameplay?[/b]\nVery interesting concept and realization. As a matryoshka doll you're able to stack inside other dolls (thus the name, duh) and perform different actions with these to solve a whole lot of (sometimes very convoluted, to the point that there is an in-game hints system) puzzles. At a later part in the game, the dolls have to combine their powers (actions) to solve various even more difficult puzzles (e.g. the fireman shoots water for the fan boy to cause a sniffle attack on a guard keeping one of Charlie's - that's the main character - family members). Apart from this stacking element, there's also \"quests\" like finding a particular set of dolls that you have to stack or finding 26 different dolls in a level, or provoke effects on other dolls to get rewarded with a bip-star sound, whicih make for a nice extension of the adventure.\n\n\n[b]Graphics?[/b]\nI especially like the vignette style of visuals, and the movement of the dolls, the way they stack and unstack and are used in different context makes for an appealing adventure.\n\n\n[b]Sound & Music?[/b]\nNice sound effects, coupled with lively music set to the era.\n\n\n[b]Replayability?[/b]\nA whole lot of it, especially if you're a completionist and want to get 100% done and not just run through the game in 50 minutes or so.\n\n\n[b]Time played?[/b]\nAround 12 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1515029410, "timestamp_updated": 1515630471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39029767": {"recommendationid": "39029767", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970546721", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1485052169}, "language": "english", "review": "Intersting concept with some clever puzzles, a good quick puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1515022483, "timestamp_updated": 1515022483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39013631": {"recommendationid": "39013631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068465411", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1489813750}, "language": "english", "review": "Stacking is a game I have enjoyed so much, and for so many reasons! I personally cannot think of too many bad things with this game, but there are many good things. The game has charm, created by its style. Stacking also has a pretty good message in it about child labour, and the gameplay is amazing!\n\nThe game has a strong charm with the style chosen to be 'stacking dolls'. The stacking dolls provide a very nice painted look to them, which goes well with the overall style of the game. This is very unique when it comes to video games, and I am yet to come across another video game that implements nesting dolls into their character design. The music also goes well with this style. Many cutscenes in the game are a sepia tone, with old film effects such as film burn, to create a feeling of time. This feeling of time is very important to the story of the piece.\n\nThe story of the piece is mainly about child labour and poverty. The protagonist in the video game is a child, who is the smallest doll in his set/family. This child's siblings get sent away through child labour trafficking on a boat. The young kid has to overcome many obstacles and utilise his size to overcome the illegal forced child labour scheme. In the process he befriends a homeless man, and this homeless man ends up being basically the only person who stays with you throughout the game. The game describes the effect being poor has had on the protagonist, and his family, as well as displaying homeless and poor people to have humanity and dignity, which can be rare in many forms of media, let alone video games. Although the representation of homeless and poor people wasn't perfect or complete, it was quite a positive one, which is important. And it is especially important to show how children are affected by poverty, as that is rarely discussed.\n\nThe gameplay is really so much fun! Utilising the nesting dolls, the protagonist is able to disguise himself with many different types of dolls, creating an aspect of stealth, or to use doll's abilities to solve puzzles, creating aspects of puzzles.  This can be surprisingly challenging, and very rewarding when completed. With every puzzle, there are multiple ways to solve it, and the game will always let you go back to previous areas to complete and collect, making the game great for perfectionists!\n\nThere may be some bad aspects to the game that I have forgotten about, or didn't notice, but overall, Stacking is quite a gem of a game! Stacking uses a very old and well-known item, and completely uses it in a new and different way, making for a familiar, but new experience.", "timestamp_created": 1514991593, "timestamp_updated": 1514991593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57315748929977417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38732704": {"recommendationid": "38732704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160584580", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1427507928}, "language": "english", "review": "4321/12345 Would beat on my Xbox and PC again", "timestamp_created": 1514370892, "timestamp_updated": 1514370892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461454957723617554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38691612": {"recommendationid": "38691612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025348409", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1514283751}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really nice puzzle game....but if you play it now it might seem outdated.

It is another tiny novel feather-in-the-cap for Tom Schafer, the creator of Psychonauts. The game involves you, Charlie Blackmore, going on an adventure to rescue your family from the clutches of the evil Baron. \n\nGameplay-wise, you move around stacking into dolls that are one size larger than you and then using them to stack into other dolls. Each type of doll has an unique ability that only it has. \n\nConclusion, do try this game. While it is absurdly simple and short, the novelty is pretty cool. It can be greatly improved with a few suggestions. Only 15% of all accounts have ever completed the Final Challenge.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. Interesting and Innovative Game Mechanic\nUsing the Matryoshka Dolls is pretty fun.\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Way Too Short\nIt takes only 4 hours to complete the main and the DLC.\n\n2. Same Puzzle, Same Outcome\nWhile there are multiple ways to solve the puzzle, it makes the game feel extremely short and boring if you play the same puzzle over and over again. If you had so many innovative solutions, why not make more puzzles instead of focusing them all on 1 puzzle?\n\n3. Boring Levi Collection\nThat shiny Hobo collection is not any incentive to replay the game. Make the collection come alive. No one wants to look at a jigsaw puzzle.\n\n4. Story is Bland\nEvil Baron and the need to save a family? That's like bad writing. If the Camel Toe reference wasn't bad enough, I would just fire Tim Scafer's writer. If he wrote it himself, stop writing and let someone better take over.\n\n[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Team Ups\nThis game could be solved with puzzles similar to Lost Vikings. Remember Olaf's shield? You could stack a team of dolls then bring them to a zone to solve a complex puzzle where you could alternate control of the dolls. Currently, you are only in control of 1 doll and this severely hampers the possibilities.\n\n2. Hero/Ally Collection\nMake it so that collecting different dolls enables you to open up new avenues of gameplay. E.g. If you convince the chef doll to join your cause, you can make 1st class food. Using that 1st class food, you can convince a hungry giant doll to join your cause. E.g. If you collect the construction worker doll, you can break down cracked walls so that Charlie can squeeze into them.\n\nRefer to Suikoden for more ideas.", "timestamp_created": 1509718429, "timestamp_updated": 1602638781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36195477": {"recommendationid": "36195477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050595269", "num_games_owned": 1086, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126, "last_played": 1561553372}, "language": "english", "review": "The gemaplay idea is good.

Unfairly so, to itself and to you.\n[/list]\n\nThere's some stuff that carries Stacking. Visual gags all around, from the doll's special abilities to designs and presented situations. The weirdly but nicely intricate levels, for another - the Gilded Ship in particular could pass for a Quake map with its level of interconnectedness and verticality. \n\nOf course it ends with a one way street of a level, so not all good things last.\n\nCarrying it the most, proudly flying at the front of the ship, is the entire premise. Playing as the smallest piece of a Matryoshka doll, you stack and manipulate bigger pieces, solving puzzles and disguising yourself from bumbling authorities - all within a Depression-era narrative presented as a 1920s silent film, complete with wooden acting.\n\nNovelty is inherent to entertainment, and this novel premise is inherently entertaining. The amount of grand puzzles and adventures that could be made with it is astounding! It doesn't do any of that.\n\n[h1]\"Legend has it that the crown was split into pieces and can only be reforged by three mythical hobo blacksmiths!\"[/h1]\n[i]- if the writing seems like it's trying too hard to be quirky, yes.[/i]\n\nIn your typical walking simulator, they try to patch up the lack of gameplay with narrative and story. This is a collectathon with none of the platforming or combat, and patched up with finding the unique dolls, who shine and are impossible to miss, and performing \"hi-jinks\" for the sake of a completion rate. \n\nYou can ignore the little collectathon aspects, but they're the only remotely fun part of the game. Otherwise all of your time is spent just ambling - slowly and awkwardly - to collect a doll, then walking back - slowly and awkwardly - to the quest area and use the doll's ability. If you are unsure of which doll to use, ask any doll in the immediate area. They'll just tell you.\n\nThis is 85% of the game. A litany of one-note stop and start prompts. Wasted potential doesn't even begin to cover it.\n\n[h1]\"I will not leave my post for any reason, barring sickness or mild unpleasantness!\"[/h1]\n[i]- this is about as hard as it's going to test you [/i]\n\nThis pervasive lack of momentum is broken on a couple of occasions - in the last level you're finally introduced to using multiple dolls to solve a puzzle, which leads to an inkling of thought. But it's too little, too late.\n\nThe Lost Hobo King is where Double Fine pulled out all the stops. There's puzzles, timing, lots of approaches involving dolls whose abilities make sense to use. Even the gags get attention, whereas otherwise the bad puns and toilet humour make it seem like a kid's game for a demographic that doesn't exist.\n\nCombined with the level itself, if the entire game were on par with the Lost Hobo this would be a positive review.  It's where the game shines, and stacks itself to the potential it should have aimed for. It's also about 10% of the game.\n\n[h1]\"Time for a trim, boy!\"[/h1]\n[i]- a fairly inventive boss battle and final set of puzzles deflects my otherwise convincingly sour impression[/i]\n\nEvery game has wasted potential. That's just the fact of life, there's always ways that a game can be pushed, but isn't because they actually need to sell it and survive. But it's rare to find a game that so gleefully refuses to even touch the potential it has quite like Stacking has.\n\nIf you want to get frustrated with a game that doesn't really want to be one, or you're a doting parent who wants to get their child a game without any of the pesky dangerous thought or gameplay involved, this is for you. \n\nFor everyone else, just move on.

It was a side project, and it definitely shows in its limited scope and gameplay depth. Despite this, it's a game definitely worth your time if you're a fan of logical puzzles, and any puzzler should consider adding this to their library. Its style, design, and mostly clever puzzles make it a bit of a diamond in the rough, although I will admit that the occasional stinker, extremely short gameplay time, and the fact that its a little pricey hold it back.\n\nThe story is mostly a vehicle for puzzle solving and the stages' existence, but it deserves mention. In the early 1900s, Charlie Blackmore along with his family are a working class family of chimney sweeps. When they can't pay their bills, they are forced into servitude for the Baron, an evil industrialist that uses child slaves. Charile is too small to be of use, and is left behind. Using his ability to stack into larger dolls and control them, Charlie must save his family, end child slavery, and stop the nefarious Baron!\n\n[h1]Hand-Crafted With Care[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay, although not very deep, is clever. Charlie, living ina world populated by Russian Matryoshka dolls, can literally stack into dolls larger than him. Each doll can be used for their special ability, which ranges from the incredibly general to specific to the point of being one-use. Dolls are of varying sizes (eventually leading up to a truly monstrous 6th size), and they must be stacked up one size larger than the doll currently being used. In the final stage, dolls' powers are combined, but that's basically it in terms of gameplay. Double Fine put care into how this plays, however, and this gameplay is still fun at the end of the game.\n\nIn terms of artistic design, the game is genius. It plays on the common trope of \"Small characters use little objects for everyday objects\" (e.g. matchsticks for fences). It uses this sparingly however, and the environment is majorily crafted to look like our real world. The mixture between these two themes plays together beautifully, however, and you feel like you're a small little doll, but the world is still pretty in its own right. It looks wonderful and everything works great together.\n\nThe most important part of the game, the puzzles, are mostly implemented well. It's all about using the dolls' specific abilities in conjunction with the environment to achieve certain goals. Maybe you'll have to dump out caviar, or save an ambassador from a race. Most of theses solutions are clever and make logical sense; you can make connections between presented concepts and use the context to help. They are fun to figure out, and the hint system helps if you really can't figure some of a puzzle's solutions.\n\n[h1]It's a Small, Small World[/h1]\n\nTo clear this off before moving on, the music in this game just doesn't really work. It's a very short (~45 secs.) loop on each stage and it gets maddening quickly. Listen to something else while playing this game.\n\nTo continue from the last positive, I said that [i]most[/i] puzzles are good. Some answers are either ridiculously easy or stupifyingly obscure to the point of practically forcing you to use a hint. I can draw examples of both of these from the same puzzle: In the third level, an ambassador that is anti-child slavery has been trapped on the opposite side of a cloud of noxious gas. Two of the solutions to this:\n\n[*]Use the hazmat suit directly across from the room with the gas.\n\n[*]Use an opera singer's ability to sing near the gas. The logic you're supposed to find out here is that because she inhales heavily, she will inhale the entirety of the gas, freeing the ambassador.\n\n[/list]\n\nThese are just two examples of how simply [i]bad[/i] some of the solutions can be. As a final note, the game also has a bit of a problem of putting the person required for a solution directly in front of the puzzle area.\n\nMaybe the biggest problem with the game is the fact that it's short. [i]Really[/i] short. I you tried to speedrun this game, by finding one solution/puzzle, and getting no collectibles, you'd be done in about an hour and a half. That might actually be a bit generous. To this point, the first level of the game, of which there are only four, is the train station that acts as the hub world. The entirety of the first level is [b]one puzzle[/b]. One puzzle, and you're done with 1/4 of the game's levels. The levels get progressivly longer, and you do admittedly solve two more puzzles at the station later, but this only speaks to the lack of enduring content on display.\n\nTo continue, there is no replay value whatsoever. If you're a completionist, everything is perfectly available in one playthrough. I would suggest getting all the unique dolls and hi-jinx the first time you enter the level. Don't move on from a puzzle before getting all the solutions, either. I say this because if you come back, there is nothing new. You'll only be retreading ground with minimal enjoyment. The only exception to this in the game is a unique doll in the train station, which requires you come back after completing the Gilded Steamship, and thus making larger dolls available. Get everything in one playthrough, and don't come back unitl you want to start a new game.\n\nFinally, the game can feel pricey. It's not a lot of content for CAD$10. The free The Hobo King DLC helps, but it can still feel a bit expensive. If this really isn't your thing, it's probably not worth the investment.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nOverall, this game is creative, original, and fun. The team made a product with an excellent concept, and there was clearly a lot of love put into this. It is too bad that the game is hampered by frills around the edge that prevent it from ascending to the heights it deserves to reach.\n\n[b]7/10[/b]\n\n[b]Great Display[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1498241636, "timestamp_updated": 1511820047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32345155": {"recommendationid": "32345155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066371046", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1058, "last_played": 1598585144}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this game.

I had a great experience playing Psychonauts so I got my hopes up when I saw the same people worked on this game.\n\nThis game like any game had some flaws. A big one was the camera. It was a touch to close to the character and was obnoxious throughout the game. The story was nothing special and the character development was almost non-existent. The interest of playing went down the farther and farther you got, and it began to feel tedious going through the levels. The music was repetitive and annoying except for the intro song which was fantastic. I ended this game listening to a podcast and wishing it had just played the intro song over and over. It would have felt less repetitive. The cutscenes lasted too long and felt intrusive, but without the cutscenes there would be no story at all. When the main way of telling a story feels intrusive in your game, something needs to change.\n\nOther than that everything was unique and creative. The aesthetic while it didn\u2019t really fit, was definitely something cool and new. The game was charming and the humor was ok. Nothing special and without the charm it wouldn\u2019t have worked. Some of it actually fit into the puzzle solving aspect which is smart. The puzzles were mostly well done and hard to figure out and the hint system was done really well. \n\nAll in all this game is pleasing to the eyes and not much else.

I played through the whole thing, including the DLC, and wasn't bored or getting fed up with it for a single minute.    \n\nHaving played the incredible Psychonauts, I have no idea why I left it so long to play \"Stacking\".  I think it was because it seemed 'silly', which is odd, considering I loved their other game about a bunch of paranormal cadets in a cartoon universe.     \n\nAs you can probably tell, the game is played in a universe where Russian matryoshka dolls live together.   The smallest dolls are \"children\", and the ever-larger dolls are grown-ups.   You play as a tiny child doll who has the rare ability to 'stack' inside other dolls.  You can only stack inside a doll one larger than yourself, but you can stack over and over until you're in the largest dolls.\n\nThe \"levels\" are set up with three things:   \n* A story plot, which you need to play through in order to win\n* A set of dolls which you can use to play the game.  Some are 'special'.\n* A set of challenges and other fun distractions to do while playing.\n\nThe story is that your family has been abducted, and you have to go rescue them.   You start off in a \"hub\" level, the Royal Train Station, which in typical DoubleFine fashion is host to a number of fun and interesting puzzles.    From the train station, you take trains to the various 'levels' where you play through the story to rescue your family, and ultimately win the day.\n\nThere are dozens (hundreds?) of dolls in each intricately crafted area.  some of the dolls are 'unique', while some are clones.  If you stack into unique dolls, you get an achievement, and a little trophy back at base.    Each of the dolls has an ability, which can be used on other dolls.  Some abilities work on a class of doll (all men, or all children), while some abilities work on specific dolls.  The key to winning is working out which doll to use when.\n\nThe puzzles are all relatively easy, and you can play through by solving the puzzles in the most obvious way.  Usually, just talking to the doll you need to get past is enough to tell you how to do it.  For example one doll might say \"I am scared of clowns\", so there's your clue how to get past.     However, each challenge has between 3 and 6 ways to defeat it, and some of the ways are downright devious.   They're mostly pretty logical though, and I only had to google two of them because the combinatorial number of options was scarily large.  However in both occasions, I should have just been more patient.\n\nThe add-on DLC, \"The Lost Hobo King\" is a great piece of DLC.  It uses the same style and puzzle format as the main game, but adds a few new bits and bobs to keep it fresh.   The usual tongue-in-cheek slightly adult humour shows through in the  add-on.  \n\nAll the way through, the game tries to look \"Victorian\", with self-playing pianos, steam trains, zeppelins and monacled bad-guys.  The music is all twinkly piano music or violins, and the cut-scenes are shot in a style to evoke 1920s black and white movies.\n\nThis was a really fun, really nice little game.

Unfortunately, Stacking isn't one of their finest games. It is, however, one of their most inventive. In this puzzler, you play as a Russian stacking doll who must save his family. Of course, you accomplish your goal by stacking into other stacking dolls, each with their own unique abilities. Each puzzle you're given has a few solutions, so the game encourages you to try out different ideas. It's most certainly very clever (and with a fun Lego style of humor to boot), but there's something missing here. The game feels too small and limited to really deliver on its premise effectively. Each puzzle only has a few set solutions, taking away the experimentation aspect of the game. It's also overloaded with cutscenes that take away from the flow of the game. Again, the premise is certainly there, but it seems better suited for a more open game more akin to Lego Worlds.\n\nThere's also such a weird disconnect between the gameplay and the game's style. It's a game about Russian nesting dolls that draws from old American silent films. There was a great opportunity here to play around with Russian culture, but instead we're treated to a somewhat arbitrary coal-era American setting. The stacking doll mechanic doesn't really connect to the game's themes or ideas in a terribly coherent manner, making the final product feel like a hodge-podge of mismatched ideas.\n\nDespite it's flaws, this is still a very cute and clever idea from Double Fine, and as always, I tip my hat to their innovative thinking.

I kinda do, but I am so annoyed by the amount of cutscenes that it colors what would have been a really fun, quirky game without them. Here's the breakdown:\n\nThe story:\nYou play as the smallest of a family of Russian nesting doll chimney sweeps, in search of his missing family members who were taken by an evil baron. You're tiny and scrappy, and it's endearing. It's a little heavy-handed at times, since the villain is a baron who's profiting from child labor. There are characters you can play as that are clearly all the big stereotypes from the Progressive Era, like oil barons, union leaders, a black lung kid etc.\n\nThe Mechanics: \nYou solve puzzles by hopping into other nesting dolls, each of whom have a special power: digging things, hammering, drinking tea, flatulance, lighting things on fire, pouring soup, literally anything. The controls are tight, just WASD, Q for talk, E for your special ability, Left mouse to hop into someone else, right mouse to jump back out. There are multiple ways of solving each puzzle, and since areas are revisitable, you can do them all (and get achievements if you do!) but only one is necessary to progress the story. There are also collectible characters that you only get credit for if you actually hop into them, so people who like getting to 100% completion have a lot to do. There is a very fair progressive hint system as well, with three clues for each of the different variations of a puzzle, so if you just need a little clue or the full solution, you got it. That alone would have been perfect, but unfortunately the game ruined much of the mystery by telling you what to do at every stage, not just in the cut scenes, but also with screen popups and dialogue. So there's this whole mechanic of talking to different people, but frequently you don't have to, because the game already said, \"Find this person, then go to this place and do this.\"\n\nThe music:\nFantastic. Lots of violin, kinda that small orchestra, lots of solo violin stuff and piano, very good turn of the century vibe.\n\nThe Art:\nThe art is, in fact, awesome. It's one of the reasons I bought the game despite negative reviews. All the characters really do look like Russian nesting dolls, you have large, revisitable areas with lots of detail. The aesthetics were good, with a silent movie era kind of vibe going during cutscenes, which brings us to....\n\nThe Pacing:\nThe pacing is fucking awful. There are SOOOOO many cutscenes to get the story across, unnecessarily long ones, too. For example, there are reactions cutscenes after EVERY SINGLE ONE of the times you injure the final boss. I'm not talking about a reaction animation, where the boss nesting doll gets blown apart, revealing another one of himself you now have to fight. That would be fine. But no, You have an unskippable cut scene where a group of the people come upon his discarded pieces, cheering each other on to \"Get him!\", then they pick up the pieces in a different way each time, then say something else, like \"We got him!\" then run off. AFTER EVERY ACTION AGAINST THE BOSS. Like, we got that he exploded. I mean, there are also huge, sweeping camera pans every time you entered a new area (sometimes 20-30 seconds long), as if to say \"Oooo, isn't it pretty?\" They gave a tiny bit of aid in showing you the general layout of where you're going, but since it was mostly in the 2D and you play in 3D, it's pretty useless. I mean, you don't get to play for the first 5 minutes or so of the game, and then when you finally get control, you go down one hallway, and there's another couple of minutes of cutscenes. It never ends. It's actually really sad because they were doing a silent movie thing with the cutscenes, and it looks great, but the devs clearly didn't understand that silent movies had hardly any dialogue in them FOR A REASON. It's like they wrote dialogue for the cutscenes and then said \"Hey, what if it was like a silent movie?\" and they did no changes to the script. Since the characters are wooden dolls, they can't move their lips, and have no visible emotions, so do we need to show them talking, then throw up an entirely too long paragraph, then have someone react to it while adding no new information (like to recap to another character the thing we just saw happen??)...WAY too long. If the dialogue had been spoken over the animation, the cutscenes would have been half as long and I'd have at least 30 minutes of my life back.\n\nOverall:\nBy just inserting a skip function for the cutscenes, I would have given this game an 8 or 9 out of 10. But with the cutscenes...well, it burned me bad enough that I started the bonus mission and it started with another enormous cutscene and I just said \"I'm out\" and forcequit that thing hard. This game could have been wonderful, and if there was a way to skip the cutscenes it actually would be. I got it for $2 or something insane, and I DID like it during those few short bits between cutscenes, so I'd say I got my money's worth but I will not be replaying this.\n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1487996096, "timestamp_updated": 1487996096, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30088858": {"recommendationid": "30088858", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960931103", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 213, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1487716396}, "language": "english", "review": "Stacking is a unique puzzle game using Russian stacking dolls, of all things. You must solve various puzzles using the dolls unique abilities. The trick is, you can only stack to dolls that are one size bigger than you. Even further, there are multiple ways to solve every puzzle.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are not hard to figure out one solution to progress in the game. However, to find all the solutions was difficult and sometimes not logical. Luckily, you have 3 clues for each solution you can reveal.  \n\nThe story unfolds using silent film cut-scenes. It adds a bit of extra charm. The environment and graphic design are well done. Dolls are uniquely stylized and the detail in the environment is more than expected for a game like this.  The whole game has a very Victorian, old style to it. \n\nAlong with the main story, there are \u201chi-jinks\u201d you can perform and also collect all the unique dolls. Both of these feats are not too difficult to accomplish. The hi-jinks only hint is in the title of what they are. It takes some thinking to understand what they want.

Political messages aside, the characters are simple and everyone has very little depth but it\u2019s the humor in the interactions and the settings which show the creativity behind the game. You really feel like you\u2019re on a boat or a train or a railway station while playing it. It\u2019s not psychonauts levels of creative but it\u2019s charming to say the least. The story can be ignored but it\u2019s not a bad addition.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nThe concept is that you can nest into other dolls that are N+1 size from you to do specific tasks. You take control of them to solve basic logic puzzles. Imagine a 3D adventure puzzle game where you get other characters to do talks rather than doing it yourself. If you\u2019re a adventure game fan, you\u2019ll probably like the game because there are multiple ways to solve the issue using different dolls but the simple solutions are pretty easy.

I appreciate the artistic effort but it just takes forever to get 2 sentences of dialog out.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]\nIf you like adventure games, you\u2019ll have fun with this.

Usually the solutions are so obvious that the main effort you have to put into is just running. Moving around could have been enriched by some jumping, shooting or some other interaction with the environment but no, you can just move forward.\n\nThere are usually multiple ways to achieve the main task and you are encouraged to find all the solutions just for \"fun\" but I must admit that after finding the first solution, looking for other without any purpose kind of lacks the \u201cfun\u201d factor.

These facts alone might tip you off that I might be biased just a little bit towards liking this game.  I do, unabashedly.  It's a fascinating, curious little puzzle game that hits basically all the bases for me.  The environments are full of small details and are quite varied, from fancy cruise liners to airships to trains and more.  The music is top notch.  There are multiple ways to approach the various puzzles and exploring these options is encouraged.  The aesthetics hearken back to a romanticised past that is, in many ways, charming and lively, though it does occasionally approach some of the darker aspects of life in the eras it pulls from.  Some might say it's somewhat short, which it is (I reached 100% completion for the base game and the extra campaign in about 8-9 hours), though this does mean that it is less likely to overstay its welcome.  I remember when my character first hobbled out of the train tunnel at the beginning of the game and saw the train station open up below me.  The view, with some sort of filter simulating tilt-shift photography (another thing I discovered at an early age and have loved ever since), blew me away and the game just kept right on going with those types of surprises.  It's not a big, AAA title, but it is an enjoyable little game and really stoked a sense of wonder for me.

Because for them you are too weak to work. When Charlie tells her mother that goes behind them, it is awful because he believes so small and fragile could not much. But she ends up letting him go.\nAs the name suggests we do is for the most part of the time to \"join\" the others, in a gameplay system developed based on \"Russian dolls\" or if you prefer matrioska. Your character to be very little you can get in other dolls and control them for as long as you want and the bigger the character that needs to be controlled, more dolls you need to have stacked. Each character has a unique ability (there are repeated characters) and they can serve as something to help the missions or may just be a joke. Speaking in Jest, there are several goals in the game and that is the main one being at every stage to release one of his brothers and others that are redo missions differently and mischief which is nothing more than awakening his evil side and out creating confusion, and giving slap or even wrapping someone made a mummy. These shenanigans you render something different in character (which made the conquest), usually it is becoming a part of the golden clothes.\nThe missions are completed in all possible ways, they release new characters to use and thus complete his collection phase. Although the theme is really heavy, the game pulls mood and you just end up forgetting the \"dark side\u201d.\n\nThings that caught my attention in particular:\n- The cutscenes are made like an old movie playing on an overhead projector, where it appears the scene with a piano music in the background and at times there is talk, text overlap the actors.\n- Incredible soundtrack that will make many remember the old days.\n- The scenarios are fairly large for this type of game and there are many things to do at each stage. As the details of each place is magnificent.\n- But what caught my attention was the gameplay system that was what led me to make the analysis of this game.\nAlthough Charlie is small, it is part of a grand game that is full of characters for every taste and can enthrall rats, cycling, shoot a cannon and even seduce someone. There are so many possibilities that the hours fly and you feel bad, because there is a multitude of situations to explore.

It was entertaining to see what all the individual dolls did, and 100%ing the game was satisfying.\n\nI loved the atmosphere of the game, the style of the era represented, the music choices, the silent film touches.  \n\nThe Hobo King DLC delves into a much quirkier sense of humour with a splash of epic saga thrown in, with a nod to dungeon crawling that was pretty awesome. I'd love to see more DLC outside of the original game setting - I loved the original but actually loved the DLC even more, it felt like more creative licence/control was enabled than in the original game. That part at times felt like one of the Lego games (smelly meat hats, man. Stanky good time!)\n\nThe bonus art shows a museum  - I wish we could have seen that in the game, and I wish Hobo Yaga hadn't been cut!\n\nAll in all, fun, casual, play/explore at your own pace. 100%ing it is satisfying, but not at all a bummer if you prefer not to.

Unfortunately, this world is governed by the Baron a nefarious industrialist that mostly turns as many dolls as possible into slaves.\n\nYou play as Charlie the cadet of the family that need to rescue his elder brothers, sisters and parents from the evil Baron. Despite of his size he is very smart and perseverant and will be able to save his family through different area. (train station, ship, zeppelin\u2026)\n\nThe bonus story let you play another story set in a medieval genre. In that story you need to save/help the Hobo king.\nThe main story features many cut scene as a silent movie with the slideshow for the subtitles! Don\u2019t worry only the slideshow are in a black and white style.\n\nThe game concept is pretty simple but far more complex: as the smallest stacking doll you can stack into a larger doll up to the biggest doll. Each doll has their own ability. You need to use abilities in order to progress through your journey and complete challenges. There are more than 100 unique dolls so there is a lot of possibilities.\n\nIn each area you\u2019ll find several challenges and each of them has different solutions. You\u2019ll also find some unique dolls and have several small hidden challenges in each world called Hi-jinks. You can track your unique dolls, Hi-jinks and Challenges at any time through the menu. Also you can freely travel to the different area when you\u2019ve unlocked them.\n\nTo unlock a unique doll you only need to stack into it, and perhaps use its ability. \n\nHi-jinks are small secret in-game achievements: they are revealed once you made the right interaction using an ability. Like one Hi-jinks asks you to play tag with 5 different child dolls so when you\u2019ve done your first tag the Hi-jink will be revealed and tracked.\n\nFinally when you\u2019ve perfected a whole world you unlock an awesome decoration in your hideout.\n\nI would recommend this game to any puzzle-gamer that wants challenges.", "timestamp_created": 1468942379, "timestamp_updated": 1468942379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560322999954223633", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24335740": {"recommendationid": "24335740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067303267", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1448243882}, "language": "english", "review": "\nI Love this game and have completed all solutions to all puzzles.\nIt is amusing and charming with a cute story and unique mechanics. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1468596101, "timestamp_updated": 1468596101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508928596973419189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24312643": {"recommendationid": "24312643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030784015", "num_games_owned": 8592, "num_reviews": 10534, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1468494367}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a puzzle adventure game from DoubleFine. \n\nUnfortunately this is a very poor quality console port from an otherwise reputable company.\n\nTechnical issues and controller problems make the game near unplayable - googling technical problems shows a plethora of victims.\n\nIf you want to play this game, you must go buy a cheap PS/2 keyboard and trackball, apparently, because any more sophisticated devices are immediately assumed to do completely different things.\n\nGraphics - okay but not great because of the console heritage\n\nGameplay - fairly okay puzzler but nothing amazing\n\nTechnical - atrocious technical issues make the game unplayable for many.", "timestamp_created": 1468494615, "timestamp_updated": 1468494615, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.41573488712310791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24290439": {"recommendationid": "24290439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010082736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 245, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 897, "last_played": 1468324875}, "language": "english", "review": "Very funny and challenging puzzle game.

Taking control of a child who could possess any person as long as they are unaware, you could traverse intricately designed locations in order to learn an unusual story. A downfall of that game was only that it came before its time.\n\nStacking, however, isn't Messiah. Its characters are completely flat, the story left me failing to care, and, worst of all, even though you anticipate an intricate game of expertly using your matryoshkas like a point and click adventure inventory, Stacking is not an adventure, it is simply a collectathon. \n\nAn example of what I am talking about: a room is filled with malodorous gas, which has to be bypassed. How to solve it? There is a hazard suit literally directly opposite to the room. Puzzle solved. Congratulations. This is a late-game puzzle. There are about four of these per chapter, for a total of four chapters.\n\nWhere is the content coming from, then? Alternative solutions to the puzzle that are just as simple: such as using the doll whose farts smell wonderfully to override the order. \n\nCollecting unique dolls, such as a doll whose farts smell wonderfully. You will generally find all of these over the course of just solving the story puzzles.\n\nHi-jinks, such as using the dolls' ability to fart on other dolls.\n\nIn case you didn't know, there's a lot of farting in this game.\n\nThe ability to use one doll's ability instantly after the other to provide a \"combo\" is acquired extremely late into the game, is not particularly substantial, and, yes, you guessed right, half of those involves farting.\n\nMusic is the same three piano tracks over and over, the overall attempt at storytelling kinda tries to be a silent movie and fails, and the only thing noteworthy about this game is the interesting matryoshka art.\n\nOverall, I rate this game a f4rt/10 and cannot recommend it to anyone. \n\n4/10", "timestamp_created": 1462538034, "timestamp_updated": 1462538204, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565078675746917725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22813831": {"recommendationid": "22813831", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987280065", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1433438614}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice funny game.", "timestamp_created": 1462468702, "timestamp_updated": 1462468702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22771557": {"recommendationid": "22771557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117374265", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 775, "last_played": 1462220552}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE this game. I had more fun playing Stacking than any other game I've played this year. It's completely different than anything I'd ever played before. I played using my gamepad and the control mechanics were fantastic, super easy to understand and use. The in-game menus are well designed, the hint system was exceptional; there's even a button that will create a trail to lead you to the next objective, if needed. The challenges were fun and often very humourous. Each objective has several different ways it can be completed so it's up to you if you want to figure out each way, or just continue with the story. Each character has a unique ability, like a gruel chef who's ability is to add thickener to different substances, a raccoon who can see in the dark, the seductive widow who can distract guards and the gassy man who's farts can clear an area of people. The characters move quickly (slow moving protagonists are one of my strongest pet peeves) and this is helpful because the locations get fairly large and you do have to walk around a lot. Totally family friendly and yet that never interfered with my enjoyment playing as an adult.\n\nIt's just so good. So fun.

The puzzles aren't brainbusters, but they do work your problem solving skills and some have multiple and usually amusing solutions.\n\nThe two main criticisms are what appear to be standard ones for this game.  First, Charlie moves very slowly, and in areas where you backtrack, this can be a pain.  Second, this game has pretty much no replay value once you finish everything in it.

Double Fine Producitons hits the nail again with their cleverly designed and well thought out game\n\nStacking is an adventure game where you play a family of Russian dolls who get kidnapped by the Baron and are forced to work long cruel hours, plus the children get sent to work even more. The subject of child labor is found in the game\n\nYou have the ability to stack yourself into more dolls with each doll having their own ability. The game's gameplay is simple, all you have to do is solve some puzzles with the help of a hint system, they can be completed instantly.

Story is decent and the game presents itself like a silent film, using title cards in cutscenes. There are four (plus one DLC) puzzle areas, each with simple challenges and puzzles scattered around. \n\nEvery NPC model has their own ability (though most are fluff and only needed for achievements) and you have to find the character(s) that can do things to accomplish the tasks. The puzzles aren't too hard and they offer an in-game hint system to help you out when you're stuck. It's hard for me to describe but puzzles didn't really give as much of a 'eureka!' moment where things click together (like Portal or Antichamber) but felt more like solving Scribblenauts puzzles. The challenge isn't necessarily finding a solution that works but rather finding all the solutions that work. The majority of puzzles can be solved by bringing the right NPC to the right location and using their ability, there aren't many combination/multi-step puzzles.\n\nThe way I approached each area was to explore the area, get familiar with NPCs and their abilities/locations, then go back and solve the puzzles. The world is small and detailled enough that I didn't get too lost or bored wandering around. The biggest road block for me was needing to look upwards (for birds' nests, elevated platforms, etc.) but the hint system helped me know where to look when I didn't.\n\nI would've liked a run key so that I could travel to places/puzzle areas faster.\n\nSometimes they move the necessary NPCs closer to the puzzle area (which is fine) but it was annoying when I went to their original place (where I thought they would be) and couldn't find them. This is partly why I wanted a faster travel option (I'd go all the way to the opposite end of a level to find a particular unique character only to have to travel all the way back).\n\nIt's worth a look if you like simple puzzles where you have basic tools and then you pick the right tool for the job.", "timestamp_created": 1451253988, "timestamp_updated": 1451253988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19967670": {"recommendationid": "19967670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039509928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 700, "last_played": 1451148986}, "language": "english", "review": "Has interesting puzzles a great sense of humor and great and art and story aspects.", "timestamp_created": 1451149181, "timestamp_updated": 1451149181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19897547": {"recommendationid": "19897547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065394477", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1545580565}, "language": "english", "review": "*Game is capped at 30fps!!*\n\nI love stacking....I love most double fine games though", "timestamp_created": 1450934386, "timestamp_updated": 1450934386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19860673": {"recommendationid": "19860673", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995237476", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1469964484}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to like this game, but I couldn't.

But after restarting (and setting the resolution without problems on second attempt), I found out there is no way of inverting mouse Y axis as I am used to, which makes me unable to point in the direction I want to go. Then I found the in-game view has an inch of faded margin around the screen probably for artistic purposes, which somehow has the effect of making me feel very uncomfortable, not immersed in the envirnonment but as if looking out through a narrow slit from inside a tank. And then the second cutscene triggered while I was trying to orient myself, and I was not able to skip it by any key press, and that did it.\n\nEach one of these is just a small inconvenience, perhaps except the mouse thing, but together they managed to make me hit my keyboard repeatedly, then Ctrl-Alt-Del and kill the thing.\n\nAnd then I found out it messed up my desktop icons.

Anyways what is this game about? A lighthearted puzzle game set in a world where matryoshka dolls replaces humans and everything is shrunk down, scaled and done in a way that would make sense for a matryoshka doll. Since they also incorporated silent era film stuff what this means is that dialogue are not voiced but rather appear on screen to the tune of piano and violins and there is no such thing as facial expression since everybody have prepainted wooden faces and they all speak by flapping their midriffs. -sigh- Anyways,\n\nIt uses a third person perspective with a simple story and mechanic that I will describe later but do read the critique section to learn about some of its flaws.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nGameplay is really really simple to the point that even a child could finish the game provided they are age 8-12. Basically you press a button to possess a doll 1 size bigger than you so you can solve the objective at hand with the doll unique ability. Sometimes you need to possess a doll several time so you can grab the larger doll, also some dolls cannot be possess until you clear the challenge since they will either face you preventing you from possesing them since it only works when you are behind them or they are situated in out of reach places.\n\nSo with the power of the dolls you must then use it to clear the challenges aka mission objectives that ranges from reopening the train station to stopping the food services which is nothing complicated and they all have 3-5 ways to clear them and by finding all the solution you will earn a completion mark and a unique doll. Some of the solutions can be a bit obtuse but thankfully there is the hint system which after a short period of time will give you another one so you are never really stuck in a level.\n\nSo after you finish the level you can either do the side challenges like collecting all the dolls in a set, doing bonus challenges, collecting all the unique doll in a level or doing hi-jinks which are basically doing mean things using a doll's special ability a number of times.\n\nAll in all rather simple, good for some fun and one of solutions for any given challenges are often incredibly obvious. Once you are done with a level your hobo friend will draw a mural for you and display all the unique dolls you have possesed and all the challenges you have completed. \n\n[h1]Option Menu/Performance/Controls[/h1]\nVery basic, you have options for controls, game effect, resolution, vsync, and a few other things but no sound, also what is the how to play section and credits doing here anyways. The option menu is rather empty for most parts.\n\nI manage to get 60fps on the highest setting although it does stutters when loading a new section of the map.\n\nControls are pretty good but character tends to feel like they are sliding at times since they don't really have feets but after a few minutes I got used to it. I suggest  a keyboard since the game don't really support controller fully.\n\n[h1]Graphics/Sound/Presentation[/h1]\nGraphics looks fine, all dolls have these sheen to them which suggest they have been applied with a layer of lacquer and dolls with soots and crayon don't have these sheen as expected. Enviroment are good, nothing of note.\n\nDouble Fine were aiming for a classical sound style and they succeded in that. Piano, violin and period style musics are used aplenty and dolls often grunts and do weird noises as oppose to speaking.\n\nNow presentation. Double Fine really nailed the presentation, dolls have floating accesories since they don't really have any hands to hold things and everything else have been adapted masterfully. An example would be the animal which still uses the doll style and trains being made with pins and cardboards. Good point for immersion is what I am trying and failing to say.\n\n[h1]Conclusion+Critique[/h1]\nIt has a good premise, good gameplay and they really nailed the presentation so what went wrong in my opinion? Simple.\n\nThe game lacks depth. The whole game feels like one big challenge mode  with nothing else to break it with. While fps may have turret section or sniping mission that goes quiet and 3rd person games have stealth section but Stacking have only the power of using a doll's unique power and possesion to get through the whole thing.\n\nSo if you are not a fan of those I suggest you look elsewhere.

The hook of this cute little puzzler is that every character is a matryoshka, a Russian nesting doll that can by climbed, or \"stacked\", into and controlled to command their specific ability, but you can only climb into a doll that's one size larger than the one you currently inhabit. This is where Charlie Blackwell comes in.\n\nCharlie is the runt of the litter, the youngest and smallest of the chimney-sweeping Blackwell family, who've been tricked by the villainous Baron into hard labour across his various business ventures. Being unwanted in the workforce because he's considered too puny to be anything useful, Charles sets out to rescue his family and bring down the Baron and his empire, along with the help of his hobo friend, Levi. What follows is an epic adventure across land, air and sea as wee little Charlie stacks his way into a wealth of loveable characters and straight into our hearts.\n\nEach of the four main locations has multiple challenges that can be solved in multiple ways using the abilities of various dolls. Abilities can range from shaking your tush as a beautiful widow to seduce and distract male dolls, to playing a flute as a pied piper and parading rats through kitchens or exhibits... or even just puking up cookies as a seasick child. There's a huge array of abilities, some useful or necessary, some serving no purpose other than to amuse and have fun with, but all are entertaining and encourage experimentation. I honestly had just as much fun using vital dolls to complete challenges as I did needlessly slapping some poor random waiter across the face with a glove for two minutes just because I could.\n\nThe characters are all incredibly loveable throughout (with even the bad guys being endearingly bumbling in their attempts to thwart our hero), but that's only one part of the wonderful presentation that manages to be so effortlessly charming in every way. Cutscenes are presented to us as a cross between a stage play and a silent movie and accompanied by some perfectly fitting ye olde piano music, all tying together the overall Victorian look and feel of every part of the game. The dolls themselves all have so much charming personality that's somehow amazingly conveyed through mostly static, shiny, painted-on faces, and the world around them largely assembled from everyday objects that stay true to scale next to the tiny little toy dolls. It all combines to an experience that has so much more warmth and heart than just about any other game I can think of and only adds to its already enchanting uniqueness.\n\nIf I had to criticise anything about the game it would be that the solutions to a small few challenges can be a tad, umm... \"too imaginative\" at times and the sense behind the answers feel a little stretched. But, unless you're a completionist, you only need to find one of the many ways to solve each problem and move forward, plus there are optional hints for each puzzle anyway, ranging from slight nudges to outright step-by-step guides, so no player should become too unstuck at any point. The free expansion, The Lost Hobo King, is perhaps a little less successful in winning us over, with its slightly more random feeling elements, but that's only in comparison to the phenomenal main game, and is still a fun hour or two either way, adding to the 10 or so hours to be had with the rest of the adventure.\n\nMost of my time with Stacking felt like getting a great, big hug from a warm, fuzzy blanket and had me fawning over it with wide, glassy, wondering eyes for with just about every part of it. I really hope there are more games in the series to come and can't wait to see what kind of new characters and abilities we'll get to play with like dazzled kids rolling around with a new puppy on Christmas morning.

Also while there is no voice acting in the game there are sounds from certain dolls that are particularly amusing.\n[*]Great soundtrack, the music is really pleasant and really helps to set you in the world of the game. It's quite twee in places but it really suites the silent film aesthetic this game goes for, especially during the cutscenes.\n[*]There are many characters and they all feel unique. In a game where nearly every character is also a collectible you get to really appreciate all the work that went into designing them all.\n[*]Some great humour, there's plenty of slapstick and a fair bit of toilet humour as well but I like that kind of thing. Letting rip an enormous fart in a crowd and hearing everyone comically screaming in disgust and running away never gets old for me.\n[*]There's loads to unlock in the game and loads of extra challenges to complete. While I'm sure it is possible to storm through this game in a few hours, if you just choose the straightforward solutions to puzzles so that you can complete the story, the real meat of this game comes in the extras. Going through the game and unlocking everything, doing every challenge and finding every unique character takes quite a bit longer.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Bad Points:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Player movement feels quite stiff and lacks a proper feeling of momentum. Wierdly it takes a while to get up to speed but when you stop walking you just stop dead, changing direction is also very sluggish.\n[*]Stacking into one particular doll in a crowd can be a pain because many of them may be highlighted but you don't know which one you'll end up stacking into.\n[*]Sometimes the solutions to certain puzzles can be really obtuse and just downright unintuitive. There are also a couple of puzzles where 2 different solutions were pretty much the same in effect and some others which were very different but end up just counting as just one in the stats.\n[*]The sound in the game can be glitchy, though this may just be me. There will be certain times where every sound effect except the music and background ambience will just stop or be replaced by crackling and pops in my headphones. This only happens quite rarely though.\n[*]Getting around some of the later levels can feel like a chore.

Russian matryoshka dolls. And the funny thing is: this game is not just for little kids, adults will enjoy it just as much, if not even more.\n\nStacking is the name of the game and the main mechanic: your goal on each level is to solve a set of clever puzzles by jumping into other dolls, taking over their actions. All dolls have a unique ability that could be the key to one of the many solutions for each puzzle. If not, then it may be used to complete an optional challenge for added fun!\n\nAll of this puzzling is packaged into a story that reminded me of Charles Dickens: early industrialist world with steam engines everywhere, pompous factory owners who try to oppress the working class even more by introducing child (slave) labour, and a witty little protagonist, Charlie Blackmore, who starts on a quest to save his kidnapped family, following the advices of a friendly hobo he meets along the way.\n\nThe plot is divided into 4+1 stages (train station, ocean cruiser, zeppelin, luxury train, plus a DLC stage in a shanty town), all with increasing difficulty and maximum doll size. The first two stages start out especially memorable with their level and puzzle design, but the second half of the game is blander with darker levels and puzzles that share the same goal over and over: get rid of the next guard.\nLuckily there is a DLC/expansion after it, the Hobo King quest, which brings back the creativity of the early levels, bumping this gem to \u201chighly recommended\u201d status for everyone who likes a good adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1443520172, "timestamp_updated": 1443520172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608717024326324463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18244382": {"recommendationid": "18244382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040243171", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 91, "last_played": 1443494758}, "language": "english", "review": "I love double fine games, and I love puzzle games, so I figured: this should be an obvious hit for me.

Fine after the first, second and third episode, but wait, I've got to figure out how to do this 6 different ways? \n\nAlso, the levels were impressive, I enjoyed their detail and how it was all put together, but sometimes - mainly the airship episode - I had trouble finding my way around.\n\nOther than some interesting thematic sequences - a certan doll has to sniff other dolls butts or a woman puts children in cages - it was still an enjoyable play through.\n\nOverall 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1441897566, "timestamp_updated": 1441897566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17940036": {"recommendationid": "17940036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018580644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1617077948}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a neat concept, and I'd really like to get into this game, but the 30 FPS framrate cap really kills it for me.

I mean, hell, it comes with it's own cheats.. err, hints, even.\nIn fact, it seems that if one were to do only the main objectives, one could easily complete this game in about 90 minutes. But then, one would be stupid, because Stacking is, actually, not a game, at all.. it's a toy.. to be played with.  More precisely, it's a toy box full of animated old wooden dolls.  Robust characters, diverse in size and personalities (though, not ethnicity, as everyone seems to be white.)\nBut, wait a minute.. they're not just dolls, but vehicles, too! They're easy to jump in and outa, and speed around in, and take screenshots from.  And, as if all that isn't fun enough, each doll type possesses a talent or skill (from gross bodily functions to amusing cartoon antics) to be mixed and matched, and otherwise, experimented with, and giggled at.\nFrankly, the only reason I ever moved on to the next level was to get more dolls, and different places to ride em around in.\n \nHow You'll Probably Play\nIn Stacking, you'll play Charlie, the youngest member in a family of old-world themed nesting dolls. They're poor (of course), but happy (of course), until one day when Charlie's dad goes out for a pack of smokes, or something, and doesn't come back. Eventually, and mysteriously, all of Charlie's older siblings disappear, leaving young Charlie the task of rescuing them, all.\n\"Don't worry, I'll bring them home.\" He tells his mother, then bravely bobs off in search of family.. and adventure.\n\nNo Matter How You Play\nI think there's 5 levels, each with a main challenge, as well as some optional side trips. In general, the challenges are simple, and puzzle-ish (unless you're crazy enough to set it on hard), which allows for a stress free, laid back gaming experience.\nWell, that is, until Charlie's last challenge..\nYou'll probably need to sit up a bit, to get through that one.\n\nNotes:\nI got my copy as part of a bundle, so paid about 1/4th Steam's retail price of $9.99.\nThis copy of Stacking also included The Lost Hobo King DLC,  which I have not, yet, played.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1435989894, "timestamp_updated": 1435989894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623545944690704346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16818344": {"recommendationid": "16818344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085138751", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1419611349}, "language": "english", "review": "Jumped inside a guy, then another guy, then another guy.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1435708879, "timestamp_updated": 1435708879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16739122": {"recommendationid": "16739122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071542202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 831, "last_played": 1435408295}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is unlike any other game I have ever played.

For this game, it's been just over a week (about 9 days) as I've been pretty busy lately, and I thought I'd sit down and write a review now.\n\nBut funnily enough, I don't even really remember that much about the game, and it's only been a week! I get really involved into most games that I play and just sink myself into them. I don't play games while randomly talking to other people or anything like that. What that tells me is that this game hasn't left a big impact on me at all, sadly.\n\nDoes that mean it is a bad game? No, not necessarily. I thought it was fun when I played it, as the style of puzzles is unique for the most part, as you swap around with different characters who hold different powers, and you have to build yourself up (or drop yourself down) to proper sizes to get around the puzzles.\n\nI remember the locations, like the train or the cruise ship or the station. I remember the game was tongue-in-cheek with its style of cutscenes and self-directed humor. But in the long run, it didn't excite me that much playing it, and I remember very little about what the actual puzzles were.\n\nThe puzzles, for the most part, are really simple in most cases, and you can just use Hints if you get that stuck for some reason. I like that the game has multiple ways to solve most of the puzzles, but it is still not that difficult to find them all, and each solution is usually just as easy as the others. If you don't go out of your way to find all of the solutions or to do the special challenges in each level, then you could probably beat the game in about 90 minutes.\n\nAs I said, the game isn't that exciting to play. I laughed at some of the cutscenes or characters, but eventually the style of the game wore off on me. I completed all of the challenges in the game as well, and while some were funny things to discover, it became annoying when I realized that the majority of them just asked to you repeat the same generic action of one character 10+ times.\n\nIn the end, there is no desire to replay the game, and as I've forgotten most of the details in the levels and the puzzles (short of their general settings), the game won't last with me much in the long run. I will likely forget it in a few more weeks entirely.\n\nDouble Fine is still a good developer, but (please excuse me bringing it up) Psychonauts still remains its best game, and it has stuck with me the longest. I remember everything about it and likely always will. That isn't to say that others won't love this game more than I do, however.\n\nSo if the general idea and style seems interesting to you, likely wait for a sale if you want to try it out. It won't take that long to get through, and it is still decently fun in-the-moment.

With everyone being bigger than him, one could say that Charlie is the only one not being in some way hollow. Every doll has a special ability that may help Charlie on his way.\nOverlooked or ridiculed by the bigger dolls, his only help is Levi, the hobo, who offers him a hideout and chronicles his adventures.\n\nThe concept is very well executed, making for lots of fun and at times quite tricky puzzles. There's multiple ways of solving the different situations, with a generous but optional hint system suited to all ages. On top of that there are lots of optional mini quests, involving all kinds of shenanigans, encouraging one to try out all possible combinations of stacking. There's much to explore and delight in in this small world.\n\nMuch effort is put into details. Difference in height when using different dolls changes perspective, field of vision, depth of focus and perception of sound. When jumping into a dog the colours fade, and so on.\n\nThe humour ranges from fart jokes to more mature themes such as the seductive black widow or that creepy guy who stares at women.\n\nAlong with the PC version comes the only DLC, in which Charlie returns the favour done to him by the hobos; finding the lost hobo king of Camelfoot is just as enjoyable as the main game.\n\nThis one comes highly recommended, whether you want to play it alone or together with your kids. Since some of it's themes are quite dark, it's probably not suited for toddlers as tiny as Charlie, unless you lend them a hand.

Definitely one of the most original games I've played in a very long while: it's charming, it's funny, it's cute, it manages to be both easy and challenging at the same time, and most importantly: it's fun to play through and actually makes you -want- to complete all the extras and side quests! As an extra bonus, it's one of the very few games that I not only found had pleasant music, but I also liked it enough that I didn't care to lower the volume to almost nothing to avoid hearing it.\nOn the downside, cutscenes are almost unskippable (you can actually double tap esc to skip them, but only at certain points, apparently), but I can live with that for the most.\n\nEdited (a bit more thorough) review below:\n\nStacking is one of the most original games I\u2019ve played to date, and one of my favorites. I just cannot tell you how much I love this game. \n\nIn Stacking you take the role of Charlie, the youngest in a family of Chimney Sweepers. His relatives are all taken away to work for the Baron, an Industry leader. Your task? To find and rescue your family, and while you\u2019re at it, free the children that are being used in child labour by the Baron.\n\nThe game is just super charming: the visuals are pretty stunning, the nesting dolls are adorable, and they all have their own powers and personalities. You, being the youngest of your family (and thus smallest) will need to solve puzzles (how to get into and out of places, unlock stuff, etc) by getting into different dolls and using their powers to achieve your goal. You have to respect the sizes, so sometimes to solve a puzzle you have to get inside various different sizes of dolls.\n\nWhat\u2019s best about it, besides the originality of it, is that:\nAll the puzzles are very logical, thus making them both challenging but at the same time not impossible.\nAll puzzles have more than one way to solve it. Meaning you can go back and find all the other ways in which you could have solved the problem. in fact, you will definitely want to do this.\n\nI found the humor utilized through it to be quite adorable and funny too.\n\nThe cutscenes are all made like little theater plays, and the music is just beautiful and very in tune with the game\u2019s setting and style. \n\nThe only downside I could find to this game, though, is that the cutscenes are almost unskippable (you can actually double tap esc to skip them, but apparently that works only at certain points because most the time I just couldn't skip them).\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to everyone, regardless of age and gender.", "timestamp_created": 1417865121, "timestamp_updated": 1436380049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623390138149261475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13234139": {"recommendationid": "13234139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038756563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 102, "last_played": 1417725739}, "language": "english", "review": "really looking forward to this and was so underwhelmed, it looks like an active puzzler with an interesting design, but simplistic level design and poor game controlls let it down so bad. unless it's a big sale I'd find something else, at no point could I describe this game as fun or enjoyable throughout the entire experience", "timestamp_created": 1417753579, "timestamp_updated": 1417753579, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473267912864685059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13232897": {"recommendationid": "13232897", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970557713", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1415944628}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a cool game.

Using Charlie's skill of hopping inside other civilians \u2013 in the way which stacking dolls are known for \u2013. the player must solve various puzzles to progress further and rescue his family. Each puzzles has multiple solutions, so there are multiple paths of thinking for each obstacle, and it allows for an extra challenge should a player wish to discover them all. This gameplay mode in itself makes up the majority of the story-driven aspects of the game, and is both fun and difficult in trying to find those last few solutions by thinking outside the box.\n\nThe game has other aspects to it, however, all as equally fun. Progress towards 100% completion requires more than just problem solving, as unique dolls and sets of dolls (such as a family of tourists or a magician's troupe) can be jumped into and collected, and 'Hi-jinks' can be completed, by completing unusual tasks such as shattering glass using an opera singer doll. This is fun, and entirely optional, so if one gets too frustrating, it can be skipped with little consequence towards completing the story mode of the game.\n\nThe game also has good \u2013 if cliched \u2013 writing, and an excellent visual style, especially in the quasi-2D designs of the doll characters and the environments.\n\nHowever, this game is not without its faults, and there are several. If long unskippable cutscenes aren't your thing, you may want to give Stacking a pass; its cutscenes, presented in an old fashioned silent movie fashion, are numerous and can get frustrating. Despite this, the game's runtime is still rather short, and I myself reached the end of the story in only a few hours. The controls are also slightly fidgety \u2013 to take control of a doll, you have to stand in a specific spot behind it, and groups of dolls can make it difficult to select the correct one; there is also a \"Highlight path\" function for if you get lost, but it takes a long time to run, during which you can't move, so hitting it by mistake is equally frustrating. The camera angle is also somewhat annoying when stuck as a smaller doll such as Charlie or another child, where it swings awkwardly and focuses on the floor more often than not.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, I do still highly recommend Stacking as a fun casual puzzler to whittle away a few hours, and is an excellent package for its price; however, if one is put off by the above-mentioned flaws, perhaps waiting for a sale would be advisable.", "timestamp_created": 1416203662, "timestamp_updated": 1422069818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12887204": {"recommendationid": "12887204", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999186221", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1415701852}, "language": "english", "review": "Amusing, fun puzzles with multiple solutions, not too long.

Para eso tiene una mec\u00e1nica curiosa de mu\u00f1ecas rusas. Puedes ir meti\u00e9ndote de forma sucesiva en mu\u00f1ecos m\u00e1s grandes y usar la habilidad del que est\u00e9 'en la superficie'. Con esta premisa est\u00e1 claro que el juego no puede ser complicado: simplemente consiste en buscar al personaje que tiene la habilidad que quieres y llevarlo a donde tiene que actuar. Si eres especialmente torpe o tienes una resaca tremenda cuando hablas con los personajes te dan pistas que... en fin, no hay que Sherlock Holmes precisamente.\n\nLo que sorprende del juego es, sin duda, su est\u00e9tica. Los personajes son matrioskas que se meten unos dentro de otros por orden de tama\u00f1o y se mueven por maquetas en 3D que conforman el escenario. Para rizar m\u00e1s el rizo le a\u00f1aden el aspecto de una pel\u00edcula muda, con carteles de texto y m\u00fasica de piano. Esto todo muy raro pero tambi\u00e9n original.

Stacking is a puzzle game which teeters on the casual line. It\u2019s gameplay and core concepts are based on the Russian matryoska stacking dolls, hence the name: Stacking. You play the smallest doll of them all, named Charlie, as you set out on a quest to rescue your chimney-sweeping family from the evil industrialist Baron. If you haven\u2019t already guessed, Stacking is set in a miniature Victorian world inhabited by matrioyska dolls. Even the cut scenes are presented like silent movies on a stage. It is not quite to the same scope as Brutal Legend as it is less than 10 hours long, and it\u2019s not quite to the same calibre as Psychonauts, but Stacking upholds the fine name of Double Fine.\n\nStacking does have the charm factor turned all the way up with a saloon soundtrack, a miniature world and an unlikely hero. When all the dolls get excited, they jump up and down, like they\u2019re being moved with an invisible hand. Stacking doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. It was produced as a small side project while Double Fine were working on Brutal Legend and feels like one too. While I was happy with the $10 purchase, I would not pay more than that as there\u2019s just not enough substance overall.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/08/22/stacking/", "timestamp_created": 1408861992, "timestamp_updated": 1408861992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11830908": {"recommendationid": "11830908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078425158", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1365577200}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fun and easy to finish", "timestamp_created": 1408788933, "timestamp_updated": 1408788933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11813930": {"recommendationid": "11813930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022997080", "num_games_owned": 2102, "num_reviews": 388, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1408668818}, "language": "english", "review": "Double Fine never ceases to amaze me with the sheer amount of charm and originality they can squeeze into a game, and Stacking is perhaps the best example of this yet. An adventure puzzle game starring Russian nesting dolls, it's designed around the principle of, ahem, stacking your character inside other dolls in order to gain control over them. Each doll has a unique ability based on the character they play (for example a bear can scream at the crowd, or a seasick child can literally toss his cookies), and it's in using these abilities that you are able to open up new paths and solve problems in any number of different ways.\n\nAnd that's what I found so enjoyable about Stacking. It's not so much the actual task of solving a puzzle that's fun, but finding the myriad of alternative, often hilarious ways in which you can solve a dilemma that proves so satisfying. Sure I can simply take control of the chef and toss the caviar in the gutter to stop buffet, or I could use the Pide Pipper to draw a band of rats into the kitchen and have then overrun the place. Even when the solutions become too nonsensical to guess, a surprisingly handy hint system points you in the right direction without completely spelling out the answer.\n\nAnd of course all of this is wrapped with as much charm and personality as you'd expect from a Double Fine game, with terrific characterizations for the dozens of unique dolls, a brilliant vintage art direction, and excellent cutscenes that pay homage to silent movies. It's absolutely brimming with character and manages to tie it all back in to its clever puzzle mechanics, making a cohesive whole that might possibly be my favorite of Double Fine's recent games.

Hobos are cast as helpers and industrialists as effigy which, along with the child labor issue that sat quietly at the center of the story, suggested a greater commentary that wasn't elaborated on past that basic point. The same can be said about the act of stacking itself. It's sort of implied that the protagonist's ability to stack into other dolls is fairly unique, but neither that nor the fact that these other dolls have lost control of themselves and done things, often against their own interests, is ever commented on.

It doesn't seem like much, but after purchasing this game on a whim(it was 75% off for me thanks to crafting my Killing Floor Badge), I realized just how much I had underestimated this novel of a game. The game mechanics are amazing, and it all feels very fluent and only takes a minute for anyone to catch on and have a blast! The story revolves around Charlie, who is basically a midget child that everyone makes fun of for being so small, and his family, whom, at the hands of an evil Baron, are sent off to slave away mining coal, forced to work on ships, and generally anything that is considered a violation of child labor laws. Charlie, being as he is so small, was left with his mother. He then hatches the brilliant plan to master the art of body-snatching, and sets off on a wild adventure to rescue his family from the Baron by occupying the bodies of keymasters, flatulent old men, an ill-bladdered german boy, and a slew of insanely wild characters, all of which will have you laughing emmensely and enjoying yourself way more than the price tag would infer. If you have ten dollars, and you're on the fence about this one, STOP READING AND BUY THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY!! The story is of moderate length, and a bit lackluster with the progression(you start a level, solve the challenges and progress by train to each other level), but the challenges are the true soul of the game, both simple and complex, all of which have hilarious outcomes(making sea-sick kids vomit on maps, luring rats into a kitchen using Peter Piper's flute, etc).

Many of the environmental pieces come from real life objects, for example you will see playing cards used as fences, and popsicle sticks and pins littering the area. \n\nThe story is decent, you are the youngest child in a family tasked with rescuing the rest of your siblings after certain events provided in the beginning. The controls are very easy to become familiar with and the tutorial is both helpful and non-intrusive. Learning curve is minimal due to the helpful tutorials and simple control scheme.\n\nAs the youngest and smallest child in the family, you are able to \"stack\" with dolls exactly one size larger than yourself. Essentially, you are body snatching the person lol. For each person you take over, you will have a particular skill you can use. For example, one of the most helpful dolls is a lady doll that can use \"eagle eye,\" which will reveal any unique dolls in the immediate area.\n\nThere are special sets of dolls that you can get achievements for if you successfully stack all of them together. For example, in the first level there is a family that has become separated - stacking the son, daughter, then the mother will complete the optional side quest. \n\nThe puzzles are not too challenging, and there are 3 available hints that you can use if you are stuck. The hints have a cooldown timer that is not very long. The first puzzle you encounter involves you having to find a way into an exclusive restaurant in order to clear out the guests (so the 3 people you need to body snatch leave as well).\n\nFor each puzzle, there will be different ways to complete them, and these things will all be represented in your secret hideout.\n\nIn the hideout, you will get a new wall mural for each level you complete. For each unique doll you collect in the stage, there will be a life-size model in front of the mural (similar to Fallout's bobble head collectibles). For achievement/100% junkies, you will love this part. There is also a mini painting representing the puzzle challenge you had to complete, and completing the puzzle every way (3 ways in the very first challenge) will complete the picture. \n\nGreat game if you want a new take on puzzle adventures, definitely recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1405194674, "timestamp_updated": 1405194674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56077110767364502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11198159": {"recommendationid": "11198159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109559631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 507, "last_played": 1405123765}, "language": "english", "review": "A great and fun game, not too difficult and not too easy either.

It is essentially a puzzle game starring nothing but Russian stacking dolls where you try to solve problems by stacking into certain dolls and using their wacky special abilities.

There are always multiple solutions and only one is required to progress through the story, but the game has a way of making you want to find them all.  It would actually be quite frustrating if it weren't for the hint system, which provides 3 increasingly obvious hints (the last one actually tells you exactly how to solve it) for each puzzle solution.\n\nThe game is made in the style of a silent movie slathered with Double Fine's signature style, with all aspects of the game fitting together so well.  Doll abilities range from farting to charging, punching, and even firing a gun and other dolls will react in ridiculous ways.  They even look shocked when you stack into another doll, since you seem to be the only person with that ability.  It even fun just watching the dolls react to you when you're going about your business solving puzzles.\n\nAs an additional note, this game is locked to 30 fps.  It is the only game I've played that I feel has an actual reason to do so, given its silent movie style, but it still makes the game feel choppy and I would prefer being able to run it at a higher framerate.\n\nSo, Stacking is great fun.

Your brothers and sister and taken by him during a workers' strike, and so you're on your newly found quest to rescue them, and find your father, who disappeared to pay off the family's debts.\n\n\nPresentation\nThe art direction in this game is amazing! Everything shows character and is highly polished. In this regard, I can't find any flaws, really. The screenshots don't do it justice, but you get the feel of it. The cutscenes are done in an old movie style, without any speech and then added text, with fitting music. \nDespite the dolls' shape, their animation gives each of them a very unique feel, even in the way they walk and talk, which isn't something anyone could pull off.\n\nThe music fits every scene really well, with handpicked classical pieces, which contributes to the very unique atmosphere of this game. Even if you're not a fan of classical music, I'm sure you'll find it in its right place here. \nAs for me, this might have given me the will to explore classical music a bit more. It's one of the game's spotlights for me.\n\nPresentantion is simply excelent! I'm surprised with how they've managed to do it so perfectly, I really am. From the animation, to the cutscenes, the music... everything is just awesome and you'll find yourself just stop progressing and look around for the sake of it.\n\n\n\nGameplay\n\nThis is where this game is truly inovative, it blends mechanics with the world it's set it, gameplay and the artstyle just fit perfectly.\nDue to your size, no one pays much attention to you. This is where the main mechanic comes in. You can Stack into other dolls that are one size bigger than you, and those can stack into others that are one size bigger than them, and so on.\nThere are Unique Dolls, with a name and a backstory, and a very personal feel to them. Then there are types of dolls, mainly a satirical depiction of their \"class\", I'd say. \nEvery unique/type of doll has its own special ability that will help you solve puzzles or just interact with other dolls to simply have fun with the game!\n\nIn the main game you have 4 main areas (one of which is like the Hub area, which gets more quests as you progress) in which you rescue your family, solve puzzles and just joke around, each with a theme to it. Another area and sidestory is added in the DLC.\n\nEach area the main quest, divided into smaller puzzles. To every puzzle you have from 3 to 6 different solutions, which are accomplished by stacking with the right dolls and using their abilities accordingly. You only need to solve them once to progress in the story, but replayability is highly encouraged in this game, for various reasons. Every solution is very creative and actually pretty fun, so I'd encourage you to try to get to every solution even after finishing the game, as you can go back to every area at will. The in-game hint system is actually very good, giving you little hints that will definitely help you solve some of the puzzles without spoiling it all for you!\n\nAside from the main quests, you have Hi-Jinks. These are essentially challenges to your creativity with the different dolls and interacting with each other to comical effect. Each area has a bunch of them, and I can't stress enough that you should definitely try them all, every side objective in this game rewards you.\n\nIn the main area of the game, you have the friend you meet at the start of the game, and he essentially keeps track of your progress, and creates dolls, wall paintings and puzzle pieces for each solution and unique doll found. In the end of the game, it's awesome to go meet him and see the whole cast of characters and locations in a sort of secret exposition.\nThis is a reason to do the sidequests and challenges, but do them for the sake of it, because every single one of them is very fun to do!\n\nStory\nThe story is pretty straightforward, but it actually has many nuances to it and follows the world hand in hand, leading with some serious issues in a very casual and humorous way.  It's not something I'd examine very carefully, but I like that it's there, and it helps you understand the characters and the world better.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAs if what I wrote was not enough, this was a truly brilliant game, in my opinion!\nEverything fits, the world feels alive and is just eye-candy. While I'm not much of a puzzle game fan, this one pulled me in and made me keep playing until I've absolutely finished everything there was to finish in it! \nIf you're intrigued by it in any way, go ahead and buy it. I'm sure you haven't experienced anything like it so far, and it's great to see some developers doing something they like and being inovative... and succeeding!\n\nFrom the music to the artstyle and game mechanics, the writing... I can't find anything worth complaining about. The only problem one might have with it is the fact that it's a puzzle game, but the fact that it has several solutions makes at least one of them fairly easy to get, even if a couple of them were a bit hard to get if you hadn't talked to the right people.\n\nEnough of this chatter.

You play as Charlie, the tiniest wooden stacking doll. You can stack into other dolls, thus changing your size and what abilities you can use. In order to solve puzzles, you must find which doll to use in which circumstance.\n\nYou can also combo abilities. For instance, I lit a flame with one doll, but the fire needed to be bigger. Hmm, what fuel could I add to the fire? I found a stinky doll and used his \"Flatulate\" ability near the flame and it made a huge, satisfying inferno. Apparently I could alternatively have used a doll that spilled oil on the floor, but the farting was much more amusing. *giggle*\n\nWhile you're playing the game, you naturally have to solve puzzles in order to progress. But for each of these puzzles, there is usually around three different solutions. You only need to find one solution in order to continue the story, but if you're a completionist, you can explore the area more thoroughly and find all of the solutions. You can do this as you go along, or you can return to the area later, even after you have completed the storyline.\n\nWhile using different characters with different abilities to bypass obstacles is by no means a new concept, the implementation of it in Stacking makes it feel fresh and fun.

[b]Stacking[/b] does an amazing job of offering fun, challenging puzzles without having any stupid, frustrating aspects.  If you're looking for a fun puzzler with a very fresh taste to it: pick this game up, you won't be sorry.\n\nIn [b]Stacking[/b] the basic mechanics of the game uses the concept of those Russian Matryoshka dolls that stack inside one another.  You play a tiny doll, and to solve puzzles you have to stack inside of various bigger dolls each with their own special ability.  You use this dynamic to solve puzzles as you progress through the game using different dolls and their different abilities to overcome obstacles.  It is an extremely innovative and refreshing concept, in my opinion, and I loved every second of it.  \n\nThe graphics won't leave you in awe, but they do the job.  The atmosphere won't send shivers down your spine, but it sets the tone. The story won't totally enthrall you, but it holds everything together. Regardless, the gameplay is so incredibly fun and fresh that the mediocrity of some of the other aspects are made inconsequential.\n\nPlay this game.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1392419514, "timestamp_updated": 1449516406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686356723308563232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9098704": {"recommendationid": "9098704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114013459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 879, "last_played": 1394619465}, "language": "english", "review": "Hans is a hardwork actor, shown in every stage.\n[spoiler] \"One more chicken drumsticks!\" ----dit Director[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1392368894, "timestamp_updated": 1392368894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9090530": {"recommendationid": "9090530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011679550", "num_games_owned": 1271, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1405289638}, "language": "english", "review": "A game featuring Russian matryoshka dolls as characters, Stacking blends Double Fine's signature humor and great writing with simple but unique gameplay and an engaging (if a little dark) story.

The characters, the settings, the details great and small; like each Double Fine game I've played, I didn't want the leave the world behind when I wrapped up everything. Stacking is deceptively fun; it seems like it'd get monotonous and tedious, but there are so many small possibilities that even walking around and interacting with the characters doesn't have to be boring. The uniqueness of each doll is a stroke of genius; their abilities are unexpected and often quite funny, and as you start to recognize regulars from scene to scene you do start to feel a bit attached to them. Also, the protagonist is adorable. He's the tiniest kid in the world trying to save his family from peril, and he's so brave and optimistic that you want him to succeed. It's a feel-good story for every short kid like me.\n\nOne thing I will say, though, is that like many DF games the color scheme here is very brown and green, with rustic and dingy details. If these sorts of games make you dizzy or nauseated, steer clear, because this one's not very brightly colored and the camera is in constant, meandering motion to navigate around the surprisingly large environments.

It's ironic that in the train station near the ticket desks there's a poster, showing kids with shovels with a glorious shining sun behind them - this was supposed to represent children, enslaved by capitalism, but the fact is that it's communism that did that. In capitalism children no longer had to work because society got richer, and it's communism that produced such propaganda posters and enslaved both adults and kids with obligatory hard work.\n\nI also didn't like how the whole game was scripted. Similar games, like the eco-fundie Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus and the nihilistic Messiah also feature possession of NPCs and puzzles based on this possession, but in these games the NPCs have reactions to your actions, they're suspicious to what you're doing etc. Not the case in Stacking.\n\nI bought most of Double Fine's games twice, I supported their Kickstarter and I don't regret spending money on Stacking because of the general idea that the studio stands for.

So it has nice little morals and such along the way, and even has a funny little extension to the story after the main game.\nThe main idea of the game being that you start off as a tiny little Russian doll, and as you know, a Russian doll usually has 4 or 5, maybe even more layers to it, and you're thrown into a busy world, with many different dolls walking about minding their own business. Many different characters with different abilities and you can jump into the next size doll up, to control them and make use of their ability. E.g. jump into the body of a guard to open that pesky door you needed to get through. It really opens up your imagination and there are many different solutions to each puzzle, so it really gets you thinking.

The youngest kid must, thanks to his cunning skills and his brains, outsmart the baron and save his siblings and all the other kids... To achieve this, a single weapon: stacking! \nThere are puzzles to solve and, to do so, the hero must stack into bigger dolls and, then, use their special abilities (sometimes weird or funny, like a glass-breaking singing, a rancid belch, a contagious sneeze or a very firm handshake...).

The visual style of the cut scenes is done in a style similiar to a silent movie and it works for this game.  The level design is very polished and everything meshes for this particular art style.\n\nThe only drawback of this game, is that each problem has multiple solutions.  It's good from the aspect that the game never forces you to solve a problem in any particular way; you're free to choose your solution.  However the game encourages you to solve the problem by exploring every solution.  This was fun for awhile, but the levels are massive and movement around them is not very fast.  So you figure out the second solution, and remember that the doll you need is all the way across the level.  Many puzzles have four or five soutions.  After you make this trek a few times it gets monotonous, even if the cut scenes are funny.  I got part way through this game and then let it sit for awhile exactly for this reason.  However I picked it back up and played it out to the end, just solving each puzzle once, and I'm glad I did as the ending was enjoyable with a quite a few hearty laughs on the way.\n\nA good game for adults and kids alike, even though it delves into toilet humor territory, it still keeps it clean.", "timestamp_created": 1355010855, "timestamp_updated": 1355010855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553571403026580811", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "4446689": {"recommendationid": "4446689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037304681", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 527, "last_played": 1331622000}, "language": "english", "review": "Something completely different.

Charlie Blackmore is a tiny doll who has the ability to stack with other dolls and take control of them. Each doll has a unique ability, which he uses to solve puzzles and rescue his family from an evil baron who's enslaving children.\n\nPuzzles are relatively simple, but still require you to pay attention to your environment. Stacking with random dolls and playing with their special abilities is fun and rewarding. In fact, it's required. You need to know who's around you and what they can do in order to solve the puzzles and move to the next level.\n\nThere are multiple solutions to every puzzle, doll sets to find, unique dolls to \"collect\", pranks you can play. There's a lot of extra things in the game to keep you busy, and they're not just pointless busywork. They're fun to complete!\n\nThe style is charming, tongue-in-cheek, and lighthearted. Won't be much of a game for the shooter crowd or adventure game fans looking for a serious challenge, but the game strikes a nice balance between casual challenge and G-rated fun.\n\nI bought this one without even playing a demo.

Stacking gives you the option to unlock clues (which I didn't use, as the puzzles are all solveable for pretty much everyone) and multiple ways to solve each puzzle. It's brilliant and adds quite a lot of replay value. Plus, there are a lot of other things to do as well, like collecting all unique dolls in an area.\n\nThere are no voices in this game, just basic sounds.
