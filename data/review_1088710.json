The PC version was released in January 2021 as part of the Yakuza 3-5 Remastered Trilogy pack. The story takes place in 2007 and 2009, after the events of Yakuza Kiwami 2 (or Yakuza 2) of which the Tojo Clan held out from collapsing and survived an all-out gang warfare against the Omi Alliance. Daigo Dojima became chairman of the Tojo Clan, but an internal conflict started to brew. Yakuza 3 takes a stark contrast than its predecessors, leaning on heavy character developments and interactions, extending to cinematic story structures, cutscenes, and different environments. Is Yakuza 3 worth playing?\n\nYakuza 3 and the remastered version aged the worst of all the titles releases so far. It\u2019s not a negative, but in comparison to other titles, the game engine didn\u2019t age well. The graphics were only upscaled from the PS3-era graphics to its modern standards. There shouldn\u2019t be an issue for anyone to max out the PC settings. However, the environment, audio immersion, and game soundtrack are great and outstanding. Notable examples are the soundtrack like Fly, Aqua Sky, Clay Doll on the Cradle, and among others are top notch and notable. The composer, Hidenori Shoji (and the RGG audio team), has done an outstanding job. \n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the environment is different than its predecessors. Most of the story takes place in Okinawa, where the main character, Kiryu Kazuma, runs the Morning Glory Orphanage with his adoptive daughter, Haruka Sawamura. Many found the story pacing in Yakuza 3 as slow, boring, and/or unnecessary. However, I found it impressive, because the Okinawa setting gives deeper character development for Kiryu as a father figure for not just Haruka, but other orphans. A true, ideal masculine figure not just on responsibilities of being like a father figure, but also for selfless reasons in various situations. Additionally, I like Haruka Sawamura\u2019s character growth in Yakuza 3 as she becomes mature and became the eldest sister figure to the other orphans. Those are the strengths in Yakuza 3. \n\nYakuza 3 does have good and underappreciated strengths, but there are disadvantages, and few negative attributes need to be considered. The substories in Yakuza 3 are the most in all the series, but most of these were fetch quests and tends to drag. As much as I like the story in the game, I do find some plot elements a bit out of place when it involves an outside party. I won\u2019t spoil it any further. The combat in Yakuza 3 is stiff and janky. There were arguments from the community, stating Yakuza 3 should get an \u201cKiwami\u201d treatment. I agree. If Yakuza 3 gets a \u201cKiwami\u201d remake with revamped combat and enhanced graphical environments, especially for Okinawa, that\u2019ll be perfect. \n\nYakuza 3 Remastered is certainly an anomaly compared to the other titles in the series because of the story pacing, different approach on the story \u2013 character development heavy, and extensive cinematic cutscenes. Most of the community didn\u2019t like Yakuza 3 for a variety of reasons, and it\u2019s fair. Yakuza 3 is a diamond in the rough. The combat gameplay and story can feel draggy at times, but Kiryu Kazuma\u2019s character development growth, Okinawa setting and orphanage storyline, and overall plot blossomed. An underappreciated title to the series.

There are a great many things I really like about it, from the story, to the characters, to the graphics, and even, yes, to aspects of the combat that were clearly done in an attempt to raise the bar from the OG Yakuza 1 and 2 in many ways (more heat moves, more moves in general, generally smoother control of Kiryu, just more overall). It clearly wasn't lazy and genuinely was made to try and blow the previous entries out of the water in all regards. I believe the story and graphics certainly live up to what they were going for, me being a fan of it's more light-hearted start and slow burn to get things going in comparison to Yakuza 1 and 2. The only issues I really have are some story ones where a certain character is sent to the corn fields  and some of the plot points having weak or non-existent final conclusions (though not on the most major plot points to be clear).\n\nHOWEVER, the combat doesn't live up to what it should be.\n\nHonestly, I can't really blame the game itself COMPLETELY in this case. That is, when it comes to this port of the game. While Yakuza 3 has always been criticized for having enemies that block too much, have too much hyper armor, take too little damage, and so on, it's clear that this port has made those issues worse and caused a slew of new ones for one simple fact, the framerate. The OG's  framerate was 30fps, typical for the time given how new the HD era of gaming was. When porting the game to the new internal framerate of 60fps the game wasn't properly adjusted to compensate for that, at least in terms of the combat logic. \n\nSome of these issues include: \n - The quickstep is halved on PC\n - Enemies recover their block FAR faster\n - Enemies react far faster\n - Enemies with the Majima style side dash do it CONSTANTLY (expect ironically Majima in my case at least)\n - Common pistol enemies can have issues even using their guns\n - The heat gauge goes down faster than it's supposed to, making it hard to keep heat up and causing fights to drag out longer as a result\n\nIn short, the game's combat is running at double it's intended speed and this causes it to wig out and cause a slew of issues as a result.\nIf you want a good video example of some of these issues you can check out this video by DillionT - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5UPxSKjKw\n\nI will say that the game DID get more enjoyable during the middle and later portions, but that's mainly because some of the moves you unlock which help you delete enemies and get through fights you're being annoyed by faster. Interestingly I often found the bosses, the later ones anyway, easier to deal with than normal enemies due to often having less tendencies to block/have hyper armor on  their moves (though CERTAIN fights can be even more annoying given the combat logic issues). So I'm not saying it's impossible to enjoy the game, I beat it over a pretty short course because I genuinely found it fun and engaging for the most part despite the frustrations and did it all vanilla on Hard.\n\nDespite me having done it vanilla, If you plan on playing this port then make sure to look up some mods like \"Yakuza 3 Rebalanced\" by bdslick and a companion mod \"Yakuza 3 Rebalanced (but slightly better)\" by UMP45GFL. From what they describe, they try their best given the mod limitations on the game to make it far less frustrating for the average person to play, even on Hard.\n\nIn short, I DO like this game. I personally found the combat FAR less annoying than Yakuza Kawami 1 despite it's MANY issues (which says more about that game really but I digress). I also found the story and characters to be fun and entertaining and certainly great for developing Kiryu's continuing story from Yakuza 1 and 2. I think it looks super nice and was almost a perfect transition from the PS2 era of graphics to the PS3 era of graphics for the mainline series. This game unironically has a great many things to appreciate about it. Still, if I could have an in between option I would rate it that, as while I DO like the game I really can't condone a port with logic issues this bad. Regardless, I would suggest playing it on normal or even easy (unless you use the previously mentioned mods) to experience an important step in the Yakuza story and appreciate the many aspects of the game I think it gets right despite its shortcomings.", "timestamp_created": 1700131102, "timestamp_updated": 1700131877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511784493923187256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150202659": {"recommendationid": "150202659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056510999", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1252, "last_played": 1698564888}, "language": "english", "review": "ME WHEN PUNCHCY PUNCH FOUR :)", "timestamp_created": 1700103818, "timestamp_updated": 1700103818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150200267": {"recommendationid": "150200267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198938728540", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2398, "playtime_at_review": 2398, "last_played": 1700098930}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game, and I don't think the combat is as bad as a lot of people say.

I prefer to sing praises instead of criticizing, since I know any piece of media might float some people\u2019s boats, but I cannot for the hell of me give this any praise. The shock of coming to this from such an amazing game as Kiwami 2 is insane, and I think Yakuza 3 would really benefit from getting Kiwami\u2019d.\n\nOnce upon a time, the Yakuza Series was at stake of not being localized due to low performance on the western market. It was laid in the shoulders of Yakuza 3\u2019s success for a decision to be made about the localization of future Yakuza games. Now WHAT THE FUCK were they thinking in laying such a responsibility on THIS GAME, out of all of them?\n\nThis is a brawler game where 90% of your hits do not connect. Enemies are either blocking everything or in a state of invincibility. You are given absolutely no tools of fighting back, at least until you level up. Enemies can block while you\u2019re in the middle of your attack string and you CAN\u2019T DO THE SAME for theirs until you level up. I have spent most of my game time looking at Kiryu dizzied or laying on the ground, waiting for him to get up only to get downed again by some boss with the most annoying barks I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nKiryu hits as hard as a child here. In the beginning, heat actions do not cause enough damage to be worth the hassle. Regular attacks do chip damage. Your grabs are useless on a ton of enemies.\n\nYour enemies, meanwhile, hit like a truck.\n\nI have let myself get killed in a boss battle (Yes, it was [spoiler]Lau La Kong[/spoiler]) so the easy mode prompt triggered and I wouldn\u2019t want to pull my hair out with the same fight again. I missed a QTE and lost what, about 25% of my health? Fuck that.\n\nThe chase minigame is dumb and I dreaded every time the POSSIBILITY of a chase or an escape sequence arose.\n\nThe story Is silly and I enjoyed it. I liked some of the new characters, Haruka is great here and the kids from the orphanage are annoying but not to the point of pissing me off. I played this game solely for this, and I\u2019d STRONGLY recommend to just play it on easy from the get go, if you want to experience the story for yourself. As a story? I enjoyed my time with it.

That being said, let's get started: \n\nPros:\n-Continuation of a great series\n-I like Haruka\n\nCons:\n-Ugly graphics\n-badly aged gameplay\n-tedious mission design\n-not so well written story\n\nSoo, After I've played Yakuza 0, and Kiwami 1 & 2 I've expected a lot, and there was the first mistake, you can clearly tell, that this game 12/10 would've benefitted a lot from the Kiwami-treatment. This game, when it comes to gameplay is a joke in comparison to the modernized remakes and I wish I would've had that. Apparently this game is known for splitting the playerbase from those, who stopped after this to those who continued to play it.\n\nNow the reason I bit and stuck with it was one of my besties and me being stubborn to not wanting to quit, and see where this adventure ends. But I have to admit, I could not beat the endboss with the mechanics so I've used cheats to finish the game. Just a heads-up, everyone should enjoy the games the way they want, I only would ever condemn cheating if you ruined someone else's fun (e.g. multiplayer) but It was better and funnier for me that way when I had to beat mine.\n\nSo, the story starts interesting and strong, mind you, Ive completed Yakuza 0 so it was really interesting to see, what 1 substory told us about the future, about having all these children. The Setting really started strong but the story lost track soo quickly, became stale and boring, it forced me to do stupid shit like watching for a bunch of children, which was really unfun, probably so you care more for them and what happens in the story, but it was really more a bummer than anything. The Ending is pretty okay tho, it gives decent closure tho I am not a big fan of stupid redemption-arc's but I'll let it slide.\n\nVisually speaking the game is not too bad, you can tell, some textures have been redone, some have not. The variety of NPC's is for a PS2 game pretty good, fedality not too bad and some animations were okay, BUT a lot of things felt and looked so stupid, prime example is Haruka's normal walk cycle or anything that is Smaller than our 2 Meter (6.75 feet for those who don't know what a kilometer is) behemoth, and it was quite weird. Also while I'm at it, the sound design was all over the place, you sometimes have really good immersive atmospheric sounds, and the music is quite decent aswell, but then you step on wood and it sounds like Kiryu is a damn horse, or some sounds being recycled and sounding just bad.\n\nBack to music, overall it was a 7/10, not every track really a banger but overall pretty decent. I'd love to admit but 0 and 1 thus far were killa when it came to music and I liked the Joji Theme and Mine's boss fight too, just some parts, when it came to these atrocious chases with people, yikes, just no. Bad music, bad gameplay.\n\nBecause of the terrible mission design I really skipped the side content, not like in Kiwami 1 or 2 where I did plenty, or 0 where I did everything (with cheesing), I hated the engine soo much, that I wanted to get this game over with as soon as possible. My Mistake was to play at Hard difficulty, not knowing what I was getting myself into, and that may have ruined my experience since I've had to cheese a lot of fights (you see, I am really not a beat-em-up guy, more strategy games, but the story overall's just enjoyable) and therefore my experience may have been harder than necessary BUT even my best friend who LOVES THIS SERIES and is really atteched to it, told me this could've been a better game as a remake rather than remaster. So where does that lead us? Besides the story, the gameplayloop felt tedious and was unenjoyable, I was happy when I finished the main story, and apparently I only played 7% of the game. Technically speaking, I'll better avoid this game as a second playthrough.\n\nTime for Story, that really struggled on some ends, why do we have Kazama back (the way they brought him back was just stupid), why would the CIA ever entangle in japans inner affairs, what are men in black, why do we have a dog now??? I cannot answer these questions. I feel like there were a bunch of ideas in a bowl and they just grabbed 4 main plots and knotted them together into a game. I really tought in the beginning the action's going to be great but meeeh. Merely the end, as mentioned before, gave some closure and even that was random as hell.\n\nNow I think I've made my point clear that everything I've played up until now was superior, and I'd like to state that I had some fun with this game, but not enough to justify the times I've suffered from bad game design, I've hated the mechanics soo much, and yeah, I will probably never attempt to finish this game to 100%. I hope there may be a Kiwami remake at some point but until then, may this game rest forever in my library.

But does it put up a fight against these claims and unleash the dragon, or does it only prove that all good things must come to an end?\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n    [th][b]\ud83d\udfe9 Positives[/b][/th]\n    [th][b]\ud83d\udfe5 Negatives[/b][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]\ud83d\udfe9 Another action-packed, adrenaline-fueled story following the famous Dragon of Dojima, Kiryu Kazuma, as he fights once again for new friends, family and the future of the Tojo Clan.\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 A wide array of minigames to participate in, some new, some old, and some still infuriating.

But this peace is soon threatened by an enterprising expansion where some prominent figures seek the land the orphanage rests on and will stop at nothing to have it.\n\nFor the defence of his new family, the dragon once again rises to the challenge and charges headlong into battle against forces unknown.\n\nYakuza 3 Remastered is another gripping tale in the series following Kiryu Kazuma and his ever-persistent striving towards a peaceful life. It has been well-written and beautifully designed to deliver an action-packed series of twists and turns that persist to keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]\n[h3]Blockuza begins.[/h3]\nThe general fighting mechanic of Yakuza 3 Remaster is pretty similar for the most part to Kiwami 2, so there shouldn't be an enormous shock to the system for players moving through the series sequentially. With that said, however, it does appear that some of the more intrinsic details of the combat have been tweaked to favour difficulty, and in doing that, it has become a far more tedious experience than it ever was in the past.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3073806461\n\nIt mainly comes from brick-wall blocking encounters throughout the campaign, with the later, longer fights almost entirely becoming chip-damage encounters. Enemies will block 90% of your attacks, break their block, take a minor hit to their health, counter hard and then resume their blocking stance. While this probably is a more realistic approach to street fighting, some later fights are 20-30 minutes long due to the mechanic.\n\nBut the new mechanics aren't all bad, as the latest levelling style works in favour of players getting right back to where they were powerwise by the end of Kiwami 2. Kiryu can quickly gain levels and power, putting you right back into the driver's seat. This can be a double-edged sword, as it does remove some of the minor decision-making players could do previously, as well as stops you from outlevelling the content.\n\n[h3]A new region to explore.[/h3]\nEarly into the campaign, Kiryu migrates to another region of Japan to live and open his orphanage, Okinawa. With the move comes a new place to explore beyond the series limitations of Kamuchoro and Sotenbori. Okinawa is a far more tropical and tourist-type of location where everything is a little slower and calmer than the busy streets of Tokyo, but this doesn't mean it's boring by any stretch of the imagination. There are loads of activities to partake in, including minigames specific to the region, like golf (which is absolutely sensational, mind you) and pool, as well as the usual plethora of side quests, locker keys and secrets hidden amongst its many streets and alleyways.\n\n[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]\nYakuza 3 Remastered isn't an ugly game. It's simply a dated one. Immediately upon boot up, you will notice its dated character models and PS3-era style graphics, and overall lower quality than the previous titles in the series. It isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely startling coming from 0 and the remakes and should be considered before purchasing. I should state that one good addition to the series here is the implementation of blood and visible face damage on both Kiryu and his opponents after fights, which really helps immerse you into the whole experience, and it was not present in the previous games.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3073805646\n\nThe audio and soundtrack, on the other hand, are absolutely amazing! While still a little dated, the general audio experience helps immerse you in the illusion of the world being alive. The soundtrack is full of hard hits that will have you bopping your head through even the most tedious encounters the game can throw at you.\n\n[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]\nWith the game set to 2560 x 1440 resolution and as high as the quality can go, the frames never dropped below 60 FPS, and there were no signs of visible tearing or any graphical concerns to note.\nRAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 24%)\nCPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 44.9%)\nGPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 27%)\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts - Good[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]\nWhile Yakuza 3 Remastered is far from peak Yakuza, it is still a pretty good game. Not quite as graphically pleasing, with plenty of tedious boss encounters along the way, it still manages to pull a positive rating here purely based on the fact that by this point in time, you're invested in the plot and characters and the general story is still exceptionally written which I've come to expect from the series. Far from a perfect experience, but it's worth it if you've already come this far and want more. For the amount of content you receive, the current price point is reasonable, but it's safe to say that I wouldn't recommend any player use this as a starting point for the franchise.\n\n[quote]If busting heads across Okinawa has you seeking absolution, head to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/hellpurgatoryandparadise] Hell, Purgatory and Paradise[/url] to seek the inner peace you so desire.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1699229352, "timestamp_updated": 1699229352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676753461360931396", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149620225": {"recommendationid": "149620225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078150487", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 465, "last_played": 1699489663}, "language": "english", "review": "The overall gameplay is very retro, the combat is absolutely awful like genuinely you'll want to avoid fights.\nBut everything else is so good and such a breath of fresh air just like LAD IW being mostly on an exotic island with a story that is kinda more original to Yakuza 0/1/2.\nAlso you can basically finish the game in a week.\n\nDON'T SKIP THIS GAME, don't listen to the funny men on your screen.", "timestamp_created": 1699226284, "timestamp_updated": 1699226284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149598522": {"recommendationid": "149598522", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968608379", "num_games_owned": 699, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 2390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2390, "last_played": 1699201744}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great installment in the Yakuza series.

While I harbor an intense frustration towards it due to its unforgiving difficulty, surpassing the challenge of even the most formidable Souls-like games, there's a deep affection I hold for this title. It served as a crucible, imparting upon me the virtue of patience precisely when I needed it most. I adapted to the relentless combat, learning to thrive by prioritizing defense and nimble counterattacks while embracing my creativity through the artful use of grapples. In my estimation, Yakuza 3 stands as my favorite installment in the entire series. Yes, its combat is unapologetically demanding, but this adversity becomes a necessary mentor, a harsh yet effective tutor pushing you to ascend and grow accustomed to the franchise's combat dynamics in future titles, which will feel like a breeze in comparison. From a personal perspective, Yakuza 3 boasts the most remarkable soundtrack in the entire series, and its narrative narrative ranks among the finest I've ever experienced, complete with captivating boss encounters. I wholeheartedly recommend that others embark on this journey, and if you manage to surmount its challenges, consider it a rite of passage that signifies your readiness to tackle the entire Yakuza series, having demonstrated the fortitude required to navigate its intricate world.", "timestamp_created": 1698833616, "timestamp_updated": 1698833616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149219058": {"recommendationid": "149219058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044452741", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 698, "last_played": 1698697097}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to be completely honest, if you came from Kiwami 2 like me, assume it has Dead Rising 1 movement, and expect nothing more than a mid combat system with a great story, then this falls within your expectations.\n\nI am also going to remain completely honest with all of you; I cheated. YES, it's true. I cheated, OK!\nFor the first time, I played this game using a one hit kill. YEP! I know! Sue me! There's a big reason for this.\nI really. Really. From the bottom of my heart, dislike this combat system. I dislike the movement. It is not fluid. The way Yakuza combat is build relies on fluidity and a lot of movement, the quickstep moves you less than a normal footstep would, the character movement makes you feel like a roblox character and the fighting feels so subpar I feel like I'm punching a pillow full of marshmellows.\n\nBut the story is fantastic. The kids are hilarious. The fat kid is my favorite, and Izumi is cute with her doge Mame, the nerdy kid in the green shirt is funny, there's a ton of loveable characters here for you. The fact they let you play whole chapters just focusing on the orphanage is fantastic. I adore it a lot, it's so sweet and makes me look forward to the idea of having a kid LOL. That's how much it captivates you. So if you're here for story like me, now you might understand why I used said one hit kill cheat, just so I could get through this game's clunkyness and remain entertained by what is the real focus here, its narrative.\n\nAnd to be honest? I loved it. Certain things I can't comment on, even if I generalize and point to a specific section without being specific on what that section entails, it will spoil, so I won't say anything else.\n\nStart with Yakuza 0, play Kiwami 1, then 2, then this.\n\nAnd enjoy 4. Cos I don't think you will feel the same way about 3 as you do 4, it will only get better from here, in terms of gameplay! Story wise, amazing, enjoy it! Oh, and don't listen to those kids online who tell you this game sucks and overly critique it, none of them probably played ps2/ps3 and if they did they really are just hating for no good reason. All non spoiler pros and cons were addressed which were the main focus for all the hate this game got.

Moreover, in my opinion, it tells the most emotional and well-rounded story in the series up to that point. However, even though Yakuza 3 did a great job bringing the series to a new generation, it certainly has its flaws. The biggest, in my opinion, has to be the orphanage sections. For the uninformed, the first few chapters of Yakuza 3 revolve around Kazuma taking care of the children at an orphanage he runs. As a result, there's very little combat, the pace is very slow, and the main storyline kind of takes a back seat. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I did actually enjoy the first few chapters, the problem comes about a third into the game when it pops up again; the intense and fast pacing gets cut off very suddenly and doesn't return for close to two hours. Again, while these sections aren't necessarily bad and do help build Kazuma's character and give the player time to do some side-missions, they just go on for too long and cause the pacing to come to a crawl.

Trust me on this.\n\nI think most of my frustrations lie within the fact that this is labeled as a 'remaster' when it's clearly a bare-bones port of the original title to PC. There are some very obvious bugs when it comes to combat that arise from frame-rate issues, as the 'window' for QTEs is insanely small and enemies will occasionally just phase through your attacks. Furthermore, enemy AI is predisposed to just hold block as you relentlessly flail doing zero chip damage, even with guns and swords. Combat is easily the most broken part of this title and I'll just leave it at that.\n\nThe story, as always, is full of intrigue, strange tonal shifts, and death fakeouts akin to a daytime soap opera. Y3 features some of the most interesting characters but the plot itself can't support them as everything just slows to a crawl for the middle 8 chapters. The finale is pretty damn fun, however, so you have that to look forward to.\n\nY3 often drags but there are some high points.

You've honed your skills on all the minigames, you've adapted to different styles of combat, even if you miss the style changes and play styles you adopted in the canonically earlier titles. \n\nPrepare to be SLAPPED by this game. It will make you miserable. Everything from combat to pool is a less refined downgrade. You CAN master the mechanics and dictate any battle in this game, but it's a process of learning un-fun jank, not necessarily skill. \n\nThe earliest jank you'll lean on is throwing enemies in combat. Enemies will often resist your throw, so you'll have to spam the throw button (B) every time you want to get any damage in - ESPECIALLY before you learn tiger drop and the throw counter. Worst thing in the world? No. But it turns easy encounters into button mashing slogs for the initial chapters of the game. \n\nLater jank involves running away from enemies to charge your heat bar. In a handful of the Ultimate Challenges this is necessary to proceed/preserve health for multiboss unhealable encounters. Again, not the worst thing in the world, just tedious and not fun. \n\nThe combat can be mastered - it'll really click when you do the coliseum & challenges. Pro-tip, switch up between Tiger Drop (Y) and Grab Counter knee in the stomach (B) which both have the same trigger conditions. Combat isn't even really the problem here, it's just a slog. \n\nThe real list of painful terrible things in this game are as follow:\n- Club hostess minigame (I thought softlocked my game with this accidentally. 3+ hours of a cycle where I couldn't make any progress on this and every guide had no solutions. TERRIBLE, worst thing in ANY Yakuza game so far.)\n- Hostess dates (Be prepared to sink 5+ hours into these even with a guide to complete the substories.)\n- Pool (must use keyboard and mouse or artificially disable joystick inputs. Insane.)\n- Back to the future guy substory (Lau Ka Long 3 v 1 fight.) \n- Batting cage expert mode \n- Orphanage focused content that locks the main story, especially Haruka's drug dealing side content.\n- Trash on the beach pick up (doesn't always register as a successful pick up of trash. I went over 50 on my count, really janky)\n- Knocking down pedestrians (again, doesn't register in the game engine when you knock people down. Unclear what the actual trigger is but eventually it works. Just takes forever.)\n- Damage output in legendary craters, enjoy spamming heat actions and dominating fights that overstay their welcome. It's not hard, it's just annoying. \n- Heat finishers (Do you enjoy doing a quicktime minigame every boss fight? Get used to it sport.)\n- No option to run in the overworld (this one feels like a reversion to the stone age.)\n- Running minigames where any slight bump destroys Kiryu but not the person/thing you're chasing (The ultimate Mack race in ultimate challenges is a special hellish endeavor. I think these come back in Y-4...)\n- THE STORY [spoiler](They did Kashiwagi so dirty in this one. If you've been paying attention since the early games, this story REEKS. Chapter 10 is just you sitting around for an hour and the game explains everything to you. Mine is by far the worst final boss in the series, so uninspired, his motivations barely make sense, and he ends by hugging you limply? Just silly. The CIA tie-in is weird and unnecessary, your dead adoptive father has a twin brother??? Compared to EVERY other Yakuza this game is insultingly bad.)[/spoiler] \n\nGood luck everyone.

It also has some really stupid twists, I mean [spoiler] Joji? Fucking seriously? [/spoiler]\n\nBuy this on sale and rush through it to get to Yakuza 4 tbh.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[i]I really wish there was a \"Maybe\" button for these recommendations, I'll also update my review after a complete playthrough.\n\nWhere to start? Guess I'll start with the main story, I haven't finished it yet but it's fucking sloppy and slow the chapters I've played and a bit political if you ask me.\n\nGameplay is...

Fights are annoying with how much block enemies use only to combo your ass with no time to put up a guard yourself so you end up going through more healing items than in other games in the series. \n\nSubstories are weird, they pop up as ? on the minimap but it doesn't even notify you started a new one nor gives you its name like in previous games making tracking longer by having to go into the menu to find out which ones you've done, I can tell I'm not really gonna bother with all of them save for some of them which tie into the story or so I've heard.\n\nFuck golfing.

(Crying in my Daddy issues)\n\nAlthough I feel the frustration through out the game, considered using trainer, I finished the game completely in the end without any cheats, maybe slightly rushed through out the story though. \nBut, looking back seeing the whole journey, something strikes me.\n\nThe game itself was more than just Yakuza, brawling, crime, humour, unlike previous episodes. Most of the things aren't even about any of those. \n- Yes the combat sucks, is there a way to get around it? Of course. But it doesn't have that combat feeling like any other  Yakuza games series always have, this will make you feel more like playing Dark Souls. \n- Yes half of the story is about the orphanage kids, drama wasn't really a roller coaster ride as half way the story some MF CEO will tell you almost everything you need to know. \n- Yes most mini games and side activities sucks like to run and catch, or even your typical darts, pool or what not. Using keyboard/mouse and Controllers wouldn't even able to save you in some situations. \n- Yes even the weapon modding or even using weapons are just straight out BS, most of the time you wouldn't even touch it unless it's a pew pew. \nI can keep going on if I have to. \n\nIn the end, I adore and love the game. \nNot becuase it sucks, but how all those flaws become a true test of this Father Figure simulator. Everything is so hard to deal with and require such high amount of patience and precision, accuracy to what you do, just like a real father. \nYes the combat can be encountered by looking for a good opening to hit it right on time at the right distance.\nYes everything you do felt like a grind but yet it make sense once you grinded the sub story and go back to main quest with all those exp, skills and money.\nYes the most difficult parts of the game wasn't in the end, it came at you unexpectedly mid game such as Lau Ka Long, and you need to go through it just to keep going on with the game or story knowing everything comes after just gets easier. \nYes you can become powerful or even OP at a certain point like other Yakuza titles but not until you able to defeat the most difficult parts in the game. \n\nIn a nutshell, everything you do in the game test your ability to become a true father figure. \nFrom the game play, story unfold, mechanics, challenges, everything require the same traits of a real father have. \nI grew from all those controller throwing keyboard flipping fights for sure. \n\nand that's how the bad become part of the game's essence, true to Kiryu situation being retired but have to deal with everything while being a father figure. \n\nWill i play it again? Maybe, maybe not, but no way you should skip through this chapter just becuase of those reasons.\n\nBesides, \nIt's still better than any Ubisoft game ever released.

Remaster. This refreshed take on the PS3 classic had me hooked all over again on the series' gripping storytelling and quirky personality.\n\nVisually, the remake really impresses. Kamurocho's neon-lit streets and Okinawa's sunny beaches look better than ever while retaining that distinct Yakuza flavor. The upgraded character models and textures bring everything to life in a modern yet faithful way. It was like seeing an old friend get a makeover.\n\nOf course, visuals can only go so far - the narrative depth is what had me invested for the long haul. Kiryu trying to leave his past behind to run an orphanage tugs at the heartstrings. I felt even more connected to the motivations driving him and the colorful supporting cast.\n\nSpeaking of the cast, the localization and voice acting are top notch. I really felt immersed in every emotional beat and conversation thanks to performances bringing out that naturalistic Yakuza charm. The writing carries humor and gravitas equally well.\n\nCombat still carries that satisfying brawler feel, letting you pummel goons with basic combos and environmental objects. It's easy to pick up but with enough heat actions and combos to master that veterans like me stay engaged. A few more modern quality-of-life improvements could've smoothed things out further.\n\nIn the end, even after completing Yakuza 3 multiple times before, this remaster pulled me back in with improved visuals and storytelling. Sure, some sections drag a bit, and it's not as polished as recent entries. But for longtime fans or newcomers, it's an offer you can't refuse.

In the third chapter, we are busy with Super Mario and his child, with melon and pineapples as background characters. Super Mario's child, who is named after alcohol, was kidnapped by the Italian drug cartel, and we must save her. Then we become the third Mario brother.\nIn my extensive analysis of Yakuza 3, I discovered hidden easter eggs that only exist in my wildest imagination. For instance, during the epic boss battle in Chapter 6, Kiryu unleashed his secret martial arts move known as the 'Flying Noodle Fist,' where he flung ramen noodles at his foes with astonishing accuracy, leaving them both defeated and hungry.\nIn Chapter 8, there's a completely fabricated mini-game where Kiryu becomes a professional penguin wrestler, taking on the toughest penguin opponents in Antarctica. The penguins wore tiny top hats and tuxedos, adding a touch of class to this fictional bout.\nThe side quest involving Super Mario and his child took an unexpected twist when they revealed their secret power-up mushrooms that turned Kiryu into a giant, stomping his way through the streets of Kamurocho, causing traffic jams and chaos, while singing the national anthem of a made-up country.\nLet's not forget the rare 'Singing Yakuza' sub-story in Chapter 9, where Kiryu and his Yakuza buddies formed a boy band and had dance-offs with rival gangs. The dance-offs were so intense that they caused spontaneous rainbows to appear in the sky.\nBy the time I reached Chapter 10, Kiryu had become a master chef, and there was a whole cooking mini-game where he competed in Iron Chef-style battles against other characters. His signature dish? Sushi made from fish he caught barehanded in the sewers.\nAll in all, Yakuza 3 is a game that defies reality at every turn, offering an absurd and fictionalized version of Kamurocho that kept me entertained with its bizarre surprises and completely untrue moments.

While this remastered version attempts to revive the classic Yakuza experience, it falls short in several key areas, making it a less-than-stellar entry in the series.\n\nGraphics and Visuals (2/5):\nThe visual improvements in \"Yakuza 3 Remastered\" are barely noticeable, leaving the game feeling dated and lacking the polish that fans of the series have come to expect. Character models and environments still show their age, and the attempt to modernize them feels half-hearted at best. It's a missed opportunity to truly breathe new life into this classic.\n\nGameplay (2/5):\nWhile the core gameplay mechanics are intact, they also reveal the shortcomings of an older title. The combat system, which was groundbreaking in its time, now feels clunky and unrefined compared to more recent entries in the series. The lack of improvements in this area is disappointing and makes the game feel like a relic from a different era.\n\nStory and Characters (3/5):\nThe storytelling in \"Yakuza 3 Remastered\" is one of its stronger points, but it still doesn't measure up to the standards set by later games in the series. The narrative lacks the depth and complexity that fans have come to expect, and while it explores Kiryu's personal journey, it fails to deliver the same emotional impact as some of the later Yakuza titles. The characters, while decently developed, don't leave a lasting impression.\n\nContent and Extras (2/5):\nWhile the remastered version includes all the original content, it doesn't offer much in the way of additional extras or improvements. The lack of new features or enhancements makes it feel like a missed opportunity to provide a more comprehensive and enticing package for both longtime fans and newcomers.\n\nSound and Music (3/5):\nThe sound and music in \"Yakuza 3 Remastered\" are serviceable, but they don't stand out in the same way as in later entries in the series. The voice acting is decent, but it lacks the exceptional performances found in more recent Yakuza games. The soundtrack, while fitting, doesn't leave a memorable impression.\n\nOverall, \"Yakuza 3 Remastered\" is a lackluster attempt to revive a classic. While it may hold some nostalgia for longtime fans of the series, it fails to capture the magic and excitement of more recent Yakuza titles and struggles to compete with the standards set by modern gaming. this is going to take me some time to beat since i last beat it on the ps3", "timestamp_created": 1694018509, "timestamp_updated": 1694018509, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446345895528793335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145721728": {"recommendationid": "145721728", "author": {"steamid": "76561199138484396", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1893, "last_played": 1694011942}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game overall.

I've played 0, Kiwami, Kiwami 2, and now, 3 Remastered. \nThis is the most dated game out of the Yakuza PC ports, and it shows. \nThe graphics are a little jarring at first, however they will grow on you, especially if you've played other PS3 era games.\n\nThe levelling system is very linear and the combat feels very restricting. Enemies block way too many attacks, which makes a lot of fights feel frustrating. Admittedly, I can't speak for how the Komaki moves affect combat because I completely missed him, however, I blame this on another flaw of the game. \n\nUnlike the more modern games/remakes, Yakuza 3 is lacking in incentives to engage with optional content. In the other games mentioned above, various events will interrupt your flow to entice you to do substories, play minigames, etc. Additionally, Yakuza 0's dual protagonists system creates a mild sense of FOMO for progressing the main story without doing side content while you have the chance (without making it too punishing). Yakuza 3 has nothing of the sort, and some of the side content is pretty well hidden in areas you mightn't think to check as you've already fully explored Kamurocho in 2-3 games by this point.\n\nThis game's biggest redeeming quality is it's story. While the story[i]telling[/i] isn't the best, the contents of the story are brilliant and it is a vital part of Kiryu's character growth. There are also some legendary moments, including one of the most emotional scenes in the series so far.\n\nMy review may seem quite negative, but I'm reccomending it because, despite its flaws I still enjoyed it, and it is essential for anyone who wants the experience of playing through the whole series chronologically.

You will not miss any good gameplay.\nDETAILS:\nPositives:\n- Facial Rigging and animations for talking/expressions during cutscenes is a lot better than they were in past games.\n\n- Money grind is a lot less strict than past games, you'll find yourself spending significantly less to heal yourself at restaurants. \n\nNow that that's out of the way...\n\nNegatives:\n- You spend the first few chapters in an absolute slog being a glorified errand boy. Imagine all the really boring substories from past games, mash them together into a Frankenstein's Monster of garbage, and make them part of the main story, and you have the first 5 or so chapters of Yakuza 3.\n\n- Combat is totally broken. Enemies will spam blocks all the time, so you better get a weapon that can break block early! Oh wait, you can't!\n\n- Coin Lockers, which worked to benefit players who explored the cities regardless of what chapter they were on, have been reworked. Keys no longer spawn in the first few chapters.\n\n- Heat Burn-Out was re-added. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if they didn't make it so you didn't get an absolutely pitiful amount of Heat per attack. Heat Actions are useless to the player until they obtain significant upgrades to their Heat skill tree. Getting grabbed by enemies is basically a GG for atleast half of your Heat Bar as well, because you lose Heat much quicker while grabbed.\n\n- EXP System is bogus. You can no longer choose what upgrade you want to get next, like every single past installment, the game now uses a predetermined skill path for each of the 4 skill \"trees\": Soul, Heat, Body, and Tech.\n\n- The animations are really clunky, stiff, and overall unnatural. Kiryu can now turn on a dime without needing to take a second to stop his forward momentum.\n\n- Groups of enemies no longer show up on the map until they're sprinting at you. Better memorize their outfits and spawns, cause one unexpected enemy encounter can and probably will send you back to the main menu!\n\n- The new city is cool and all, but it somehow manages to have less explorable ground than Sotenbori, which is a literal fucking square.\n\n- Enemies do significantly more damage to an unprepared player if they play on Normal difficulty. You will frequently be using Staminan XX to recover from street fights instead of just using a Toughness L or two.\n\n- The inventory system has returned to the Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1 system of limited slots and non-stacking items. Refer to the points made earlier about Heat and Enemy Damage.\n\n\n-------SPOILERS AHEAD-------\n\nThe story, if you can even call it a story, is utter horseshit. You start out, again, as mentioned before, as the orphanage errand boy, slogging through menial task after menial task for the first few chapters. The real story after Kiryu is done with the orphanage has no tension whatsoever, every single plot twist and weird ass plot device is forshadowed by a chapter or two, and the ending where Mine jumps off the roof for no fucking reason whatsoever is a stupid plot point.", "timestamp_created": 1693432597, "timestamp_updated": 1693432597, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145287079": {"recommendationid": "145287079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173049575", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2220, "last_played": 1693346616}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Peak", "timestamp_created": 1693347381, "timestamp_updated": 1693347381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703453600406646729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145271552": {"recommendationid": "145271552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085534136", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 871, "last_played": 1691883995}, "language": "english", "review": "Haru.

The weakest of these games I've played so far. Combat is kinda stale in this one, enemies constantly block your attack with some being able to completely break through yours. The EXP system of this game doesn't help either as you'd have to play a lot of the side content to unlock everything. The story is also not very engaging for most of the game, the first few chapters are just orphanage simulator 2009 with sprinkles of the main story here and there. Once the game gets going proper, theres still very little excitement happening, it may seem a little unfair to compare a original release to a later one but only once did this game get me hyped up for a fight the same way Yakuza 0 does with Kuze.

This game was released in Japan in 2009 and has been remastered and released worldwide in 2020. At its core, Yakuza 3 Remastered is a 3D action-adventure game set in the fictional city of Kamurocho.\n\nThe game follows the adventures of Kazuma Kiryu, a retired Yakuza boss, as he tries to solve the various mysteries, fights, and puzzles that beset him. As expected, the gameplay remains largely unchanged from its original Japanese release. Players control Kazuma Kiryu as he moves around the city, interacts with NPCs, and engages in combat with various enemies.\n\nThe biggest and most notable change to Yakuza 3 Remastered is the improved visuals. The game has been given a complete graphical overhaul, with higher resolution textures, improved lighting, and enhanced character models. This makes the game look and feel much more modern and polished.\n\nThe story of Yakuza 3 Remastered is still as strong as ever. The game follows Kazuma Kiryu as he tries to unravel the mysteries that have been plaguing him since his retirement. Along the way, he will meet a variety of characters, from Yakuza bosses to everyday citizens, and he will have to make tough choices about how to handle each situation.\n\nYakuza 3 Remastered is a great game for fans of the franchise, as well as newcomers who have never played a Yakuza game before. The story is still engaging and the improved visuals make the game look great. The combat is still satisfying and there are plenty of side activities to keep players occupied.

Overall the combat ranges from mediocre to dreadfully bad. The AI seemingly chooses its actions based off how angry it causes you to be. 95% of the enemies will simultaneously block every attack you throw at them whilst ogling blankly at you, not throwing out any attacks, barely moving. They essentially turtle throughout the entire game. Combine that with the fact that the majority of hard enemies can downright disallow you to grapple them, the lack of easy access heat moves, and the staggering realization that at no point in the entire game does Kiryu reach the point where he can breeze through enemies. I've 100%'d this game and at no point are you given an opportunity to tear through enemies, Kiryu just does so little damage. Overall this games combat is a major let down and massive annoyance for the player.\n     Story-wise, the game starts out surprisingly strong. The new beach setting is extremely refreshing to see, though a large section of the game still takes place in Kamurocho. The dynamic between Kiryu, Haruka, and their band orphans is done really well, showing Kiryu's more compassionate and understanding side to contrast his more stoic attributes. The story is also considerably more goofy compared to the previous entries. Its very wacky, which for some could be a turn off, but this game handles it pretty well; It doesn't  overstay its welcome and is generally funny and creative. That being said, around chapter 8 the story begins to slow to a crawl and present a very generic C.I.A/F.B.I/W.H.Y plot. Overall the story of Yakuza 3 is probably the highlight, a shining light within the crust that is this game. \n     The last thing I want to point out are the mini games. Mirroring the combat, the mini games range from mediocre to dreadful. The crane game, arcade shooter, batting, bowling, gambling, massage parlor, mahjong, and shogi are barely any different from previous remastered installments. However, the other half of the mini games are very annoying to deal with, in particular pool, and darts. Both are extremely jank, with darts being so weird and precise to control that its nearly impossible to pick it up without the use of a guide. Pool is also pretty jank, with the shot preview literally just not working for close shots. On top of that, the AI just cheats, the harder players are literally omnipotent pool gods and can bank crazy shots without you even being able to retaliate. \n     Yakuza 3 is considerably worse than the previous remasters, it should've gotten the Kiwami treatment, but unfortunately it didn't and it suffers tremendously from it.

"playtime_at_review": 5862, "last_played": 1692483953}, "language": "english", "review": "Featuring firsts for the series that ended up being positive and formative changes, the game as a whole unfortunately doesn't hold up and a lot of it can be attributed to a very poorly made remaster which completely broke the combat. However, the game also suffers from poorly executed story elements, especially one that sits at the core of this games narrative - [spoiler]the orphanage[/spoiler]. As much as I personally love some of the things this game tries to do, I find it difficult to recommend as the core elements of this game are so lacking - combat and narrative. I recommend trying the game and if you aren't enjoying it getting a story recap in some fashion and moving on to the next game since it would be a shame if this game put you off from playing the other entries in the series.\n\n\n\n\n------- SPOILERS AHEAD --------\n\n\n\nElaborating on story elements that I felt were poorly executed:\n[spoiler]\n[b]Morning Glory[/b]:\nKiryu running an orphanage is a story element I personally love as it's a very unique narrative point to have in a video game as well as other media. Unfortunately, it isn't executed well. Each kid in the orphanage gets their own part of the story. Their stories feature a variety of problems and are meant to display how Kiryu deals with their problems as well as introduce the kids as characters. The gameplay in these parts of the story comes down to talking with all the different kids about whatever the problem may be with an occasional odd job. On top of that, the issues these kids are facing are covered on a very surface level. Each kids segment is resolved fairly quickly and while not all of the topics covered in these parts are worthy of a more elaborate story part, stories like bullying with Shiro and not being able to do what you love because of an illness with Taichi are ones that have potential to be more interesting than they were in the game. It ultimately would have been better as a sidestory like the HLA since it ends up feeling like a chore when interrupting the main story and the stories arent fleshed out enough to warrant a mandatory main story spot.\n\n\n[b]Focusing on the wrong thing[/b]:\nMine and Rikiya are this games greatest additions in terms of characters.\nRikiya is a classic Yakuza character archetype - loveable and determined young yakuza who looks up to Kiryu. His death only took away from the story. Kiryu had the most severe reaction we've seen him have so far to someones death and while it is a very sad death it feels a little off in retrospect. That reaction would have made a lot of more sense if it was in any way acknowledged why Kiryu is sad and this kind of reactions makes the most sense for Kiryu if it was because every time he gets involved in something the ones he cares about keep dying. However, that isn't something the story focuses on and it ends up being a death without much impact. Everyone moves on after his death and that's the end of that. No further elaboration on Kiryus feelings and the way he grieves him. It ends up being a meaningless death. Not only that, Rikiya gets killed in a frustratingly bad turn of events where all the characters just leave a loaded gun right next to a defeated Tamashiro.\nMine is another example of poor focus. He ended up being a very interesting and complicated character but was given very little time to shine as we only learn of his philosophy at the very end of the game. Had the orphanage content been cut down or maybe less focus was put on some other antagonists like Kanda who is very one-dimensional, he would have gotten the screen time he deserved. It's also a shame that the only scenes you see of him beforehand is him being cold and unstable. The story would have greatly benefited if there was a bigger focus on Mine much like the previous two games focused heavily on Nishikiyama and Ryuji. Mine is a great character but there should have been more of him. The lack of focus is intentional as this is the first game that tries to include multiple antagonists. However, it is strange as the game is large content wise. There are 118 substories, a few of which include cutscnes and are used to elaborate on main story characters, many minigames and the HLA sidestory. Even with all that, the story feels like it didn't have enough time to do everything it wanted. Hamazaki had a very memorable introduction but didn't do anything untill literally after the credits and Mine was in a simillar situation. The way you get to learn about the plot is by talking with a high ranking politician and asking him a bounch of questions. It's a very sudden huge info dump as opposed to a gradual, more natural flow of information throughout the story. Instead giving more time to all of that what gets the most screen time is the orphanage which would have been fine if this game was a lot bigger.\n\n\n\n[b]Tonal shifting[/b]:\nThis is the first game in the series that features big shifts between a lighthearted and goofy and a serious tone. This ended up becoming one of the Yakuza series' most prominent elements and something the games later on execute really well but seeing as this is the first time it's been implemented it ended up hurting the story just a little bit. Kashiwagis death is handled in a strange way. He is meant to be a person Kiryu looked up to but his death doesn't seem to phase him as the only two moments you see his death having an effect on Kiryu is immediately after and when he's talking to Rikiya on the bench in Public Park 3. During that conversation with Rikiya, the player is given a choice to answer with a serious and non-serious answer. To be more specific, you can say the following:\n\n\"Honestly, Kashiwagi-san was...\"\n1. Great at leading from the shadows\n2. Great at hiding from the shadows\n\n\"Amazing? Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I was especially in awe of...\n1. How level-headed he was.\n2. How much he loved cold noodles.\n\nThe fact that you can pick between these two answers takes away from the impact of Kashiwagis death and makes it feel like the writers and Kiryu didn't care much for Kashiwagi, which is strange since he should be a much more prominent figure primarily because he's a role model to Kiryu but also because he's a very important figure in the Tojo Clan as the head of the Kazama Family and the person that carries on the legacy of one of the Tojo Clans most legendary figures.\n\n\n[b]The combat[/b]:\nI have not played the original but I have heard that the combat wasn't this bad in it.\nRegardless, this games remaster has many issues:\n- Quickstep is very weak as enemies will sometimes do 180s to rotate around and hit you. The tracking some attacks that bosses have look ridiculous and make the games combat feel even more clunky than it already is as they will fly towards you to catch up to you at really high speeds (ex. Mines running attack). Although this isn't a boss-exclusive issue since some types of enemies will do perform similar attacks.\n- Enemy AI is poorly programmed since they continue to block for extended periods of time and attack very rarely making every encounter feel like a chore as you're forced to either grab them to death or wait for them to attack and parry or hope your quickstep doesn't bug out and get tracked.\n- Random encounters are too difficult to dodge as enemies will stand in your way and if you pass next to them immediately trigger a fight as opposed to the later games giving you time to avoid the fight if you don't want it by alerting you that you've been spotted first.\nOverall, these issues and the inconsistencies it causes makes the combat feel like a chore rather than something to enjoy.\n[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1692376877, "timestamp_updated": 1692378431, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650248110294342041", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144485811": {"recommendationid": "144485811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058847074", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 830, "last_played": 1688500378}, "language": "english", "review": "kiryu proud mom :) :D", "timestamp_created": 1692364349, "timestamp_updated": 1692364349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569034337997436523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144464582": {"recommendationid": "144464582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058745611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1982, "last_played": 1692412039}, "language": "english", "review": "this is the bad one?", "timestamp_created": 1692337700, "timestamp_updated": 1692337700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144463732": {"recommendationid": "144463732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004377599", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1662, "last_played": 1688267180}, "language": "english", "review": "Completed: July 1st, 2023\nTime Played: 28 Hours\n\nThis game ranges from horrible to pretty decent.

Fair enough, I'm on 4 now and consider 0 to be the best entry so far so you're a bit spoiled quality wise. After 0 people go to the even more modern Kiwami 1 and Kiwami 2, and then if they still wish to continue the story, this. \n\nUnlike 1 or 2 Yakuza 3 received no Kiwami upgrade (Kiwami means extreme) meaning (gameplay wise, at least) it's no different from the day it was released back in early 2009. Yes, the graphics are going to be inferior, the gameplay is a bit clunkier than the newer entries that people will have played first and despite being the third entry on the list in areas you get the feeling the writers and game designers were still perfecting the formula for a Yakuza title, but I like it. Alot, actually. It's my second favourite after 0, with a very decent story. In my opinion, the strongest story in the series since 0 (and arguably the best antagonist so far, including 0)\n\nI found it a bit bemusing, if not downright jarring at first considering just how much of the story doesn't revolve around violence. Not to spoil anything specifically but a considerable portion of the game revolves around Kiryu performing menial tasks at his home and for the orphans. It's different, but comfy. If you pick this (and presumably 4 and 5 as part of the remastered collection) don't get confused by the \"Remastered\" title. It's purely a cosmetic remaster. Don't be discouraged because it's a little old, Yakuza 3 and the following games should be played just as much as 0, Kiwami 1 and Kiwami 2.

From their nonsensical plotlines to the bizarre minigames, none of these games are, in my opinion, meant to be taken entirely seriously. Because of this, my general expectations of these games are not high, but oh boy does this one take the cake.\nBefore going into this game, I already knew it had been deemed as the worst one in the entire franchise, but believe me, I was not prepared for just how bad this thing was. Now, is it the worst thing in the world by itself? No, far from it, but compared to all of the games you've probably played before this one (0,k1,k2), this one just sticks out as a sore thumb.\n\nI gotta talk about the visuals first. If you had told me that this got released in 2021, I wouldn't have believed you until I fact checked it myself. I understand that unlike kiwami 1 and kiwami 2, this game is simply a remaster and not a rework, but even for a remaster this is a bit tragic. Especially with the whiplash you're gonna get when you switch from kiwami 2, a game that looks absolutely gorgeous and will have your graphics card fighting for it's life, to yakuza 3 which looks like it was made at least a decade ago, if not more. I don't understand why they called this Yakuza 3 \"Remastered\", when this game, in my opinion, lacks the fundamental part of a remaster: improvement of visuals. Sure, they increased the resolution from the original 2009 release for the PS3, but besides that it all looks the same. Remasters can update character models, environments, etc, if the developers bother to do so. Again, as a standalone this isn't bad but compared to the other games, this one's definitely got the weakest visuals.\n\nThe combat in this one is also probably the worst so far. The combat in these games is typically braindead, and this is coming from someone who is terrible at beat em ups and has so far in all of the Yakuza games i've played, while playing on the normal difficulty, only died on two boss fights (once on the 1st Kuze fight because I was still getting used to the game and once on Y0's So Amon who is a secret boss meant to be ridiculously hard). If you shove enough medicine up your ass you are pretty much guaranteed to pass every fight without breaking a sweat (except if you're fighting Jingu, this one might give you a mental breakdown). This might sound like a complaint, but it's not. While I enjoy difficult games, I like how easy these games are, it's relaxing.\nBut the combat on this one, besides being the most braindead so far, is also the most frustrating. The amount of blocking the enemies do is insane. You got 1 hit in on the boss? Good, now get ready to spend the next minute waiting for him to stop blocking so you can hit him again and take off 1% of his health. This doesn't only go for the bosses either, regular goons on the street also block any chance they get, tho these are way less frustrating. The more frustrating part about said goons is that, unlike in the other games, it's really hard to avoid them on the street. They will see you and catch you before you even register that they're near you. It's also harder to spot them because, unlike in the previous 3 games, they don't stand in groups. It's just a single goon standing and he will magically spawn in his companions when the fight starts.\nBesides the blocking issue, hitting the heat actions is also a bit of a pain in the ass. It feels like you only have a split moment for some of them and you have to be in the pixel perfect position to execute them (especially the one you can do to a downed enemy).\n\nThe plot of this one is also the worst in my opinion. If any piece of media has a 30 minute scene where 3 characters are sitting in a room, while one of them is giving a massive info dump about the game's entire (pretty boring) plot while your visuals are limited to watching them in this room from different angles, yeah that's just an immediate sign of a bad plot. These games are, as I've already said, pretty silly (which I love). But this isn't even silly, this is just boring.\nThis game also uses one of the world's biggest and most boring cliches, [spoiler] turns out character A actually had a twin that was never mentioned the whole time... The whole Kazama has a twin thing is so stupid. Especially because, [b] they're not even twins [/b] . Kazama is supposed to be about 3 years older than his brother, so tell me then why do they look identical (spoiler: the answer is lazy writing). Not to even mention the fact that his brother really doesn't add much to the overall story. I feel like he was added purely for shock factor. [/spoiler]\nThere were, however, things I liked about the plot:\n[list]\n[*]Kiryu running the orphanage\n[*]the Ryudo Clan (especially Rikiya)\n[*]Majima (feels like this is the first time where he has a pretty big role in the plot since Yakuza 0)\n[*]Mine (this game gets extra points for having an evil gay antagonist)\n [/list]\n\nI gotta mention the karaoke real quick, because I'm a sucker for this minigame and it's the one thing I go and do as soon as I can in every game. It's lackluster and this makes sense considering that this is the first game that introduced this mechanic, but I'm still going to complain. All of the songs besides Kamurocho Lullaby are forgettable and generic, but my real gripe are the input visuals. Really struggled with them (for the record, I play on a keyboard and from what I've seen, the inputs seem to be easier to read on the controller).\n\nAnother mechanic this game introduced is the Revelation system, and it's honestly phenomenal. Kiryu will whip out his flip phone, capture a few images of something absolutely ridiculous happening in front of him, think of a witty caption and then post it onto his online blog. Besides being funny, the revelation system also lets Kiryu learn new skills. I never know what the fuck to expect in these Revelation cutscenes but I'm always a bit baffled after them. Whoever came up with that shit needs a promotion\n\nIn conclusion, so far this is the weakest game in the franchise, with a wonky plot (even the creators themselves are aware of this given the fact they joke about it in Kiwami 2), boring combat and underwhelming visuals. However it still manages to carry that usual Yakuza charm the previous games have. I'm glad I didn't skip this one tho I don't see myself revisiting it in the future (at least not any time soon).\n\nSo, is it worth playing?\nYes, this game is worth playing if you've played and enjoyed the previous ones, if anything, it's worth playing just for the infamous Majima pink garbage truck scene.", "timestamp_created": 1691187723, "timestamp_updated": 1691187752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143350264": {"recommendationid": "143350264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319614686", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1286, "last_played": 1691097646}, "language": "english", "review": "terrible gameplay but made me cry at the end so it redeemed itself", "timestamp_created": 1691098149, "timestamp_updated": 1691099539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143317061": {"recommendationid": "143317061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080243973", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 786, "last_played": 1689889443}, "language": "english", "review": "i dont know a single word of japanese", "timestamp_created": 1691064193, "timestamp_updated": 1691064193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143305161": {"recommendationid": "143305161", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013045080", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1018, "last_played": 1700187793}, "language": "english", "review": "Aniki, please stop blocking me im getting tired of this, i do recommend its just too much blocking, though i dont have much time in this game like the others in the series i enjoyed it.", "timestamp_created": 1691044851, "timestamp_updated": 1691044851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143295468": {"recommendationid": "143295468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991703644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 877, "last_played": 1690586470}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello?

And I could even play other games.It even made me react better in real life.So I can definitely say that John Yakuza is my hero.", "timestamp_created": 1690390839, "timestamp_updated": 1690390839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142844295": {"recommendationid": "142844295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198822160155", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1690340795}, "language": "english", "review": "mine is hella zesty", "timestamp_created": 1690390691, "timestamp_updated": 1690390691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142841434": {"recommendationid": "142841434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079558994", "num_games_owned": 727, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 1591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1570, "last_played": 1694897393}, "language": "english", "review": "i hate taichi so fucking much", "timestamp_created": 1690387345, "timestamp_updated": 1690387345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.387755125761032104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142792715": {"recommendationid": "142792715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093222670", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1065, "last_played": 1690119688}, "language": "english", "review": "I couldn't stand the horrible fight system, however the story was great", "timestamp_created": 1690317654, "timestamp_updated": 1690317654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142786731": {"recommendationid": "142786731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340661780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1688, "last_played": 1690311114}, "language": "english", "review": "Yakuza 3 is not as broken as people say and is a great game.

It's rough around the edges to be sure, but it was the first PS3 Yakuza title, so judge it in it's context. Main point to address is the joke about excessive guarding. Yes, enemies guard a lot. But you can also very easily just break guard with weapons, use X, X, X, Y, Y to crush guard and utilise back attacks. Its not that big a deal as Redditors make it out to be. My brief summary is as follows:\n\nGood:\n- Score is very good, battle tracks are very funky.\n- Setting is very nice to look at, even if it's mainly used for the orphanage stuff which can get a teensy bit tedious. It's all story-building though.\n- A lot of things can be unlocked from the Revelations system and upgrade system, and most of your repertoire is available from light time investments, you don't need to grind for hours doing one type of content just to get your full move set like in Kiwami or 0.\n\nBad:\n- The narrative I felt was a bit silly and kept introducing twist elements that felt a bit desperate. A lot of it is frontloaded in the last two chapters too. I also feel that the villains introduced were untapped potential. You're shown a set of ruthless, cold-blooded Yakuza heads and... they get one boss fight after their initial introduction. I really liked Kanda's intro, I wish there was more of him.\n\nOverall, a solid entry with many fun points. It just takes some getting used to.

I also just love this Kiryu design, giving so much expression compared to the Stoic and cold lookin classic Kiryu.\nYou'll notice that he smiles like a lot, but man, this Kiryu can also be quite emotional...\n\n([b]Short story summary[/b])\nWe see a beautiful blue sea and a beach, we see Haruka waving to Kiryu as he comes out of the sea having caught a big fish and his hair ain't even wet lol,\nhe tells Haruka to make dinner ready and hopes to not let anyone waiting, as we are wondering who does Kiryu mean with everyone? It's dinner time, and we see a lot of children playing ball, and Haruka is calling everyone to sit on the table,\none of the children notices a person coming that they all know, all the children go to him, altho the man doesn't really seem so happy, it's like he's here to tell something to Kiryu.\nKiryu asks if something happened, and the man responds by telling that their boss got shot, a quick fade to black, and we see Daigo Dojima again in a car, and it looks like he became the next chairman of the Tojo clan, his assistant gets a call telling them about a deal of some sort.\nDaigo keeps telling them that he ain't interested in it and that his answer is final. As he discusses with his assistant to stop speaking about considering he ain't interested, his assistant tells him if it has to do because of the fourth chairman, as Daigo tells his driver to take him back to Tojo HQ and cancel the banquet.\nDaigo arrives back at HQ as he is tolled by someone that a mysterious person is here to speak with Daigo, as Daigo didn't believe when he said to Daigo who wants to see him. Daigo enters the room and meets the mysterious person, they talk about letting Daigo have the deed instead Daigo kept refusing and to Daigo's eyes it looks like the mysterious man goes for his gun, so he picks his gun trying to shoot him....\nBack at Okinawa, we see Kiryu and the man that tolled him about his shot boss run to the operation room, as he confronts a little girl and she lets Kiryu see how the man looked drawn in her sketchbook.\n\n([b]Gameplay[/b])\nNow before anyone goes at it saying stuff like blockuza 3, you're wrong and just bad at the game. (just kidding)\nYes there is a lot of controversy with the gameplay of Yakuza 3 for the amounts of blocking the enemies do in this game, the sad thing about it is\nit was totally normal in the original PS3 version of Yakuza 3, in the remastered version however enemies block almost the entire fight, what's more frustrating is that when you try to dodge to the back of the enemy or boss, kiryu makes a whole spin which is so dumb beyond belief,\nthis was also not an issue in the original PS3 version of Yakuza 3. Let's just say the beginning of the game might be a lot of doing the same moves but trust me when having komaki moves asap like the \n[u]Komaki Parry[/u] and [u]Tiger Drop[/u] the game gets fun as fuck with its combat system and trust me you're going to use Komaki Parry a lot! Imo the combat is way better than the DE DOD combat (sue me). The combat is so technical you have no idea the possibilities of doing combos, like mf WALL COMBOS, that shit broken af and very useful against bosses.\nProgression is again with XP in this game, you go to the [b]UPGRADE MENU[/b] when click on [b]START[/b] and upgrade your move set from there. A new thing that is added in this game are [b]REVELATIONS[/b], strong deadly heat moves and [b]FEEL THE HEAT[/b] moves against bosses that are very useful and cool af not so late in the game do you get to learn about it. Another new thing that is added to the game are [b]CHASE SEQUENCES[/b], where you go and chase enemies or normal people as they are running away from you.\nOverall combat is the same as the OG Y1 and Y2, but more refined.\n\n([b]Substories, Minigames and Side content[/b])\nMost of the beloved substories return from the OG PS3 Yakuza 3 in Yakuza 3 Remastered, as some substories are completely removed as they were against modern times.\nAs always, you can come across them randomly, and they are fun as always. One of my favorites being one where Kiryu goes full detective mode in a murder case that happened in Caf\u00e9 Alps.\nMost of the minigames return as well, with Karaoke and Fishing being a first for the Yakuza title and let me tell you fishing in this game oh man, be ready to put some hours into catching that darn tuna.\nPool and Bowling return in this game, but man does bowling suck in Y3, on the other hand pool feels fine and playable. The Purgatory returns as well with a new mode having TAG-BATTLES and like I said you can still learn moves from Komaki but not a lot this time.\nA small part of side content is back that went missing in Yakuza Kiwami 2 and that is the Cabaret Club, you meet a woman on the streets ask them if they'd like a job as a cabaret hostess and complete the side activity by having the hostess rank to S, it can be annoying in the beginning but when you find a perfect look for the hostess it's going to be fine.\n\n([b]Enemies and Bosses[/b])\nIn Yakuza 3 we have a new location called Okinawa, it's also a lot smaller compared to Kamurocho, but it's still a nice location never the less.\nIn both Kamurocho and Okinawa you can come across enemies, but holy shit do they appear very fast when you're just walking in each location, and the annoying thing is they are everywhere and not even have a unique design that it's an enemy, they look like basic residents.\nEnemy variety is also less in this game, just Angry Guys, Yakuza and Punks, yeah not a lot, The Story does have lots of enemy variety on the other hand.\nI also like how some groups in the story you fight against have their own theme and not everyone has the exact theme, altho you do hear one theme almost every time when fighting groups of enemies.\nAnother thing added is the HLA, an organization that tries to hunt killers, as you get bounties to hunt each killer and take them back to the HLA. The final boss in that is a nostalgic character from Y1/Kiwami.\nAs for bosses there are really some enjoyable bosses in this game especially in the final act as Y3 is also technically the first Yakuza game having a Dynamic boss intro, and some bosses have also a great boss theme.\n\n([b]Soundtrack[/b])\nThe Yakuza 3 OST is louder, hardcore, rocked, metal, techno, beat, mixed into one. Also being one of my favorite ost's in the franchise,\nit's definitely quite a change compared to Y1 and Y2 (just wait till Yakuza 4 hehe), Battle music also has variety again depending on who you fight\nMy personal favorite being Crush & Strike, such a great ost to fight enemies with it. Yakuza 3's soundtrack is really great in every way, and like I said, it's something that RGG Studios does for every Yakuza game of theirs.\nHaving an absolute banger of a soundtrack.\n\nThat concludes my review of Yakuza 3 Remastered\n\nThe game can be janky at sometimes, but I still enjoy playing it with it's great story, the combat is good minus the weird issue that enemies block almost everything, which again wasn't an issue in the og PS3 title.\nAnd also what a nice refreshing take to a Yakuza story and especially for Kiryu.\n\n(9.4)", "timestamp_created": 1689113917, "timestamp_updated": 1689114004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141856055": {"recommendationid": "141856055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100641621", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 803, "last_played": 1689104931}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as it pains me to give this game a neg, i can't rec this game to anyone but the diehard Yakuza fans.

Not because of (at least for the western release) cut content but due to the mechanics, the change in location and how the game feels somewhat stiff at times. \n\nThis is not to say that Yakuza 3 was seen as a terrible game or a misstep. Far from it. It was just that it was something that felt different and took a while getting use to but also paradoxicality not feeling like much has changed in the formula (this was felt even more in the West, due to how long it took for us to get it and again cut content.)\n\nWhich is what puts Yakuza 3 Remastered in a weird spot. 1 and 2 got revamped with Kiwami, but Yakuza 3 Enhanced is basically just updated graphics with all content from the Japanese version. But the gameplay remains unchanged from the PlayStation 3 version. No revamp to the awkward combat, the experience and many of the mini-games are a shell of what you\u2019d come to expect from Yakuza Zero, 1 and 2 Kiwami and the visuals don\u2019t leap out like before. And if you\u2019ve come from those games, it\u2019s going to be an even rougher experience. \n\nThere\u2019s the level up system which feels very restrictive. It may have been done to prevent grinding to make Kiryu into a near-overpowered badass early into the game but it also feels gated. \n\nThe same feeling goes for getting heat actions, weapons and armour, with the game\u2019s modding system not being noteworthy until very late into the game and even then the available options still feel limited. It\u2019s justifiable to not have Kiryu once again become overpowered early/midway into the game, but it\u2019d be nice if Yakuza 3 Remastered was more generous in what you could unlock. \n\nThe combat feels off. It feels like they had to nerf Kiryu and so you don\u2019t feel as badass as before. Some heat actions don\u2019t feel as epic and it does have an awkward feel. This is especially noticeable against bosses and tough opponents (e.g. the ones you face in the Coliseum activity), where it seems you have to cheese them more than use what you\u2019ve learned up to that point.  It\u2019s not a total disaster, as its still solid enough to be enjoyable but you do feel like a handicapped badass. \n\nVisually, even considering the time frame and how this is only a remastered and not a remake/overhaul like the Kiwami games are, it\u2019s still a let down to an extent. This wasn\u2019t a huge leap back in the PS3 and you can see the age and rough edges still present, such as sudden pop-up and sometimes NPC\u2019s having derpy or dead-eyes look. \n\nAnd of course, it has its own set of Yakuza restrictiveness: Save points are really far apart, you can\u2019t accept more than one hitman mission, can\u2019t buy more than one food at a time, item inventory is always a pain and other, somewhat archaic game design choices.  \n\nAgain though, this must be stressed that DESPITE these issues Yakuza 3 Enhanced is still overall a fun game. When it hits its stride, the dopamine hits hard and you remember why you love the series; \n\nKamurocho feels like an old friend, vibrant, looking different but also similar and hiding its share of secrets underneath all the glitz and glamour and while Ryukyu isn\u2019t Sotenbori (Osaka), it still has its character and charm, feeling like a place to visit and absorb a different aspect of Japan. While the visuals might not pop out, its still an impressive showcase of packing cities with details and small touches that still make it fun to explore and just run around. \n\nThe music is banging, as expected with the Ryu Ga Gotoku library (and this being Sega, who rarely drop the ball when it comes to music,) with a mix that ranges from techno to J-pop (and that\u2019s not getting into the Karaoke songs.) \n\nThere is always moments that are dramatic or comedic (sometimes swinging around in the same scene) that make one actually care what is taking place and invest in characters, even those who just appear in a small substory. Speaking of those, the substories once again reveal the soul of Yakuza/Ryu Ga Gotoku series, with some amusing (and even downright heart-warming) scenes. \n\nAnd yes, some of the activities aren\u2019t that engaging or fully fleshed out (hostess ones spring to mind) but Yakuza 3 still has a lot of content that it hits more than it misses and just when you begin to flag or tire of one thing it throws something else to keep you hooked. \n\nYakuza 3 Enhanced is often seen as the \u201cworst\u201d of the games in the franchise and it is justifiable line of opinion. But it also hides a truth about it; That even the \u201cworst\u201d games in the Ryu Ga Gotoku franchise are still solid b-tier fun. This is enhanced (ahem) by the fact that the price of the game is dead-cheap (it\u2019s also part of the Yakuza Remastered Collection, again a fantastic bundle). \n\nIt is best to come to Yakuza 3 Enhanced with expectation in check but also the fact that you\u2019re still going to have a lot of enjoyment pounding solutions into people\u2019s faces. \n\n[h1]Rating: 7*/10[/h1]\n(*More towards a 6 than an 8)", "timestamp_created": 1689084942, "timestamp_updated": 1689085088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501897513866424561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141820857": {"recommendationid": "141820857", "author": {"steamid": "76561199225309949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1689067750}, "language": "english", "review": "To be honest, from all Yakuza games I played so far, this is the worst, just because of the story telling and the combat. Literally the 2nd fight in this game took about 15 minutes and it wasn\u00b4t hard, but just too long and annoying. Enemies can block every attack of yours and evade 7 times in a row while you can hardly evade once, which made me use all weapons and stuff that was lying there to actually win. Heat gauge decreases over time? But charges when having low hp? I don\u00b4t really get that, now that it wasn\u00b4t in the other yakuza games I played. And when finally using a heat attack after hitting an enemy 50 times, you deal 5% dmg on him, which just doesen\u00b4t feel good at all. The other Yakuza games at least had a lot of story telling with voice behind it, this game has 90% just reading, which is frustrating tbh. You get introduced into the game with voices for 20 seconds than you have to read for 5 minutes straight, what is actually just disappointing.

I was expecting a whiplash from the drop in quality and archaic engine, but I have to say I much preferred it to Yakuza Kiwami 2.

People said the combat wasn't as good, but even if the controls were clunkier, there is actual progression to Kiryu's moveset here, unlike in Kiwami 2. I found this much more satisfying. I myself was expecting the game to look like crap, but the clear directorial vision made seeing Kamurocho again one more year into the future refreshing as always. The crowds were a surprising touch too, filled with many varied NPCs that really brought a sense of life to the world. If I had to pick one grievance with the game, it would either be the lackluster bossfights or the return of Feel The Heat, but the former didn't exactly bother me and the latter was vastly improved upon from its Kiwami 2 iteration.

From the moment I started playing, I was drawn into a charming world filled with colorful creatures and catchy tunes.\n\nThe concept of the game is simple yet captivating: you collect and breed a variety of monsters, each with its own distinct appearance and musical sound. The monsters are visually appealing and come in all shapes and sizes, from fuzzy to spiky, each possessing its own charm. Breeding monsters to discover new species kept me engaged and eager to uncover the next whimsical creature.\n\nThe heart of My Singing Monsters lies in its music. Each monster has its own musical note, and as you place them on your island, they create a harmonious symphony. The sounds blend seamlessly, creating a relaxing and enchanting atmosphere. The game's music is a true highlight, offering a soothing experience that's perfect for unwinding.\n\nCustomization is another strong point of the game. You can design and decorate your monster's island to your heart's content, adding structures, decorations, and arranging the monsters to create your own unique musical landscape. This personal touch adds depth to the gameplay and allows for creative expression beyond breeding monsters.\n\nWhile My Singing Monsters offers a captivating experience, it's not without its downsides. The game's progression can feel slow at times, requiring patience as you wait for your monsters to earn coins and generate resources. In-app purchases are also quite prominent, tempting players to speed up progress with real money. While this is common in many mobile games, it can be a drawback for players who prefer a more balanced and less pay-to-win experience.\n\nOverall, My Singing Monsters is a joyful and engaging mobile game that's perfect for music lovers and fans of cute creature collecting. Its combination of charming visuals, enchanting music, and creative customization options make for an enjoyable and unique gaming experience.

While it retains many of the elements that made its predecessors so engaging, Yakuza 3 falls short in several key areas, leaving fans feeling somewhat disappointed.\n\nOne of the biggest letdowns in Yakuza 3 is its pacing. The game starts off slowly, taking a considerable amount of time to build up the main plotline. While this deliberate approach can be appreciated, the excessive amount of filler content, including repetitive mini-games and side quests, bogs down the experience. These distractions often feel disconnected from the main story and lack the depth and variety that fans have come to expect from the series.\n\nAdditionally, the localization of Yakuza 3 suffers from some questionable decisions. The English translation fails to capture the nuances of the original Japanese dialogue, resulting in moments of awkward dialogue and a loss of emotional impact. This issue is particularly evident during crucial story moments, hindering the player's ability to fully invest in the narrative and connect with the characters.\n\nAnother major drawback is the combat system. While it retains the satisfying brawling mechanics from previous entries, Yakuza 3 feels somewhat clunky and outdated compared to more recent installments. The lack of fluidity in combat, combined with limited move sets and repetitive enemy encounters, makes the combat segments feel monotonous and uninspired.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, Yakuza 3 does have its merits. The game's setting, Kamurocho, is meticulously detailed and beautifully recreated, offering a visually stunning and atmospheric backdrop for players to explore. The main story, once it picks up, still manages to deliver engaging moments of suspense and drama, showcasing the series' signature storytelling prowess.\n\nAdditionally, Yakuza 3 introduces a new focus on the protagonist's personal relationships and explores deeper character development, which adds emotional depth to the narrative. The side quests, although excessive, do provide some humorous and heartfelt moments that further flesh out the world and its inhabitants.\n\nIn conclusion, Yakuza 3 is a mixed bag. While it retains the series' charm and strengths, it falls short in crucial aspects that hinder the overall experience. The pacing issues, localization problems, and outdated combat mechanics prevent it from reaching the heights set by its predecessors. However, fans of the Yakuza series may still find enjoyment in the game's story and exploration elements.", "timestamp_created": 1688765751, "timestamp_updated": 1688765751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141540567": {"recommendationid": "141540567", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064304261", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1863, "last_played": 1698819147}, "language": "english", "review": "congratulations to yakuza 3 for being the only game in existence to have yoshitaka mine", "timestamp_created": 1688753278, "timestamp_updated": 1688753278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640070497989654541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141519291": {"recommendationid": "141519291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086683762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1004, "last_played": 1688732896}, "language": "english", "review": "excellendae", "timestamp_created": 1688732915, "timestamp_updated": 1688732915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141502806": {"recommendationid": "141502806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081664481", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 1532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1532, "last_played": 1688603446}, "language": "english", "review": "not enough Majima", "timestamp_created": 1688710644, "timestamp_updated": 1688710644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141483368": {"recommendationid": "141483368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154078481", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 906, "last_played": 1688603031}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1688684271, "timestamp_updated": 1688684271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141476520": {"recommendationid": "141476520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209279025", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 683, "last_played": 1692122663}, "language": "english", "review": "Started playing the game 3 days ago..

But it's really hard to play now....\n\nWill edit the review in the future again!\n\nEdit #1 finished the game yesterday, \noverall it was storywise a bit weaker than 0, yk1 and yk2... \nbut Still enojyable! \nThe bosses where still blocking alot \nand also the chase parts were less fun for me tbh, \nbecause I am not so good at it... \nno matter how often I've tried and even was learning with mack in Purgatory.\nI miss the skills to run properly without bumping into stuff.\n\nBut as I said before, the Story was weaker, \nbut it was fun having stuff to do in Okinawa.\nAlso Morning Glory/Asagao was cute,\nseeing Kiryu being an adoptiv Father to the Kids was very sweet!!!!\nThat's a part I really really enjoyed a lot!\nKaraoke Songs were less enjoyable, because I prefer Dragon Engine Karaoke.\nIt's easier to control, also the Song were less catchy.\n\nStill very nice substories! They didn't disspoint me at all,\nexcept the chase ones... some I've finished after mulitle times of trying tho\n\nThe Hitman Missions where Intresting!

Yes, this game does have it's major flaws, especially the ones brought about in the remaster version, but I still had a good time with it despite it's rough patches. For starters, Yakuza 3's story is probably my favorite out of the entire series so far, like I haven't been this invested since 0 and I think that's due to this game's cast of characters. I'm talking characters like Rikiya, Mikuo, Nakahara, all of the orphans at Morning Glory, Majima and Date, and Kiryu himself just make this story work so well. And because I found myself getting attached to these characters, it meant that any emotional moment in the story hit 10 times harder which they did. Yeah I cried a lot during certain parts of this game, I ain't ashamed to admit that. Anyways love the story, but as for the gameplay... it's not that bad!... as long as you don't play on hard for your first run... which I did. It's an absolute slog on hard, just stick with normal it's not worth it. Your damage is godawful, there's very little opportunities to do any real damage, and fights just DRAGGGGG!!! God the long battles were the worst about this, like I usually love the long battles in these games but yeesh, on hard these were just some of the most annoying. And the boss fights, good god I did not enjoy over half of them, yet the ones I did enjoy were actually really great (shoutout to both Majima fights). Of course what helps gameplay greatly is the soundtrack and BOY I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! The whole thing absolutely slaps, god especially Lyricism without Tears, which is probably one of the most emotional boss tracks in the entire series IT'S SO GOODDDD!!

However, while the game certainly had its strengths, it also had some noticeable weaknesses that dampened the overall experience.\n\nLet's start with the positives. Yakuza 3 Remastered delivers an engrossing narrative, packed with compelling characters and intense moments. The story takes players on an emotional rollercoaster, exploring the depths of Kiryu's past and his struggles with the Yakuza lifestyle. The remastered visuals breathe new life into the game, making Kamurocho and Okinawa vibrant and immersive. The attention to detail is commendable, and the world feels alive with its bustling streets and intricate shops.\n\nHowever, the game falls short in certain aspects, particularly the combat system. While Yakuza titles are known for their brawling action, Yakuza 3 Remastered's combat can be [b]frustrating[/b]. The enemies seem to have an unfair advantage, often blocking your attacks indefinitely, leading to a repetitive and dull experience. It's disappointing when you want to unleash Kiryu's full power but are met with relentless blocking.\n\nAnother drawback that impacted my enjoyment was the abundance of filler content. While side activities have always been a part of the Yakuza games, Yakuza 3 Remastered takes it to another level. There were numerous times when I felt these filler moments dragged on for too long, disrupting the pacing of the main story. As a fan, I felt compelled to push through, but it did detract from the overall experience.\n\nThat said, despite its flaws, I would still recommend Yakuza 3 Remastered, but with a specific audience in mind: [b]Yakuza enthusiasts[/b]. If you're a fan of the series and eager to delve deeper into the lore, Yakuza 3 Remastered provides valuable insights into Kiryu's past and the world of Yakuza. However, I wouldn't recommend playing this game casually or as an introduction to the series.\n\nIn conclusion, Yakuza 3 Remastered is a mixed bag for fans. It excels in storytelling and visual enhancements, but falters in its combat system and the excessive filler content. If you're a devoted fan seeking more Yakuza goodness, this remastered version is worth exploring, but be prepared to endure some frustrations along the way.", "timestamp_created": 1687013652, "timestamp_updated": 1687013714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670393884181976318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140187061": {"recommendationid": "140187061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037520124", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 3202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1002, "playtime_at_review": 3202, "last_played": 1700650595}, "language": "english", "review": "Compared to 0, 1 Kiwami and 2 Kiwami, this is a little raw and rough.

This time he'll.....learn how to be a good father figure? That's right, Kiryu's taking care of an orphanage full of a rag-tag bunch of kids out in Okinawa, when suddenly real estate disputes threaten to shut the whole thing down. Kiryu investigates further to stop all this, only to get rolled back into yakuza affairs when he realizes that this real estate dispute may be a cover for something much more impactful.\n\nYakuza 3 is rough for sure. Not only coming off the backs of Yakuza 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2, but also just the bangers of Yakuza 1 and 2 in general, this game very often falls flat in delivering that iconic Yakuza experience. Story-wise, as wholesome as it is seeing Kiryu finally form a life outside of the yakuza, it's boring to put it simply. The first third of the game is spent almost entirely dealing with everyday tasks and problems all relating to the kids and the orphanage, and it is rarely entertaining. The story does pick up after a little while, but becomes muddled with how many different parties become involved in these various conflicts that I lost track of who was the antagonist I needed to focus on at any given time. Gameplay-wise it is not great either. Combat is dull and lacks unique moves, with only three different finishers available for boss fights, two of which you have to unlock from side gameplay. Lack of incentive to eat at restaurants to refill health due to easy combat and prevalence of medicinal items. One of the worst skill \"trees\" I've ever seen in a videogame. Terrible karaoke minigame (this is very important to me). The one notable positive I can think of from Yakuza 3 is that they actually made a gun-wielding boss not frustrating to play against for once, which was a welcome surprise.\n\nA lot of people will say that you have to take everything with a grain of salt, especially if you play these games in chronological order, considering Yakuza 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 are all stellar games, and the Kiwamis were both remakes as opposed to remasters. They're completely right. That being said, Yakuza 3 is still a really rough game on its own, remaster or not.\n\nI would recommend you play Yakuza 3 if you're really invested in Kiryu Kazuma's story and want to see his arc from start to finish, but otherwise this is a skippable game. 4/10, maybe pick it up on sale for like $8 or less.", "timestamp_created": 1686818863, "timestamp_updated": 1686818863, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140035410": {"recommendationid": "140035410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230406048", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2018, "last_played": 1612754768}, "language": "english", "review": "Yakuza has got to be one of the most consistent franchise in gaming.

I came in with an open mind after reading some negative and positive reviews and I could say for certain that this one Yakuza entry isn't for everyone, gameplay wise, and story wise. Yakuza 3 Remastered is a really really old game so I would not be comparing it to 0 and the previous Kiwamis. The best way I can put it is that you [b]you have to make it fun yourself[/b]. I'm gonna talk about the positives first and then get to the negatives of each section.\n\n\n[b]General Things[/b]\n\nI seriously do not get why people are complaining about the graphics, like everyone is saying that this is awful, what??? The cutscene graphics are amazing and the general in game graphics aren't all to impressive but you are overreacting if you say that this is awful it's good for a 2009 game. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing even with what people argue is \"the worst in the series\" the Yakuza series cannot make a game with a bad soundtrack. For new things, The game has the revelation system like in Yakuza 0 with some QTEs for them but they are learnable instead of story progression which can be bad or good. For the negatives, I would say the movement is pretty awful, you don't have a run for some reason you only jog. Adding to this, A truck load of people walk the streets like their purpose is blocking you and Kiryu flinches so easily that it was pretty irritating to get anywhere. This one should be in combat but this is [b]that[/b] important. The encounters, the encounters with street fights are completely ridiculous, there is no notification whether there is someone coming after you or not, not only that, they also go after you [b]immediately[/b] after they see you. The closest thing you can have to a notification is a voiceline and a small unnoticeable chat bubble. They will stop you in the street give you 3 lines of dialogue, and then fight you. I'm almost certain I have 2 hours of me jogging around the map and getting into almost unavoidable street fights. The progression is pretty awful too, it's basically required to get a certain amount of moves to have fun in the game.\n\n\n[b]The Infamous Combat[/b]\n\nWith positives first I like the fact that I can't mow enemies down with the same attacks over and over again because they  block everything that's the thing that always bothered me about the Yakuza series so far is that it's really easy to defeat the enemies with the same things. The real problem is your options, you don't have any. It's either a weapon from the street or grabbing them if the square-triangle combos don't work. It's such a chore to fight a large crowd especially if there is large/obese enemies mixed with the fast ones, the grabbing system only works if your enemy is doing [b]absolutely nothing[/b] and that is such a huge problem because this Kiryu is already struggling with big crowds with his bare hands now he can barely grab anyone? The damage too, it's extremely garbage you barely do anything to them, on top of playing pretty mediocre with bosses and smaller enemies you barely do anything to them and it's a completely awful experience when you are fighting a boss with a group of smaller enemies. I do like the boss fights, this one is a personal opinion of mine but I really like that they put up more of a fight than Kiwami 2 where I explained it was extremely easy. The combat itself is extremely tedious and arguably boring, but I did have some good fun and entertainment with getting around to their weaknesses and openings.\n\n\n[b]Story and Gameplay[/b]\n\nWith the story, it still follows Kiryu and the problem of The Tojo Clan being in ruins after he left to start an orphanage. The villains were honestly pretty good. The Big Fool Kanda, The smart but broken Mine, And funny English Black Monday guy. I think the villains were okay at least, and the main villain was pretty good but didn't have enough screen time to fully care about him. The kids of Morning Glory (Kiryu's orphanage) were pretty much irrelevant and their identities didn't really matter, but their existence mattered to show in contrast the other side that isn't a beat them up passionate manly man. The only complaint I could have with the story is that they gave the kids more screen time than Mine which is a really bad decision in my part because the main villain was supposed to be this guy you cared for in the end but they didn't give me enough time to understand and to give any care for him. Gameplay wise, it's pretty bad, exploration is a chore and the combat is a chore everything just feels super slow they also make you do these ridiculous searches for items, people and other stuff it felt like a chore every single time. I cannot say a positve that doesn't come from my own interpretation, hence the title [b]you have to make it fun yourself[/b].\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nI was expecting it to be bad, but it sort of met my expectations and slightly pass it. Nothing fun comes from this game and even the story without your own interpretations and opinions, so it made sense that people keep saying this is bad because of the justifiable bandwagon saying everything about this game is bad. Personally I found some good fun with it, but you should know that finish this game won't make you say [i]\"That was a good game.\"[/i] you would say to yourself [i]Finally, it's over\"[/i] and that says a lot about how much of a chore I felt of this game when I wasn't defending it with an open mind.\n\n5/10 I only played it because I wanted to get through all of the Yakuza games myself and be a fan.

Give yourself a break between the first three games (0, Kiwami 1, Kiwami 2) and this one, because this is a much older game and while it feels pretty similar to the other games at first glance, you'll start to notice a bunch of small nitpicks that will add up to a bundle of annoyance. \n\nYou're going to have to accept that a significant chunk of this game is an exploration of Kiryu's character and that a bunch of chapters aren't going to be what you might have expected after playing the first few games. It's much slower, and I can see why this game generally gets ranked pretty lowly when people talk about the series as a whole. The combat is also a lot more frustrating, because enemies love to block. Ultimately, for a huge chunk of the game, you're hanging out at an orphanage and dealing with kids and their problems. It's not really as riveting as watching Yakuza argue over territory or whathaveyou. \n\nThere's also the issue of the latter half of the story being a little incomprehensible. I'm not sure if there's something missing in translation or what exactly is going on, but without getting into spoiler territory, a bunch of character's have wacky motivations for their actions and it was a bit difficult to figure out what was going on. \n\nBut I still really did enjoy this game, mainly because the Yakuza series has a great story and the side missions remain incredibly amusing. As much as this game gets a bad reputation for the slowness of the early chapters and one of the later chapters, I genuinely enjoyed watching Kiryu navigate the situations presented in them.

The behated, the infamous! The jump to the 7th console generation, with the worst development cycle in the entire series!\n[b]And it shows![/b][/i]\n\nIt's the third game in the series, released back in the year of our lord 2009 for the PS3. If you're this far into the series you've probably played the previous games so I don't need to give you a summary of what these games are like. If you're new just stop reading this and go play Zero.\n\n\n[i]All good? All good.[/i]\nEverything you've heard about this game's combat. It's true. But it's not even my main gripe with this game. I'll get into the other stuff later, because somehow [b]EVERYTHING this game does, it does wrong[/b].\n\nYes, it's slow and stiff.\nYes, you deal literal single-digit pixels of damage with every attack. No damage upgrades ever.\nYes, bosses have added resistance to weapons and heat actions, just to waste your time.\nYes, enemies block everything you throw at them from the front. Two thirds of the enemy types (there's a grand total of three) either resist or counter your grabs.\nYes, [i]\"dashing around to hit them from the back\"[/i] is not even remotely a thing with this game's pathetic-ass dash that moves one millimeter.\nYes, you need to grind your ass off to even make Kiryu remotely playable by the time you're 2/3 done with the game. Your combos aren't even true combos until you have every \"combo speed\" upgrade at your disposal so you can keep a single chain going without an enemy casually walking out of it.\n\n\n[b]The combat engine in itself is entirely busted.[/b]\nHitboxes are the most inconsistent in the whole series.\nGrabs go through enemies if there's even the slightest height difference (inclines, stairways), grabs also go through enemies if they're in any kind of attack state.\nHeat action requirements are INCREDIBLY picky, and generally require enemies to be at a complete standstill, giving you only a frame or two to trigger them before that enemy's AI decides to do whatever else it feels like doing (usually dashing out of your way or otherwise moving out of range to be defensive and waste your time, because they HATE being aggressive in any way, so you're never even in any danger of dying, outside of dying of boredom).\n\nYou've heard all of this before if you've seen anyone talk about this game, it's nothing new. We know.\n\n\n\nI would like to talk about this game's STORY though, because it is genuinely insane to me that any deranged person can go out and pretend that it's anything close to good, let alone \"one of the best in the series\".\n\n[spoiler]This entire game is filler. The entire game is pointless. It starts by hitting you in the nuts with 6 hours of ORPHANAGE FILLER. Then it hits you with THREE MORE HOURS by chapter 10. 9 out of my 19 hours of playthrough, with minimum side content done. Literally almost half of this game is filler.\nAnd the story itself doesn't have much better to say for itself.\n\nThe whole story gets kickstarted by a generic [i]\"ooooooo evil business wants to demolish the POOR ORPHANAGE to build a BIG BUSINESS RESORT, THINK OF THE CHILDREEEEN\"[/i].\nIt's the cheapest way to try and gain your sympathy.\nAlso children in my Yakuza. [b]Get out.[/b] Haruka's terrible enough on her own.\n\nSayama gets unceremoniously removed from the series, axing all her development from the second game. Sure, whatever.\n\nThe two main villains of the game do not interact with the main character until the tail end of the game. Richardson is Jingu 2.0, as if the original wasn't a bad enough villain. And Mine's entire motivation literally boils down to [i]\"I'm lonely and have no friends :(\"[/i].\n\nThe other three main villains get ZERO development, and are simply evil for the sake of being evil (you could replace them with cardboard cutouts and it would make no difference). They also get unceremoniously removed from the plot without your involvement. Two of them offscreen.\n\n\nYakuza 2 EXPLICITLY avoids the shitty trope the first game had, of leaving a bad guy alive next to a gun just so they can kill off a good guy.\nDaigo just shoots Shindo before he can get any funny ideas.\nYou know what this game does with that writing development?\nThey roll the whole thing back!\nThey have this dumb babby Yakuza in the form of Rikiya who instantly falls in love with you, starts following you around, and gets killed off suddenly by a bad guy Kiryu knocked out and left next to a gun!\nAnd it leads to the worst, most overacted, most unwarranted death scene in the franchise!\nThis [b]sucks[/b]!\n\n\nThe game sets up the \"OOOOO KAZAMA MYSTERYYYYYYYYY\" at the very start just to hit you with the 6 hours of orphanage filler, only for the whole subplot to go nowhere by the time you get to it.\nYou just find out that the \"Kazama\" you see in this game is actually the [b]EEEEVIL AMERICAN TWIN BROOOOTHER OF KAZAMA THAT WORKS FOR THE CIAAAA[/b]. The literal, single, most terrible, Hollywood-ass way they could have taken this subplot. A literal \"\"\"uncle\"\"\" that Kiryu never found out about, that just happens to be a bad guy here.\n\nYou fight him ONCE. There's no emotional payoff for any of it. He has a change of heart, gives you a plane to move between towns quicker, and promptly disappears from the franchise.\n\n\nNot to mention how stupid and gringo-pander-y the entire American/CIA story is to begin with, or how much of a non-character Richardson is. Or how Black Monday (the organization he runs) is literally introduced to you near the end in one of the two FOURTY-MINUTE EXPOSITION TEXT DUMPS that the main story forces on you.\n\nThis entire plot is an active insult to the intelligence of anyone that plays this game. It's easily the worst-paced plot in any game I've played, and I've played some CRAP, alright.\n[i]It's the most garbage story this series has ever, at any point, had, somehow finding a way to combine the worst tropes from both anime and Hollywood and playing them completely straight, expecting you to care.[/i]\n\nAlso, THE knife scene.\n\nI cannot believe anyone would in good faith like a story this abjectly terrible, outside of being blinded by the nostalgia of having the misfortune of playing this... THING as a child.[/spoiler]\n\nNeedless to say I was mentally tuning out by the end from boredom.\nImmediately forgot most of the character names as soon as they were unceremoniously removed from the plot, too. That's how unmemorable everyone in this game is.\n\n\nThe music's nothing to write home about, either. JUST finishing the game, I remember... two or three songs at most. Anything that isn't generic ambience is just generic Yakuza \"rock\" themes that are like four notes in total and have no memorable melodies to them.\n\n\nEasily one of the quickest ALT+F4+Uninstalls I've done, soon as I was done 100%ing to avoid the blemish in my series 100% journey. Minigames and side content were the most bloated and miserable in the entire series BTW. 119 bland substories, censored/removed content notwithstanding.\n\n\nI was THIS close to waiting for a Kiwami 3 after seeing the bad reputation this game had. But caved in and bought the remaster pack. [i]And it was the right choice.[/i]\nThis game does NOT deserve a remake. It does NOT deserve a Kiwami 3.\nAnd if I had waited for something like that to happen, I would have simply never got around to playing the rest of the series.\nRipping the bandaid off now so I can play the games after and actually have anything [i]resembling[/i] a good time was the best choice here.\n\n\n[b]Unironically, skip this game. Every single aspect of it is irredeemable in every way. Even the PLOT is completely inconsequential, to the point where you'd be getting the gist of it from seeing a plot summary on YouTube. Or just looking up who dies.[/b]\n\nFans of this game are actual insane toxic gatekeepers too.

It\u2019s the first main series game to feature a controllable game camera for the adventure portion, and to introduce more elaborate side content that would become synonymous with [I]Yakuza[/I] games. Visually, the power of the PlayStation 3 allowed major characters to be depicted with greater detail and realism, cementing their iconic designs. These advancements laid the technical and stylistic foundation for future [I]Yakuza[/I] titles in the main and spin-off series.\n\nThe technical and stylistic similarities between [I]Y3[/I] and future [I]Yakuza[/I] games meant it didn\u2019t require the major overhaul that [I]Yakuza 1[/I] and [I]Yakuza 2[/I] needed in bringing it over to modern platforms. It\u2019s therefore understandable that developers at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio decided to remaster [I]Y3[/I] than to remake it, especially when they were also working on [I]Judgment[/I] and [I]Yakuza: Like a Dragon[/I], as well as remastering [I]Yakuza 4[/I] and [I]5[/I] around the same time.\n\nSadly, [I]Y3R[/I] is not a great remaster, in part because of the uneven remastering workmanship. The flaws of [I]Y3[/I], on the heels of the superb [I]Yakuza 0[/I] and the excellent [I]Yakuza Kiwami[/I] and [I]Yakuza Kiwami 2[/I], were also amplified in comparison and with time. What we ended up with is a game that showed us that [I]Y3[/I] should have been remade \u2013 that is given the [I]Kiwami[/I] treatment \u2013 instead of remastered.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2980100332\n[H1]Graphics & Framerate Issues[/H1]\n[I]Y3R[/I] is a decent looking game on modern platforms. While it\u2019s obvious that the character models have fewer polygons than those in more recent games, they look good enough even when upscaled to 1080p from the original 720p resolution. However, some textures, such as those for male hands, still appear low-res. In-game cinematic sequences also look decent, but pre-rendered cutscenes were simply resized from 720p without any additional image sharpening or colour adjustments done. The contrast between in-game and pre-rendered visuals is quite jarring, making [I]Y3R[/I] look unpolished.\n\nThe visual inconsistencies could be forgiven if the gameplay is solid. Unfortunately, [I]Y3R[/I] is a bit of mess under the hood. Although the PC version can run at framerates higher than 60 fps, it\u2019s not fully optimized for it. A few minigames (e.g., fishing, massage parlour) are actually harder to play if they\u2019re run at above the original 30 fps cap. I suppose you can play [I]Y3R[/I] at 30 fps at the expense of smoothness in graphics, but that would defeat the point of playing a game that was specifically and supposedly refurbished for modern systems.\n\n[H1]Semi-Broken Combat[/H1]\nThe inherent framerate issue also affects combat, which is the core of [I]Yakuza[/I] games. For some reason, basic quickstepping doesn\u2019t put adequate distance between you and your enemy, making the technique rather useless until you\u2019ve upgraded it. Quickstepping behind your enemies so you can strike them from behind is also difficult to pull off at above 30 fps. These are flaws that should have been detected and fixed during the remaster, and not doing so only made [I]Y3R[/I] feel like an unfinished product.\n\nYet, two of the biggest problems with combat in [I]Y3R[/I] (reportedly carried over from [I]Y3[/I]) are enemies blocking attacks too often and swarming you in all directions at the same time. I guess these are meant to add a touch of realism to the game, but they don\u2019t make it fun. These become a major problem when you try to build up Heat for special moves and takedowns. You can\u2019t build up Heat when enemies are blocking, and Heat also depletes if you get hit or if you\u2019re idle. Downing a couple of Tauriner or Staminan drinks is a quick workaround, but even with sufficient Heat, timing your Heat Action execution can be tricky \u2013 again, possibly due to framerate issues. It\u2019s often frustrating, and I did finish the game at normal difficulty by learning to circumvent this semi-broken combat system. But, it shouldn\u2019t have been this way.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2980100030\n[H1]Story: Gem in a Bloated Mess[/H1]\n[I]Y3[/I] was originally the third part of Kiryu\u2019s story, with him now running an orphanage in Okinawa. On the surface, it\u2019s a tale of Kiryu going up against the yakuza who wants to seize the land on which the orphanage sits. At its core, it\u2019s about vulnerable and abandoned people looking for love, support and acceptance. In fact, the first third of [I]Y3R[/I] focuses on Kiryu being father figure to the orphans he is looking after. It\u2019s actually a refreshing change of pace in line with Kiryu\u2019s post-yakuza life. It\u2019s not until Chapter 5 of 12 that he returns to Kamurocho to take care of business.\n\nUnfortunately, outlandish plot devices and set pieces muddle the otherwise awesome story of one man versus the yakuza to protect the children he cares about. Although [I]Yakuza (Kiwami)[/I] and [I]Yakuza (Kiwami) 2[/I] are bizarre and incredible in their own ways, [I]Y3/Y3R[/I] dials the absurdity up to eleven[SPOILER]by adding a doppelganger plot twist, the CIA, international arms dealers, a sexagenarian flipping a bull, and stealth fighter jet commutes to name a few to the plot[/SPOILER], so much so that it\u2019s more like a story dreamed up by prepubescent boys, with story beats clearly taken from prominent films, including a couple by Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nThe story\u2019s pacing is also very uneven, necessitating in dedicating a whole chapter three-quarters into the game for exposition by a single character to explain the convoluted plot. Instead of revealing the main antagonist\u2019s motivation bit by bit throughout the game, it has him describe it in full prior to the final showdown. The ending feels like a quick fix for a major plot hole, and any tension and significance it might have had is then quickly resolved with a post-credit scene. It\u2019s such a mess that I feel [I]Y0[/I], [I]YK[/I] and [I]YK2[/I] form a better, more complete story arc for Kiryu than [I]Y(K)[/I], [I]Y(K)2[/I] and [I]Y3/Y3R[/I].\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2980099225\n[H1]Final Thoughts: A \u201cKiwamissed\u201d Opportunity[/H1]\n[I]Y3[/I] might have been good back in the day, but in the decade that followed, many innovations and refinements have been made to this game franchise\u2019s gameplay and graphics. Remastering [I]Y3[/I] without fixing flaws that negatively affect the original gameplay, and without doing a thorough job in upscaling the graphics is simply inadequate for a title that follows the [I]Y0[/I], [I]YK[/I] and [I]YK2[/I]. No wonder [I]Y3R[/I] feels dated, unpolished and incomplete.\n\nConsidering [I]Y3[/I] was a pivotal title for the game series, it deserved better. But, I get why RGG Studio and SEGA didn\u2019t give [I]Y3[/I] the [I]Kiwami[/I] treatment: it made no sense for them to spend time and money on recreating assets that won\u2019t be used in future titles. After all, [I]Yakuza[/I] games are lower-budget titles made to look like AAA games. But as a result, [I]Y3/Y3R[/I] is now seen as the worst game in the series for the wrong reasons.\n\nA properly made remaster could have salvaged [I]Y3[/I]\u2019s reputation, even with the absurd plot elements that didn\u2019t age well. At the end of the day, [I]Yakuza[/I] completionists would buy this game \u2013 likely as part of the [I]Yakuza Remastered Collection[/I] \u2013 regardless of its quality. I may give it a thumbs down in this review, but I think at the very least it\u2019s worth playing the first few chapters to see Kiryu\u2019s gentler, loving side that contrasts his Dragon of Dojima persona. It\u2019s really too bad that the rest of the game couldn\u2019t be as straightforward as Kiryu\u2019s life in Okinawa, but instead become more unnecessarily complicated, much like his time in Kamurocho.", "timestamp_created": 1684948766, "timestamp_updated": 1684975318, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628571450710296631", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138869831": {"recommendationid": "138869831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842748017", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 958, "last_played": 1684878666}, "language": "english", "review": "this is one of the games ever made", "timestamp_created": 1684879538, "timestamp_updated": 1690991774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138836642": {"recommendationid": "138836642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832305151", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1161, "last_played": 1684847680}, "language": "english", "review": "rikiya best boy", "timestamp_created": 1684847698, "timestamp_updated": 1684847698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138813126": {"recommendationid": "138813126", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004746252", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1267, "last_played": 1684817357}, "language": "english", "review": "Barring the horrible combat, this games story stands out way more than the others, so many good emotional moments for Kiryu that shows the bro in a whole new light.", "timestamp_created": 1684817437, "timestamp_updated": 1684817437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138750632": {"recommendationid": "138750632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034998486", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2542, "last_played": 1684837548}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're here reading this, chances are you're probably on the journey of playing through this series in chronological order. There's not really any other point in playing through this. If that is you and have started with Zero, well, this is not that.\n\n[b]Combat:[/b] As others have pointed out, the combat is slow and can be very frustrating. Finding Komaki and his training is not optional - it's fundamental. With that, it gets a little more enjoyable, but you'll likley need to put in some hours until I got used to it. Bosses can be challenging. Random encounters are one of the most tiresome and annoying parts of the game, since they're inescapable, they take a long time and you can also just spot the guy waiting to kick you on the street, so most times it felt like I was just running away from them, hoping they wouldn't see or catch me.\n\n[b]Story:[/b] I have mixed feelings here. You're probably used to it by now, but Yakuza continues its tradition of being overly cryptic and complex and introducing way too many characters than it has time to explore. That said, I found the story to be better than that of 2. Yes, that's right. It starts slowly at first, but then it just goes all over the place and by the end it feels like you're not actually justified in doing anything else apart from the story missions due to how urgent they feel. I'd say it was worth it though.\nAside from Kamurocho, you also get to experience Okinawa which was really chill and enjoyable and had the distinct feeling of being a different place.\n\n[b]Substories:[/b] Way too many. A lot of fat that gets in the way. There are some notable highlights that are really good and/or explore main characters. There is also one that's a murder mystery and feels like the prototype for what would later be Judgement. I recommend those but the problem is that you have to dig through some very boring ones to find them. And the hostesses, once again, get in the way of completing everything. Idk, I just didn't enjoy them at all.\n\n[b]Minigames:[/b] Yea nah. Overly difficult. Don't even get me started on the cabaret minigame here - even with a guide I just couldn't get anything to work. Some people may enjoy them, but I've always found minigames to be unnecessarily challenging and grindy.\nThere's also an odd reliance on modding weapons and finding or purchasing catalogues and items to combine and enhance weapons. I didn't get it, personally - and I didn't find it useful in any way.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] It's hard to play this in the current era of gaming where there's better out there, but if you're here to experience Kiryu's third chapter, then I'd recommend it for the story if nothing else.

Sometimes boss fights will refuse to allow you to continue fighting for an extended period of time and continually stun you or keep you down. This game really limited your options in terms of combos and fighting styles, and the ability tree is more or less non-existent. I don't care too much about the combat in comparison to others, but I'm sure the combat system hurts replay value.\n\nThat being said, the story is good as always. While I have some issues with pacing (especially when the main plot really gets going, it slows to a crawl and drags unnecessarily with the orphanage kids. As much as I like the orphanage kids, the story structure definitely needed a little shuffling. I liked most of the new characters, and a lot of the character development is quite rushed. Standouts were Rikiya and Mine, but Mine's character development is rushed. And as always, every now and then, Yakuza 3 manages to get a laugh from me every now and then. Revelations in particular, was great, and I hope to see more of that in the other installments. \n\nUnfortunately, the minigames are nowhere near as good as the others. Karaoke and talking to hostesses are the two exceptions. \n\nHostess Maker is monotonous and boring. Dressing up is awful when you realise that there's only one combination to make your hostess as good as she can look, and there's only one bland route to optimise your training sessions/breaks with her. The grind is tedious, and none of the girls are distinct enough for me to grow attached to any of them. It's frustrating to walk around at a snails pace to see my hostess lifelessly feeding a grown man a piece of fruit. \n\nAroma Massage is nothing to write home about, but at least it's funny in concept. \n\nBatting is alright, Bowling has some weird physics; sometimes the game refuses to give you a strike when in other games, you absolutely would have gotten it. Darts and Billiards are extremely frustrating in this game until you look up a walkthrough (and even then Darts is still not really fun if you're looking at anywhere except a triple 20 or a bullseye). Fishing is the most frustrating and tedious trying to catch a stupid bloody tuna. Golf is really infuriating trying to put the ball away. \n\nThere are also a few smaller quality of life features that I miss from other games such as knowing how much health a particular food item or drink restores, but it's not that important.\n\nI recommend Yakuza 3 Remastered if you're a Yakuza fan, but just be prepared that it's not refined as the rest in terms of core gameplay and minigames. 7/10.\n\n*I've played Yakuza 0, Kiwami 1 and 2 at time of review.", "timestamp_created": 1684731499, "timestamp_updated": 1684731499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138737042": {"recommendationid": "138737042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105220259", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 984, "last_played": 1684728633}, "language": "english", "review": "Yakuza 3 (2009)", "timestamp_created": 1684729149, "timestamp_updated": 1684729149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138609282": {"recommendationid": "138609282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088467570", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2069, "last_played": 1684586270}, "language": "english", "review": "How to beat the Blockuza 3:\n\nsquare + square + square + triangle + triangle", "timestamp_created": 1684586475, "timestamp_updated": 1684586475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138530799": {"recommendationid": "138530799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071379163", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1533, "last_played": 1620097007}, "language": "english", "review": "Overly hated.

With even the most common street thugs blocking pretty often, the pacing being an issue for some (very slow at the start, then picks up on Chapter 5 only to slam into a wall on 10, then picking up again to wrap up the last 2 chapters), and bosses having a bit too much damage reduction - especially on the harder difficulties - it's understandable why some might become disappointed with this game, especially if they moved on from the Kiwamis. However, I wouldn't say that this is a terrible game by any means.\n\nI honestly didn't mind the the slow pacing for the first half of the game, especially since it allowed the game to have the caring side of Kiryu on full display, a stark contrast from the rugged badass we knew him as in the previous games. That being said, it did make my Legend playthrough quite a slog, even with me running NG+, so it's especially hard to recommend a subsequent playthrough for this one.\n\nI haven't really talked much about the antagonists when reviewing the previous games, but Mine in this game is actually one of my favorite villains in the series, being a complex and tragic character who can be terrifying when he snaps out of his calm and composed state, not to mention he steals the show whenever he's on screen, with a rather intimidating presence.\n\nTo my surprise, there isn't an achievement for completing everything on the Completion List like with the previous games, but there's one for completing all minigames, which is usually the hardest part, so it was pretty much the same to me. If there's any chance you changed the controller configuration to have the right stick only register vertical movement due to pool, I don't blame you for doing so at all.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely

tecnically the oldest of the franchise available to play.\n\nIf you played this right after finishing 0 to Kiwami 2, you will notice how mechanically dated the gameplay feels, since most of the quality of life improvements still have to happen and the gameplay feels stiff and simple.\n\nKiryu moveset is very basic and pretty much every goon can be dealt with button mashing. The combat lacks the stance system from 0 and Kiwami and lacks the dynamic system from Kiwami 2 to become interesting.\nPunches lack weight and you are mostly repeating the same 4 combos over and over and over.\nIt can still have a few satisfying moments, but you will want to go back to the other games.\n\nBosses on the other hand are annoying since they mostly play the same: block every attack, immunity to throws, can attack immediately after blocking and usually have a counter attack that always hits you before you can dodge or counter.\nAs soon you get Tiger Drop, most bosses turn into a joke. Punch them twice so they counter, then Tiger Drop.\n\nThere is still a bunch of minigames scattered, but there is little to no reason to do them. Kiryu also moves at a fast walk at most, so getting around gets a bit annoying, even worse that enemies can't be seen on the minimap and instead stay still on several spots around the map, so avoiding fights is a pain since you have to go into other streets since most places are far too tight for you to maneuver.\n\nThe Hostess minigame makes a return, or better yet, its debut. Its very rough, boring and takes a lot of time for almost no payoff.\nAll you do is go back and forth two rooms about three times, just paying attention on 3 lines of dialogue and then changing the hostess clothes a bit. It gets boring really fast.\n\nTalking about the minimap, some substories don't show at all until you stumble upon them. I have found a few of them during the last chapter because I never had to enter most buildings.\n\nThe story is ok. Not bad, but nothing to write about, there is some plot and twists to keep you invested, but overall it feels rather weak after 2.\nCharacters come and go, deaths seem to happen only so there is some drama and eventually the plot barely matters at the end. Even the twist they do right at the end gets resolved post credits, so there was no point.\nThe story feels pretty short, since half of it is Kiryu taking care of his kids.\n\nThe 60fps improvement of the remaster also brought a few problems, since a few things were tied to frame rate, the quickstep distance is halved and button prompts require you to mash way too fast, causing some counters to be basically impossible and the \"Feel the heat\" moments not charging fast enough.\nSome mods are available to fix the quickstep problem at least.\n\nMusic is still very good, \"D 2 A\" was so out of place that it became one of my favorite songs of the franchise. There is no song at \"Receive you the madtype\" levels, but that one is on a tier of its own.\n\nOverall, not a bad game like I said, but the wrinkles of time are very apparent on this game and unless you keep in mind that this is basically the mecanically oldest game in Steam, it will feel like a letdown.", "timestamp_created": 1684349390, "timestamp_updated": 1684376108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138447118": {"recommendationid": "138447118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355056702", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1685206404}, "language": "english", "review": "Watashi wa poor people desu, I curb stomp-u on the disabled(desu).

This can be good or bad depending on who you ask, but personally, there are aspects to this game that felt new and groundbreaking and there are some aspects that felt annoying and boring. When it comes to the review, I have to point all the good and bad points of Yakuza 3 so that its easy for you to understand. \n\nThe Good:\n\nAs some other reviewers have mentioned, Yakuza 3 is a substantial improvement from the original Yakuza 1 and 2 games, making the shift to the Yakuza 3 a lot easier for most of the players who have played previous polished games of Yakuza 0, Kiwami and Kiwami 2. The combat is easy to adapt to, albeit not diverse, the inventory shenanigans are the same as they were in 0 and Kiwami (although you have to share your item slots with gear and weapons), the heat actions still feel visceral and Kiryu still kills people with his spectacular karaoke. Some of the places in the Yakuza 3 Remastered can be stunning, some of the characters introduced in this game can be unforgettable and some of the new mechanics to weapon building and heat actions are fun.\n\nThe plot is intriguing when compared to the previous Yakuza games and I know that many people don't really like the pace change that they did in this game, but personally, it feels great to finally see Kiryu spending some time being a dad instead of constantly being involved throughout the story in some sort of drama with either Kiryu's family and friends or with some sort of international mafia that is constantly a threat. It allows for players to experience a more peaceful and dad-like life of Kiryu. To add to all of this, newly introduced characters go through great character developments that makes you cheer for them whilst the antagonists in this game, except for couple, feel humane and relatable as you can understand where they are coming from and why they are doing the things they do in the story. So overall, it's still a Yakuza game, but with a different pace of portraying the story. \n\nThe substories in this game remain the same, at times great entertainment, at others a chore. Certain substories have cutscenes and some of them help the player to get closer to some of the new characters, which is great as there have been so many additions and deletions of characters in the series thus far that you can become numb to some of the new additions. \n\nThe new mechanics that they added into this game, and later into the series, with Revelations, additional Heat Actions, IF7, and Hitman missions are actually fun. Whilst it is not necessary for you to complete and collect all of them, I highly recommend doing at the very minimum Revelations as those are great entertainment and provide great Heat Actions and Finishing moves that will help you immensely in the story. Very easy to understand where to go and they do not feel like a chore! IF7 is a cool idea, where you can re-engage previous battle fights and get upgrades or ingredients. Hitman missions are a neat idea and are easy way to get money and fight unique mini-bosses.\n\nTalk about minor details, I genuinely think that this is the second game where I actually love the entire OST in Yakuza series thus far, Yakuza 0 being the first. Every single track feels fun, blood-pumping, stressful or emotional. Fly, Pure Malice, Sound's Storm, Receive and Stab You, D2A, and other songs are unique and unforgettable, making some of the fights actually feel inspiring and fun. \n\nLast, but not least, KARAOKE. I think that this is the first Yakuza game that I have played so far that allows you to reminiscence some of the animated moments of karaoke, even those when you sing with friends or hostesses. I think it is a neat idea as sometimes you just want to listen to and enjoy the song without having to sweat on the QTE. \n\nThe Bad:\n\nOh boy. As you most probably have heard, the fights and encounters in this game, while might feel great at times, are not as fun due to uncanny amount of blocking. You are either forced to constantly grab enemies and send them flying, counter attack, or have items that can allow you to bypass their blocking (sharp items such as knifes on enemies with no weapons or guns). This sucks as it does not feel as great to fight as it usually is in any other Yakuza game. The only fights that actually feel fair and fun to fight are only by the end of the game as those bosses either don't block or are susceptible to block breaks. \n\nIn regards to the plot and characters, it's the same old Yakuza. Some of the moments in the story can be genuinely dumbfounding and some characters are just boring and undeveloped. Kiryu in this game feels more isolated in his own agenda, which is sometimes nice but at the same time infuriating, when you progress through the story. To add to that, the entire removal of previously established characters and their connections with Kiryu in the previous games also questions as to why writers have completely forgotten or have changed the narration entirely, as it downplays important events that happened in the already established storyline. \n\nThe game has its usual high amount of minigames that everyone love and expect to see from the previous corresponding games of Yakuza, but has outdated mechanics to them that feel sometimes more difficult than they ever were in other Yakuza games. Some of these, especially batting center's Extra Hard, Golf's Competition Completion with a score of -5 and Pool's Broken AI can be very challenging and soul-consuming if you are going for the 100% achievements in this game. Probably one of the most frustrating achievements I had to deal with in a while as the last time I felt this frustrated at my time wasted would have to be at Yakuza 0. To add to that, I have no clue as to why they added one of the worst minigames in the entire series, Hostess-making. It feels confusing as the game does not tell you the crucial information you need, so you have to use Google to find the most optimized way of completing or even playing this minigame. I had to play this minigame for a quite bit for the achievements and it felt like I was wasting time. I understand that not a lot of people are here for the 100%, but I believe that even if you are going to play for the entertainment value, you will not get a lot of fun out of these minigames, unfortunately.\n\nGetting to Amon fight and the fight itself are disappointing. As mentioned, you have to date hostesses to unlock substories and have to complete certain hard levels in some of the aforementioned outdated minigames to get to the substory completion, which sucks. The Amon fight itself was boring as he uses same fighting styles as some of the bosses in the story, making it easy to win against as he is probably the weakest Amon in the series.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall, for anybody who has been enjoying the Yakuza series so far, you should try this game out. It has a different pace from the rest of the Yakuza games I have played thus far, and it feels great. The addition of a new city, Ryukyu, the OST, and some of the new characters make it worth playing at least once. On the other hand, poor mechanics of enemy blocking, minigames and some sidequests are the most disappointing parts of this game and can be by themselves a put off for many people. Whilst I enjoyed this game despite its flaws, my recommendation for casual enjoyment would have to be play it for the story and not for the side-activities!\n\nI apologize for any mistakes here as it is my first time writing a review, so I hope this helps!", "timestamp_created": 1684118982, "timestamp_updated": 1684118982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138316766": {"recommendationid": "138316766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198806031160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2095, "last_played": 1684107447}, "language": "english", "review": "While Yakuza 3 has not aged well, it is still a fun game to play. \n\nI find the story in this part very well done, and for now is my 2nd favorite behind Yakuza 0.

The mainline Yakuza series is now up to eight entries; ask people to rank all the titles, and most will put Yakuza 3 at the bottom (while noting that the worst Yakuza game is still a solid game on its own terms). I think this is fair, and yet simultaneously, I think this is one of the most important and visionary Yakuza titles, and will only get shortchanged by modern audiences because of the Kiwami remakes. Let me explain.\n\nThe first two Yakuza games were an ambitious attempt to combine a Shenmue-style dense, simulated world with low-brow brawling and a serious, melodramatic Yakuza story ripped straight from Japanese cinema. The fact that they were obviously stitched together from these disparate parts was part of their charm, but the underlying technology couldn\u2019t fully support the vision; Shenmue was able to make its detailed world on the Dreamcast only through a truly stupendous outlay of time and money and clever use of the Dreamcast hardware.\u00a0Yakuza had a budget the fraction of the size and was forced to work with the difficult-to-program PS2. The end result is more of a zoomed-out brawler playground that a richly detailed slice of Tokyo.\n\nYakuza 3 changes this. It returns to the exact same location\u2014the semi-fictional red light district of Kamurocho\u2014but renders it in lush detail (as well as the new secondary location of Okinawa\u2014more on that in a sec). A first-person camera is implemented, and used in a few game modes, but is really there just to show off the detail. The pacing is tremendously improved by allowing battles and exploration to seamlessly blend, without the traditional black loading screen; a wider array of minigames are implemented, bringing the total up to 20. These changes would carry through to every subsequent game in the series, and ultimately be \u201cbackported\u201d to its predecessors via the full remakes of Yakuza Kiwami 1 and 2.\n\nThis means that someone who started the Yakuza series today, playing the games in chronological order starting with Yakuza 0 and working their way through the Kiwamis before hitting Yakuza 3, would find Yakuza 3 a substantial step backwards; the \u201cremasterings\u201d of Yakuza 3\u20135 are simply HD ports with redone localization, and so are a substantial graphical downgrade 0/Kiwami. Without the freshness and awe of its advances, Yakuza 3 can feel like a filler Yakuza game, a final spin of the wheels before the series realizes it needs to start changing to avoid becoming stale.\n\nBut I have a fondness for Yakuza 3 even coming off Kiwami, and that\u2019s almost solely due to the brave, divisive turn it takes with its story. One of the most common tropes of the \u201chonorable criminal\u201d is the criminal who leaves the life of crime behind to Do Good, but then gets Pulled Back In because somebody wants to make a sequel. Yakuza 2 already pulled this trick, and at the end of that protagonist Kiryu went \u201cokay, for real this time, I\u2019m running an orphanage on Okinawa and not beating up any more dudes.\u201d You\u2019d expect Yakuza 3 to find some flimsy excuse to reverse this off the bat once again, but it doesn't; the game spends an extended period of time with Kiryu fully in Orphanage Dad mode, helping take care of kids and dealing with the occasional financial or local crime issue.\n\nI love this; Kiryu\u2019s always at his best when his natural warmth is allowed to shine, and I bluntly didn\u2019t take enough of a break between this and previous Yakuza titles, so the variety was welcome. A lot of players felt that this isn\u2019t what they signed up for, that the Okinawa segment was a series of pointless sidequests and character moments divorced from the larger stakes of the series. And yeah, if you\u2019re here solely to see more Elaborate Yakuza Opera, you\u2019re going to be disappointed with the game\u2019s first half.\n\nI felt the opposite; eventually, Kiryu is pulled back in and goes to Kamarucho, and while I appreciate that the game took the time to \u2018earn\u2019 this and it felt consistent with Kiryu\u2019s character, the actual story and gameplay is a forgettable retread; I can barely remember the plot writing this, and what I do remember is mostly just a variation on things we\u2019ve seen in the first two. The villain in particular, while a notable attempt at making a more intellectual antagonist for Kiryu, is at the end of the day a thinly-written finance criminal.\n\nThe developers clearly realized that they were getting into a rut; Yakuza 4 substantially shook up the series and it never looked back. But I wouldn\u2019t skip Yakuza 3; some of the best character moments in the entire series are found with the children of the Sunflower Orphanage.", "timestamp_created": 1682035388, "timestamp_updated": 1682035388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786373615264892578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137003471": {"recommendationid": "137003471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093191064", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1292, "last_played": 1681997459}, "language": "english", "review": "Kiryu", "timestamp_created": 1681997525, "timestamp_updated": 1681997525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136954865": {"recommendationid": "136954865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198430194025", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1191, "last_played": 1682602519}, "language": "english", "review": "starting from 0, this is the worst entry so far, but still ok", "timestamp_created": 1681908456, "timestamp_updated": 1681908456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136942383": {"recommendationid": "136942383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189695297", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2288, "last_played": 1681880667}, "language": "english", "review": "thumbs up", "timestamp_created": 1681881158, "timestamp_updated": 1681881158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136939939": {"recommendationid": "136939939", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990082800", "num_games_owned": 758, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2529, "last_played": 1681735569}, "language": "english", "review": "Coming from Kiwami 2, adjusting to the aging Yakuza 3 is something of a tall order. From the dated visuals, to the frustrating combat, even the rudimentary side activities, Yakuza 3 is by far the worst gameplay experience in the overall series by 2023 standards.\n\nWith that said, Yakuza 3 has one of the more interesting stories in the overall series, offers added variety with the setting of Okinawa, has a banging soundtrack and, most crucially of all, has the batsh*t lunacy the series is beloved for in spades.\n\nIf you can endure the rough edges, Yakuza 3 has plenty to love and is well worth your time. But if you're coming straight from Kiwami 2... it's going to be a bumpy ride.\n\nTECHNICAL / PORT: Port is solid. Locked to 60FPS but holds this consistently. Has a good range of visual options considering it's a 14 year old PS3 game, but beyond simple things such as button prompts for Xbox controllers, this port uses the same assets as the PS3 version. The game has aged decently, though the lower detail textures and lower poly models are glaringly obvious. The texture work here is excellent despite the lower fidelity though which prevents the game from looking muddy or blurry. Uses a deferred renderer so lacks support for MSAA, but offers CMAA (or FXAA if you hate your eyes) as well as increased render scaling and FidelityFX CAS. I noted frametiming seemed a little off with the built in vsync though this wasn't noticable in gameplay. All the same, disabling vsync ingame and forcing 'Adaptive' vsync via the nvidia control panel smoothed this out. I experienced no crashes, glitches or other issues during my playthrough.\n\nRE COMBAT DIFFICULTY: I played this through on Hard. It sucked. Y3 is 5x harder than YK2 on hard, and this largely comes down to how the combat functions here. From what I can tell online, even Normal difficulty can be quite rough, Hard is just worse. From my playthrough, here's a few observations and recommendations to help smooth out the journey. First of all, the hardest boss fights in the game are earlier ones, notably Tamashiro and the two back-to-back boss fights you endure once arriving in Kamurocho. I recommend engaging with as much side content as possible to generate exp, healing items, weapons and money. The coin lockers are your friend. In Y3, some coin locker keys can only be obtained in first person mode, so if you see one you can't reach, try this. For these first few difficult fights, stock up on strong weapons and recovery items and save them for the actual boss encounters. Get in the habit of eating at restaurants to restore your health as this will generate exp - not a lot mind you, but it adds up. Once you're able to begin Komaki's training, make this your priority and master the Komaki Parry - this is done by being in combat stance (RB) and pressing grab (B) just as an enemy attacks. The timing for this is very tight, so this may take practice, but once you lock it down, this is the single best move in the entire game. You can also buy a sword from the Dragon's Palace which is one of the strongest weapons in the game - obtain this and save it for boss encounters. It's expensive to buy (using chips) and just as expensive to repair, so I recommend getting the various items that essentially allow you to cheat in the casino and use your winnings to buy the sword and generate a ton of cash. A Zero Jewel can generate roughly 3.5m yen in a single game of roulette if you're willing to save scum on a 50/50 chance, or half as much as a safe bet. Things will get much easier from here on. Some boss fights like Lau Ka Long render weapons largely ineffective and will require good use of the Komaki Parry to get through smoothly. The final boss on the other hand is easily torn apart by that sword you bought earlier.

It\u2019s a calm slice-of-life story that slowly devolves into a crime thriller and another ploy to save the Tojo Clan.\n\nAfter playing through the series, I still adore this one the most, especially when you consider it\u2019s essentially a prototype of sorts. You can see what RGG (or CS1) were attempting to do here, and its a valiant effort. \n\nThe remaster is naturally the best way to play, with tons more content making an appearance after being cut from the original Western release.

The remaster has given it a face lift but the underlying game play feels a bit long in tooth. It shares similar systems with the previous kiwami and yakuza zero but in certain aspects make it feel slower. Kiryu's running speed, for example, is variable sometimes its fine, other times its like watching a man run with weights under water. Chapters can be ridiculously short (eg go here beat up this guy) or padded in length (eg you need to track this person down and time is crucial, oh hey boss, I'm new to this town can you show me around?). In fact the game starts in media res then flashbacks but by the time I get to the section leading to this point I was confused because I had forgotten how it started. Side quests attempt to liven up the world but creates a somewhat limited world experience as outside of side quests the npcs are pretty wooden. While I was heavily engaged in the kiwami and zero, yakuza 3 doesn't pull me in the same way. Several of the early chapters are rather mundane. The focus is on the day to day life at the orphanage which is meant to create an affectionate air around the children but feels slow and bloated. It tries to spice up the average day of an orphanage director with mystery and story twists that rather feel like a soap opera. The main character runs the orphanage and takes care of the kids - sort of. Interaction with them can be a little inconsistent. I was asked to buy a copy of the in-game version of Shonen Jump by one kid and when I returned home he never asked for it and my character never gave it to him. It felt like I should have taken an extra trip just to hand him the comic magazine if I wanted that task resolved which is bizarre because the trip only took a few days and the magazine wouldn't be out for weeks which is why it was requested in the first place.\nCombat is serviceable but not quite as fun as the revamped earlier editions. It feels basic with a lot of later enemies blocking - a lot. There are mods that improve it but playing stock port is less fun compared to zero, kiwami 1 or 2. My advice hit the weapon store before the final chapters and buy guns. Lots and lots of guns. On the flip side, you can still pull off a decent amount of sidestepping counters and power attacks with a bit of timing on bosses. Skill gain appears to be a one way street. You gain skills as you upgrade for experience and choose which skill as you go up. However once picked there doesn't appear to be an option to get the other skill.  Inventory management is less forgiving and it's still ok but it's not as good as the others that were re-done before it. There are still quick time combat events which did happen in previous fights but feel so much more pervasive in this one. Some of the button mashing events being the most annoying.\nAnother annoying part of the game is the psuedo option. It pretends to give you a choice but it either forcibly tells you to pick the other one or events make the choice moot. Its a waste of time for no reason other than making sure you don't fall asleep. \nLastly its short. There are a number of side quests I could have taken to expand the length but I just didn't find them interesting.

The plot is certainly a Yakuza plot. If you are coming off of 0, and Kiwami 1 and 2, and are hoping for more fun brawler gameplay above all else, stay far far away from this game. I wouldn't even recommend it if you got it as a part of the remastered collection if you're someone who prioritizes gameplay over plot. This game will literally just disappoint and irritate you if you aren't someone who gets invested in the story. You can move on to Yakuza 4 without missing much, outside of the fact Kiryu is running an orphanage in Okinawa, which is something you learn in the first chapter of this game.\n\nThe combat in this game is the worst I've seen yet. Enemies are super passive, and will often just stand around you holding their fists up. The thing that makes this a problem is that they also like to block constantly. Combat is boiled down to spamming grabs on enemies or just cheesing them with weapons that deal chip damage through their blocks, and not any of the fun stuff you're accustomed to from the games you've likely played before this point. \n\nThe vast majority of your attacks and options are entirely useless since they wont deal any damage through an enemies guard, and enemies re-guard before you can continue a chain without fail. Even waiting (a long time) for an enemy to attack to get behind them isn't a valid strategy, since enemies in this game can turn around while you're combo'ing them.\n\nOn top of that, many enemies including bosses take an obscene amount of damage to knock down, don't give you any good openings to deal real damage, and they can't be grabbed. Combat in this game is more of a menial chore than a challenge or fun task, and the random encounters that happen on every single city street quickly become irritating as a result.\n\nTL;DR - This game's combat is as deep as a dried up puddle, and is actively monotonous and irritating. It is not at all a combat system that is worth experiencing by any degree.\n\nIf you don't care about any of that and just want to see the substories and plot, do yourself a favor and chunk the game down to easy. The less time you spend in this game's monotonous and boring combat, the better. You'll thank yourself later. Having completed the game on hard, I can tell you there is absolutely no reward to be had in the higher difficulties. The story is worth seeing if you enjoy other Yakuza plots, so for those people I'd encourage them to bear with it.\n\nIf you're interested in Yakuza in general, and haven't played a game yet, please don't start with this game.

If somebody was coming from the original PlayStation 2 versions of Yakuza 1 and Yakuza 2, this game would be considered a significant upgrade in nearly every way, but obviously the vast majority of people these days will be coming to Yakuza 3 directly from Kiwami and Kiwami 2 as I did. This means that the consistency is quite off; you're playing a much older game, and it shows.\n\nI went into Yakuza 3 Remastered knowing this ahead of time, and it rightfully feels like a significant downgrade coming directly from the much more modern Kiwami 2 engine. The combat controls feel quite stiff and not as free-form, which tends to make fights a bit frustrating and more difficult than they need to be, especially in the early game when you are weaker and don't have access to many Heat actions, recovery items, weapons, or upgrades.\n\nThe graphics themselves have clearly been cleaned up and remastered for the PC release, and are decent enough given the origin is a PlayStation 3 game from 2009. The environments are nice and bright, and lighting effects, especially with neon signs at nighttime, are as pretty as they always are in Yakuza games. \n\nOne small complaint I have regarding the remastered visuals is that, while it appears some of the story cutscenes were quite well-remastered for this release and look amazing, others appear to have been left completely untouched from the PS3 version, with somewhat-grainy and low-quality video. I'm not sure why this was done, but it seemed to only be like that for cutscenes with many things going on at once or very large environments. Given this is the most modern way to experience Yakuza 3 right now, it would have been nice if all the cutscenes in the game received the same remastered treatment.\n\nI don't go into specific story details in my reviews for the sake of avoiding spoilers for those that are interested in the game, but I will say that the story is very enjoyable. I can't say it is quite as good as the previous chronological games, Yakuza 0, 1, and 2, but it is still very good and beyond a worthy addition to the Kiryu saga of Yakuza games.\n\nAs far as the PC port and optimization goes, I never noticed any issues. Just like Kiwami 1 and 2, the game is very well optimized and ran perfectly on my system. As always, I give Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio a massive thumbs up for adding PlayStation button prompts for DualShock 4 controllers through Steam, even in this release of an older game. It's a small thing but it's really nice for many parts of the games to have proper PlayStation button prompts, rather than the generic Xbox-style button prompts most games display.\n\nUnlike the previous games, I admit I didn't really get invested in a lot of the sidegames in this release, as I didn't find them as engaging. But even so I very much enjoyed Yakuza 3 Remastered, and having got it on a very good sale for less than $10 CAD, I will say it was more than worth the purchase price.\n\nThat said, in the future, I'd like to see Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio give the proper Kiwami remake treatment to Yakuza 3 and 4, as out of the entire Yakuza series, 3 and 4 are the only ones with very dated PC ports originating from the PlayStation 3 versions. I think it would really breathe new life into these games and complete the entire Kiryu saga experience in a more consistent, modern feel for players.", "timestamp_created": 1680564576, "timestamp_updated": 1680568660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136036529": {"recommendationid": "136036529", "author": {"steamid": "76561199215077786", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2020, "last_played": 1680714358}, "language": "english", "review": "yakuza 3 is so awesome i wish gay people were real", "timestamp_created": 1680544434, "timestamp_updated": 1680544434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549043715000152588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136035116": {"recommendationid": "136035116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365489036", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2486, "last_played": 1680545039}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, the mechanics are a little old but the story is gold, I can tell you that!", "timestamp_created": 1680542807, "timestamp_updated": 1680542807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136007198": {"recommendationid": "136007198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037320861", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 741, "last_played": 1680582161}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, got it.", "timestamp_created": 1680499028, "timestamp_updated": 1680499028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136003142": {"recommendationid": "136003142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013610937", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 1204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 422, "last_played": 1680750015}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate this game.\n\nIf you're thinking of playing this right after Kiwami 2 - for the love of everything that is holy and unholy take a break and play something else and then come back to this or you'll feel immense disappointment in the insane drop in quality.\n\n99% of the time the combat is terrible, but there is 1% where it is actually quite fun.

The menu is oldschool, the map works janky, zooming is annoying, upgrade system is absolutely stupid and who doesn't love holding A/X 20 seconds (grain of salt) to level a stat.

So keep in mind that going in I was expecting a mess, but I was pleasantly surprised and shocked that people are waving fans away from this game, and to \"skip it\". Don't get me wrong the game definitely has some rough edges, jankyness, and slow combat. But despite all of that this game isnt bad at all. In fact I enjoyed this game more over kiwami 1 and 2.\n\nWorld and Gameplay - Im going to be honest I did not like the idea of another game taking place in Kamurocho again since by now fatigue of being in the same location was now starting set in playing the whole series in chronological order, however once I did set foot and dipped my toes into Kamurocho within chapter 5, the feeling completely vanished as I was barraged with content to do and new places to see. I'll say it again, it is impressive how they make a same location for a game different to play through each game. But Okinawa is probably one of my favorite locations in the series so far. Maybe im just a sucker for tropical locations but I was immersed and amazed with the new decor. I was actually stopping to admire the view in this game despite it being pretty old.\n\nCombat - Now being the oldest Yakuza title in the series on steam, this is most stripped down Yakuza game that I have played, and that isnt even that bad. Had me using weird strats and things I wouldn't really use in the other games at times and got me experimental. With that mindset I had a lot of fun with street fight encounters. Now playing on hard has never really felt anymore tense then it did in this game, enemies even normal thugs would block FOREVER, your ass will get chain attacked for a century, and damaging a boss in this game is liking chipping away at a stone. But despite all of that, it was not impossible as people claimed, in fact I ended up first trying the secret Amon fight in the end which if you dont know is usually the hardest boss in the game. Combat definitely was a mixed bag but I enjoyed it despite a few big hiccups, like the Lua Ka Long fight, seriously screw that fight.\n\nMini games - Now most of my hours and enjoyment come from the side activities in these games if you couldnt tell from my hours of playtime for one playthrough, whether it is Yakuza's fantastic substories (actually best side content in any franchise), or climbing the ranks through the collesium. But most of it comes from the mini games, and hostess clubs, and wow do I have some things to say. First off, fuck pool and darts in this game. I was never good at pool but holy shit was the aiming inconsistent, I even looked up a guide for it and it sent me to a photo of a cat crying. The tips for that shit was be patient and maybe you'll get lucky, and guess what I did after three whole days of playing nonstop, the AI ended up missing the 8ball twice and lining up the ball for me to get an easy shot, and dont get me started with darts, the guides for those told me i needed a ruler to be pin point accurate with that shit. A lot of these mini games demanded perfection out of you, and I am proud and ashamed to say that I now legally have the bragging rights to say I completed all mini games and have the achievement to prove it. Now other from those 2, all the other mini games werent that bad and were actually pretty fun. Golf was a vibe, boxcelios was comfy for some reason, and the hostess night life establishments are quite fleshed out and lengthy, though it did start to get repetitive near the end. I enjoyed how much variety they gave us with the choices of hostesses you can request but I do miss the simplicity of just one or two like in Kiwami 1.\n\n\nAs you have read, the game has rough edges but does not deserve to be ignored or passed on by.

I really didn't want to give this game a negative rating, but I am gonna have to , else I would have given yellow neutral rating, because while the game isn't terrible, it's mediocre, probably the most unfun yakuza game I have played.\n\nTo start of, my previous experience was Yakuza 0, Kiwami and Kiwami 2. I am not going to judge the game based on graphics, in fact for PS3, they are pretty good. Let's get the positives out of the way, because this game does have some positive sides.\n\nFor starters I think the music is pretty great and I think the story is actually good. I like the change of setting how Kiryu wants to start a new life with kids, so it's a pretty good setting overall. Sure there are some cliche moments, but every Yakuza game has them to this point. There are a couple of really great substories, some might even say these are one of the best substories.\n\nBut, the main reason why I am giving the negative review is the gameplay. The gameplay is absolute trash. Combat is notoriously bland, especially since most people are going to play this after Kiwami and Kiwami 2. The biggest complaint is the blocks. In previous yakuza games, blocks were not as common and Kiryu could easily break them with some moves. Here it's just block, block, block, block... You just have to run around the enemy and punch him for openings. It becomes really boring, but thankfully, last boss is not terribly hard.\nOn top of combat being boring, the thing I hate the most are ENCOUNTERS WITH THE ENEMIES. Now you might be telling me \"But TTC, all Yakuza games have encounters\". Let me clarify. In the previous yakuza games you usually had a bunch of gangs walking in the street, they would spot you and they would give you time to either engage them or start running away. They gave you a huge window of opportunity: Run or fight. This is especially useful in late game when money is not the issue and encounters are useless. In this game, a single enemy likes to stand at the left or right side of the street and just waits for you to pass until he starts chasing you, and then engages encounter. Now there are ways to run away from that, but their reaction to start chasing you is like in nanosecond, unlike previous games where they give you a few seconds time. It goes on and on and on. These are the worst random encounters I have ever seen in Yakuza. If it was Majima like in Kiwami, I would have no problem. Majima's encounters in first yakuza were random but unique.\nThird main issue are the mini games. Almost every minigame here has been downgraded: Bowling has stupid physics, the batting has no strategy and is just hit and aim, the arcades have only one game that is... pretty odd and kind of boring, and the hostess, oh dear let me tell you about the hostess. There are 2 hostess minigames in the game, one is the standard artificial dating from the first yakuza, and the second one is hostess management. Now I love hostess management in 0 and Kiwami 2, I love how you easily earn money and how satisfying is it to watch it flow, and I when I played this version of hostess management, I was like \"...Wow this is utterly boring\". What sucks about it the most is you don't even earn any money from the hostess management minigame! It really sucks.\n\nQuestion for Sega... Why did you not do Kiwami 3? You know that this game is a big downgrade from the 2 others, so why did you not remake it? Was it too expensive, was it because it was first PS3 yakuza game where Kiryu looks identical to the newer games and not low poly kiryu from PS2 era? I don't know why, maybe they were too lazy or just wanted to make a quick buck, because they did release other remasters relatively fast.\n\nSo my final recommendation. I would only recommend this to people who played the original PS3 game, grew up with it, and want the exact same experience. Well there you go, this is a game for you, and it's pretty cheap.\n\nFor others like me who started from 0, then played Kiwami 1 or 2, I would advise that you just watch the entire gameplay on youtube or just rush through this entire game and ignore the minigames, solve a few substories and move straight to Yakuza 4, because this aged like milk.", "timestamp_created": 1680128307, "timestamp_updated": 1680128307, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674701571464538574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135694410": {"recommendationid": "135694410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880250017", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2309, "last_played": 1673191631}, "language": "english", "review": "good story meh gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1680115523, "timestamp_updated": 1680115523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135684118": {"recommendationid": "135684118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191977106", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4489, "last_played": 1679925205}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a narrow decision between giving this a thumbs up or a thumbs down.

The combat system is a single set of moves that need to be further unlocked as you gain experience, the combos are pretty different from the ones I was accustomed, but they were easy to adapt to and learn what worked. Unfortunately the game suffers from the known issue of \"enemies block too damn much\". No sugarcoating it, it's a fact. A lot of dislike is given to the game due to this, but I personally took it as a way to adapt how i'd often played the series before: try to use grabs more often, or even weapons. Dodge around enemies, or simply go all out on your rush combo since the last finishing hit almost always breaks through their block. Enemies also tend to be damage sponges and it can get annoying, but I personally tried to adapt to this way of combating enemies.\nNow the reason why i was able to look past the combat was actually the story, and specifically, the Okinawa sections. These parts of the game change from the usual action heavy gameplay and storytelling, to more mellow paced segments that almost become a slice of life story. Kiryu is simply enjoying his newfound life as an orphanage director and spends time with his kids. I personally completely adored these moments and a lot of their parts even brought me tears of joy. I can't find the words to say it but it just fills me with happiness, and I give the game a lot of points for all of these parts.\n\nThe game is not perfect by any means and I can understand part of the hate it gets, but I'll be bold to say its my favorite entry in the franchise so far because of some of the smaller aspects of it that form the whole product. And as I said at the beginning, I did literally EVERYTHING, including the entire completion list and all of Haruka's Trust, so I know well how unforgiving some objectives were. If after all of that I can still keep a positive attitude, its because of how much the game resonated with me.", "timestamp_created": 1679894275, "timestamp_updated": 1679894275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626081287860870361", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135519309": {"recommendationid": "135519309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834836348", "num_games_owned": 858, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1528, "last_played": 1679882225}, "language": "english", "review": "Combat wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but the bosses blocking forever was pretty annoying. It'd be one thing if you were suppose to dodge attacks to counter attack but theres no way with how little reaction time you have. Even if I managed to dodge in time, I'd still get hit by the move.\n\nUnlike in Kiwami 1 and 2, there never came a point where I felt like I unlocked all the upgrades I wanted. Because I didn't really know what the upgrade tree looked like, it was kinda just hoping that the next upgrade was something I would really want. \"Oh I don't like these but maybe after this one?\" Throwing hard earned upgrade points into something that seems lackluster isn't fun at all. Even more so when you gotta sit through that animation that only goes to show how much time your throwing into an ability that \"sucks\".\n\nStory was pretty good but it relied too much on random exposition sections where you take in a chapters worth of story in 5-10 minutes to figure out what's going on. The trade off is that I also got to do a lot more \"non yakuza\" stuff as Kiryu. Just would have been nice if all the morning glory missions were sub stories so that the yakuza stuff had a bit more room to breath and develop. Ah well.

Personally, I feel they introduce too many antagonists into the plot as by the end of the game they would appear and I've completely forgot about them. Mine is similar to Kiryu in upbringing but what separates them is the presence of Kazama throughout Kiryu's life. He's a good villain and is the most memorable character out of the entire game. \n\nAlso for  the 100% I thought Minigame Master meant playing each minigame at least once, it is not it is very much not.

You still gun down tons of people and pretend nothing happened. It's a soap opera every game, filled with bizarre slice of life comedy.

As we all know, though, weakest doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad game.\n\nEveryone says the combat is bad and that dissuaded me from playing the game initially. But so far it's nothing crazy judging from the first two bosses on normal. And anyway, whether or not I believe this game's combat to be good or bad by the time I finish it, can we really make this criticism about Yakuza 3 ALONE? Because Yakuza 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2, the only games I've completed so far, definitely all have their fair share of unfun combat. Yakuza 3 is, just off of hearsay, unique in that enemies spam block... but why are we ignoring the fact that so many bosses in Kiwami 1 and 2 just spam quicksteps and counters, making it impossible for the player of a BEAT-EM-UP GAME to confidently attack without worrying about being punished? \n\nLike some of them pretty much had their own Tiger Drop... some, LITERALLY. Notably the damn \"Man in Black\" from Kiwami 2 that you fight MULTIPLE TIMES. In Yakuza 0, this was Sera and Shibusawa. In Kiwami 1, pretty much half of the bosses. And don't get me started about the evasiveness of Kiwami 1's finale enemies... who designed the MIA colonels? If you decide to look up No Damage boss runs, most people rely on quickstepping and countering to initiate their combos because so many bosses have their own counters that make throwing EVEN ONE attack risky. And... in a beat-em-up game? Why? It doesn't help that they're random either; thank god there are some bosses in all these games that do some stance or something that shows they're gonna counter you if you attack.\n\nOn to the story... I've pretty much spoiled myself for the story and am pretty much playing to experience it myself. If I had to comment on the story, it's actually very good. It's definitely better than Yakuza 4 and 5 (I also spoiled myself for these games as well... got no clue what happens in 6 yet tho). The end got me feeling some type of way... [spoiler]I will forever hold Mr. \"Okay Got It\" in my heart :( .[/spoiler]\n\nSomething really stuck out to me about 3 coming from Kiwami 1 and 2 in terms of its writing: it is so, so, SO MUCH LESS CHEESY. For Kiwami 2, \"the cheese\" stuck out so much because the main plot without it was actually interesting. Spoilers on Koji Shindo: [spoiler]pretty much up to the point where you fight him you really get the idea that he wants revenge for Nishikiyama... but it turns out he's an insider trying to take the Tojo Clan NOT because he wants revenge over Kiryu for having some role in Nishiki's death, but BECAUSE HE JUST WANTS TO SLEEP WITH YAYOI DOJIMA[/spoiler]\n\nSo yeah, unlike Kiwami 2 and 1, Yakuza 3 actually manages to have an interesting main plot and not have it play out with Romeo and Juliet levels of cheese. That makes it in terms of the story an 8/10 game.", "timestamp_created": 1679133934, "timestamp_updated": 1680660547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134865938": {"recommendationid": "134865938", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985132289", "num_games_owned": 2504, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 2876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2876, "last_played": 1679121647}, "language": "english", "review": "So, two caveats with Yakuza 3:\n\n1. It is easily the weakest stick in the entire game series I have experienced so far.\n2. It's still a good game.\n\nA lot of the complaints are around the relatively simple combat controls. Which, honestly, I consider a plus rather than a minus, given how I'm not particularly keen on fighting game systems.\n\nMany other complaints have to do with the non-Kiwami treatment of this game when 1 and 2 have it. Which, again, not a huge deal to me. Sure, you have some graphical scaling inferiority, and some people look ridiculously ugly when compared to the Kiwami engine's face rendering tech. But still, these are pretty minor details in what I consider an overall fun game.\n\nSo, what is inexcusable in this game?\n\nAnything, and I mean ANYTHING, involving the Okinawa orphanage, be it quests, characters, backstory, or interactions of any kind, are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!\n\nEverything involving that damn orphanage is so drawn out and needlessly long! It takes HOURS to leave it the first time so you can get on with the main story, and each time you come back for sidequests and such they are easily the most obtuse and stupid parts of the game. \n\nSure, it's great that Kiryu is running an orphanage, but I didn't purchase Yakuza 3: Bullshit Orphan Problems Edition. I bought a game that would continue the series. And, while this game certainly does that, I hope to everything that they never involve another damn inane orphanage to eat up so many hours of wasted gameplay.\n\nOh, also, the final boss is the easiest in the series I have faced so far. But that's okay, I exploited the relatively simple battle system.\n\nOverall, great game, hate orphanages.

It takes a bit of time for it to actually get going, but when it does, you're in for a good time. I have some gripes with how some events play out, it feels like the writers just needed something to happen but they couldn't work out a way to do it in a way that makes sense, it doesn't happen most of the time but there are things I am very salty about. For clarification, I'm not talking about the coincidences that happen a LOT in the yakuza series. Oh, and the sidequests, as always, are fun! Chase missions aren't as terrible as people make them out to seem imo.\n\n[b] HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD [b]\n[spoiler] The thing that annoys me the most about the story is Rikiya's death. It was emotional and still saddens me, sure, but it also makes me angry, because it makes NO SENSE! Tamashiro for the entire boss fight was fighting with a gun, but when Kiryu defeats him, they completely forget about that and Tamashiro shoots at Kiryu (Rikiya taking the bullet of course) when their attention gets drawn elsewhere. They knew for the entire time that the gun was there, and at that moment, there was no real dire situation for them to just completely disregard Tamashiro's existence. And the gun's. Kiryu's whole talk to Rikiya before leaving to fight Tamashiro was that Rikiya isn't allowed to come as his death would be for nothing, but with a simple picking up the gun or knocking Tamashiro out cold, it all could have been avoided. Instead, the writers could have found another way to go about it, hell, I wouldn't have been too mad if Tamashiro had a hidden gun on him instead, or maybe have one of the bulls kill him, e.g. one woke up and went wild, the crew needing to escape asap and Rikiya distracting it, getting hurt and Kiryu saving him at the last second, dragging him out of the bull pen and the death scene happening there. oh and that would leave Tamashiro getting crushed by the bulls. He deserves it.

The story is great, typical Yakuza story stuff, you get the idea (Except the Morning Glory stuff. That went on for way too long) But the combat is something that annoys me. Don't get me wrong, you should play this game if you are playing in order, but the combat is something that I personally dislike. so, if you care, here me complaining about yakuza 3 combat for what could honestly be 2 paragraphs.\n\nThe games combat is typical older Yakuza combat. If your playing in timeline order, its basically the Legend/Dragon style from Y0 and K1. Kiryu feels fine to control, and I like the dragon style so its whatever. My real problems come from the enemies. You may have heard the joke \"Blockuza 3\" used before, and I can see why. Enemies will block basically any (raw) attack thrown at them. Plus the dragon style is JUST slow enough so the enemies can block between hits if you try and punish from the front. Many people will claim it just \"button-mashing noobs who don't know how to counter properly\" This is correct in a sense, in that you can't just mash to kill people, you need to counter. HOWEVER, the quickstep in this game is bugged, and the 60fps breaks the quickstep so you gain hardly any distance. But you could always use the Komaki abilities, right? Well you don't get (most) of the Komaki abilities until chapter 4 (roughly). This makes some of the hardest bosses in the game the earliest ones you encounter, just because you can't properly counter their attacks or dodge spam (another issue that some bosses have. Looking at you, Majima) Komaki Parry essentially carries this game, as the strategy goes: 1. Komaki Parry. 2. Run around the enemy and land a full combo. 3. Repeat. The other issue is heat actions. Heat actions do so little damage its insane. A normal combo does about the same damage as a heat action with 3 different quick time events. Heat in general in this game also regenerates so slowly, and goes away very quickly, another issue i believe caused by the 60 fps.\n\nThe combat in this game isn't great. It's basically Yakuza 4's combat but with the issues I mentioned before. Now you might have noticed \"This guy sure has a lot of issues with the combat, why is this a positive review?\" Well, because of the story. It basically carries this game. Sure, some of the substories are a little lacking (especially when there is over 110 of them. Y0 had 100 split between two characters) but man the story is to die for.

Me, personally, have to say that this game is \"an experience\". It's really hard to say if it is a really bad good game or a really good bad game, it sits in between which is also kind of ironic since it's also the \"in-between\" point in the franchise were it evolved from the ambitious games from the PS2 era to the style the franchise is most known for. On that fact alone, Yakuza 3 does deserve certain recognition for being sort of a testing ground of ideas that would work better later, kinda like Shenmue but not dry and lame and f-cking boring.\n\nHaving mentioned the good stuff, this game is one of the weirdest things you can ever play in a \"bad good\" way. It's not a train-wreck or anything (don't expect Sonic 2006), but the whole thing is so jarring and theres such a huge disconnect between main plot, the B-plots, the story progression and the gameplay that it just keeps you wondering and wondering what the f-ck were the writer/s doing. The plot basically could be summed up in \"Villain wants a lot in Okinawa where Kiryu has his orphanage\", yet there's so much unnecesary stuff around it: there's a whole political subplot around two politicians clashing about building a resort vs building a military base in Okinawa, a doppleganger of Kiryu's step dad that starts shooting people, a weapons dealer infiltrated in the CIA even though the CIA is after him so they should know his face but whatever, a main villain whose motivation is not really clear even after it is explained (he wants to make money but doesn't care about money because who cares, we need a bad guy), and in between all that they shoe-horn stuff from the previous games because this was after all the third entry in the series.\n\nI say play it and have fun wondering at the end of every chapter why the hell did they story progressed the way it progressed when it does not make any f-cking sense.", "timestamp_created": 1676870791, "timestamp_updated": 1676870791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605497002601623535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133207958": {"recommendationid": "133207958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040442212", "num_games_owned": 1499, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1075, "last_played": 1658180181}, "language": "english", "review": "It's okay, but definitely the worst Yakuza game (not counting Dead Souls).

From the very first 10 minutes of the game, the writing is absolute shit, and it doesn't improve. The mini-games in this are either absolute bullshit or supremely disrespectful of the player's time. I had to forcibly make this game run on only one CPU to make the fishing mini-game even playable. And don't get me started on the fucking bullshit golf mini-game. The fighting is not fun in the slightest. From the chapter 3 boss onward, the bosses will block almost everything. You'd expect to be able to use grabs to break through that, but no. And quickstep was completely nerfed when they ported this to PC because (like the fishing mini-game) your computer's FPS are simply too good for this game to deal with. This is the absolute weakest Kiryu has ever felt so far.\n\nI'm assuming you've beaten the second game if you're looking at reviews for the third game. At the end of the second game, Kaoru and Kiryu are so in love with each other that they're even prepared to die together so that they won't be apart.

There's a lot of complains about this game, and they're understandable. \n\nThe combat is wonky, it isn't difficult, its just boring. You get blocked a lot, and there's only a few tools you can use to get around that. So you'll end up using those same tools again and again, and you can only avoid street battles in chapter 10 when you get that special item [need to find 100 locker keys first thought].\n\nI think what made it worth a play through is what it brings to kiryu's character, it adds another dimension to him and if you plan to play the entire franchise, i think it'll just add to the attachment to the character and the game world. I liked the substories mostly, there's a lot of scams in kamurocho and ryukyu lol.\n\n Just a suggestion but if you plan to get through the game for the story, just drop the difficulty to easy, play the substories, skip the hostess stories if you aren't familiar with the celebs [i think they're celebs], the 10 hostess stories takes time and the repetition is pretty boring, do one and get a feel for it. Skip the mini games since i think a lot of the physics of the minigames are wonky due to the 60fps [not 2 sure though]. \n\n The game isn't bad, it actually looks pretty okay too, its just slow.

Loved that aspect of the game.\n-The hostess clubs are fun but can get boring so i suggest doing them early and as you progress cuz if you wait at the premium adventure to do them all back to back this is where you're gonna get bored.\n\nCons:\n-The combat sucks and is annoying\n-The inventory system IS A NIGHTMARE\n-At least half of the minigames are broken cuz they were poorly optimized for 60 fps\n-Kinda hard to make money and repairing/reloading weapons is expensive af\n-Most substories dont have any pointers on the map so you find yourself searching a lot or you give up and ends up checking a guide online.\n-The Kamiyama weapon & gear crafting thing sucks honestly. Its just not worth it.\n-The enemies in the streets are annoying and unlike the previous games they dont walk around in a pack there's just a single dude standing at a corner of a street looking around and the second he spots you you get dragged into a fight so yea keep your eyes open to not aggro them.\n-The hostess maker minigame is boring and tedious. \n\nThe reason i recommend the game even after all these cons is because the story and the new characters make up for it. I know many people say its better to skip this game but the story is absolutely worth it. Its still a Yakuza game after all so i still found myself enjoying it.

It\u2019s commonly called the worst game in the series while also having tons of diehard fans for it. I at first skipped it and played 4&5, but I caved and bought it, and what do you know, I nearly completed this game in less than a week, not because it was short, but because I couldn\u2019t put down the controller. With most of the series in mind, Yakuza 3 is overall the worst game in the series, in both gameplay and story structure, but by no means does that make it not worth playing. It\u2019s still pretty good, if not, great at times and its major flaws can be easily avoided. So if you like Yakuza, get this game!\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nYakuza 3 is most hated for its combat, mostly because enemies blocked too much and had too much health, making boss fights and normal encounters last way too long. Strangely, this can be easily remedied by playing the game in easy mode. It pretty much makes combat feel totally normal, aside from it being easier. Though the combat is by no means perfect. Compared to the games that came after, it\u2019s not quite as involved. I can now see why Y4 took the multiple protagonists approach since Kiryu\u2019s gameplay was growing bland on its own. The combat ain\u2019t all bad though, I found the Komaki training rewards pretty entertaining, especially the final heat move which is pretty difficult to pull off. All in all, the combat feels mostly normal, the only issue is that it outstays its welcome. But there are other parts of this game, like the side content, I actually think this is the real black sheep in Yakuza 3. Most of the substories, while straightforward and easy, just don\u2019t need to exist. I did most of the side quests because I previously made it my mission to defeat every iteration of Amon in the series. In a way, adding other requirements (like hitmen missions and IF7 fights) to fight Amon made the substories less valuable to me. None of them are bad, just not worth the time I spent on them. Overall, the greatest problem with Yakuza\u2019s gameplay is that it tries to squeeze so much of it in where it isn\u2019t necessary. If the game was just a bit lighter in content, or if its requirements to fight Amon were the same as the rest of the series, I think I\u2019d have a lot fewer problems with it.\n\nSTORY\n\nNow, this is what makes Yakuza 3 truly worth experiencing. Its story is the most intimate and wholesome in the series and Kiryu smiles here more than he probably does in the rest of the series combined. Parenting and getting to know these orphanage kids was a real treat and it gave me something to lose later in the story. Plus, there\u2019s Rikiya and the rest of his family, he was a pretty likable guy even though I knew he was going to die at some point. Kiryu\u2019s relationship with Haruka is interesting too. Just as a 6th grader, she\u2019s pretty much in charge of everyone and she reminds Kiryu of chores and such. If they are met with a big story-related problem, they just look at each other and nod. I really like this silent trust that crescendos by the end of the game. Like most of the Yakuza games, their relationship is one of the best parts of the game, only being outshined by Yakuza 5&6. I\u2019ve seen complaints about the first few hours of the game, saying that it\u2019s \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cgoes nowhere\u201d but it is actually the most valuable part of the game. If you get invested in these characters as I did, you will be pissed, sad, and glad like I was as shit happens in the story. Ironically, the political side of this game is my least favorite in the series. Yakuza is normally the best in the industry at tonal dissonance, Y0 especially, but Yakuza politics really don\u2019t mesh well with the intimate Morning Glory part of the story. The story could have been much simpler while possibly being even better. Just like the gameplay, they just shoved too much unnecessary stuff in the story. But those are my only gripes with the game. Since I\u2019m not a fan of the Yakuza politics, I\u2019m just going to highlight moments I really liked. Majima was GOATed in this game. For the first time in the series, he and Kiryu treated each other as friends. They speak out of understanding, which is absent in the rest of the series. Unlike Yakuza 2, their fight in the Coliseum was entirely consensual, Kiryu was actually excited to fight Majima here. Majima\u2019s dialogue is hilarious and him saving Kiryu in that massive pink truck was funny as hell. Not much else interesting happens until the third act of the game. Mine, the main antagonist who before this point seemed cool and brutal, brought a whole Yakuza family over with a bulldozer to trash the Morning Glory. At this point in the game, after connecting with all of the characters and enjoying Kiryu\u2019s new home, this is probably the most anger-inducing scene in the game, if not the series. In a flash, I went from thinking Mine was cool as hell to realizing he was a heartless bastard. Afterward, Kiryu goes to the bullfighting area to save Rikiya\u2019s boss Nakahara, who was already in recovery from a gunshot wound. A Yakuza boss that we fought near the beginning of the game threatens Nakahara\u2019s life by putting him in the middle of four bulls. Up until this point, Nakahara seemed pretty sickly, but when his surrogate daughter, who has been mute for the whole game, yells for him, he flips a bull by its horns and achieves a new purpose in life. Kiryu flips a bull, fights the boss, and Rikiya comes to his side. That\u2019s when the Yakuza boss tries to shoot Kiryu in the back, which Rikiya prevents with his own body. As Rikiya lies dying, asking Kiryu to show Mine what for, Kiryu can do nothing but wail and beg for him to stay. This is the most emotional he has gotten in the series and it really sends home Kiryu\u2019s fear of being involved with the Yakuza. Even when he\u2019s many miles away from Tokyo, the people he\u2019s close to still get hurt. I felt something in my eyes when I watched this even though I knew of Rikiya\u2019s fate beforehand. I think Kiryu\u2019s reaction is what truly got me, not Rikia\u2019s death. Now, Kiryu is on what he thinks is a suicide mission to save Daigo from Mine. So in what he thinks is his last time to wander with Haruka in Kamurocho, he selfishly takes her with him. Haruka understands this though and encourages him by hugging him in the middle of the street. Kiryu leaves her at New Serena and fights his way up the hospital to Daigo\u2019s room, he finds out Daigo was taken up to the roof by Mine and reaches them. Mine threatens Daigo\u2019s life, saying Daigo doesn\u2019t have to struggle anymore. This gave me Y0 Nishiki flashbacks and Kiryu diverts Mine\u2019s attention to himself. They have a cool shirtless battle on the rooftop and Mine finally sees that money isn\u2019t everything. In a moment very reminiscent of Like A Dragon, he calls his secretary and refuses a billion yen deal. The Black Angels attempt to kill them, Daigo deadeyes all of them, and Mine sacrifices himself thinking he doesn\u2019t deserve a second chance, despite him already making progress moments ago. As Kiryu\u2019s about to leave Kamurocho with Haruka, one of the Yakuza patriarchs, Hamazaki, comes to him and sabs him as revenge for ruining his life. In a moment that feels a lot like Yakuza 5\u2019s ending, Haruka leans over Kiryu yelling for him to stay with her. Hamazaki really could have gotten more screen time. I wanted to fight him but we never got the chance. At least we get that chance in Yakuza 4. The credits roll with what\u2019s probably the best song in the game, and we see Kiryu living peacefully at Morning Glory with his orphans again. Although the game is riddled with flaws, Yakuza 3 has one of the best stories in the series. The gameplay is dated, but it has its high points and it deserves credit for paving the way for the games that came after. This game may be disregarded as filler to many, but like ATLA\u2019s filler episode, The Tales In Ba Sing Se, it is still a highlight in the series nonetheless.

When you are fighting street thugs and is only able to land one punch each time you combo them is definitely a bad sign. Can't imagine playing the legendary difficulty, that gotta be one helluva ride. Anyway, I like the game (Story).

If you're playing in chronological order, it definitely feels like a step backwards in everything; graphics, game design, gameplay, etc., because it's literally a PS3 game that came out in 2009, albiet slightly touched up. It's by no means a bad game, it just suffers in the shadow of previous games. This shouldn't be a huge issue because the real 'point' of playing this is the story, but if for whatever ungodly reason you don't care about that and only want good gameplay, don't bother with this. Gameplay seems to suffer slightly from the old engine and their shit job with this port. And if you're really bothered by it feeling dated and just want to experience the story, watch the cutscenes on YouTube. If you do like the series for its story and gameplay formula, it's probably safe to assume you'd at least enjoy this one, but there are a number of things worth noting, ESPECIALLY if you're playing in story order (0-6) so as to temper your expectations, otherwise you're more likely to be disappointed.\n\n[h1]The Fix(es)[/h1]\nDespite being a remastered port released in 2021, there are some things that are screwed up that they never bothered fixing, that YOU need to either get mods to fix, change the FPS, or deal with. I really have no patience for this kind of shit these days and cannot stand relying on modders for quality of life features and especially to fix broken mechanics. These are primarily related to the 60fps upgrade that breaks some physics and mechanics. Most of the minigames (bowling, golf, pool) are much harder because their physics are tied to the framerate, but it doesn't seem like there are any mods to fix this. If you're going to attempt 100%ing this game, for the love of God lock the game to 30fps. I have no interest in the minigames outside of karaoke (which doesn't seem to be negatively affected) so if you're like me you're probably OK with leaving it at 60fps, HOWEVER...\n\nGet the \"Quickstep Restoration\" mod, ESPECIALLY if you're playing on hard. Because of issues with the framerate upgrade, they halved the distance of Kiryu's quickstep/dodge. You could probably live without this fix for most of the game on normal, unless you want to try and beat the harder bosses like Amon, but if you're on hard you NEED it. Enemies will block way too much compared to the previous games on this difficulty. Without the original quickstep distance, you are forced into a more time consuming fighting style that feels tedious compared to 0/K1/K2, relying on the cheese of your Komaki moves that unlock in chapter 5 or 6. I didn't know about the quickstep nerf and simply restarted on normal because I could just easily envision this shit getting untenable late game. Quickstep is integral to how you'll be successful in this game THE way to efficiently counter hard difficulty's blockspam.\n\nYou also need the \"Yakuza 3 Restoration Patch\" too. There was a bunch of licensed music they cut that this restores, but most importantly, the cutscenes in the PC version are much lower quality than the remastered PS3 version and look horrific. This mod restores them and the difference is ridiculous, almost comical that the developers didn't do this themselves. And there's also a really stupid bug where the Ryukyu street noise is much louder than other parts of the game so you should probably get \"Fix for the loud ambient car sound in Downtown Ryukyu\". All of these issues are laid out on the PCGamingWiki, but who would've thought you'd need to check there for a so-called remastered version released in 2021?\n\n[h1]The Fight[/h1]\nGameplay is the typical Yakuza format of watching cutscenes, running around the city, beating up enemies, doing side stories, and fighting a boss or two, then doing the same in the next chapter. This game is much shorter, between 16 and 30 hours depending on how much side content and minigames you distract yourself with. As for that side content, I found myself taken out of the 'main quest' more than other games. They felt more tedious, boring, repetitive, less interesting, consequently less complementary to the game's storytelling, and more vehicles for leveling up and getting items. Some are missable unless you know how to initiate them by checking walkthroughs. They're technically not 'completely' missable as you can go back in Premium Adventure (free-roam after the story) to finish them up, but to me that's kinda pointless; the 'point' is to level up and to give you things to do between major story events. They've always been diversions, but it's way more noticeable that they are in 3.\n\nYou only have one fighting style and enemies are drop dead stupid, even on hard. Hard is less of an actual 'hard' difficulty and more an exercise in tedium; it only seems to turn up enemies' block frequency, health, and damage output, NOT intelligence and stuff that matters like attack frequency, combos, etc. Besides boss fights, combat is pretty boring, and since you do a LOT of it, most of the game can feel pretty boring. But like I said from the beginning, you're here for the story. I personally think it's strong enough to warrant playing through and dealing with everything mentioned previously, but it's not free from critique.\n\n[h1]The Plot[/h1]\nThe story is definitely weaker compared to previous games. It's not bad, but again, just not as good. Kiryu leaves Kamurocho for Okinawa and sets up an orphanage with Haruka, but it's existence is threatened by a land development deal involving people in the Tojo clan, the Japanese government, and spoilers but not really: [spoiler]the CIA and some weapons dealing organization[/spoiler], who all have converging interests in setting up a resort, casino, and military base. The characters are all fine, obvious standouts being Kiryu, Rikiya, Date, and of course Majima. None of the few antagonists are as compelling as those in previous entries. All of the Tojo leadership are lame and the main bad guy who is revealed later in the game is really uninteresting. The whole plot is a little predictable, but there are a couple effective deaths. The orphanage thread was a fun change of pace, but it seems somewhat out of place. Sure, there are glimpses of this kind of Kiryu in 0/K1/K2, it just gets a little too goofy and feels slow. Like I'm here for a crime drama full of intrigue and doing Yakuza things, not raising kids and being a great dad. Also I wish there were more fully voiced cutscenes. This wasn't as noticeable in previous games but it feels like there were more of the static in-engine \"press X to read more dialogue\" stuff. Again, probably due to it being a remaster, but I would much prefer all of the story segments as full cutscenes to not break the flow and interfere with tone.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nDespite everything I've said up to this point, it's still fun and I enjoyed my time with it. To sum things up, Yakuza 3 is just an older, dated game that suffers in comparison to 0/K1/K2. This game is rooted in the context of it being the third entry of a young series that was still finding its footing for storytelling and character development. It's significantly shorter than 0/K1/K2 and despite my playtime, not a 77 hour investment, I just really enjoy taking everything in and seeing as much of this game as possible (minus some of the minigames, I'm not that masochistic). A better estimate is 20 hours if you're focusing on the story and somewhere between 30 and 100 if you the more substories, minigames, crafting, collecting, etc. you want to do.", "timestamp_created":

sheep of the series. Yakuza 3 crawled so Yakuza 4 could run.\n\nYakuza 3, for all intensive purposes is not an unplayable game by any means. However it's gameplay is a far cry from the high points of the franchise as many of the games aspects were the first iterations, thus they're very hard to stomach if you're playing this after the newer entries, or didn't grow up / live with games that came out between 2000-2012.\n\nFor the guys reading this that are considering getting this game for the story and aren't sure if they want to go through the hoops themselves or watch a longplay online, I won't sugar coat it.\nIf all you want is story, just play it on easy mode.\nIf you're feeling brave and want to know hurt similar to your loved ones being the reason you're feels like its ending, play on normal to get the emotions out.\n\nWhy has this one in particular aged poorly exactly?\nGameplay, and solely gameplay. Don't be fooled by criticism over the writing as most qualms for better or for worse have smoothed over as the series went on rather than take strides to retcon this out of the canon.\ntldr, if it was still 2010 and the series future was up in the air, you'd be right to be cautious. but, thats not the case.\n\nlike previously stated, many of the aspects of this game are now staples of the franchise, however this was the game many were introduced and as a result are clunky or obtuse to figure out.\nHostess maker / cabaret club manager is the biggest example of this as far as minigames go...\n\nCombat is especially jarring. Yakuza 3 doesn't reward the more aggressive or rush down play styles some my be accustomed to, which requires taking time to learn its more...Reserved combat that relies more of waiting and punishing enemies through use of countering, parrying, or learning the weapons system, which are essential if you intend to brave Hard or legendary difficulty.\nThings most will be aware of right out the gate:\n-enemies will attack you from off screen\n-the heat meter drains quickly, more so if you happen to get grabbed\n-QTE's are everywhere\n-enemies will often spam sidestepping to avoid attacks which ultimately makes them invulnerable\n-enemy guard can't REASONABLY be broken with normal attacks.\n-when enemy guard is broken, they will put back up again immediately.\n-And last but not least, due to the games pacing, it takes upwards of 6-10 hours before you're able to really get into the meat of the combat.\n\nProgression is earned through EXP similarly to yakuza 1 & 4. you have one resource to divvy up between 4 skills trees in a fixed order. Getting through the skill trees isn't hard of course unless you're b-lining it through the story and skipping everything else. The problem is, even if you fulfill it, you still won't have your full tool set to fight with. Certain tools that are more or less necessities aren't able to be unlock through exp.\n\nPerhaps one of my biggest nitpicks is how additional moves can be earned. through out the game kiryu meets different characters who for the most part are upfront saying \"I have something to teach you. come back when you have time.\" sometimes you can earn health or heat upgrades, other times kiryu can handle certain weaponry better (his or his enemies), however my least favorite is Mack.\nYou meet Mack early on, he tells you to find interesting moments in the overworld and make a not twitter post, and as a result, kiryu learns a new move. \nThe problem is, when you've unlocked the ability to do these, all you're given is a vague clue as to what or where you need to look. you must then go into a first person mode and zoom in on the moment of interest, do a small series of QTE's, then make a timed decision on what to caption the event with (only one out of three being the right response). If you fail, you have to leave, and come back.\nAs much fun as hidden unlockables can be...In an beat em up, the last thing I want is my tool set being locked behind obtuse puzzles.\n\nTheres also a chase \"minigame\" lets call it.\nthe premise is simple, chase someone through crowds and tights spaces and tackle them. do it enough times before you run out of stamina.\nyou have to play it on a couple occasions in the main story, but fortunately for completionist out there and handful of these moments were cut from the remaster (if you don't know why, don't worry. neither gameplay or related side quest story was worth it.)\nIts cluncky, its mandatory to play, its unforgiving at first, its not fun. plain and simple.\n\nfinal verdict: 6/10\nTLDR:\nif you're gonna play it just for story, play easy mode.\nThis ones rough, we need a Kiwami 3 to happen", "timestamp_created": 1674455581, "timestamp_updated": 1674456136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131367801": {"recommendationid": "131367801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197185575", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 947, "last_played": 1674424195}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite popular belief that this game is garbage, it is still quite good.

For the time, its visuals are stunning, and even now its art style and settings differ completely from the other entries in the series. It purposefully depicts the two sides of our main character's life as being entirely different, with the dirty backstreets of Kamuroucho being their own world away from the sunny beaches of Ryukyu. You get to play the role of a father figure to a group of orphans, much like Kiryu himself once was, and see how he continues to struggle with the aftermath of the first two games.

(maybe) 1, and 2; might as well keep going for the story. Graphics-wise this remaster looks okay on 1080p, not sure about higher resolutions. The main story was good but near the end had some small issues. Most of the substories were decent. Now for my grievances... Not going to say anything new here but the combat really sucks the fun out of the game. Just really love the constant blocking that gives bosses almost full immunity. Also appreciate how easy it is to get knocked down / stunned and then repeatedly stunned. The street thugs were a nuisance, yes they were in the previous games as well but in this game they love to run up and engage in a dialogue with you, wasting time. Plus, in past games you could sweep them in 3 button presses by using a bike or whatever object laying around, in this game these objects felt almost completely useless. The host club was a snoozer, might as well have been a capsule hotel mini-game since I was falling asleep in my chair trying to play it. Finally, don't waste your time like me collecting the locker keys past whatever the first achievement is (I think collecting 5 or so) since there's no achievement for opening all the lockers. Just really loved the gimmicky first-person camera mechanic for finding the keys. Overall... I give this remaster a 5/10, don't think I'll ever be replaying it.

I had to sort of change how I played, focusing more on getting a few hits then dodging while waiting quite a while for heat to build, and using weapons much less than previous, while also having a pretty low overall damage output. Even so, I was expecting the game to feel much more tedious to get through, but it was still very fun. The story is what made me enjoy the game the most by far though. You get introduced to all the kids at Kiryu's new orphanage he takes care of, and although they seem annoying at first, there were lots of cute and wholesome interactions between them and Kiryu. You also meet the Ryudo family dudes and as the story goes on, they became my favorites. [spoiler] Rikiya's death [/spoiler] is still one of the saddest moments in the whole series for me, personally. As well as [spoiler] Mikio nearly dying, and seeing what's in Saki's notepad and her speaking for the first time [/spoiler] this game is filled with very many tear-jerking moments in the story.

It's not only a problem of how many times the enemies block every single move, but also the fact that combos are NON-EXISTANT. Enemies can block in the middle of a combo, at the beginning of it, at the very end, they can block bullets of both guns and shotguns, explosives... everything. Not only the blocking can be an issue, but also the constant quickstepping and stun of such which makes some boss fights absolutely broken, more specifically (minor spoilers): Misterious Strangers' ambush, Yonashiro's training and most of all, Joji Kazama. \n\nIt can take a huge amount of rage for me to abandon a game, which i did not, but this is possibly the first time i'll ever say something like this: i DO recommend playing yakuza 3 to get yourself ahead in the story, understanding better haruka's progression, Kiryu's storyline and the Tojo clan's Lore... but by all means, USE CHEATS when you fight certain bosses, your mental health won't thank you enough... and no it's not a matter of difficulty, but of sheer jank unfairness.", "timestamp_created": 1673227386, "timestamp_updated": 1673227386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593332052230834961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130413408": {"recommendationid": "130413408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363271702", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1458, "last_played": 1673416342}, "language": "english", "review": "john yakuza", "timestamp_created": 1673165670, "timestamp_updated": 1673165670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484240680932998657", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130405765": {"recommendationid": "130405765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076222515", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1344, "last_played": 1666901096}, "language": "english", "review": "ignore the hate, this game is awesome. a little dated, but awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1673155348, "timestamp_updated": 1673155348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489631354808807373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130381474": {"recommendationid": "130381474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136088350", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 145, "playtime_forever": 1352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1352, "last_played": 1672942966}, "language": "english", "review": "A continuation of the Kiryu saga which has been slightly soured by barely tolerable combat and a dated skills system.\n\nPlaying this essentially amounts to masochism.\n", "timestamp_created": 1673127250, "timestamp_updated": 1673127250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130284720": {"recommendationid": "130284720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198910925135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1673247818}, "language": "english", "review": "WHY DID THE KILL RIKIYA IM GOING TO FUCKING EXPLODE RYU GA GOTOKU HEADQUARTERS, THIS GAME SUCKS!

As well as some characters u start to absolutely love, and then.... some truly sad moments, which has now made me reconsider my rating of the game.\nI'll pump up the review from 5/10 to a 6.5/10 as a overall rating, but story was defo 7/10 while certain moments was just truly beautiful.\n\nTL;DR: Rating 6.5/10\nif you plan on skipping this game, then I DONT recommend that, cause this game really shows another side of kiryu, which you really should see :D", "timestamp_created": 1672647262, "timestamp_updated": 1672647262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519230782985687256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129895579": {"recommendationid": "129895579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372023975", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 1309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1692063999}, "language": "english", "review": "dog house", "timestamp_created": 1672615975, "timestamp_updated": 1673907638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129881444": {"recommendationid": "129881444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991784363", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1018, "last_played": 1672879774}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't you DARE talk to me or my orfans EVER again", "timestamp_created": 1672602621, "timestamp_updated": 1672602621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129862632": {"recommendationid": "129862632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062753901", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3241, "last_played": 1630260899}, "language": "english", "review": "People will tell you there are no bad Yakuza games, but this exists.", "timestamp_created": 1672586312, "timestamp_updated": 1672586312, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503642261028289795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129859324": {"recommendationid": "129859324", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997159902", "num_games_owned": 1240, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 3052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3052, "last_played": 1660345195}, "language": "english", "review": "Although it'll be quite the adjustment going to this from Kiwami 2 and the chronologically earlier entries, it's still a fantastic Yakuza game that hits all the high notes you'll have come to love about the series so far -- dramatic shirt removals, crying men, heartfelt drama, positive vibes, Kiryu being a goof, and so on.

I feel like a lot of the reviews are more focused on people trying to defend the game (since it's largely considered the least favorite game in the franchise) than actually judging the remaster itself. Not even sure I can make it through the remaster with all the issues that have been peeving me off. \n\nI will make this clear, Yakuza 3 (OG) is not a bad game, the combat is highly over criticized and the story is great, but the Remaster is not the OG, while the story is still amazing all round, the game does very little to fix the flaws of the OG and in fact worsens them.\n\nIf you really want to play Yakuza 3 (and not be completely annoyed at combat segments), I'd highly recommend the original as the combat just feels butchered here comparatively as combos that are guaranteed to work in the original will sometimes if not always fail on the remaster which just makes the block heavy game much less fun. It's hard to really give the port any good points when there's so many issues with it.\n\nThe only reason you should ever buy this game is if you buy it with the other remasters, otherwise it's only worth it if you want the much better localization\n\nVideo By DillionT comparing the games and showing a lot of the issues that will be discussed: https://youtu.be/PI5UPxSKjKw\n\n[b]The Issues with the port:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] A lot of the mechanics have changed ever so slightly, and for the worse. \n\n[list]\n\n[*] For whatever reason the heat loss is insanely fast compared to the original title\n\n[*] Enemies turn faster which causes your combos to fail even if you're completely behind them which makes it much harder to combo them\n\n[*] Your quickstep is shorter, which makes it even harder to get behind enemies\n\n[*] The AI is still allowed to have super easy stun combos while Kiryu is barely able to even get hits in since his ability to stun and combo is greatly reduced due to the faster turning of the Remaster which allows the block happy enemies to basically block behind them\n\n[*] AI is actually outright worse, ranging from bosses like Shinzaki who now quicksteps like a maniac to just extreme passiveness and 180 degree turning\n[/list]\n\n[*] Visuals are barely any better, in fact some things like Kiryu's heat aura is actively worse looking overall\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1672121230, "timestamp_updated": 1672407080, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129382867": {"recommendationid": "129382867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137568691", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4682, "last_played": 1682365908}, "language": "english", "review": "\"waaaah why are the enemies blocking ;(\"\n\npress \"O\", bro.", "timestamp_created": 1672101295, "timestamp_updated": 1672101295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129377411": {"recommendationid": "129377411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092782010", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 7784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7681, "last_played": 1696673600}, "language": "english", "review": "When it comes to Yakuza games, I would rank this one in the top, the only thing holding it back from being a perfect game is the gameplay which most people will find frustrating or just plain boring due to the abundance of blocking and the damage of heat actions being lackluster. \nThe story is carrying the game hard, more of a slice of life style with very nice character development, and it's the one game that in my opinion humanises and pushes Kiryu to be more relatable to us on a personal level.\nThe soundtrack is... amazing, I highly recommend using the uncensored/restoration patch for the game, the opening is so good I've never skipped it, the boss fight themes are really good, some of my favourite tracks being \"Ogre has Returned\" and \"Fly\", but other songs are nothing to scoff at either such as Kiryu's battle themes for the two different cities, they hit hard, sound great, and have a lot of love put into them by the composers.

If you have played Yakuza 0 through Kiwami 2, please do not skip this game as it's still something that should be experienced.", "timestamp_created": 1671915403, "timestamp_updated": 1671915403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129195184": {"recommendationid": "129195184", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096109722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2305, "last_played": 1671909708}, "language": "english", "review": "block bad", "timestamp_created": 1671910108, "timestamp_updated": 1671910108, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487804889678955078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129182900": {"recommendationid": "129182900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122634450", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 71, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1700176453}, "language": "english", "review": "BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK", "timestamp_created": 1671897792, "timestamp_updated": 1671897792, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486921519041061401", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129177731": {"recommendationid": "129177731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214548615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2909, "last_played": 1671892640}, "language": "english", "review": "sugoi", "timestamp_created": 1671893110, "timestamp_updated": 1671893110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129149014": {"recommendationid": "129149014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406017558", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 13293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 555, "last_played": 1697652946}, "language": "english", "review": "Guys... just because the enemies block 101% of the time doesn't mean its hard!!!!!! just go behind em and slap their bald spot........... i hate golf, i had 9 strokes. 9 strokes irl and i ran over atleast 7 people with a car", "timestamp_created": 1671861187, "timestamp_updated": 1671861187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129144419": {"recommendationid": "129144419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040908754", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 2211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2211, "last_played": 1671853489}, "language": "english", "review": "Yakuza 3 is the Fourth entry into the series. Unlike the Kiwami's and 0 this is just a remaster and not a remake. \n\nThe combat is frankly terrible. The enemies block non stop so on higher difficulties you have to constantly press grab. This feels terrible because the low ranking enemies have pin point pecision on their blocks, it makes every fight feel like an absolute slog. On hard this becomes a mess, and because this game is old you cant swap difficulty in the middle of the game, so i had to use a 3rd party software to change the code in the files in order to swap it. This game isnot hard, its just poorly designed. The rpg elememts are also very bad, inventory system makes 0 sense. Theirs like 10 slots and it was so bad i had to do inventory management in a fucking Yakuza game!. The skill system is the worst its ever been, it was bad in Kiwami 1 and its even worse here. Its just levels into 4 categories with random perks attached to it, theirs no choice just 4 options the entire game. The mini games are very outdated, some are super hard ether because the difficulty is crazy or because the ui for the game is terrible. There are some actual developed minigames, but like i said they are to much of a slog to really get into. \n\nThe story takes place on a orphanage on Okinawa after the end of 2. The kids all have distinct personalities and sadly the game tells you every single one of these kids stories. It literately forces you to experance this shit, it would have been fine in a sidequest but it gets very very annoying when the actual Yakuza stuff is picking up in momentum and then it suddenly stops and the game forces you to go on a goose chase helping these kids. I have no idea why they chose to develop every single one of them cause they dont really matter at all to the general story. Kiryu already loves kids and has Hauruka we dont need to be told a million times how much of a good dad Kiryu is too these kids, we already know!. These quests with the kids generally ruined my experance with the game for half of the runtime. \n\nThe other half is the average Yakuza stuff, where half of it is generally pretty bad. My issue is that the overall plot is it is very generic. Basically its this overarching narrative about evil secret organisations that go past the Yakuza plot. The characters you meet are killed off quickly or have little time on the screen because of this overarching narrative. It is sad, because their are genuinely some really great characters with awesome backstories that have pretty good motivations, but when that narrative comes creeping back in, those elements about those characters are ruined for some cringe inducing plot points. But that other half of the Yakuza part of the plot is actually good, because i could see the potential with what they were doing. It just that Yakuza 3 doesnot have an identity, it wants to be a orphanage simulator, then it wants to be a Yakuza crime drama, then it goes towards an action movie generic secret organisation plot. These 3 distinct plot diversions ruined the games pacing and made story elements very frustrating. It also turns the CIA into the good guys, really...\n\nOther than the main quests, the side content expecally in Okinawa is actually very good. The first 4 chapters are filled with side stuff to do and its all up to standard side content. But by the time i went back Kamurocho, the story was so slow i just skipped over the side stuff to finish the game. \n\nIn the end, Yakuza 3 is a very disappointing game that tries to many things with its plot, that it ends up turning into a slog. The gameplay and the minigames are outdated and unfun at higher difficulties. I would rate this a 5/10 more to a 6 than a 4, it has some good moments but the overall game ruins those moments.

is a game that i think is often overlooked because of its glaring flaws. the most obvious of these flaws is, of course, the combat. the AI has a tendency to block too often, ruining the flow of the game. its ability to target/track kiryu is also a little overbearing, as it makes sidestepping and hitting enemies in the back much harder to pull off. damage output is frustratingly low. all of these flaws lead fights to be ultimately less satisfying than they could have with a couple tweaks. many boss fights can drag on for way too long if you don't know the best ways to cheese them or deal more damage quickly. the game is very rigid in its approach to combat and wants you to work with it in a very specific way. but these are complaints everyone has.\n...but, to be honest, past a certain point in the game, i didn't really care.\nyakuza 3 is a game that does an incredible job at humanizing kiryu and its themes of trust and familial bonds feel like a natural evolution of what was explored in the first two games. rather than opening up with the typical over the top crime drama hijinks, y3 has you tend to the absolutely loveable cast of orphans at morning glory. while a lot of fans consider this segment of the game tedious, or the worst part, i thought it was incredibly well-done and found myself invested in these kids' character arcs quite a bit (especially taichi). having kiryu do the same thing his role model kazama did in the past really feels like a nice progression of his character. additionally, the supporting cast of characters like rikiya, mikio, and nakahara were a lot more likeable than past games.\nthe strong emotional core and the lovable cast allows me to look past this game's glaring flaws, but at certain points i found myself bored out of my mind with the main plot. while the core concept of okinawa being gentrified and transformed into something the natives can't recognize is an interesting idea, i found myself struggling to stay awake once tamiya dropped an enormous plot dump on me.\nyakuza 3 likes to reuse plot points from the previous two games in the series, and there are a ton of parallels and incredibly similar plot beats, but i don't see this approach as necessarily wrong. at the end of the day, its story stands on its own as pretty solid. mine is a very good foil to kiryu and his entire mindset, and having seen kiryu's trust pushed to its limits over and over again, you can't help but respect his tenacity and willingness to uphold his ideal.\noverall, while it lacks the dense atmosphere and focus of the first game, or the absolute manic pacing and insanity of the second, yakuza 3 manages to stand out as one of the most emotional games in this series for me, next to 0.\n\noh yeah, if you are planning on playing

(War God Talisman acquired through S rank Ultimate Challenges, very tedious but optional; Calming Towel is purchased through Coliseum, 7500 points).\n\nStep 2: Get Tech level 10, Komaki Parry (Leveling, Komaki Parry can be gotten very early and you could look up a guide for it).\n\nWhat do they do?\n1) You can freely cancel your attacks through Tech level 10's Quickstep Cancel and follow it up with Komaki Dodge Shot which is very vital for punishing enemies that attacks instantly after you attack them (especially if you want to start No Damaging bosses and want to lean over combo than technical no damaging) - pairing this with Calming Towel makes wall-bounding, stunlocking and tech-cancelling half finisher combo very easily and gives you the flexibility that the game could not provide you because Heat gain is too much even with other Heat decrease items.\n\n2) Heat Actions. War God Talisman is for those who wants to mix-up combos with Heat Actions; Red Heat Actions cannot be performed but it's still very good anyways.\n\n3) Komaki Parry is the cherry on top of the cake mainly due to allowing you to immediately punish an enemy and then chain-stunlock them, some bosses have Komaki Cat-Like Reflexes but none of them can tech out of 2x Rush 1x Finisher Evade Finisher combo or 3x Rush 1x Finisher Evade Finisher combo, allowing you to playing it like one of your favourite Tekken game (brokenasfuck)\n\nOptional: Payback Ring replacing War God Talisman. Once again - grinded at Coliseum. 15000 points. This makes all of your combo super lethal in EX-HARD difficulty as if you get hit the enemy would just take your punches harder, and if you're No Damaging bosses you're in for a ride - once you get a hit in it's already over, you need only one health and few stunlock wall-bound combos to immediately win a tedious fight in just a single minute that originally took you 8x more times to complete.\n\nThe game is very flawed, of course you still have to grind to achieve the satisfaction in gameplay, but it's well worth it. It's one of my hated and loved Ryu Ga Gotoku game to this day and I think limiting certain aspects of gameplay DO help that there are more aspect of the game that can be exploited to hell.

The combat is much more janky then that of 0, Kiwami or Kiwami 2: dodging feels more finicky, enemies block quite a bit, and it feels like the requirements to upgrade yourself feel a little much (Even with doing a ton of the sub stories, I wasn't anywhere close to maxing out my skills by the end of the game). The graphics don't look as polished as the game's proceeding or that come after this one. And the substories, at least early on, aren't quite as compelling as those I've experienced in 0 or Kiwami 2. \n\nThat said, despite the messiness, I still had a lot of fun here. I less than perfect Yakuza game is still a pretty dang awesome game. The characters are pretty fly; some of the new people you meet are series highlights for me, and Kiryu's Okinawan outfit is pretty rad. New gameplay elements - like revelations- are really fun, and the new essence skills they unlock are fantastically animated. The soundtrack is incredible, as usual.

To be sure, the change in graphics, in gameplay, in general quality-of-life is jarring - Yakuza 3 very much looks and feels like a PS3 game, lacking the polish and finesse of the PS4 era games that come before it in the series's internal timeline. However, I found that the Yakuza formula remains the same no matter what engine it's in, and the charm and appeal of the series shines through in 3 just as much as any other iteration.\n\nThematically, 3 is the end of a trilogy established with the original versions of 1 and 2, following Kiryu as he transforms from a lost, aimless ex-yakuza into a primal force dedicated to upholding the honor of the Tojo Clan by any means necessary, and then further on as he settles into what he hopes is a new, peaceful life. The change of scenery in the early game from Kamurocho to Okinawa is a welcome one, slowing the series's typical breakneck pace down to a peaceful, relaxing crawl for the first several hours. It's a divisive decision, in the way that it takes chances with what people expect of the Yakuza games, but I felt that the ways in which Kiryu's character is developed and deepened were vital. You see what he's like as a father figure, at peace after resolving the latest Tojo Clan disaster, his focus on the small scale of Okinawa's yakuza presence and keeping his orphanage afloat, determined to give back to society in a way he never could have before. I felt that it didn't overstay its welcome too much, though I did find myself longing for Kamurocho when the game turned back to the city.\n\nThe rest of the narrative is typical Yakuza fare, in that it's a strong, engaging crime drama with a fair amount of hyperbole and outrageousness. The Okinawa crew is a fun set of supporting characters, as are the new members of the Tojo Clan we meet throughout the story. Where Kiwami 2 felt like it relied too heavily on endgame twists, the plot of 3 - written at a different time, with different narrative sensibilities - is somewhat more straightforward, with clear, understandable motivations from the main and secondary villains, particularly Mine, an excellently written villain whose backstory elicits a fair amount of sympathy even as his actions remain vile. The Black Monday subplot, vaguely, feels rather like nonsense, but I can admit that it dovetails well into the main story, and never feels like a set of twists for the sake of twists.\n\nThen there's the combat. You always hear about Yakuza 3 being a slog by way of the extremely block-heavy enemies, from street level goons all the way up to the final boss. I can absolutely see where people are coming from, and it's certainly a huge adjustment to make from Kiwami 2, where the combat is comparatively smooth as butter. However, I was rarely ever truly frustrated or irritated by the combat - the goons block, but they'll simply drop their blocks if you pressure them enough, and you can quickstep around them or grab most of them to get around it. The bosses are more aggressive, but I found that once you understood their attack patterns, you could interrupt them and chip damage away pretty consistently. It makes the fights take forever, but I never felt that I would unfairly take a loss - if I lost, it was a skill issue, not a gameplay issue. Fixing the quickstep distance when running at 60 fps with a mod helps, for sure, but I personally didn't think it was absolutely essential for the combat to be tolerable.\n\nOn the whole, while Yakuza 3 is a product of its time, the fact remains that RGG Studio has always known what they're doing, and the framework of what makes this series truly great is evident in their first PS3 game, the oldest game in the modern play order by release date. It's not devoid of problems - the story occasionally has goofy nonsense, the combat can slow to a crawl, the substory interface is rather frustratingly obtuse even with a quest log, and I never once found myself wanting to play any of the minigames, ESPECIALLY the comparatively-horrendous version of the cabaret club minigame - but Yakuza 3 remains a Yakuza game, and that means it's fun, engaging, and worth your time.\n\ntl;dr blockuza 3", "timestamp_created": 1670819711, "timestamp_updated": 1670819711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128398856": {"recommendationid": "128398856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010222614", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 3447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3447, "last_played": 1670806206}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes the minigames are a pain in this one, yes the substories are somewhat boring in comparison to the prequels, yes the fighting is not as good and yes the overall quality is a step down from zero or kiwami 1/2 but its still a solid game.

It was so boringly plain stuffed with fillers that were spread throughout chapters. I was in a hurry to get to the end since I was wondering, 'where does this all lead to?'.

If you're like me and you've been belatedly working through this series, starting with Yakuza 0 and on through Kiwami and Kiwami 2, what you are going to find here is the first game that doesn't have a newer touch on its game mechanics, and it shows. \n\nEverything is clunkier! Combat is not as fun. Street encounters are less dynamic and harder to avoid when you reach the point in the game where you just want to run away from guys. New mechanics, like chases, are annoying. Kamurocho is less alive outside of cutscenes. Heat actions are very undertuned against bosses. Even the progression mechanic isn't particularly satisfying, with little feeling that Kiryu gets much stronger from the beginning to the end of the game. I was disappointed that the story made the decision to just write out Sayama from Kiwami 2 rather than carry over a potential love interest for Kiryu. The new location of Okinawa is not as cool of a secondary location as Sotenbori has been in prior games.\n\nLooking over all of those flaws, I did like experiencing the story of this game, when it was there. Kiryu acting as the father figure to a house full of orphans, including Haruka, is sweet to see, how he tries to have a normal existence for them even when some of the craziness of his old life starts to catch up. I wish there was a bit more of this mixed in with the plot, which ends up being several chapters in a row in Okinawa that awkwardly try to catch up the story from where Kiwami 2 left off to when the main plot of 3 is set, several more chapters in Kamurocho, and not much back and forth until the very end. The cast is always committed to every cutscene and the plot is full of dramatic turns as you'd expect from this series. \n\nI'll be continuing the series, but I sure hope that 4 and 5 (which are the other games that were made before the 0 prequel, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 came along) represent an improvement over this.", "timestamp_created": 1670035159, "timestamp_updated": 1670035159, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127802995": {"recommendationid": "127802995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177878913", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2766, "last_played": 1670030858}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've played through zero, Kiwami 1, and Kiwami 2, the abrupt shift in combat is jarring, but you eventually get used to it.

As someone who decided to play Yakuza 2 on PS2 instead of Kiwami 2 (I don't like how it's basically a completely different game that tells Y2's story) I appreciated the way it advanced the series more than others I think.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThe story, unfortunately, feels a bit rushed and gives the impression of something that was originally going to be way bigger. You can kinda tell with how [spoiler]Rikiya's death is never mentioned or talked about after it happens afaik, not even Kiryu and Haruka paying respects to him in the ending or anything which sucks since he was a good character[/spoiler] and the infamous giant exposition scene. If you're someone that not the type to do every substory, you're gonna be annoyed with all the mandatory orphanage stories, but as someone who does do all of them I really like seeing Kiryu's new life and how happy he is as a dad. The story does otherwise have some fun moments and an enjoyable finale though.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nGame was played on hard, I don't know if anything significant changes in Normal or Legend.\nOn one hand, Kiryu's kit has improved a lot since Yakuza 2, with improved controls, getting tiger drop and parry pretty early, and powerful heat moves like Essence of Rolling. However, as you probably know, the problem with this game's combat is the enemies. Their problem isn't just that they block all the time, it's combined with some other factors. So, if they block, why not go behind them since they can't block from behind? That does work on occasion, but depending on the moveset the enemies can have attacks where they turn 180 as they do it. Grabs can work, but they're not that strong and even then there are enemies which just can't be grabbed, which sucks. \nThere's also the way the ai works: enemies will mostly only attack when they know you're vulnerable, such as when you're attacking someone else. Later games' enemies do a downplayed version of this ai but combined with the blocking this can make early game group fights really annoying. Even later on this makes standard enemy fights longer on average than most others in the series. \nNow, at least it can be easy to tiger drop enemies on one-on-one fights, right? It would be if they actually attacked you. Biggest example of this is [spoiler]Joji[/spoiler] who as far as I remember just didn't attack for the longest time and waited for you to mess up, this is the same for the Coliseum enemies where if you wanted to counter them, you need to try bait their ai into attacking by facing away from them or with blockstrings, which even then doesn't always work (works pretty well on Majima though). Probably the worst offender is Komaki who I swear wasn't play-tested. There are a couple of alternate ways to whittle enemies' health down but it's not exactly efficient or consistent. \nFunny thing though, Amon and the final bosses actually attack you constantly, making them the funnest bosses in the game since you can actually counter/get behind them!\nAnecdotes from my experience:\n-Komaki Parry only works for punches and most weapons, but you can do it the moment the enemy enters the attacking animation compared to tiger drop where it's just before they attack, so get used to using that on enemies with punching movesets. Enemies may take forever to attack, but they'll do it eventually! I think enemies with weapons are slightly more aggressive too.\n-Get some swords for annoying group fights, they can't block them bare-handed.\n-Get used to heat actions that are initiated by grabbing and essence of rolling since that's basically free damage.\n\n[b]Exploration & Substories[/b]\nNew to the series is Ryukyu, which is pretty comfy if I do say so myself. In a series that's so far focused on city life, it's nice to explore a place a bit more rural, with a good amount of substories focusing on its culture and how life is like there. While failable substories can be a bit annoying, There being one where you play hide and seek with Kiryu's kids is very cute.\nKamurocho has some enjoyable stuff as well, the first time you can explore it at a good run speed (compared to ps2) with a free camera and some nice substories. Following up what happened way back in Yakuza 1's intro in 95 was a pleasant surprise and the journalist is pretty enjoyable for one that's sub-story only. Rikiya's substories helped the character a lot too.\nChase missions are fine when you figure out you can quickly stop pressing run for tight turns then start running again.\nAccessing the item box from pay phones started here and it's super welcome. Having to go all the way back to a hideout to sort the box with your 9 item inventory in ps2 honestly demotivated me from playing a bit.\nWeapon modding came here and it's fine here too, but I'd always rather try to just continue the game than gather materials for things I don't really need. I just come here to repair my swords.\nLocker keys' sparkly spots aren't as obscured as the ps2 but now require looking in places you'd never otherwise. I do wonder how many have gotten them all without a guide 'cause I certainly don't have the patience.\nHostesses are back and as a carryover from the past game you need to complete all 9 to face Amon. I don't know why so many of these games have so many, they're never that interesting.\n\n[b]Side activities[/b]\nIF7 lets you fight past enemies and they get you a few new abilities, mostly not that useful but I'd still get the 'guard against swords bare-handed' upgrade if you're planning to face Amon.\nOf course there's Karaoke which debuts in this game. They didn't go too far with it yet with Kiryu only having one song but at least the hostess songs are enjoyable enough and Kiryu has cute cheers.\nPool and Darts are new, and the batting cages now require you to aim the bat as well as time it. Quick tip, Pool and Batting is way easier with the mouse & keyboard if you're into completion. Darts is easier depending on the yakuza game you're in or maybe you'll have better luck than me in 3. I found it extremely brutal on controller though, same with Pool. With batting, just remember to time it with Kiryu's hands becoming steady rather than the ball. I'm pretty sure cee-lo, koi-koi and oichu-kabu debuted here too. \nKoi-koi you'll eventually get by remembering the hands, what cards are high-value and how they combine by playing. I'd recommend turning cherry blossom viewing off.\nFishing I actually found pretty fun, didn't even have that much trouble with the tuna though I played post-patch. It does take ages with the tougher fish though, especially in Y4.\nGolf I also found actually pretty fun despite the complaints I heard about it. It's harsher than, say, Mario Golf but a bit of practice should get the golfing substory done. Just remember the wind, the way the ball rolls and the downhill spots when putting. Getting -5 for completion is however pretty dang tough.\nBoxcelios is a nice little arcade game where you pay attention to glowy weak points and laser them. Just remember you're way faster when not firing.\nThere's also hostess maker which is really boring and returns in 4 for some reason.\n\n[b]Misc.[/b]\nSoundtrack's cool, favourite tracks are Sounds Storm and Receive and Stab You. Best Karaoke song is Saturday Night Lover. In the context of 'English speaking people that were seemingly just in Japan at the time and were probably given no direction', Donald Glover did a pretty alright job compared to the 'VAs' for the Mega Man ps1 games. Revelations are fun too but unfortunately don't get much better apart from the moves you get\n\nThat's all I can cover within character limit. While Yakuza 3 definitely has issues, it also added a ton for the series in terms of controls, exploration and minigames.

"review": "tl;dr, it's not a bad game, but it's not the best the franchise has to offer. A mediocre Yakuza game is still a good game relative to what else is on the market.\nJohn Yakuza just wanted to retire to an island and foster a clutch of orphans, but then, as always, the reprobates of Kamurocho drag him back into a messy fight for something it's not clear he actually believes in but feels forever obligated towards. The story is fine, but follows the same main beats as all the other Yakuza titles. This time the villain is less compelling and we spend less time growing to dislike him. I went into the final battle not even aware it was the climax of the game. Story isn't the only aspect of this entry that's notably weaker than the others, though it's less forgivable since it doesn't have the limitations of an older game engine as an excuse. Combat is button-mashy and the visuals are PS3 era (but not bad - in parts even quite beautiful). This time around the side content is especially weak. Playing through the games numerically, I typically have a completion percentage in the high seventies to mid eighties.

The substories are sub-par, hard to follow and complete, and the levelling up system is way too grindy.  HOWEVER, the story is one of the best written in the Yakuza series imo.  There has been no other game in this series that has made me hate a character so much, and then kinda like them after (except kuze).  The many underlying themes present in Yakuza 3 such as loyalty, love, wealth, acceptance, and family are brought to life not only by the narrative, but by many of the characters and their actions.  I, personally, have a love/hate relationship with this game, as although some components in the game were quite bad, the story really shines, and hits you right in the feels.

my least favorite so far for two reasons. One being there are a few segments that feel like they were implemented simply to drag out the game time, even if they do invoke some of the same emotions as the rest of the story. The second is the combat itself, which the game unfortunately makes most of the combos and abilities you can get useless in most cases, and it took me the same amount of time to learn this game's combat as it did when I first started with Yakuza 0. \nDespite the flaws Yakuza 3 has, it's still a fun and brilliant game that I recommend anyone who's interested in playing the Yakuza series to play, even if you just play through it once.

The first few Okinawa chapters are seriously great and probably the way the first game should have ended. I didn't really want to continue with the story, I wanted Kiryu to stay at the orphanage and get some peaceful moments for a while. That's kind of the reason it took me so long to finish this.\n\nBut then I did and while the story has some good moments (and some sad ones), it get's to a very weird state.The series starts about internal Yakuza wars for real estate and leadership of the clan, but now you're fighting secret global organisations. Kinda taking a wild turn.\n\nGameplaywise it's the same loop again, so not too exciting tbh. I didn't even bother with most side activities unless they didn't take too much time.\n\nThe combat is pretty much the same old, but the ways to learn new moves are pretty annoying.

Little movement freedom, short combos, no huge upgrades, low history rhythm, and no \"feeling\" when hiting enemies or in Heat Actions. Everything is so slow and blocky to play.\n\u2714\ufe0fEven so, this IS a Yakuza. Amazing Sub-stories, a lot of secondary content, friendly faces, a lot of humor and drama.

It introduces the new Kiryu life and a lot of his new family. The History is so slow because it takes a lot of time to \"set\" the background story after more than a YEAR since the previous game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNt7wwETXf4", "timestamp_created": 1667431825, "timestamp_updated": 1667432703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124849019": {"recommendationid": "124849019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268794709", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1668887014}, "language": "english", "review": "kiryu best dad", "timestamp_created": 1667423384, "timestamp_updated": 1667423384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53498542308807373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124806186": {"recommendationid": "124806186", "author": {"steamid": "76561199168906341", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1403, "last_played": 1661978361}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story.

It's a perfectly serviceable Yakuza title, but its one that suffers from feeling like a filler episode with its awkward pacing and piss-poor gameplay changes.\n\nIt's the shortest Yakuza game yet, taking me around 15 hours to finish even with side content added into the mix. The actual plot of the game doesn't really kick off until you're about halfway through and because of this, the actual plot feels like it goes by at a lightning pace compared to previous titles.\n\nAt this point the formula is feeling pretty predictable and nothing happens that you aren't already expecting to. It has its moments, but this mostly felt like a filler story that could've been cut out entirely and not much would've changed.\n\nAs for the gameplay changes, it basically feels like the worst parts of Kiwami amplified. The regular fights feel like for the most part, but the bosses can take way longer than they should due to overly large health bars and the fact that they block almost every single attack type in the game. Heat takes a stupid amount of time to build up unless you're under the alcohol buff, so you need to become a straight up alcoholic if you want to use your heat consistently. The progression system feels weak and restrictive, leading to a very stop-start style of progression rather than natural growth. It's probably the easiest Yakuza game, but the fights are also probably the most tedious. Not to mention that they halved the evade's effective distance, making it basically useless in all combat.\n\nThe substories this time around are mostly incredibly short check-list quests that don't offer much additional meaningful gameplay this time around.\n\nI could go on for a while, but truth be told, its just a very weak entry. My stance is that I would recommend playing it through one time if you're a fan of the series, but its definitely not an entry I would be revisiting.\n\nIt just barely gets a positive rating out of me simply because I never felt like putting it down during my playtime, but at the same time, its the least special of the Yakuza games so far.", "timestamp_created": 1667262889, "timestamp_updated": 1667262889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124746788": {"recommendationid": "124746788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125467545", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 3026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3026, "last_played": 1667247122}, "language": "english", "review": "Buen Juego.", "timestamp_created": 1667261280, "timestamp_updated": 1667261280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124721764": {"recommendationid": "124721764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255008789", "num_games_owned": 623, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1101, "last_played": 1663266450}, "language": "english", "review": "White suit man get dumped by girl she leave to Mearican so man start orfphanage in okinawa and met nwe people and then he tell kid life lesson while mixe up in yakuza plot and big gobervment toruble so he fight man who speak english on phone and hire suit man to hunt down man in whiute suit and then bag guy turn good andf kill blacksuit man who is bad", "timestamp_created": 1667227166, "timestamp_updated": 1667227166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124695002": {"recommendationid": "124695002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202107208", "num_games_owned": 4058, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 6456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6456, "last_played": 1667180328}, "language": "english", "review": "other than the abysmal combat, the game was alright and had its good moments", "timestamp_created": 1667180370, "timestamp_updated": 1667180370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632325410842895508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124694645": {"recommendationid": "124694645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085088135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1417, "last_played": 1667179441}, "language": "english", "review": "I just can't do it.

"review": "Honestly this game isnt worth playing other than to see Kiryus story through.\nI wish I could give a middle or neutral thumb because this isnt an outright bad game. It's just okay.\nThe story is fine but starts off at a glacial pace gets to a nice momentum around the middle of the game and then writes itself into a corner so badly that it needs a 30 minute exposition dump. The final chapters fall into the usual tropes and cliches of the series and after having played 4 games a certain tiredness of it is starting to set in for me personally. Certain emotional moments feel very artificial and cheap because of this. I generally liked most of the characters in the story and didnt even mind the orphanage parts that much. It's just a pretty standard Yakuza story overall and nothing special.\n\nHowever the gameplay is where it starts to become really hairy to me. To get the obvious elephant in the room out lets start with the combat. The combat is fine in my opinion. Its much slower paced than in the other games but I generally didnt mind it most of the time. I actually had fun  in the moments the game allows you to pull of the combat techniques unique to this game like wall bounces and parries. However the combat also starts to introduce a gripe of mine that affects pretty much everything in this game. It wastes the players time so hard it becomes actively infuriating. Every street encounter starts with a forced pause of having to read the same text box dialogue and watch the slow ass intro camera pan as it introduces Generic Gangster #15152 again. It adds up to like 15 seconds of wait time before every single encounter. Sometimes you even have to start off the fight with a QTE that does barely any damage other than having you wait even longer.\n\nThis trend of time waste continues in the sub stories which are riddled with long pauses to mask loading times and annoying fetch quests. Theres a few good ones but this game really went towards quantity over quality when it comes to substories. I generally enjoyed my time doing substories but couldnt help but roll my eyes when it had me walk to the other side of the map again to look for an random NPC in some street over and over. This is made worse by map traversal being super annoying. The game misses the dash feature and the option to avoid enemy encounters the later games have. Fast travel is only a minor help in this regard as taxis are few and only placed at the border of the map.\n\nBut the actively worst part of the game are the minigames. Almost all of them suffer from clunky controls, janky physics or a glacial pace. The Hostess Maker minigame in particular doesnt just waste your time by being slow as molasses but is also completely intransparent in its mechanics. It's an unenjoyable minigame thats pretty much requires using a guide. I had fun playing Boxcelios though.\n\nOverall I cant really recommend this game to anyone other than diehard Yakuza fans who want to see the entirety of Kiryus story start to finish.", "timestamp_created": 1666527562, "timestamp_updated": 1666527562, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124249332": {"recommendationid": "124249332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426134907", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "playtime_at_review": 11329, "last_played": 1700711735}, "language": "spanish", "review": "People are to harsh on this game, I actually expected something worst.\nThe gameplay is not the best, but you can go through it with other strategies.\nThe story is probably one of the best ones I have seen in this games.\nIf you're looking to plat this game, is surely a nightmare, but it was worth for me at the end.", "timestamp_created": 1666491080, "timestamp_updated": 1666491080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124248036": {"recommendationid": "124248036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986569114", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 320, "playtime_forever": 8396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8396, "last_played": 1666489278}, "language": "spanish", "review": "He de decir que la saga saca mi masoquista interior, porque no es normal c\u00f3mo disfruto rejug\u00e1ndola sabiendo lo que voy a llorar.

The story was the strongest part of the game by far, only lacking in its pacing. By the end I was well invested and stopped pissing in order to see what happens next, but at the start I was dead ass thinking of doing biology revision instead due to it suffering from this little issue: It was fucking boring as shit. The villain and supporting cast in this game were spot on with Rikiya, Nakahara and Mine being the highlights among some of the shitter characters like Richardson.\nHowever, The part in which this game suffered the most was in the combat and world. The combat felt less satisfying than shoving porridge up my ass, and was easy to button mash or repeat the same x x x y y combo over and over in my experience (then again that is partially my fault for being a boring ass guy and not spicing things up, although the game never really encouraged that all too often). Next, the world was nice and big yes, but I felt as though it was quite lifeless in comparison to prior games. I was never all too eager to explore and when I did it felt like a chore to engage in any of the activities or side quests I stumbled upon, which removes half the fun of a Yakuza game. So I often spent my time rushing through and trying to get to the next main story quest a lot more than in the others which kind of blows hard. \nSome of the main story quests were tedious as shit as well e.g. Finding any of the annoying shits in chapter 10 (this was the game's lowest point and was frustrating as paper stuck in your ass when you go for a shit).\n\nOverall the game was pleasant compared to most, however, it lacked something present in the other games that led to me disliking a lot of the time I spent in between main story quests and especially the shitty start of the game. Also the karaoke sucked in my opinion (at least in comparison to 0 and kiwami 1 + 2).\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1666044170, "timestamp_updated": 1666044170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123981584": {"recommendationid": "123981584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359742120", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1666397226}, "language": "english", "review": "So far not enjoying this at all but in order to know how the story ends i have to play it, 4 chapters in with barely any combat its just irritatingly boring if i wanted to read a boring book id have gone and read twilight, what happened to the usual yakuza style where you always hung to every word.\n\nHowever once the story picks up around chapter 5 onwards it only gets impactful towards the final 3 or so chapters in which a certain even which i wont spoil is rather heartwretching causing the player to really wanna kick the ever loving crap outta the final bosses.\n\nThe Ending is a questionable one but i suppose yakuza 4 will hopefully lead on from it making it work.\nGame had potential which was quite frankly wasted and the difficulty wasnt that bad even with the enemys using a stupid amount of blocking meaning you could barely get a strike in.\n\nStory: 4/10 (This story got really stupid)\nGameplay: 5/10 (the mechanics were wack)\nGraphics: 6/10 (good for a remaster)\nDifficulty:4/10 (only hard part is the stupid amount of blocking the enemies do)\n\nThis game really needed the Kiwami treatment to make it good enough.", "timestamp_created": 1666028370, "timestamp_updated": 1666397624, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123957931": {"recommendationid": "123957931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161671862", "num_games_owned": 1831, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 1114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 880, "last_played": 1666063505}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is utterly boring to a point the first six chapters are a snooze fest and honestly the orphanage you never really get a good reason to care.

You'll constantly have to read multiple lines at a time to anticipate keypresses at the beginning of the next line, and the tempo is all over the place, so the cursor keeps changing speeds and you won't be able to anticipate any timings.

You can get Kiryu's greatest combat tools very early on too, if you don't just b-line straight through the story. However, that doesn't excuse the issues that can be found in this port such as poor dead zone and broken quick-stepping. That being said, you can install a mod to fix the quick-stepping. There's also mods to make it more in line with the original release visual while keeping the higher definition. \n\nYakuza 3 is a solid entry in the series, if you're coming off of Kiwami 2 and playing this game. It's going to be rough because you're playing a game that predates the remake by 8 YEARS.

Still, let's start with the positive aspects:\n\n-This is the starting point for modern Yakuza games, tons of minigames, markers for sidequests, that huge and dreaded completion list. Some minigames are dated as fuck, yes,but it was a good addition and future Yakuza games would improve on it. \n-Being able to experience Kiryu's civilian side at the orphanage. Yeah, some missions are annoying and drag a little, but is nice being able to see Kiryu outside his tough guy persona. Makes him a little bit more interesting and enjoyable.\n-Let me remind you, even if Kiwami 1 and 2 look a lot better than 3, compare Kiryu's model between Yakuza 2 and Yakuza 3. This game looks good and nostalgic, even though Kiryu's walk cycle makes me laugh.\n-Combat is a mixed bag, but enemies blocking everything at least has some perks to it. You can't gorilla your way into them and you have to actually plan how to use your heat bar.\n\nNow, let's talk about the negative aspects:\n-Combat is really, REALLY annoying. I don't know why, but most enemies block all your attacks and early game is really painful. It ain't difficult or challenging, it is slow, it drags and most of all it sucks because most enemies are going to block your attacks mid combo. Just imagine a fighting game where your opponent could block your attack even if you didn't drop your combo. Well you somewhat can in Killer Instinct, but even in that game you can counter a counter. And even if you break your enemy's guard, they can guard instantly again. \n-The plot is weird and the main antagonist is not that interesting outside the memes. It feels like it comes out of nowhere and it lacks the impact from the previous two antagonists. Personally it didn't hook me that much and feels more like a filler episode just to traumatize Kiryu even more. \n-All versions of Yakuza 3 has cut content, even this version.\n-Even though it demands less hardware than most recent games, framerate dips quite a bit in Kamurocho and civilians constantly bug out and their walk cycle and animations break constantly. This happens in almost all Yakuza games, but it is really weird seeing a huge group of civilians bugging out when you pick up a key or move in a certain way.\n-Pacing is all over the place and the story takes a while to pick up, and once it picks up, it goes way too fast and many of its plotlines are either too convoluted or the game doesnt give them enough time to completely unfold making it feel a little too rushed.\n\nIn short, I dislike this game, but I still think it deserves to be played at least one time.

Features 119 substories, new features, great antagonists, and a great story. It definitely has a good bit of flaws. The game's biggest flaw IMO is it's lack of markers. Coming from Y0, K1, and K2, this flaw sucked a lot. Even in the main story, there aren't enough markers, let alone substory markers. God forbid I did all substories blind without gamefaqs telling me where stuff is. It gets annoyingly cryptic sometimes, even with a guide.\n\nStill got a LOT of time out of it between all of its optional content, and I did enjoy the game. Definitely could use a remake, though.\n\nAlso it could be said that for a remaster, there's a couple things that could've been buffered out -- but they didn't. \n\nMake sure to get the quickstep restoration mod as the doubled framerate to 60 causes a quickstep to be roughly half as it usually is so I've heard. \n\nAlthough yakuza combat can pose some difficulty a lot of the time, this game is just very brutal. Get used to quickstepping behind enemies to their back, or else you will pay.\n\nAll in all a great journey with it's own atmosphere.

The remaster improves a good number of environmental and key character textures, but it's very clear this is an earlier title. \n\nAltough Yakuza 3 is not quite as grandiose as the aforementioned entries, there's definitely a charm on it, this is the game that laid the foundations for the later entries, it's somewhat a different tonally from 0 and the Kiwami remakes, life in Okinawa is a bit of a different beast to the seedier parts of Tokyo, spending time in Downtown Ryukyu is a lovely change of pace from the bright lights of Kamurocho. Kyriu is different from what he was, it is great to see Kiryu in a different light.\n\nRest assured, that is just the beggining, there are those that love the change of pace and those that dislike the elongated length. I'm with the second portion, most downside to me was how it's pace is slow, but Yakuza 3 isn't a \u2018bad\u2019 game, as soon as you progress throught the game you are back at what you love in the franchise, an open-world crime drama with a large emphasis on gritty storytelling, hilarious substories, and allowing you to feel like a walking tank whenever you wander the streets of your chosen city, kicking the hell out of anyone that stands in your way. Upon your return to Kamurocho is where things pick back up plot-wise.\n\nI tend to agree that it is one of the weakest in the series, the combat show their age and the enemies block too often, if you played another Yakuza before that it's definitely a let down. But it is still a solid entry and worth playing through to see the foundations of Kiryu\u2019s later life beginning.\n\nIf you are invested in Kiryu's story, then skipping this game is a no go, each game builds and develops the world of yakuza and Kiryu.

Every single element of this game seems designed to make you frustrated, sad, and angry.\n\nThe story simply stops so Kiryu can take care of the kids multiple times, and this is probably a me thing i fucking hated the guts of every single new character they added, first time i played this i still thought this game wasn't just made to piss me off and decided to be nice to Rikya (this game's Sayama except he always manages to find a reason to GTFO any time  he would be useful) and pay the entirety of our bill in the restaurant and the bastard set me back 60000 yen leaving me with nothing, every other new character does so little they barely exist or are even more obnoxious. And yes it is true that in the middle of their game they have a straight half an hour of exposition beacuse dumbass Kiryu is just stumbling around Kamurocho beating people up for half the story.\n\nThe enemies always play on the defensive so the only way to consistantly deal damage is to grab them again and again, it really feels like the random encounter dudes just want to not be defeated instead of defeating Kiryu, they fucking block all the time and if you try to play on punishing their attacks they will wait 45 seconds before doing the weakest, fastest punch they have, even with tiger drop and komaki parry i still couldn't get any enjoyment out of the combat, i really don't mind random encounters in any other game but in this one i wish i could turn them off.\n\nThe substories are either fighting one group of guys and reading a fuck ton of dialogue or they are spread by 5 chapters and none of them are engaging or funny, the ones that try to be fail but most of them don't even try.\n\nSo yeah if you want to save money/braincells skip this one, you won't miss any context when playing 4, 5 or 6 if you just keep in mind that Kiryu has an orphanage AND HE LOVES HIS KIDS SO MUCH HE WOULD SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE BEING AN ACTION DAD OR SOMETHING DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THEIR NAMES THEY AREN'T IMPORTANT EVER AGAIN (they weren't really important in this game

even say that this is my second or third favorite so far, due to how much I loved this game\n\nPROS:\n- gameplay is surprisingly fluid. this is probably the yakuza game with the best lock-on from what i've played and also how I like the idea of focusing more on exploiting the weak points of enemies due to their blocking addiction\n- story was top class. it was so nice to see kiryu living at his highest point and spending time with his children\n- majima\n- most characters to me were very memorable and made me enjoy the time the game spends with them. cant say the same for most people in k1 or k2\n- the music is actually pretty fire, from the street battles to fly i was jamming out so hard\n- again, i knew every plotpoint and still i was crying like a baby at certain scenes. only few games can hook people despite already knowing how the story goes and i think that's incredible\n\nCONS:\n- there is no running in the game. while i think that its ok in the sense of being in kamurocho i sure as hell didnt like going through okinawa without the ability to sprint\n- some bosses are bullshit as hell. for instance, one guy made me waste like a good ten items due to how BS he was with his instant counters, insane weapon hitboxes and super armor\n- the sidestories and activities are honestly forgettable to an extent\n- the whole chase mechanic (this will be elaborated further in my y4 review)\n\nin all, this was an amazing game and definitely worth any yakuza fan's time. it may start out rough but trust me, the game gets better real quick\n\n8/10 awesome sauce",

ever:\nSo I've been playing the Yakuza Series on the game pass but I received this as a humble bundle gift and so I decided to leave a review.\nI have done the start through the Kiwami Remakes, it was a little jarring going from Kiwami 2 to Yakuza 3 but I got used to it pretty quickly, the combat reminds me of Kiwami 1 which combat I really enjoyed when I played it my main problem is the constant blocking but I got around that.\n\nI played all of the substories but didn't do all the minigames but from the ones I played I would rank them from Favourites to boring: Karaoke - Pool - Batting - Coliseum - Mahjong and then Darts which got really annoying very quickly, I preferred the darts from Kiwami 2 but I suppose that's a ways away now considering it was a remake using Yakuza 6 as a base point.\n\nStory was alright not the best but it has to live up to 0, Kiwami 1 and Kiwami 2's story which were much better by comparison but I don't hold it against it there were moments which made me laugh out loud and moments which made me cry but I'm hoping it gets better from here.\n\nAmazing game in the series so far I rank it as my least favourite but that's still a high bar in my eyes.",

While I absolutely love seeing the Father like moments with the kids at the orphanage some of the story missions that are mandatory for them felt like a hassle at time, slowing down the pacing of the main story. I think they would have be better relegated to Sub Stories.\n\nSub Stories at times felt very pointless and unnecessary. While some were great and had interesting stories, others would be simple and just there as fluff which felt pointless and a waste of time. The bigger sub stories like the Hostess maker you can see that they improved on in the newer games creating the Cabaret club and that the Hostess Maker was their original attempt at it, It does not hold up well anymore and is very boring.\n\nI loved seeing Okinawa and getting to explore it (even though its relatively small), the vibe of Okinawa is a stark contract to Kamurocho.

The problem is the story is dreadfully boring.\n\nWithout summarizing the whole game, Kiryu opened an orphanage to distance himself from the yakuza lifestyle. A big part of the game is spent bonding with the children there, which ends up being going through loads of texts boxes, walking somewhere, then a ton more text. This isn't new for the series, but there's something fascinating about reading dialogue about the conspiracies and plots of criminals and scumbags.\n\nThe game could have offset the story with some more interesting game mechanics, but being the oldest of the modern games it can't hold up very well.

in particular resonated with me the most despite the numerous flaws it might have. Yakuza 3 was the third mainline title and second PS3 title, this is important to note if you're coming from 0 and the Kiwamis, this will feel like a noticeable bump in the road if you've gotten accustomed to the modern Yakuza titles and remakes, as a result I implore you to check out the original PS2 titles before immediately jumping into this one to set your expectations.\n\nIf you're only interested in Yakuza's gameplay and never grew attached to the story nor characters, I would probably skip this one - where Yakuza 3 excels is in it's story, atmosphere and characters. Without getting into too much detail, the game definitely takes a bit to get going, and it will pull you into mandatory slice of life character interactions that won't be to everyone's taste, if you're able to set aside a few hours and really get yourself invested I think it really pays off.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I'm going to give a few recommendations now: when you get EXP, focus on upgrading your tech and body at first up until you meet Komaki (who at a specific point in the story will send a letter pointing to where he is) and relearn his moves. Coming from Kiwami 2's lack of a parry and especially K1's overpowered Tiger Drop, you might be conditioned to using the Tiger Drop as your counter of choice, however the Komaki Parry is far more effective as you'll have a wider window to hit it, it'll counter more attacks and allows you to accumulate more damage while they're stunned. The Daruma Tumbler also alleviates many of the problems with your quickstep introduced in the buggy \"Remastered\" port, at this point I'd focus on bringing heat and soul up.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I highly recommend this game if you don't mind some light grinding to sand down some of the rough edges, and you value the story, atmosphere and characters above all else. If you don't have the time nor particularly care to get super invested in the more slice of life aspect to the story and additionally want faster paced fights, I'd skip this one.", "timestamp_created": 1661107368, "timestamp_updated": 1661107445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120955312": {"recommendationid": "120955312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198814232371", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1666, "last_played": 1662926746}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bueno pues este es el juego m\u00e1s flojito de la saga sin duda, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed es muy disfrutable.\nAqu\u00ed van los puntos:\nHistoria: Un poco lenta y enredada al principio, pero como siempre, una historia que te atrapa y te deja con ganas de seguir jugando, a\u00fan cuando no puedas.

"language": "english", "review": "I realize Yakuza 3 was a huge improvement over the original Yakuza 2 upon its release, but coming off the heels of Yakuza Kiwami 2, this was a bit jarring. The visuals and mechanics are definitely a \"down-grade\", but one must understand that Yakuza 3 is a product of its time. After an hour or two of play, the initial shock of jumping back in technical time melted away, and I was soon captivated by the story, characters, and locales.\n\nA highlight for me was exploring Okinawa; I liked it a lot. It felt like a breath of fresh air, especially after having spent the majority of my time solely in Kamurocho in previous titles. I also enjoyed the characters and the tighter-knit relationships between them (especially the Ryudo guys and the kids at the orphanage). This felt like a more \"wholesome\" Yakuza game, if that makes sense. Compared to 0, Kiwami 1, and Kiwami 2, Yakuza 3's story isn't as grand, but still offers plenty of twists and turns.\n\nUltimately, I think the grander story and the motivations behind it isn't as compelling or as fulfilling as those found in past titles, but the well-written interpersonal developments of the kids at the orphanage and the boys at the Ryudo family more than made-up for it.\n\nI found the sub-stories to be some of the best in the series thus far (having only played Kiwami 1, 0, and Kiwami 2, and now Yakuza 3, in that order). I also liked the slower pacing at times, playing as Kiryu and helping the kids with their struggles (at one point we all played baseball on the beach and it was a blast!). However, sometimes the greater focus on the orphanage clashes with the pacing of the main story. For example, things will come to a head in the main story, and it's nearing a climax, when that is suddenly deflated by Kiryu being forced to help the kids with mundane tasks before continuing the story. I liked the orphanage, watching Kiryu be a parent, and helping the kids, but I wish more of that was optional instead of being shoe-horned into the main campaign.\n\nAlso, a lot of the bosses resort to blocking, which kills the pace of fights. Weapons help, but sometimes I'd become frustrated trying to defeat particular bosses for fifteen minutes on end. That's probably my only gripe about the combat. I really liked the hitman missions though and the chases!\n\nAll in all, Yakuza 3, while being a product of its time (and having been developed in under a year, from what I've read), is a good game, and a good Yakuza game to boot. It's full of action, fun side quests, plenty of character development, cool locations, fun mini games (golf, anyone?), and a main story full of twists and turns.

All the wackiness and crime drama we've come to love is still here. I got a lot of enjoyment out of it, even from the combat, which is rough compared to the later entries, but fun to master once you get the hang of it. The combat itself is more defense-oriented, so relentlessly attacking your enemies won't do much, since they block most of your attacks.\n\nIf you're planning to play the entire series for the first time, I recommend to start with this one since it's the oldest. Then progress as they released (y3 > y4 > y5 > y0 > y1 > y2 > y6 [I omit y7 since its combat system is totally different]).

There's a wonderful story behind it, with its own moments and quirks that you will come to adore. Substories are always a charm, and so are some of the soundtracks of the game (D2A still haunts me).\n\nMain complaint from pretty much everyone was the combat, some of which is genuinely fair. For instance, heat actions (blue and red gauge ones) do a lot of damage to henchmen, but barely any to boss fights. I understand why it was done like so, but it defeats the purpose of the red heat moves (for context red heat moves are meant to do a lot more damage than blue ones). So it becomes a lot more tedious than necessary.

This game was no disappointment, and continues the pretty amazing theme of the yakuza games, as well as being able to evoke emotions just as well as the previous installments. \n\nAs I stated before, the story of Yakuza 3 is great. I feel like it did an amazing job of allowing the player to create solid bonds and attachments to the other characters, especially that parental connection between Kiryu and the kids at his orphanage, and that brotherly bond with Rikiya. I thought at this point in the Yakuza series I would have experienced so many emotions through Kiryu, like his genuine happiness, sadness, or anger, that I would grow numb to it. Again, I was dead wrong, and Yakuza 3 accomplished all three of those for me once again. \n\nOne thing I would like to especially address is the combat system for Yakuza 3. One of the main complaints I have seen for Yakuza 3 is that its combat system is lacking compared to its predecessors, or that people just straight up can't put up with it. I personally think it is too easy to just compare Yakuza 3's combat to 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 just because they are so great, but on its own Yakuza 3's combat system was bearable to me, and honestly wasn't bad at all. To be absolutely fair, yes I do prefer and more enjoyed 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2's combat gameplay, but I also appreciated Yakuza 3's combat system in its own way. I truly hope that the combat system alone isn't what turns people away from this game, because those who do skip Yakuza 3 are missing out on a pretty amazing continuation of Kiryu's story. \n\nTLDR: I absolutely do recommend for the story alone, and once again I look forward to the next chapter, Yakuza 4 Remastered.", "timestamp_created": 1660383974, "timestamp_updated": 1660383974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120541922": {"recommendationid": "120541922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266208280", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 7162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5940, "last_played": 1689362535}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Que juegazo, aunque no se den la tarea de tratar de completar todas las subhistorias porque es un dolor de huevos", "timestamp_created": 1660373930, "timestamp_updated": 1660373930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120470374": {"recommendationid": "120470374", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978153177", "num_games_owned": 893, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1356, "last_played": 1659756919}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR, Yakuza 3 suffers from some at times abysmally bad pacing, enemies block too much ESPECIALLY in the remastered version, and there are some DUMB pulls in the plot.\nThat said, it's in my top 3 favorites of the whole franchise, as much as I think they should be optional the stuff with Kiryu's kids is adorable and provides a really fun alternate perspective to watch him through, and Ryukyu is one of the absolute comfiest video game towns I've ever explored, bar none.\n\nSo, most of my problems with this game specifically lie with this specific port. Optimization is awful, load times take way longer than they SHOULD for how small these maps are, and... the Big One, because the game's framerate was increased from 30 to 60 FPS, Kiryu's quickstep is pitifully useless. The first two can't be easily solved, but you can find a patch on Yakuza 3's nexusmods page to (mostly) restore his quickstep to its original PS3 form.\n\nYou'll probably find yourself tempted to skip

But it has some serious heart and contains a microcosm of the Yakuza series themes. \n\n[h1]Is It Worth Playing?[/h1]\nYakuza 3 is honestly pretty skippable. While the story advances and some important stuff happens to characterize Kiryu further, it is self-contained, having no direct consequences.\nAddressing the elephant in the room:\nYakuza 3 is the oldest \"original\" game on Steam. It is a remaster but not a remake. Many players start Yakuza 3 after having played Yakuza Kiwami 2. And this is the single largest time difference within the series between two chronological titles (on Steam):\nYakuza Kiwami 2 is a modern dragon engine game from 2017.\nYakuza 3 is PS3 title from 2009.\nRyu Ga Gotoku studios is a fast learner, and each entry improved massively in terms of quality. The exception is maybe Yakuza 6, as it was the first dragon engine to be released and shows clear signs of being rushed.\nYakuza 3 is the poster boy of the series for any growing pains.\n\n[h1]Problem List[/h1]\nYakuza 3 has the single worst combat of any not remaked Yakuza. Enemies block too much, making battle too long to be enjoyable. Consider that damage in Yakuza 3 is relatively low: Most attacks are not impactful, leading to tiger drop and parry spam. \nEven worse: Both skills have to be unlocked, and entire boss fights become unplayable without them.\nI can not stress how underwhelming most boss fights are and how many random battles become a chore.\nImprovable and unfinished is a theme that permeates all facets of Yakuza 3. Minigames are not working to such a degree that players have to cheese many activities to reach a win:\nBilliard and darts are barely functional because of an oversensitivity bound to the right joystick. Do not even get me started on bowling. The margin of error is utterly ridiculous. \nAnd mahjong...\nMahjong remained the same. Still, it pisses me off.\nEven karaoke has some questionable design choices:\nWhy do new verses have instant button presses?\n\n[h1]The Good Stuff(aka story)[/h1]\nYakuza 3 ties many of the themes together and showcases Kiryus softer side. His stoicism has become a famous quality of his character. \nYet Yakuza 3 shows him at his most vulnerable and directly ties it to interact with the orphans he is raising. It is controversial for Yakuza fans how much time Yakuza 3 \"wastes\" on these orphans.\nI agree that they are annoying, especially on subsequent playthroughs. But when Yakuza 3 hits its respective highs, it sets the bar high.\nAnd they are a part of it. Kiryu is a good guy who chose a bad hand.\nHad he given up on being a Yakuza like was told him in the past, he would not have had to endure so many hardships. \nBut when does a human earn absolution?\nYakuza 3 has an answer to this problem:\n[spoiler]It does not matter if someone has earned absolution. \nOne mistake can and sometimes will haunt your life and penetrate every aspect. There are only some moments we get to decide what kind of person we want to be.[/spoiler]\nMaking Kiryu a vulnerable human is the single greatest achievement of Yakuza 3 and impossible to overstate. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nYakuza 3 is objectively a worse title than any other Yakuza title on Steam (as of writing this review in 2022), maybe even including Streets of Kamarucho.\nBut it contains story segments of the Yakuza series that have payoff unique to this game and makes me sincerely happy to have pushed through.\n\n[quote=author]\nAs of now, meme curators dominate Steam.

Definitely don't skip this one if you're playing the series. But if you're going for 100% completion, it's a different story.\n\nYakuza 3 has the unenviable distinction of being the oldest Yakuza game you need to play to finish the series, since 1 and 2 were remade (Kiwami 1/2). So while the really crusty PS2 entries get upgraded to the Yakuza 5/6 engine, Yakuza 3 is still just an early-generation PS3 game. If you play the Yakuza series in chronological order, the games tend to improve on the technical details as you go from Y0 to YK1 to YK2; then you hit Y3 and turn back the clock by 8 years. It's a really difficult adjustment. Everything is worse: the graphics, the combat, the controls, the minigames, everything. Not really its fault, it's just...a much older and less refined game.\n\nThe combat stands out as especially bad. Enemies hold guard and refuse to attack--some for 30 seconds at a time, some forever. I've seen a few old heads talking about how the new games have lost their way, how Y3 is so much more sophisticated...nonsense. It's just stiff, slow, and broken. Kiryu drops objects after getting hit once, and takes 5 seconds to pick anything up, so they're useless in a tough fight. Half the enemies are un-grabbable, mashing out instantly, which makes it actually impossible to break their blocks. Especially in the coliseum, the only move that matters is the ever-broken Tiger Drop. Speaking of...the coliseum. No other word for it: just pure CBT.\n\nThe experience of \"immersion\" is also much worse in Y3. (Maybe I'm just spoiled by YK2, but, that's the point!) Rather than randomly generating NPCs dynamically, there is a library of maybe 30 fixed character models that get reused everywhere. It's very common to spot identical NPCs walking next to each other--a glitch in the matrix, maybe? Further, the NPCs that might aggro you are a small, fixed subset. The fat guy with the ugly red/white/blue shirt with the black christmas tree on it? 80% chance he wants to fight. Black guy carrying a guitar case? 0% chance, ever. Also, when you pan the camera to turn a corner, the street is always completely empty. Then the NPCs start to fade in over the course of 5-10 seconds. It's super noticeable and distracting.\n\nEven the controls are messed up. It's impossible to get Kiryu to run in a straight line; instead, he swerves left and right all the time unless you're at 1.0 cardinal. I think it's this same glitch that makes pool unplayable without using some bizarro claw grip to keep the analog stick [i] perfectly [/i] centered.\n\nI'm also really missing the \"completion list\" system of games past. Now, instead of using 20/40/60/80 different heat moves to tick boxes and finish the list, you have to use every single heat move (and craft every single piece of equipment). It's much more hard-core. I can see the appeal, I guess, but it's also way more tedious and made the march to 100% turn into a total slog towards the end. The scavenger hunt for crafting items for weapons I will never use was just stupid, as was roaming the map for an hour waiting for a random encounter with a sword-wielding enemy (~2% chance?) so that I could use a specific heat action that requires the enemy to have a sword.\n\nSome of the minigames are total misses. The create-a-hostess one comes to mind: pick random dress-up items, go out on the floor and get totally ignored because you are so unfashionable, randomize outfit and repeat until you randomly find a decent setup. Good luck doing that without a guide! Maybe if you do linear algebra for fun. The hitman missions are total, absolute filler. And I already mentioned about pool...\n\nEven after grinding for 100% completion, I still never finished leveling up Kiryu. Just seems like they didn't bother to balance the XP rewards vs requirements at all. No idea how long it would take to XP grind 2 more levels, but after finishing all the substories and the coliseum...why even bother?\n\nThere are still some positives. The substories are definitely more creative, interesting, and funny compared to YK2, and even more so compared to YK1. It makes sense--the writing is the one thing that didn't get \"remade\" in the Kiwamis. The plot is over-complicated, sappy, and predictable--yeah, that's right, it's a Yakuza video game plot. The bits at Morning Glory are a nice change of pace, but don't forget about all the other crap that happens along the way. (Or, maybe you did forget?) Still doesn't hold a candle to Y0 in either department.\n\nAnd I have to give credit, the new location is genuinely great. You can really feel the different pace of the Sotenbori compared to Kamurocho. It's smaller and a bit gentler overall, somehow, which fits the intended vibe perfectly. Maybe that's the one part of this game that's aged gracefully.\n\nSo should you play this game? Honestly...yes you should. Whether you're playing the Yakuza series for the plot (???) or you're already on the 100% train like I am, it doesn't make sense to skip Y3 or to stop here. I'm sure it gets better from here on, right?

The weakest part for the story would have to be it's pacing, it feels too short, it feels about the length of a DLC Story mode, let alone an entire game, but the short pace still gives one of the best Yakuza stories to date. The voice work is great, especially the somewhat corny English voice acting, but Kiryu's VA absolutely gives what I believe is his best performance so far/since, with  [spoiler] Rikiya's Death [/spoiler], the guy you see as being the coolest sunuvabitch, gives one of the most emotional and heart-wrenching performances of all time, this time, Kiryu doesn't feel like a cool guy to insert yourself in, but an actual character.\n\nNow to get back to the game and not the story, time to tackle the most controversial parts of the game: The Combat, and I'll be honest, it's not the best combat in the series, but I do think that it's not as bad as people say. Yes the blocking is a problem, but there are multiple solutions to stop it, to me the worst part was all the bosses who stun-lock you, and the gun users in the later parts of the game, [b] those [/b] are the worst part of the game, not the blocking. Other than that, the combat is solid, and given that this is my first time experiencing Kiryu's Dragon Style for the rest of the series, it does a good job at getting me used to a moveset I'm sure I'll get antiquated with for the rest of the series. Honestly, the only part of the game that I really hate is how wonky the camera controls are, but given that this is a remaster rather than a remake, I'm willing to give it a pass.\n\nI'm going to avoid giving reviews to the substories and the extra content because A. They aren't as important as the main story, but are solid, and B. I didn't do most of the minigames.\n\nAnd so, this game isn't as horrible as people say it is, but it isn't some hidden gem of the Yakuza series that people are overlooking, it's a solid game, that most people have trouble with. 8/10, would recommend, but wouldn't play again.", "timestamp_created": 1658356407, "timestamp_updated": 1659491370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119145006": {"recommendationid": "119145006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981190280", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1041, "last_played": 1658871594}, "language": "english", "review": "holding block the entire game/10", "timestamp_created": 1658333768, "timestamp_updated": 1658333768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119140315": {"recommendationid": "119140315", "author": {"steamid": "76561199274211061", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1074, "last_played": 1658328546}, "language": "english", "review": "Ora Ora Ora Ora Ora Ora Ora Ora!!!", "timestamp_created": 1658328571, "timestamp_updated": 1686780781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119137151": {"recommendationid": "119137151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050349828", "num_games_owned": 750, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 855, "last_played": 1658324501}, "language": "english", "review": "Story good.

Also, to address the elephant in the room, this is probably the worst that combat gets in the series.\n\n\nWith all of that out of the way though, I would still absolutely recommend the game.\nWhile the combat may be a bit iffy \u2014 especially if you have just come from playing 0 or the Kiwami games \u2014 it doesn't take too long to get used too, and once you start to build up your collection of special moves and combos through levelling I'd argue it's not even an issue (and you can get to that point pretty early game trust me). For what it's worth I actually found myself really enjoying the combat as per usual once I had a few good moves in my arsenal.\n\nAlso, if you happen to play this game and find yourself getting tired of running around doing errands in Okinawa, I heavily advise you to see it through a bit longer, as I myself happened to put the game down for almost a year just before finishing the intro section because I had gotten bored, but once I returned to it I felt like I was playing a whole new game. If you dislike the intro then don't worry, the game immediately increases in quality once it's done (and I mean immediately).\n\nIn summary:\n- Please do play game, and while it may be a bit slower at first, it gets incredible pretty abruptly and early on.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1658125258, "timestamp_updated": 1658125258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118964489": {"recommendationid": "118964489", "author": {"steamid": "76561199146215893", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3070, "last_played": 1664523927}, "language": "english", "review": "Hmm Mine and Daigo yaoi", "timestamp_created": 1658074065, "timestamp_updated": 1694710002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118948248": {"recommendationid": "118948248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055181574", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 206, "playtime_forever": 3487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3487, "last_played": 1658048047}, "language": "english", "review": "Its hard to rate Yakuza 3. If you played the previous 3 games (0,1,2) then you probably should play this game just to experience the story and the progression of Kiryu as a character. The story is still pretty important and its still pretty fun even if there are a bit too many bait and switches with the story beats. The characters in the story are enjoyable and I especially really liked the main villain of the game. But the story alone is not enough to make me forget the horrible time I had with so many other parts of the game.\n\nThe combat in this game is infamous and after playing for like 3 hours you will notice why. The enemies block everything, compared to Kiwami 2 its a LOT more boring mechanically. Not only that but it seems like enemies are designed to waste your time, they will be in spots where its impossible to avoid them and their attacks will constantly knock you down or stun you. Its horrible and this is the first yakuza game where I actively would avoid the gameplay part of the game. The rewards you get for fighting in this game are laughable and the time wasted feels horrible.\n\nIn general if you are coming off of Kiwami 2 then this game will really give you a rough wake up that this is a PS 3 game. EVERYTHING feels slower, walking from location to location, finding substories, playing mini games, even something as small as going through the menu is for some reason slightly slower. All those quality of life features from the recent games are not present and result in a drag of a game to play.\n\nI have to give special mention to Bowling and the Hostess side activities. To get all Substories you have to score 200 points on bowling, romance 10 girls and raise 1 girl to perfection. I kid you not that I might have spent like 50 % of my time just on these horrible mini games. Thats 12 substories that take like 25 hours to complete. Bowling for some reason has some of the wonkiest physics in the entire game and the hostess mini game takes like 10 x longer compared to all the previous iterations without any of the mini games the previous games provided as a break in between. It makes you want to pull out your hair in boredom. I enjoy getting 100 % substories and fighting the Amon fights at the end of the yakuza games, that makes it all the more frustrating that I can't skip these terrible parts of the game.\n\nBut alright thats enough complaining. There are some things the game does well besides the story. The game introduces 3 new things which are pretty fun, there is a new running mini game where you chase people. I really enjoyed this and constantly looked forward to seeing what parkour courses the game would throw at me. The 2nd new thing is that Kiryu is now blog posting which allows him to learn new moves, its a really funny way of learning new moves and maybe one of my favorite new additions to the game. Most of the substories are fine with the few exceptions I mentioned. The chase substories in particular are quite fun and there are also some substories which are part of the main story which also usually are pretty fun. \n\nThe last new thing I have to mention is huge, a new location. From the start of the game you play in a completely new location with new people. Welcome to Okinawa, its a really nice change of pace from Kamurocho and Soutenburi. I think practically all the best substories are tied to this new location and its a joy to explore and learn more of the differences in cultures compared to the previous locations. Its nice having a relaxing location and exploring Kiryu not as a yakuza or how he deals with the yakuza, but instead looking at how he deals with situations where he can't just solve everything with violence. He now works at an orphanage. Raising kids is hard and I am happy to see they at least somewhat represented the constant internal anguish on what to do in Kiryus character during the game.\n\nLike I said I thought Yakuza 3 was a hard game for me to review. Its enjoyable and can be finished really fast if you want it to, if it was purely that I would absolutely recommend this game. But I am looking at this from a gameplay perspective and a substory completionist perspective and from that vantage point I would not recommend this game at all. As it stands I would only recommend this for people who just want to play more Yakuza and want to see where the story goes after Yakuza 2. I sadly can't recommend this as an action RPG.", "timestamp_created": 1658049831, "timestamp_updated": 1658051224, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543189346790313721", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118937067": {"recommendationid": "118937067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039139160", "num_games_owned": 954, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1658023646}, "language": "english", "review": "DISCLAIMER: I only played as far as chapter 5 and my experience is based on hard mode \n\nYakuza 3 is a truly miserable experience. Every single review talking about how each and every enemy in the game blocks every single one of your attacks from the front is true. And their blocking ability is pretty much absolute. Can't break that. But Yakuza fans will probably tell you to just get good and quickstep around enemies so that you can attack their backs. Too bad that the quickstep in this game moves you about a millimeter to the side while locking you into its animation for about a second and thus is incredibly ineffective. And even if you manage to hit a boss in the back in this game, Kiryus damage output is pathetic. His attacks truly just tickle bosses in this game and he has never felt this weak.\n\"But have you tried grabbing the enemies?\" Sure, while that is a way to deal with the constant blocking, it doesn't improve the gameplay. If the optimal way to play a game is to staple a dipping bird toy to a specific button on my controller, I'd rather not play the game at all.\n\nOkay, so the combat is terrible but if you are playing the Yakuza series, chances are, you are probably here to experience the story. Well, I've got bad news. Even that isn't very exciting. [spoiler] We've got mysterious guys in black suits with sunglasses as bad guys again, foreigners (and are probably gonna fight the chinese mafia AGAIN),\nand according to a cutscene early on, the main villain is a guy with a dragon tattoo... AGAIN. Bla, bla, there can only be one dragon and all that. Come on Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, this is the third time (if you started with 0) that you are bringing a guy with a dragon tattoo as a final boss to class to pull the whole only one dragon shtick again. It's getting really old. [/spoiler]\nSome new and likeable characters get introduced in this part of the series but if they only get used to retread the same old plot threads from previous games, meshed together in a very slightly different way than the last time around, then their potential as characters is just getting wasted.\n\nI really liked the Yakuza series up until now and even learned Mahjong to be able to deal with its minigames, but this game made me want to stop playing the series and maybe return to it at a later point since it just does not feel good to play and experience at all.

Especially as Kiryu being a man of his caliber would have seen it coming a mile away. \n\nThe game controls feel quite cumbersome when using a keyboard and I had to cap the FPS to 30 to stop the game running in high speed mode so if the game runs too choppy and erratic on modern graphics cards then please set the FPS to 30 as it will run stable then. \n\nAs for the AI, the AI seems to be lacking the quantum setup with around 96% guard that forces the player to use guard break and counter attacks. It had more randomness to it on the other games in this series. One the latter boss missions without mods is another frustration as the damage ratio is way too low and being able to block Kiryu hitting him with a sofa should still take damage when it strikes. Sadly there is a lack of finesse that the previous Yakuza games I have covered have and I would only recommend this if you want the whole collection like me. \n\nIts an experience for me and personally I think the storyline should have been better thought out.

Never mind the pittance of exp that they give!\n\nThe leveling is also a problem I find. the game is not shy about asking for a huge amount of exp to get one skill or health boost. but than rewards at most 10 points for a substory and no useful reward besides maybe a plate or some crafting material. \n\nThe worst offender of heel dragging is chapters 2-4 and 10, where the game just stops and drags for several hours to establish the character of each of Kiryu's kids and the local Yakuza of Okinawa. Which of course, I didn't mind for some of it, it was inevitable that Kiryu would be allowed to have some time to just be a dad or a friend to Okinawa's people... but 3 chapters dedicated to extremely mundane main quests and even more mundane sub story after sub story killed the pace of a story that has not even had time to start! \n\nAnd worse, returning to Okinawa for Chapter 10, they double dip for what could have easily been a sub story in itself! \n\nI reiterate: I love the story, I love the combat, and I love (some) sub stories. But the game is marred down so much by content that should have been left to sub stories!\n\nAlso fuck the trust system! It's just tedious grinding for items with no in world pay off. Rikiya's tourist visit through Kamurocho was a far better trust story than whatever that ungodly meter game is.\n\nPlay the game for the story, do sub stories if you feel under powered.

as much 'good weird' as any other entry in the franchise, but sadly, it also packs more 'bad weird' than others too. Coming to this one after Yakuza 0, Kiwami 1 and Kiwami 2 feels like an obvious stepdown. To begin with, this is a remaster, not a remake, and after Kiwami 2's stunning Dragon engine, the graphics this time feel quite dated and janky. \n\nAll of the above would be forgivable if there weren't massive pacing problems with the plot. The main story is far more ridiculous and over the top than ever before, but that's okay, its a Yakuza game after all. But the way that plot unravels: slow at first, then with breakneck speed, then coming to lurching halt, then dumping an enormous and boring information on your head before returning back to its careening fall to the ending. That is to say, it is insufferably bad. It has been so bad in fact, that I put the game down midway and picked it up after what was, essentially, a whole year.\n\nThere are nice things here too. The two sides of Kiryu, one of staunch and respected mafia, and other, the loving and caring fatherly figure overlap creating an unexpected amount of character growth, but ultimately, the story takes over with its sillyness. All the fun that a standard Yakuza game offers is here too, but considering the overall setting, it feels tacked on. There is an option to pursue all those activities after the events of the game have transpired, but I just can't care enough to go in the game again after I have put it down.\n\nIn summary, this is a poor title, both in the Yakuza series and as a game in general.\n5/10, Buy it only if you are a Yakuza fan and want to see Kiryu's story pan out.\n", "timestamp_created": 1656783693, "timestamp_updated": 1656783847, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512976646423339844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118019735": {"recommendationid": "118019735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303987356", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2163, "last_played": 1663196054}, "language": "english", "review": "Still love the funny eye patch man, Mine is hot", "timestamp_created": 1656709739, "timestamp_updated": 1656709739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118014331": {"recommendationid": "118014331", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087840373", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1164, "last_played": 1676037171}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay this game has probably the hardest and annoying fighting,the enemies always blocking means mashing the grab button on my poor controller coz ofc they will struggle,plus the ai will immediately start blocking again and this is on normal difficulty i have no idea how people can play this on legend since it requires more than patience,with that huge con out of the way as a yakuza fan getting to know the story is always a plus but if u were to play this randomly not recommended lol coz of the combat but the story is decent and playing the game seems kinda worthwhile if u get it on sale,imo this game needed a remake not remaster.

The title that sparks debate amongst every Yakuza fan who has played the entire series. The title that first introduced the mold of the modern Yakuza game by adding karaoke among other extra minigames, the game that gave us the first dynamic intro in the history of Yakuza games, and the title that first employed the use of face capture to give us the iconic faces of Kiryu and Majima that we know of today. \n\nI'll start with the story. Story is overall really good or really bad depending on how you see the orphanage sections of the story. For context, you will spend entire chapters purely on taking care of the kids in Morning Glory and being a proper father figure to them. A lot of people have been complaining about how these specific parts of the story are dragging and completely uninteresting, but personally I actually love these parts. It shows us another part of Kiryu that's usually not too noticeable in the other games, his compassion. It's hard to imagine the same guy who was roughing up delinquents in the streets of Kamurocho cry over cut onions in a dish he's making for his kids. But the game gives us exactly that and further emphasizes that underneath that big, burly structure with a dragon tattoo, he's human and has emotions (ignoring his physical capabilities at least). Whether those sections are a big turn off for you or not, they did a pretty good job at delving deeper into the character that is Kazuma Kiryu. The characters that are introduced here are really fleshed out and the villains have a menacing aura that's unique to each one of them. The final boss is a very well done antithesis to Kiryu this time around (they even have opposing tattoos!). [spoiler]Mine[/spoiler] is a work of art in terms of video game villains. My nitpicks about this would probably be how one villain was underutilized considering his introduction cutscene and another character that could have made Kiryu and Haruka grow even more was completely written off within the first chapter and shipped off to the Land of the Free. Other than that, story's as solid as the rest of the series.\n\nNow onto the most controversial part of the game, the combat. Now this is something that's undeniably a flaw in the game and it alone could and should warrant a Kiwami 3. I'm not sure about the lower difficulties but on Hard, everyone (AND I MEAN EVERYONE) has the reaction speed of a fly when it comes to blocking your moves. You quite literally cannot start an offensive against any enemy, even the common street thug, coz of that sole reason. To top it all off, they actually had to nerf the quickstep distance in order to keep up with the increased frame rates the Remastered collection gives ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/yakuza3remastered/mods/22]not to worry though, as there is an appropriate mod that restores it[/url]. Heat actions deal a lot less damage than it's supposed to. There's this one fight with budget Majima where he quicksteps 24/7, only stopping to attack you (real big pain tbh, I decided to give up the fight midway coz of that). Early game combat becomes a real bore real quick not gonna lie, thankfully once you unlock the 3 Komaki moves combat actually becomes decent enough to play through. There's also the underlying problem of the chase mechanic which is just as much of a sucker punch till you get the upgrades. Later titles at least made it a lot more enticing. Overall combat is pretty bad till you unlock the Komaki Parry, after that it becomes decent.\n\nMinigames and Substories can be pretty unpolished at times. This was where Karaoke was first introduced and frankly the songs are pretty forgettable. Fishing is a lot harder compared to later titles. Some of the substories aren't exactly worth doing at times and a lot of them are tied behind the minigames. There isn't exactly a \"Be My Baby\" one in terms of how much it stands out from the rest. They might have been eye catching back in 2009 when the game was first released, but now they pretty much pale in comparison to the rest of the series' substories. Graphics will be a major problem if you played Kiwami 2 before this, but you'll get used to it as it isn't that bad. Soundtrack is one of it's stronger points in terms of the experience. Still has traces of that grungeness that was prominent in the first 2 games so if you're not into distortioned guitars it will be a con for you (I'm loving it tho). Bottom line, they haven't exactly aged well but the music slaps. \n\nThat's pretty much my take on the game known as Blocku- I mean, Yakuza 3. Sluggish combat paired with a very rich character-building story with a dash of outdated substories and karaoke. Some continuity errors will persist if you played Y:LAD first, but the experience can be slightly enjoyable once you get the hang of it.", "timestamp_created": 1656345711, "timestamp_updated": 1656345711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117723873": {"recommendationid": "117723873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022039649", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1657367144}, "language": "english", "review": "Best dad simulator", "timestamp_created": 1656336826, "timestamp_updated": 1656336826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117711156": {"recommendationid": "117711156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110108184", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1656333113}, "language": "english", "review": "Yakuza: Babysitter\n\nstory: 4/10\ngraphics: 3/10\nsoundtrack: 6/10\ngame play: 4/10\ncombat: 4/10\nover all: 3.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1656320153, "timestamp_updated": 1656333074, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117700451": {"recommendationid": "117700451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190382517", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1352, "last_played": 1656302818}, "language": "english", "review": "sad", "timestamp_created": 1656302830, "timestamp_updated": 1656302830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117651135": {"recommendationid": "117651135", "author": {"steamid": "76561199057385402", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1658300032}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10 can't date a black guy", "timestamp_created": 1656248094, "timestamp_updated": 1656248106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117603696": {"recommendationid": "117603696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066009424", "num_games_owned": 1109, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1112, "last_played": 1656276227}, "language": "english", "review": "Anyone that says that they enjoy this game is lying to you.

The difficulty curve between fighting regular chumps and bosses is a vertical line, and that is the result of bad game design and you will never convince me otherwise.\n\nMini games are bad or outright broken because of the stick sensitivity.\n\nThe story is no great shakes either.

Some people have said it was the worst in the series, some people said they liked it or had mixed feelings, and some people just couldn't get into the graphics. Having fought my way through three games prior, I finally got to play this little gem wanting to find out for myself. I honestly believe this series is very well structured and a blast to play, and I have nothing but great things to say about it so the only logical game to review, if any, would be this one.\n\nAlthough it didn't have a lot going for it graphically I would go as far as to say Yakuza 3 had some of my favorite combat mechanics out of all four games thus far. It's a lot more methodical and the abilities you learn feel much more rewarding. It was less about smashing square and triangle and more about countering the enemy or finding unique ways to use your heat. It struck me as everything a game should be. Having consistently played Yakuza on hard mode, I expect the need to utilize every tool at my disposal. If I have to do that then it's a pass. Of course, the game got easier, but that's what being rewarded for putting in the time is all about. Every point spent and skill chosen creates more possibilities and better improves Kiryu from faster attack speed to much-needed heat moves, and those heat executions are wild. Most importantly, you [i]feel[/i] the strength as you gain skills and new methods become accessible. 3 begins very slowly, but the ramp feels smooth and fun.\n\nI think the story is strong. It has shoddy parts but all of the themes that it presents definitely circle back around and the symbolism is on point. The kids are symbolic, and you get to know the family as Kiryu's struggle continues. Some of it is too on the nose though, like [spoiler]Joji. He's a copy. Why.. ?[/spoiler]but I did like the antagonist(s) and thought some of them were comical. The heavy themes in this one are pretty brilliant.\n\nIt's very weak in the mini-game department for me. That's about all I have to say about that. I found myself spending hardly any time on mini-games this go around.\n\nIt's a shame that this didn't get the Kiwami treatment because I think it could have been incredible if it did. Either way, Yakuza 3 brings something a little more old-fashioned to the table and fits comfortably in the series with its own unique and classic style.\n\nI appreciated this and look forward to the next.\nAs always, thanks for the game.", "timestamp_created": 1655094459, "timestamp_updated": 1655211720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116840411": {"recommendationid": "116840411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092345605", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1265, "last_played": 1677230771}, "language": "english", "review": "It sucks", "timestamp_created": 1654989837, "timestamp_updated": 1654989837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571253478527069092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116775591": {"recommendationid": "116775591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344282550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1584, "last_played": 1653108304}, "language": "english", "review": "4k ultra hd date graphics", "timestamp_created": 1654881362, "timestamp_updated": 1654881362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116769996": {"recommendationid": "116769996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269115318", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 897, "last_played": 1654871806}, "language": "english", "review": "So many people call this the worst one of the series, and in my opinion if this game is the worst that the Yakuza series has to offer, then it's actually a good thing. So first off, let me just say that this game is definitely not as bad as a lot of people may lead you to believe. I do agree that it's the worst one, and I'll get into the flaws later. But no way in hell is this game a skip.\n\nOne thing is for sure, I really do wish this was Yakuza Kiwami 3. The main problem with this game is that it suffers from being the \"revolutionary\" game in the series. It was the first game making the jump to the PS3, and it did a whole lot of stuff for the first time ever. The minigames that are one of the most iconic parts of the series? Yep, started in this game. The problem is that you can tell that these are very early, unpolished minigames. Honestly I was pretty disappointed when I saw like 8 karaoke songs, and only 1 you sing yourself. I've heard all sorts of complaints about the mechanics in other games such as pool, I didn't try them myself but keep that in mind. Long story short, remaking this game and modernizing all of its side game mechanics would've helped a lot.\n\nNow about the most controversial part of the game, the combat. It doesn't seem all that bad, up until you get to boss fights. At that point it's such a slog, you hit for no damage, the boss doesn't even hit that hard either. Yeah there will be a lot of blocking from the enemies. Regular/non boss fights are still the same fun as before, but maybe avoid the coliseum as they follow the same boss fight damage properties. The upgrade system is bang average, not bad but I think that it lacks the efficient/not totally unbearable exp grind that Kiwami had in Majima Everywhere. Honestly revelations are pretty cool and a funny way to get surprisingly useful moves. \n\nOnto the story. One of the issues I had with this game was how long the filler orphanage sections were. The first 4 (!) chapters are almost entirely spent doing mindless chores in Okinawa. Then, when the plot and conflict start to heat up, you get smacked in the face with another random filler section. Ignore those parts and I actually really enjoyed this story. The new characters introduced such as the Ryudo people are great. Yoshitaka Mine is probably my favorite villain of the series so far, his character is just really dope and I like the integrity and respect that makes him stand out from some of the other bad guys in this series. One thing though, without getting too spoilery, the last scene makes absolutely no sense. At all. It's like the writers wanted to have some shock value in the story but realized that the conflict is supposed to be over, so they took some shots and then wrote whatever came to mind. Serves no purpose to the story, just leave you incredibly confused as the credits roll.\n\nAnyways, I'd still recommend this game to those of you playing along through the series like I am. It's alright to play it like how I did, speeding through and skipping almost everything besides the main story. Usually I like to go through at least maybe 50-70% of the substories but knowing that this is the worst game I didn't. For one last note, get tiger drop as fast as you can. This is the game where it's easiest to land, you can get it relatively quick, and overall just makes the boss fights a lot more bearable.

Attack whiffing and wall bounding are your most essential tools, and if you're reading this, I urge you to learn these two techniques. Attack whiffing especially will help the game be less 'Blockuza 3', and make sure to get your Revelations and spec into the Tech tree to help you acquire moves that make the combat more fluid.

Only played like 150-200 hours; the rest was me being AFK. This is the first game in the series that I won't be getting 100% completion in. This is strictly because pool functions terribly and the Coliseum requires you to fight hundreds of matches to get all the modding materials. I don't like this game that much to waste my life trying to do those things.\n\nOverall, the story was good, but the gameplay was meh.  For some reason, Kiryu can't walk straight. I presume that's also the issue with pool-- the stick sensitivity is way too high and slightly off-center when going straight up or down. The fighting was very bare-bones. Do a combo, block their attack. Do a combo, block their attack. Grab them, throw them, then do a heat move. Every fight is like that in this game; it's as boring to do the millionth time as I'm sure it is to read me typing it out.\n\nHaruka's Trust is another thing I didn't finish because it's honestly shocking how good at certain minigames you have to be. I've literally never seen someone get 3000 batting, 9 strikes in bowling, 1500 in Near-Pin, or any of the other SSS tier challenges. It's not tied to a trophy so why bother? Plus, the other aforementioned stuff that makes it so I can't Platinum it anyways.\n\nAlso, early PS3 models on current gen hardware/software is terrifying, but that's just me. It's very Uncanny Valley at times. They're like porcelain people.\n\nAnd something weird happens to the game if you alt+tab out of it, or close it in any way without hard quitting the application. The menus start scrolling endlessly and the minigames with aiming mechanics don't function. By menus, I mean literally everything. The pause menu, dialog choices, emails, your inventory... It's really weird. The only fix is to save and exit, or to settle for being out of control in most menus. Don't open the controls display, either; I did that and the inability to control it got me stuck in that menu. \n\n\nEDIT: I also just realized I never got the 30 completed substories achievement?? I have the substory completion achievement so I don't know why I wouldn't have the prerequisite achievement...\n\nI'd give it a 6/10. Not great, but don't skip it either.

I just found it boring and uninteresting.\n\nBlockuza. The mobs in this game block so much that it made the combat which is usually painless, very painful on this one. The legend mode was easier once I got the golden pistol though, total cake walk. Minus those damn running scenes which I swear would be the end of me.\n\nI would still recommend this game, because the Yakuza games are probably the best series of games I've ever played, but just beware that this one is the most annoying, but, Majima makes an appearance, so, that helps a little.\n\nFinally, and the reason I'm allowing comments.. I swear to God when this game was released there was an achievement that said I had to 100% completion the game like 0, 1 and 2. so..I did that. But I got burnt out and didn't come back until a year later and now that achievement is gone.

It is not a bad game, i can however say, it is the weakest game of all the Yakuza's till I have played right now.\n\nEdit- Really disliked the hostess gameplay they did. It was so boring, didnt even bother doing it unlike the previous games\n\n\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610

Pero vamos por partes.\n\n[h2]Gr\u00e1ficos[/h2]\nLa saga Yakuza nunca se hab\u00eda visto tan mal. Okey, no se ve tan tan mal, es bastante jugable y con sus momentos que se ve bien, pero se siente bastante esa bajada gr\u00e1fica. Pasar de Kiwami 2, con su motor nuevecico a esto, uf... Cuesta un poco acostumbrarse a esto, sobre todo a ese modelado de Kiryu que parece sacado de Roblox.\nY probablemente lo peor gr\u00e1ficamente hablando, sean algunas acciones de calor. Se ven muy cutres, los golpes en esas escenas no transmiten sensaci\u00f3n de fuerza.\n\n[h2]Historia[/h2]\nLa historia de este Yakuza es bastante rara. Est\u00e1 dividida en dos partes, la primera, la parte de Okinawa que es ver el nuevo estilo de vida de Kiryu que dura hasta el cuarto cap\u00edtulo. Y segunda parte, la vuelta a Kamurocho en el cap\u00edtulo cinco, en el que la historia principal comienza (y el juego acaba en el cap\u00edtulo doce).\n\nMi problema con esta historia, es que a duras penas es una historia hasta el cap\u00edtulo ocho. Tiene bastante relleno, y va lenta porque se pone a dar vueltas en c\u00edrculos porque no hay realmente mucho que contar. Y no me mal entend\u00e1is, a m\u00ed s\u00ed me ha gustado ver la nueva vida de Kiryu, pero creo que ese contenido podr\u00eda haber sido secundario, y haberlo expandido m\u00e1s, quitando misiones secundarias por estas (porque el juego tiene muchas secundarias ins\u00edpidas), y arreglando el hecho que una vez vuelves a Kamurocho, la magia de ser cuidador de ni\u00f1os en un orfanato se pierde.\n\nEmpieza con que el gobierno quiere expropiar a Kiryu de su orfanato para construir un centro militar y defender Jap\u00f3n [spoiler]cosa que no dura mucho, y se nos revela que era un plan para acabar con unos terroristas traficante de armas de EEUU.[/spoiler] mientas una guerra dentro del clan Tojo por usurpar el mandato empieza; cosa que fracasa r\u00e1pidamente y sin que hubiera apenas tensi\u00f3n, porque Kiryu claramente se pod\u00eda bajar a los tres se\u00f1ores intimidantes. Luego entra el misterioso hombre que se parece a Kazama (el juego intenta que creas que puede ser \u00e9l, pero venga ya: Si es \u00e9l es una mierda porque lo han revivido, y sino pues tambi\u00e9n, porque no cab\u00eda en la cabeza de nadie que siguiera vivo) [spoiler]es el jodido hermano de Kazama, y resulta que es de la CIA ni m\u00e1s ni menos. Parece sacado de un fanfic pero no[/spoiler].\n\nSin embargo, a partir del cap\u00edtulo ocho o nueve, es cuando la historia se pone buena, con un par de giros de trama y sin que los malos sean tan malos, siendo m\u00e1s interesante que la de Kiwami 2 (aunque el c\u00f3mo es bastante malo, porque es b\u00e1sicamente una cinem\u00e1tica de 30 minutos que te explican todo, as\u00ed, sin vaselina).\nEl cap\u00edtulo diez y unce son mayormente relleno, y el doce es pegarse y cr\u00e9ditos. [spoiler]No entiendo la muerte de Mine. No entiendo qu\u00e9 aporta que muera en vez de quedarse como personaje de la saga, porque ten\u00eda bastante potencial, y ni entiendo eso de hacerle una llave a un tipo y tirarte al vac\u00edo en vez de que Kiryu vaya a pegarle otra vez o aparezca el jodido hermano de Kazama que ni vuelve a aparecer ni hace nada.[/spoiler]\n\nLa historia es ef\u00edmeramente buena, y se nota mucho que este fue el primer juego donde los desarrolladores quer\u00edan darle m\u00e1s importancia a la historia. De hecho, si mir\u00e1is en How Long to Beat, ver\u00e9is que es el Yakuza con la historia principal m\u00e1s corta, y a eso hay que sumarle el relleno dicho y que la historia principal tarda horas en aparecer.\n\nY la escena final es una mierda absoluta que encima no aporta nada porque se resuelve con la escena post-cr\u00e9ditos.\n\n[h2]Minijuegos[/h2]\nPara m\u00ed de lo peor de esta entrega. Se nota eso que es el m\u00e1s viejo actualmente, porque quitando los dardos y el b\u00e9isbol (que los he disfrutado m\u00e1s aqu\u00ed que en las precuelas), son todos peores, o directamente una mierda (bolos y golf, cof cof).\nCada Yakuza suele tener dos minijuegos tochos, y este no es la excepci\u00f3n.\nPodemos pescar, en un punto concreto en el orfanato, usando anzuelo, anzuelo cuya cada unidad ocupa un espacio y solo se pueden conseguir compr\u00e1ndolos en la ciudad, y que el pescar no sirve para absolutamente nada salvo para ganar un poco de dinero.\nEl otro es el cabaret que... simplemente est\u00e1 destrozado. Tienes que dar una vuelta por el negocio, leer qu\u00e9 quieren los cliente, meterte en el vestidor, ver una gu\u00eda para saber qu\u00e9 accesorios suben qu\u00e9 atributos porque el juego no te lo dice y darte cuenta que la mitad est\u00e1 bloqueado por progresi\u00f3n as\u00ed que vas a hacerlo de pena como te pidan un estilo que no puedes maximizar, entrenarla con un alto porcentaje que no haga nada el entrenamiento, sacarla a pasear y as\u00ed en un ciclo sin fin. Me encant\u00f3 el cabaret de Kiwami 2, y ver esto es hasta doloroso.\n\n[h2]Jugabilidad[/h2]\nLa jugabilidad es b\u00e1sicamente la de Kiwami 2 en cuanto a los movimientos que puede realizar Kiryu pero con menos habilidades y menos habilidades interesantes. Lo que pasa es que el combate en esta entrega est\u00e1 roto.\n\nEn Yakuza 3, con cualquier combo puedes ejercer una presi\u00f3n bestial a cualquier enemigo, impidiendo que puedan actuar. Y como el estudio lo vio, decidieron hacer que los enemigos especiales (los importantes), bloqueasen como aunt\u00e9nticos cabrones para que no pudieras abusar de ellos. Es m\u00e1s, a\u00fan si quieres intentar encerrarles en un combo infinito no podr\u00e1s, porque tienen ataques imparables que te mandan a la mierda si no les dejas. Y peor, aqu\u00ed el calor se va con el tiempo, con cada golpe que recibas, y si est\u00e1s en el suelo o te agarran, puedes ir despidi\u00e9ndote de tu barra de calor, y encima los enemigos te pueden meter en un [i]stun lock[/i] que da bastante asco. Esto hace que los combates importantes sean muy zzz. Y si juegas as\u00ed el juego se te va a hacer una bola inmensa, as\u00ed que...\n\nResulta que en este Yakuza, Komaki aparece muy temprano, en el cap\u00edtulo cinco, d\u00e1ndote las dos habilidades parry de Yakuza. Ah amigo, aqu\u00ed es cuando el juego cambia y para bien. Ahora contra los enemigos especiales les podr\u00e1s jugar a esquivar y pegar (no suele salir bien), o matarlos a parry, cosa que cr\u00e9eme, quieres hacer. Quitas mucha vida, es divertido, te da mucho calor, y gusta el ver c\u00f3mo [i]cheesear[/i] esta mec\u00e1nica en los enemigos.\nEl problem\u00f3n aqu\u00ed es que para que parezca Komaki hay que hacer un par de secundarias medio escondidas, y a muchos nos ha pasado el dejarlas y desbloquear estas habilidades muy tarde.\n\nPor cierto, el inventario de este juego da mucho asco. Todos los objetos, salvo los que el juego considera clave, est\u00e1n en el mismo inventario peque\u00f1ito (curas, regalos, equipo, anzuelos, objetos para entregar).\n\n[h2]Resumen[/h2]\nHistoria ef\u00edmeramente buena, pareciendo m\u00e1s que una historia una ilustraci\u00f3n de c\u00f3mo es la vida de Kiryu ahora. Un combate m\u00e1s centrado en [i]cheesear[/i] enemigos con los parrys. Bastantes minijuegos malos. Y exceso de secundarias innecesarias.

However the combat isnt perfect, the enemies have a bad habit of snapping around when you manage to get behind them which punishes evading attacks as enemies will just block or worse continue a combo.\nThe plot of Yakuza 3 can feel like a garbaled mess at times and the story telling can feel unnatural as the game on multiple occasions dumps exposition on you as you have the plot of what happened between 2006 and 2009, character's motivations and identities, and whole conspiracies explained to you an tensionless and uninteresting way. \nHowever the unremarkable plot is held up by the lovable characters like Rikiya and haruka. \nMost Substories in Yakuza 3 take the grounded nature of Y1 and the more developed and lengthy stories of Y2 to create memorable substories like solving a murder case at cafe Alps or following the script for a samurai movie down to the heat action and order that the enemy samurai are killed. Other substories are available with Rikya and Haruka and are emotionally charged more than others, and feature the dysfunctional couple from yakuza 2 and rikya's childhood friend.\nYakuza 3's soundtrack is great it isn't overproduced like kiwami but isn't as simple as yakuza 1's striking a good balance\nIt isn't worth talking about graphically either.\nIf I were to give it a number out of 10 \nIt would have to be a 7 it would be 7.5 if kiryu could walk in a straight line \n", "timestamp_created": 1651011636, "timestamp_updated": 1651011636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54314720630645752", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114479519": {"recommendationid": "114479519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198804592809", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1080, "last_played": 1650830879}, "language": "english", "review": "Hot take : This Yakuza game is not bad.", "timestamp_created": 1650930109, "timestamp_updated": 1650930109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114464833": {"recommendationid": "114464833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267049028", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8448, "last_played": 1650953191}, "language": "english", "review": "I really want to like this game, especially after so many hours of gameplay, but I just can't. People say it is the worst of the series, and they are right. Fanboys huff my balls.\n\nDespite a somewhat decent storyline, pacing is really sloppy in certain areas (ie. being prompted by the game to go to the Okinawa airport, only to be pulled back to the orphanage twice for extremely mundane plot filler, and THEN FINALLY being able to go to Kamurocho)\n\nFights are a goddamn nightmare, even streetfights in late game when you have more skills. Heat action prompts only show up half the time despite fulfilling requirements, and even then, they do next to no damage. Parry doesn't work at all (R1 then B; I never got the prompt in the 100+ hours of playing) and blocking is useless because even street thugs immediately break through it and beat the shit out of you before you can even raise your arms again. Blocking doesn't even raise your heat like it does in other games, so what is the point in having the block if it never works? \nWeapon attacks are more useless than trying to use your fists to break through the enemy's guard (even weapons with high attack do next to no damage), so there's hardly any point in buying/modding weapons, or using them at all. \nGrabs only work a quarter of the time (even street thugs just push you off and stun you) and do hardly any damage when they do. So the only way you can do any damage AT ALL is to spam shitty heat actions until you can use Hell's Gauntlet (the only attack worthy of being called a 'finisher'). \nThere's no way to be creative or actually have fun with this fighting engine, except with some of the earlier hitman missions. If you don't fill your inventory with Tauriner ++, you're fucked. \n\nFUCK THE CHASE ENGINE\nHoly shit guys I never experienced a gamer moment until I had to fucking chase Mac S I X TIMES on N O R M A L. The opportunities to tackle are so few and far between and dashing is completely useless because they just speed up when you do, and slow back down when you don't dash. And, because of course it is, it is EVERYWHERE in this game. Yes, I know you can train chasing with Mac, but the only course that is actually doable is the first one, which extends the amount of time you can dash for. At least the chase engine gets cleaned up a bit in Yakuza 4 (check out my lengthy review for that one too).\n\nLet's talk minigames:\n\nFuck pool and its entire life. This game clearly hates hot girls with iron deficiencies like me, where you have to keep the trigger COMPLETELY straight in order to make a proper shot. I can't believe how sensitive they made the curve for pool. I've poured hours into the pool minigame alone and can only beat the beginner pool challenger half the time because of the stupid curve. My ego is in the fucking ground because of how many fouls this baby can fit in it (I do not get nearly as many fouls in other Yakuza pools, excluding 4)\n\nBaseball and its accompanying substory is easy enough, it's not nearly as much of a grind as Kiwami, but unfortunately there isn't a prompt to hit the ball at the right time like there is in Y5 and 6 (and probably others), so it is more of a headache for some. \n\nFuck the bowling pin physics, guys. Why they so heavy and also not move like pins. It's so whack and I can't believe I got the turkey achievement. It only took me 2000 tries to bowl over a 200 and now I am procrastinating the substory that comes with that burden.\n\nDarts is fine. \n\nI've never raged so hard at a claw machine teddy bear before\n\nDon't @ me about any of the gambling mini games or shogi/mahjong. Who the fuck knows how to play Mahjong. \n\nThe hostess club mini game is,,, Once you accrue enough items to actually be able to dress up the hostess, it's okay. Though, for how expensive some of the items are, your hostess really doesn't make enough money. I'm almost done training my 4th hostess and I barely have 400,000 saved... how the hell am I supposed to be able to buy things that actually boost stats if, after that much gameplay, I have that little and a flower ring is 32,000,000. How do you make money? Am I missing something?\n\nAt least street fights, though way too frequent, often give you decent money to ball a little bit (I was able to start hitting up hostess clubs and buy luxury healing items very early game)\n\nVisiting hostess clubs is fine. It's easy enough without a guide for some of them, but a couple of the hostesses were so fucking insufferable and nonsensical that I didn't want to finish them (But I did) (It was Saya and Yui; especially Yui's substory holy shit what a self-entitled brat)\n\nApprehending all the hitmen is easy enough. It is certainly a grind, but these fights actually have different styles, and a good amount of them don't require just heat actions to be able to do. \n\nAnyways, I think the only redeemable part of this game is the substories. Some people may hate how many there are and want to focus on main story, but I like side quests, and a lot of them give you money, so sue me for being a bourgeoisie fuck.\n\nPutting so many hours into completing this godforsaken game just shows my dedication to this series.

However, this game should probably be skipped. I'm a fan of older PS2 style games, so graphically this game doesn't bother me, but the story and mechanics are so weak.\n\nLet's talk about the story. Spoiler free, the story is by far the weakest in the series so far (not counting 4, 5, and 6, haven't played those yet). It really does feel like the whole game is just grabbing at straws to make things make sense, making some very obvious and cliche \"twists\", needlessly killing characters just to make the game more \"dramatic\", and having character motives seriously out of left field. Kiryu's motives make sense throughout the game in SOME aspect, but in others it really just feels like he's obligated to proceed with the Tojo Clan shenanigans just because. Maybe it's just culture differences here, but it feels like he should be way more obligated to taking care of Haruka and the kids than solving mysteries for the Tojo Clan, which he left long ago. If SEGA decides to remake this game like with 1 and 2 (Kiwami and Kiwami 2), then I really hope they change some of the story to actually make sense as to why Kiryu would be involved. While I haven't fully beaten the game yet (halfway through currently), I don't have high hopes for this getting better.\n\nMechanics time. The battle isn't in any way difficult, but it is Boring. The characters are constantly blocking, so defeating them takes a very long time. Typically in other games, you could just grab blocks and throw the enemies to do damage, but in this game if you grab, the enemies will just break the grab about 90% of the time. So when an enemy blocks, the best thing you can do is punch until they aren't. This naturally takes a long time. Heat actions are difficult to use and there aren't a lot. From what I could find in the menus, there isn't a list telling you which actions do what and what triggers them. So unless you're memorizing all these moves like an elephant or writing them down as soon as you learn them, you're probably not going to be using heat actions a lot. This is a huge disappointment, since a highlight of the games is seeing Kiryu slam a dude's head into a toilet or break someone's arm and stealing their gun right before shooting them. The action in this game is very weak because of the mechanics. \n\nSide stories. I personally loved doing the side stories in other Yakuza games, but this one has little to no benefit. They're not very exciting, funny, or rewarding. Before, you would get EXP, unique items, or at the very least a good laugh from doing side stories. While you DO get EXP for doing side stories in this game, it's so insignificant that you'll be lucky to level up once from doing a side quest. Since most upgrades require 50 or more levels halfway through the game, this is an insanely small amount. I wouldn't really complain if you at least gained 3-4 levels from doing the side quests. Then you could at least upgrade an ability once after doing a few battles and side quests. Just progressing through main story and putting all your points into Body is your best bet for beating the game quickly, which you'll want to do if you decide to buy this. \n\nMini games. They're godawful this time around. The cabaret club management game, which had grown on me previously, is straight up frustrating in Yakuza 3. It requires a lot of money, nets you almost no money, and takes a lot of time to play. There's no benefit to doing it, unlike in other games where you could use your earnings from the mini games on EXP upgrades or other benefits.\n\nPros:\n- Haruka and the kids are cute. The side stories with the kids was very heartwarming. \n- There are SOME very entertaining and silly moments with the blog moments.\n- Rikiya is so goofy, I love him. \n- Kiryu is grade A dad material.\n\nCons: \n- Characters who follow you will SCREAM at you when you walk too fast. You almost always have characters following you. \n- Practically every other thing.\n\nAs a dedicated Yakuza fan, take it from me when I say this one can be skipped. If you really want to know the story, just watch a play-through on Youtube.", "timestamp_created": 1649280342, "timestamp_updated": 1649280342, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2,

"language": "english", "review": "Yakuza 3 is not a bad game.\n\nThe areas of issue with this game can probably be found in most reviews: the combat is weird and too rigid, the graphics are bad, some of the story decisions were weird. I get it, and I can agree with some of this to a fault, but Yakuza 3 is not a bad game.\n\nI loved this game dearly. It is such a breath of fresh air in the series and where they take that story with Yakuza 3 is interesting. For fans of the first three games, 0, Kiwami 1 and 2, some things will be a payoff, while others will feel a little weird. There were parts where I laughed, cried, smiled, was angry... this game made me feel every emotion. The story is so emotional, and gripping at that. When the twists hit, they HIT.\n\nThe direction Kiryu was taken in this installment is perfect. I love what they did with his character. Not to mention, the supporting cast is amazing as always. You get tons of new, lovable, unforgettable characters, and of course, you get your Majima's, Date's, and Haruka's back. The soundtrack was certainly fun, but I admittedly was getting tired of the random street fight music, as well as how often those would happen.\n\nThe substories are strong in this one, especially with some of them having their own animated cutscenes. Some can last a few minutes while others last as long or close to the length of some chapters in this game. \n\nYes, the graphics are not up to par, especially if you played Kiwami 2 right before this. Yes, person who has played this game all the way through as well, I felt your pain at the beginning. It does not take long to get used to this change though, as graphics shouldn't be a reason you hate a video game. Yes, if you played the other games before playing this one, the combat will feel bad. And it is... in comparison. Enemies block A LOT more in this one, and that is no exaggeration. 90% of their moves are blocks. This was something I felt throughout the entire game, and I guess would truly be my only gripe.\n\nWith all of this said, if you are a fan of the series and have been wondering how this game is, or if you're coming off the heels of Kiwami 2, do not let the bad reviews fool you. If you love Yakuza, you will love this game. I highly encourage you to play it!

Graphically it didn\u2019t hold a candle to the recent ones and there were many poor QoL design choices which reflects some of the not-so-great design of older days. \nThe enemies specially boss fights were too cheap with constant guarding, no reliable way to break it and if you do they take minimal damage making the fights tedious and a lot of times boring. The story was ok but the characters and dialogs were incredible as always. Soundtracks were okay as well, nothing as catchy as Yakuza 0. \nThe worst parts were the fact you cant save anywhere like Kiwami and must find phonebooths, as well as, not being able to sprint and the running speed being fixed.\n\nTLDR;\n\nPros:\n- Great Writing.\n- Fun gameplay minus some boss fights\n- Insane amount of minigames\n- An \"Exit to windows\" option the older games lacked\n\nCons:\n- Not as visually appealing as Kiwami\n- Tedious game designs like walking back and forth or clicking something and waiting seconds before it opens etc.\n- Poor boss fights.", "timestamp_created": 1647684640, "timestamp_updated": 1647785960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112442862": {"recommendationid": "112442862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024486198", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1172, "last_played": 1647652064}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un buen juego, no es el mejor Yakuza ni mucho menos pero sigue siendo un buen juego en general.\nLos que os quejais de los bloqueos no se si es porque es en dificultad dificil cuando ocurre, porque excepto algun que otro boss que tienes que pillarle el truco para esquivarlo y acto seguido golpear los demas son bastante sencillitos de derrotar.

This game has a lot of charm, great story and amazing characters, what more could you want. Let's get the elephant out of the room real quick, the combat in this game is not bad. The combat might be outdated but the only real time it got frustrating was fighting the Snake Flower Triad and Lau Ka Long, I like to see it as the combat forcing you to approach the game with a different strategy and not just mindlessly spamming combos and tiger drops, when you're fighting a boss one-on-one the combat is a lot of fun. Since this game is technically \"outdated\" it makes the game pretty goofy at times, I think the goofiness just adds to the charm of this game so I do not see it as a bad thing. The only real time the goofiness is a detriment in my opinion is the \"beautiful eyes\" moment, this is supposed to be a super emotional moment for Kiryu, the man that raised him, or at least that's who Joji appears to be, and died in his arms makes eye contact with him again and. This moment is supposed to be really emotional but it's instead made fun of all the time. Now I think the story is just a way better version of the 1 story. The game revolves around trying to fish out some organization that ties back to the Tojo in some way, the difference here being that the organization actually has something to do with the Tojo and the main plot unlike Jingu and the MIA thanks to the whole military expansion bill forcing Kiryu to give up the land to his orphanage putting some pressure on us. Now while the story is good the game would not be nearly as good without the amazing supporting cast, the characters are truly what add to this game and give it more of the Y3 charm that I love. Finally, Mine is a fantastic antagonist. Like Ryuji, his entire motivation and backstory is revealed almost at the end but it's done in such a way that puts him as yet another of the fantastic antagonists that RGG is so good at writing. RGG takes the boring \"I'm doing this because I want power and money\" and applies it to Mine in such a way that makes his character more tragic. Without Daigo, the one man he respected and gave him meaning, his life goes back to being empty and being just about him getting as much power, as much as he doesn't need it.

Enemies will block almost everything on hard mode, finished Yakuza 0, K1, and K2 on hard mode but I had to drop difficulty on 3 because of how bullshit the bosses are on hard mode. Combat isn't hard because it's hard, but because they abuse the combat mechanics to the point where you can't do anything. I won't go into the story because of spoilers but it is very wack even by Yakuza standards. Characters are annoying, they force Kiryu into a friendship with the local Yakuza group in Okinawa but they are by far the worst group of friendlies in the entire franchise, theyre annoying and unlikable, at least to me.

Aside from the fact they didn't remake it like 0,1, and 2, it also takes place in Okinawa which is away from the big bustling city and more chill. In the beginning of the game is feels really slice of life and it's pretty chill. Some people might find it boring but i thought it was pretty fun and interesting. Later in the game it returns to its roots and you visit Kamurocho from the previous games. \n\nThe story is okay, but of course it has the same tropes as the previous ones. It's a good story with plot twists and the such. (Spoiler Warning; Not too specific though) [spoiler] After Kiryu lost many many loved ones in previous games and he once agains loses people in this game, it's no surprise. But for the characters that die in this game it doesn't really feel Kiryu built a good bond with them and you don't really feel too sad about it because of that. [/spoiler] If you've played the previous games then you're pretty much expecting it.  If you haven't then I guess you're in for some plot twists. In a way it seems unnecessarily convoluted. I mean Idk maybe I'm just getting tired of the same Yakuza plot used for every game but it's just my opinion. \n\nAside from the main story there are a vast amount of different side missions to do. Some of them are much more interesting than others. There's actually a murder mystery side mission that I genuinely found more interesting than the main story, Some of the side missions aren't marked and it's kinda confusing on what you need to do. They let you get stronger and add more spice to the game so for the most part they're pretty good. There's also a lot of minigames like karaoke, golf, fishing, bowling, and a few others.\n\nThe combat is pretty much the same as the previous games. This game does add chase and escape scenes where you have to run and vault obstacles to evade or catch someone which was really interesting. The beatem up fighting was a bit painful though. I felt like some bosses were just block monsters and too repetitive. Sometimes I would easily dodge out of their attack and as they were hitting they would 180 turn and somehow connect with my character. Upgrade points are pretty hard to get late game and I have no idea how you'd be even able to get max upgrades without hella grinding it out.\n\nAround Kamurocho there's random people on the street who will try to fight you just like the previous games. In this one it feels like they're on every other corner and it gets annoying real fast. In Okinawa it's not so bad. They give very little exp so grinding with them is super tedious. \n\nOverall a good game. If you enjoyed the previous games then you'll most likely enjoy this one.

TL;DR at the bottom. [/h1]\n\nI\u2019ve just finished Yakuza 3 after playing through its remakes/prequels, and up to this point, this definitely seems to be weakest entry in the series so far. Sure, comparing Yakuza 3 to latter entries is a bit unfair, but that is the context that I have, so be it. Kiwami 1 and 2 is a Remake of Yakuza 1 and 2 plus Yakuza 0 came also after. If you're a newcomer to the yakuza franchise - don't start here - play Yakuza 0, Kiwami 1 and 2 first:\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/638970/Yakuza_0/\n\nSomeone else once stated that Yakuza 3 is more like a \"gaiden\" (side-story) version of the Kiryu saga, and I have to agree. Everything is a bit slower-paced compared to the prequels; from a slower-pace Okinawa beach and smaller-city setting taking a large chunk of the gameplay. It's fine for what it is, but does feel a bit off compared to the other sagas.\n\nPresentation is appropriate for an early PS3-era game, so if you keep your expectations in it's fine, but it didn't quite teleport me back to kabuki-cho/dotonbori like its prequels but thats completely fine because its just a REMASTER of the Original and not a REMAKE with new Engine. If you expect Yakuza 0, Kiwami 1-2 type of quality then its obviously your fault.\n\nThe fight gameplay is fairly average - it just doesn\u2019t have the bone-crunching effect of the earlier entries mentioned, and the moves and the play seems a bit\u2026 plain and kind of \"boring\" since it doesn't have the variety-palette of yakuza 0. Mostly button-mashing with a few dodges thrown in here and there for the tougher fights, but nothing that will make you sweat for an extended period of time.\n\nThe main story is absolutely decent and better than what I expected from the Reviews here. Your typical crime-drama storyline here with some melodramatic plot points (with you running an orphanage and all). I can\u2019t say the storyline was exceptional like that of part 0, but there\u2019s nothing wrong here. I absolutely enjoyed every second of it!\n\nThe side-story missions are okay, but I feel the formula is starting to wear thin. I found myself just wanting to move on with the main story as I didn't find the side plots particularly compelling nor all the mini games interesting.\n\nAll in all, Yakuza 3 is up to par or above average in most aspects. Some will complain about the lengthy cut-scenes, but I think this is a bit overblown. The game always gives you an opportunity to save before showing you a long cut-scene, plus the scenes themselves are skip-able, and you can also re-watch them from the menu. So there's a good deal of flexibility there. Even without the removed content, Yakuza 3 has upwards of 50 hours of content to enjoy. If you're only interested in finishing the story, this takes about 20 hours.\n\nSome Reviewers also mention to just skip this: DON'T! This Game is absolutely worth it and no one should skip this. People who say \"SKIP!\" are definitely trash at video games becuase there is nothing wrong here!\n\n[h1] TL;DR: [/h1]\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Story\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Visuals/Graphics\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 World Design (Universe, Lore and Artwork)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Level Design (Environment and Space)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Exploration Factor\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Combat, Equipment and Enemies (Mostly button mashing and some bosses just block everything.

It wouldn't be fair to call this game [i]mediocre[/i] or [i]disappointing[/i] or what have you \u2013 it still delivers a unique Yakuza experience and it's really good in its own way, but it falls short in just [b]two[/b] crucial areas which are way too important to be overlooked. Since I'd like to end this review on a positive note, let's get all the bad stuff out of the way first \u2013 we don't really have a lot to talk about here, just the [u]minigame design[/u] and [u]issues with pacing[/u].\n\nYou can also read what I had to say about [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/nuitcalme/recommended/638970/]Yakuza 0[/url][/b], [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/nuitcalme/recommended/834530/]Kiwami[/url][/b], and [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/nuitcalme/recommended/927380/]Kiwami 2[/url][/b] here.\n\n[h2]Minigames are a complete and utter mess[/h2]\n\ud83c\udc04Since you've played at least 2 Yakuza games before this one, you know very well how important minigames are in this fictional universe. They offer a welcome distraction from a hectic pace of an intricate criminal drama, a much-needed comic relief among a three-ring circus of neverending schemes, murders and betrayals. Unfortunately, in this iteration of the franchise, they sucked most minigames completely dry of all the fun that made them so great and memorable.\n\n\ud83c\udc04Bowling has messed up pin physics; they feel like they're made of paper and constantly clip through each other and never fall when they're supposed to. Darts is still broken, much like in 0 and Kiwami, but also has absolutely insane completion requirements. Karaoke, my favourite minigame of all time, has such substandard interface and unsatisfying mechanics that I didn't enjoy it at all; Kiryu also sings literally 1 short song and that's it. Balls in pool feel weird and change trajectory seemingly at random. Batting seems ridiculously unfair with extremely short reaction times required from the player. UFO Catcher is the worst one yet. And they even ruined the most sacred minigame of all \u2013 Hostess Maker. It went from one of the most engaging side activities to a dreadful snoozefest. I mean, should I even continue? You get the gist.\n\n\ud83c\udc04One could argue that of course Yakuza 3 is gonna have worse physics \u2013 it's a much older game than Kiwami 2, so what am I talking about? True, but many issues that I've listed above have nothing to do with when the game came out. It's just bad design choices. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2740345076\n\ud83c\udc04You can still have fun with fishing, gambling, and maybe even mahjong if you're a masochist like me, but the overall impression is tarnished nonetheless. So, minigames suck, okay, but the main plot has to be good then, right?\n\nRight, but sadly,\n[h2]there are serious pacing and storytelling issues[/h2] \n\ud83c\udfadWhat if I told you that at the very beginning of the game, when things just start to get interesting and you're ready to be immersed in a typical yakuza storyline, the game's pacing is brought to a screeching halt, and for several hours you're forced to deal with boring kid problems \u2013 this boy gets bullied at school, this one is allergic to buckwheat, someone had their pocket money stolen, yadda yadda yadda. So, when in previous games you've already done 10 years in prison, foiled several assassination attempts and are now in the middle of a clan war, here you've taught some kids how to say sorry and be brave. I mean, it's not bad per se and I welcome this change as it shows us how Kiryu is developing as a person, but good Lord above, this thing is sooo... looong... and tedious... [u]especially[/u] when you need to complete the game several times to unlock the Legend difficulty. \n\n\ud83c\udfadMoreover, imagine that you have a 30-minute cutscene in your game (I'm not even kidding) with some guy telling you about all important plot details, who is who and what everyone's motivation is. This is so unbelievably lazy; it's creative writing at its worst. Don't just [u]tell[/u] me what kind of person everyone is and what they want \u2013 [u]show[/u] me! You might not actually [i]show[/i] as much as you can [i]tell[/i], but there's no need to lay all cards on the table \u2013 stop chewing my food for me, I can arrive at my own conclusions and I don't need anyone sitting me down and going, [i]\"Okay, listen up, this is how it is... He killed him because... They are an organisation called... blah blah blah...\"[/i] I love Yakuza cutscenes and I think many of them are brilliant, but this 30-minute slog had me yawning and begging for the torture to end.  \n\n[h2]Finally, let's talk about the good stuff![/h2]\n\u2b50To be honest, if you start playing right after completing Kiwami 2, you'll have a hard time getting used to how old this game looks and feels. Gone are the glorious ragdoll physics and [i]whatever[/i]K textures; despite that, Yakuza 3 can still be gorgeous in its own ways \u2013 there was neither a sandy beach in previous games nor a breathtaking view of the night sky full of bright stars \u2013 and it still has a solid gameplay foundation that will keep you from getting bored. Unless you're stuck in the middle of a neverending cutscene, that is...\n\n\u2b50There are a whopping [b]119[/b] (!) substories \u2013 almost twice as many as in other games, and they are really \u2013 [i]really![/i] \u2013 riveting and imaginative. At some point you even solve a murder case, Agatha Christie style. Just be careful not to start too many substories at the same time \u2013 this may prevent other side activities from working properly, and you'll be stuck in what I call a Vicious Substory Loop of Death. While researching how to get out of this, I accidentally saw some pretty heavy spoilers. So, just finish any substory that you start and then move to another one if you wanna be safe.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2737134758\n\u2b50The music is as great as ever \u2013 that's definitely something this franchise will seemingly never stop delivering on. Isn't it just [b][url=https://youtu.be/CiwMh6DOEjs]one of the most charming melodies[/url][/b] you've ever heard? Simple, yet elegant and melancholic. It gave the Agatha Christie substory that special push to make it even more emotional.\n\n\u2b50Have I mentioned that there's finally a new city to get lost in? Since we already know both Kamurocho and Sotenbori inside and out, having a new place to explore was a much-needed breath of fresh Okinawan air. It's kinda small though, maybe half the size of Kamurocho, but I don't think it matters that much. You'll be learning a lot about people living in Okinawa, their language, customs and outlook on life in general. \n\n\u2b50There are many other things I could cover here, like Revelations, chases, levelling and combat systems, Ultimate Matches, et cetera; however, I don't want you to know absolutely everything before you start. It's always good to go in somewhat blind and let yourself be shocked (in a good way) \u2013 Yakuza is the perfect franchise to have your jaw dropped or your thighs slapped in an uncontrollable fit of laughter. Have fun!\n\nP.S. A completionist would naturally find that it's too late to stop now, having already perfected three games before this one, but I feel obliged to say it anyway \u2013 Yakuza 3 will be absolutely [i]brutal[/i] to anyone who strives to achieve 100% completion. It's head and shoulders above all other entries in the series simply because of all the broken minigames. However, take heart \u2013 if I did it, you can, too! \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2736559390", "timestamp_created": 1643915825, "timestamp_updated": 1643944643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712061643600463867", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109403637": {"recommendationid": "109403637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306506995", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1299, "last_played": 1643868108}, "language": "english", "review": "Yakuza 3 is one of the most--if not the very most--controversial games in the Yakuza series. But for what it is, it's enjoyable.\nThe story is good, Kiryu receives excellent new characterization, the new characters are great, the overall plot is somewhat familiar but has enough intrigue to keep itself interesting throughout. There are few moments that could've been executed better, but overall it's a good experience.\nThe gameplay is mediocre, especially compared to gameplay titans such as Yakuza 0. Enemies block and reguard to much, but this causes an emphasis on grabbing in non-boss encounters which is actually fascinating. I learned some unorthodox but interesting physics-based damage options with grab-throw-far heavy kick-far heavy kick into a wall for extra damage. Blocking is mostly a problem on heavy enemies who you can't grab, but you can generally get behind them (or use weapons) to make your life easier. The actual main problem is that heat generation is way too slow, but you can get a lot of heat by throwing enemies into groups of other enemies during large encounters--still, this is unreliable and you want to pack heat-giving items, especially for boss encounters.\nSpeaking of, boss encounters are mostly fine once you get a hang of the quickstep, but you should always pack weapons to make your life easier. For enjoyment purposes, combo speed and double-finishing blow upgrades are *essential*, yet for some reason are missable on the upgrade menu due to having alternate options for their slot? The ability to miss these upgrades might be my chief complaint with this game, as they should be mandatory upgrades due to how much easier it makes your life.\n6.5/10, worth playing for the story, the gameplay isn't winning any awards but it is serviceable for the most part despite some hang-ups.

This is an anacronistic but if you're a casual fan walking in from Kiwami you're gonna be let down.\n- Needs more Majima\n- Once you get the Komaki counter you can basically sail though all the boss fights in the game... as long as you are good at counters.\n\nI love this series with all my heart so of course I'm going to recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1643578071, "timestamp_updated": 1643578071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109124772": {"recommendationid": "109124772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048870804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8983, "last_played": 1643566854}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes!

Seeing Kiryu outside of his Yakuza life and just being a chill dad was a nice occurrence, and Okinawa was a good change of scenery. It also seems to find every possible opportunity to send you on a search quest for some person or item. But even after all of the hell it puts you through I genuinely think the story was well-written and I felt emotional at parts. A lot of the new characters you meet are easily favorites and final boss is one of the best in the series.

You having to play it after Kiwami 2 which is on the newest engine for Yakuza games makes it feel and look bad. It will take the first few hours to get used to this look and feel of this game, but I feel like it still can be good.\nDon't get me wrong, I really love this game, but it has to be the weakest in the franchise for me.\n\n* This review does NOT contain any spoilers for the story\n\nIn terms of story, I actually really loved it. There were very many moments when I cried, when I cheered and I felt really invested in the story. So for the story alone, this game is worth playing.\n\nThe combat is nothing to really write home about. It's just Yakuza, doesn't feel like it has any new things, though it is to be expected, as this is a Remaster, not a Rework, like Kiwami and Kiwami 2. It needs a little bit of time until you get used to it, but the game is still good.\n\nOf course, you can't have a Yakuza game without side content, but, to be honest, whilst there is a lot to do in this game, because it's technically the oldest in the franchise now, its mechanics feel aged. I feel like this game would be appreciated more by someone who played the original game. Coming from the spoiled goodness that was 0, Kiwami and Kiwami 2, this feels like a major downgrade, because it is.\n\nYes, I am sure you have heard of the insane amount of blocking the AI does in this game. Yes, it is frustrating. This is why I recommend you play on an easier difficulty than you would normally: if you want to go with Hard, no you don't, just go with Normal. For your own mental health and future anger issues developments.\n\nAlso the movement is clunky. I'm not sure if they reworked it or not, but it does feel old-style.\n\nIf you love Yakuza, I recommend playing this. but it will take some time to recalibrate from how spoiled you have been playing the first 3 games. If you find it a pain, you could just watch all the cinematics or something on Youtube and skip to Yakuza 4 which is better in every way yet still has an old-school feel, but don't worry, it's the good kind.", "timestamp_created": 1643232657, "timestamp_updated": 1643232832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108769805": {"recommendationid": "108769805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198979140053", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2289, "last_played": 1674154114}, "language": "english", "review": "I wub him", "timestamp_created": 1643133950, "timestamp_updated": 1643133950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108709716": {"recommendationid": "108709716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149307925", "num_games_owned": 550, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1665077978}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic wholesome, funny game.

I found it to be surprisingly excellent. \n\nStory:  The main story does have kind of a slow burn early on, but it adds to the plot in a deliberate and meaningful way that allows the story to build on itself and have events carry more weight.  If you enjoyed the other Yakuza game stories, there is a high chance you will appreciate this one.  It fits in well as continuation from Kiwami 2.  If its your first Yakuza game, it works well as a self contained story, and it provides recaps on the main points of past events.  \n\nGraphics:  At 4k max settings 60 fps this game actually looks amazing for a 2009 Ps3 title.  It is close to par w/ yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1.   Also, there is the added visual variety from having a new major location (Okinawa) in additional to Kamarocho .  \n\nSound:  Top tier soundtrack that compliments the experience well.  \n\nGameplay:  The overall game structure is actually really similar to Yakuza 0 to Kiwami 2.   If you liked the gameplay in those, there's a high chance you'll appreciate it here.  Enemies do seem to block more than in other entries; however, this entry allows you to acquire extremely powerful moves pretty easily and early on (like the Komaki Parry + Tiger Drop + most of the tech abilities).  The combat might be also a little stiff compared to other entries, but it did not feel like a jarring change at all.  It actually felt like it made sense, because at this point in the story, Kiryu is almost 40 years old.  \n\nLast, mods improve the experience even more.
