The same thing happens each time, I play for ten minutes or so and am drawn in by the (still) unique non-euclidean lateral puzzles before running headfirst into the true mechanics: block puzzles. \n\nAnd what a truly mixed bag of block puzzles they are. Antichamber contains within it one of the worst puzzle tools featured in any game. The block gun is finicky and so deeply frustrating to use and is such a slap in the face after a truly intriguing opening. After the elegant opening that demands you question your assumptions and truly observe cause and effect in this strange world, there follows only sloppy, linear logic cube puzzles where you're likely to get stuck because the game just didn't even try to explain one of its new mechanics. Fans might rebut that last point. \"Well the mechanics *are* the puzzle, stupid\" That might fly with the Witness, which constantly prompts you be creative and try new solutions (or to piss off till later when you've learned more), here there are tutorials that explain about half the mechanics of a new tool, leaving the rest for you to stumble upon by pure happenstance.\n\nHonestly it just becomes a slog, not helped by the complete lack of narrative motivation. There are hints and teases at the start: a mysterious black entity floats through unreachable corridors, mere inches away. These soon become just as absent as the lateral puzzles within the first half-hour, only showing up again at the honestly pretty dull conclusion. What you're left with are throwaway doodles with fortune cookie aphorisms, all as empty as the walls they occupy. These were cute a decade ago, but now just seem patronisingly low effort. The visuals too at first seem elegantly simplistic, but are eventually gratingly basic. It all feels low effort, when games like Baba Is You can utilise visual simplicity whilst manufacturing a unique and charming aesthetic, Antichamber is just empty.

The art direction shows visual themes of absurdism and cubism and these are the only two elements that align with the strange puzzling tool of the cube gun. \nEvery other element beyond this clash. From game play point of view, the main theme of the puzzles is to learn through sheer determination and very few hints. These hints are purposefully vague and even outright disrespectful to the player in their crass ways of saying \"pay more attention\" over 40 times. Many of these puzzles connect to each other, but due to the non-linear and non-euclidean design of the game, hints for puzzles you learned earlier may not be easily remembered. Specifically a strange mechanic explored and taught in one puzzle, is critical for another and critical for the finale. The good puzzles are quite enjoyable, and if the game were just about the puzzles, this would be a good review because I have a fondness for games that push players to experiment to learn.\n\nBut this is all ruined by the art direction and its' themes. Antichamber is a contemporary art piece, one that has interesting cubist designs with plenty of absurdism. Unfortunately, one of its' primary themes is to have highly saturated, contrasting colors that are harmful to the eyes. These are not toned down at any point of the game, often filling the space with sickening colors that make it difficult to look at.\nThis still would not be too much of a detriment if they had leaned into a greater theme about contemporary art. Contemporary art is often difficult to look at and even harder to find reason to analyze to the common viewer. The highly saturated colors with high contrast follows this, and the difficulty of the puzzles acting as a game play based metaphor for digging deeper into the themes of the often convoluted and complex themes of modern and contemporary art.\nBut unfortunately, there is no payoff for digging deeper into Antichamber. There is no larger themes, there are no deeper meanings. The absurdist art pieces and areas do nothing but confuse and mislead the player, detracting from game play and making difficult to tell what is part of the game and what is part of the art. This is further compounded by the endless text boxes that wax on philosophically in very generalized manners, as if the artist had no overall intent with the art direction.\n\nIn summary, Antichamber feels like a wealth of game play potential that is held down by the conflicting contemporary designs. As an art piece, it appears that they wanted to capture the deeper themes of similar works of art, but with little of the effort or purpose in their design.", "timestamp_created": 1696922202, "timestamp_updated": 1696922202, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465781509876251221", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147859638": {"recommendationid": "147859638", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962373911", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1573, "last_played": 1696764816}, "language": "english", "review": "The best puzzle game I've ever played.

Antichamber takes a difficult concept and really delivers well on it. There are a few questionable design choices and puzzle designs in the game, but when Antichamber is taken as a whole those decisions start to make sense. Antichamber is a constantly evolving experience that grows and morphs as you learn more about it. The game you play when you start is fundamentally different from the game you play when you're ready to tackle the final level, and most of it hinges on the things you learn as you go. \n\nAntichamber is equal parts a puzzle game and a philosophical journey that teaches you about game mechanics, as well as life, with its simple but effective means of communication. The level design is open ended and doesn't offer much in terms of a clear goal, but if you take the hints the game offers there is a strong sense of direction. The experience is not rooted in mechanical skill and the levels can be completed at your own leisure. (Although there are a handful, less than 5, jumping-related challenges that require rather good timing to beat.)\n\nDue to the open ended nature of the design I did have several moments where I felt like a puzzle didn't have any apparent solutions. But the game actively encourages you to leave problems that are too hard for later, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from coming back to an \"impossible\" problem with newfound knowledge that made progress trivial. I would sum up Antichamber to be a continuous series of \"things just clicking\", more so than other puzzle games of the same nature (such as Portal). You will get stuck, and the game is designed around starting over or trying something else.\n\nThe sound design is solid. The visuals are clear and effective, although I wish it had better anti-aliasing. The art style is very much \"programmer art\", but it still feels inviting and charming. Controls are logical and the game feels good to play. No major complaints about the technical aspects.\n\nI managed to complete the game in roughly 6-7 hours without looking up any walk-throughs or tutorials. However, there was 1 puzzle that I only managed to finish by dumb luck [spoiler] It involved walking through a series of solid walls in a non-euclidean space at the top of the \"tower\"[/spoiler]. There were 2 optional rooms I wasn't able to connect by the time I finished my play-through, but I still feel like I had the full Antichamber experience without missing anything.\n\nIn conclusion: Antichamber is a game about learning to play Antichamber. In the same way that the levels bend back into themselves in impossible ways, the game is both incoherent and perfectly legible. Often leaving you completely on your own while holding your hand. It lets you outsmart it while still always being one step ahead of you. It even made me go back in time and retroactively appreciate moments when I was feeling boundlessly frustrated. It's hard to call something that is only 10 years old timeless, but I feel like Antichamber will survive the test of time.\n\nIt's not for everyone, but for some people, it will be everything. 8.9/10", "timestamp_created": 1694604665, "timestamp_updated": 1694604665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146204278": {"recommendationid": "146204278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031651174", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 469, "last_played": 1584769029}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever.

This game was another title that came out on the wake of Portal's release as another game within the \"test chamber\" subgenre with a small distinction of having more focus on exploration, something I would perhaps compare to the more modern The Witness. Non-euclidean logic that will blow your mind and test your comprehension skills and critical thinking, packed in a minimalist game which is as efficient as it can be in order to communicate the game's concept and ideas. Everything in the game is intended and serves a unique purpose, even the \"main hub\" and the way \"saves\" work. Uniquely original puzzles that many would consider mind-benders will prove to be a puzzle game fan's dream, or nightmare. I'm glad Steam does not have achievements for this game as this would've ruined the sense of exploration and discovery that this game has. This is a 10/10 and a game I can see myself coming back to.\n\nOn a technical side... this game does not count with Steam Cloud so you'll have to copy and paste the saves yourself. The game won't be saved if you force quit either, please read how to save in the main hub instruction so you don't lose your progress. The minimalist graphics and great use of silence (both visual and auditory) make the presentation of this game pretty timeless unlike a lot of its contemporaries. It can literally run in 10 year old college laptops, hell, it can even run in old mid 2000s office desktops and it would still run great with an appropriate selection of available resolutions.\n\nIf you're a fan of puzzle games, especially First Person Exploratory Puzzle games and/or \"Test Chamber\" Puzzle games then you owe it to yourself to play this game.

[15/20\u2b50, 10h\ud83c\udfc5, 2/5\ud83d\udca1]\n\n[b]Context[/b] Antichamber is one of the \u201ctest chamber\u201d puzzle platform games that came out in the wake of Portal, taking place in an abstract setting (think, for instance, of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/239430/]Q.U.B.E.[/url] before the Director\u2019s Cut). Although the main puzzles rely on simple mechanics, the twist is handling the impossible physics that permeate the levels.\n\n[b]Writing[/b] There is no plot, and we never gets to know what we are doing, nor why. When you solve a puzzle, a \u201clife advice\u201d aphorism is provided that relates to the strategy required to beat the level.\n\n[b]Aesthetics[/b] Visuals are simple and abstract, without any kind of detail, as typical in these \u201ctest chamber\u201d games. [spoiler]The rigidity of the design is evident by the ending when we finally see something that are not straight lines.[/spoiler] Again, this is similar to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/239430/]Q.U.B.E.]Q.U.B.E.[/url]. The ambient style soundtrack is pretty good, although it\u2019s often not clear how the tense/relaxed tones of the tracks relate to the actual game. There is no voice acting.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] For all the emphasis on the mind-bending aspects of the world, the actual puzzle mechanics were rather straightforward. They mostly involve manipulating cubes using guns with increasingly complex powers [spoiler](from creation, to movement, to multiplication)[/spoiler]. The impossible physics were mostly relevant for exploring and navigating between the levels [spoiler](including paths leading back to themselves, or paths that change depending on the perspective)[/spoiler]. Continuing the comparison with Q.U.B.E., the puzzle-solving mechanics feel similar, but the exploration part is much less action-oriented. The game is not particularly hard despite the impossible physics, since the interactions possible interactions with the word are limited.\n\nThere\u2019s a main hub that allows quick travelling to the levels, and also identifies unsolved levels and missed paths (but not missed messages), which also made the game considerably easier. Some of these levels require carrying something from other levels, and due to the way the (impossible) way the levels are connected, this often requires starting from other levels. \n\nOne aspect of the game that was a bit frustrating is some kind of secret puzzle (involving the pink cubes) that has no purpose and seems to have been left unfinished (or was this the intended effect?).\n\nYou can hit deadends, and you\u2019ll just have to return to the hub and re-start the puzzle. There are no deaths or gameovers [spoiler](the count-down timer is there just to mess with the player).[/spoiler]. The overall progress is saved but not of each level, which resets when you return to the hub.\t\n\n[b]Value[/b] It took me 10h to completely beat the game (i.e., solve all levels and get all messages), amounting to about 60 puzzles. Honestly, the price tag seems a bit steep for a game of this depth and age. There is a single progress slot, but you can always revisit previous chapters. You can tackle the levels in non-linear fashion, but there is a single ending. There are no achievements other than the in-game registry of found messages. If you missed some, you can just revisit the levels looking for them. I can see this being replayed only to revisit the puzzles.\n\n[quote][i]For more puzzle-game reviews and curated lists check out the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43326007-The-Clueless-Adventurer-Puzzle-Trove/]Puzzle Trove[/url].[/i][/quote]\n", "timestamp_created": 1693215054, "timestamp_updated": 1693215054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144973859": {"recommendationid": "144973859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064829685", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 750, "last_played": 1692953515}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like puzzles?

It might sound dizzying but it's applied in a gentle way that makes the world abstract without becoming disorienting. Plus you can always teleport back to the entrance and use the map to restore your sense of direction if you need it.\n\nEach puzzle is accompanied by motivational phrases and tid-bits of advice that punctuate the lesson it aimed to teach turning each challenge into a physical metaphor. The solutions tend to build on one another so it feels like you're learning the rules of the space as you play and explore, best exemplified by the cube tool. I can't get into much more detail than that without spoiling things but the puzzles are interesting and unconventional.\n\nIf you enjoy spatial logic puzzles Antichamber has a few hours of fun for you to delve into.

Al lado de este juego, The Witness te lleva en brazos a la cama, te arropa y te da un beso de buenas noches.\nEl juego empieza con un men\u00fa con un letrero que dice \"Esto es todo lo que necesitas saber\" con los controles y poco m\u00e1s, a partir de ah\u00ed vas por libre explorando algunos de los escenarios m\u00e1s abstractos que recuerdo en un videojuego. Al igual que Manifold Garden, el juego se basa en geometr\u00eda no euclidiana, pero es que el juego no contento con eso, no se corta en ning\u00fan momento de hacerle \u201ctrampas\u201d al jugador en plan, ese pasillo por el que acabas de llegar, como le pierdas de vista ya no es el mismo pasillo y es otro totalmente diferente que te lleva a otro sitio en la otra punta del mapa, por lo que como no prestes algo de atenci\u00f3n no te enteraras ni como has llegado a algunos sitios. Adem\u00e1s, el escenario es una suerte de mundo abierto, el juego no es lineal del todo.\nEl juego tiene un mapa en la sala que hace de men\u00fa principal, el cual nos dir\u00e1 en que sala del mapa estamos y cuantas \u201csalidas\u201d tiene cada sala, es de las poqu\u00edsimas ayudas que nos dar\u00e1 el juego. \nEn cuanto a mec\u00e1nicas, a medida que vayamos avanzando el juego se nos proporcionara una \u201cpistola\u201d con la que podemos \u201cabsorber\u201d material en forma de cubos y despu\u00e9s expulsarlo para mantener puertas abiertas, hacer puentes, o lo que sea que tengamos que hacer.\n\n\nEl juego exige de mucha paciencia y predisposici\u00f3n por parte del jugador, es por ello que no es adecuado para todo el mundo, de hecho me gustar\u00eda saber la tasa de finalizaci\u00f3n del juego, pero como el juego no tiene ning\u00fan logro no se puede saber, pero estoy seguro de que debe ser BAJ\u00cdSIMA.\nNada de esto lo estoy contemplando como algo negativo, y menos en esta \u00e9poca donde nos dan absolutamente todo masticado y nos llevan de la mano, y donde el jugador medio en cuanto tiene que estar unos minutos buscando una soluci\u00f3n a un problema, ya tira de gu\u00eda, o directamente abandona. De hecho, The Witness, este Antichamber o el propio Outer Wilds hacen lo que pocos juegos se atreven a hacer, no tratar al jugador de deficiente mental.\n\n\nLo que no me ha gustado mucho es que por lo que vi durante las 11 horas que me ha durado completarlo, muchas \u201csalas\u201d realmente no sirven para nada, haces los rompecabezas que te exigen y realmente aparentemente muchos solo son para pura satisfacci\u00f3n personal, pues son callejones sin salida. De hecho, algunas salas deben ser totalmente opcionales, pues me he terminado el juego y a\u00fan me quedaban al menos 5 o 6 salas que no he visitado (por no saber como acceder). Deber\u00edan de \u201crecompensar\u201d de alguna manera al jugador para incentivarle a hacer los puzzles.\nEso s\u00ed, el juego te hace ser creativo como pocos juegos logran, algunos puzzles los he pasado sin saber si es el modo correcto de hacerlo, no s\u00e9 si es como el desarrollador ide\u00f3, pero gracias las mec\u00e1nicas que tiene el juego te hace hacer virguer\u00edas, sobre todo con las mec\u00e1nicas de construcci\u00f3n, las cuales me parecen muy originales y bien resueltas.\n\nEn cuanto al apartado gr\u00e1fico, el juego es muy minimalista, casi todo es en blanco y negro, salvo algunos colores y mucho cubismo. A destacar la \u201caparente\u201d infinidad de cubos que podremos colocar por el escenario... yo al menos no he llegado al tope, el cual entiendo que en alg\u00fan n\u00famero alto estar\u00e1.\nEl sonido muy anecd\u00f3tico y relajante, como suele ser habitual en esta clase de t\u00edtulos.\n\nY en cuanto a la historia, pues literalmente no tiene historia, me da igual lo que se pueda leer por alguna wiki del juego, o fumadas extrasensoriales de personas en internet con sombreros de papel de plata en sus casas comentando el juego... esto no tiene historia. Es a\u00fan m\u00e1s extremo que The Witness en este sentido.\n\nEn definitiva, Antichamber es un grand\u00edsimo juego de puzzles, casi al nivel de los grandes exponentes al g\u00e9nero (The Witness, Talos Principle, The Filament, Portal 2, etc) pero que es tan hardcore que estoy seguro de que no mucha gente va a disfrutar con \u00e9l. Adem\u00e1s, la ausencia total de historia realmente no le hace ning\u00fan bien, pues mucha gente igual le dar\u00eda una oportunidad si al menos tuviese una historia interesante, pero es TAN gafa pasta en este sentido que si tuviese una historia m\u00e1s tradicional, seguro que m\u00e1s jugadores lo terminar\u00edan.\n\nPD:Juego jugado integramente en Steam Deck", "timestamp_created": 1681510228, "timestamp_updated": 1681510307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632768332958221436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136607590": {"recommendationid": "136607590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050207385", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1586575189}, "language": "english", "review": "My brain hurt", "timestamp_created": 1681355144, "timestamp_updated": 1681355144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48868522047996521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136605501": {"recommendationid": "136605501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146507829", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1514960553}, "language": "english", "review": "good. fucks with your head but in a good way", "timestamp_created": 1681351043, "timestamp_updated": 1681351043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48868522047996521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136529465": {"recommendationid": "136529465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074772756", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 571, "last_played": 1681227455}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1681227474, "timestamp_updated": 1681227474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48868522047996521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136497636": {"recommendationid": "136497636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198895895467", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1665, "last_played": 1690745962}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely brilliant", "timestamp_created": 1681168775, "timestamp_updated": 1681168775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48868522047996521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136428501": {"recommendationid": "136428501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046466819", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 392, "last_played": 1681071645}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun. :)", "timestamp_created": 1681066749, "timestamp_updated": 1681066749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48868522047996521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136409203": {"recommendationid": "136409203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062923352", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 717, "last_played": 1681531276}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool perspective puzzler.

The solutions to puzzles often make no logical sense, yet in another, more emotional way, they make perfect sense. Everything just somehow feels right. It was always very satisfying when I figured something out, even if I didn't quite know why something worked. Especially when I didn't. Then I found the portal gun.\n\nOkay, it's not a gun that shoots portals, but it looks similar to the eponymous device, which makes comparisons between these two puzzles games kind of inevitable. The gameplay mechanics are actually very different and unique. The real issue is that the mechanics feel so... mechanical. Everything in the game becomes very logical and rational from the moment you pick up the gun. It's a stark contrast to how flowing and natural and other-worldly everything feels in the first half of the game. The sense of child-like wonder disappears and is replaced by something that just feels a lot more mundane.

Aside from the writing, the artstyle is functional, yet still exhibits stylistic flair. The soundtrack is peacefully ambient, yet still experiments with what situational abstract detail it can communicate (those wind chimes). The gameplay also includes experimental choices that -- overall -- just feel \"right\" and contribute to its themes of self-discovery and exploration, like the quick escape to the main menu (which also happens to exist within the game world and is not simply relegated to a UI system).

The puzzles themselves are creative and thought-provoking, requiring players to think outside the box and see the world in a different way.\n\nOne of the standout features of Antichamber is its clever use of perspective and scale. Players must often reorient themselves and see the world in new ways in order to progress. This keeps the game feeling fresh and exciting, and helps to prevent boredom from setting in.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is mysterious and enigmatic, adding to the overall experience.

I'm quite obsessed with non-euclidean illusory game design, and the sections of the game that use that shine the best, but about a third of the way through you gain a 'matter gun' which becomes the focus of pretty much all the gameplay. The gun is extremely tedious to use and the puzzles that come with it are no better. Unfortunately this is the direction the game heavily leans toward at this point with little attention given to putting in some more impressive 'mind-bending' design. Also, although I like those mind-bending sections, it's clear that that style was incredibly underdeveloped a decade ago and most of the implementation loses the novelty it must have had back then. (Also also, a select few puzzles are just downright cruel in how little clue there is to how you solve them...)\n\nI also hated how the game was both environmentally non-linear AND had no real direction. This leaves you wandering around the map for hours, in an environment which is very tiring to navigate, trying to find what you might be able to solve next, unsure if you just don't have the right gun yet, you aren't smart enough to solve the puzzle, or you literally just haven't touched a wall the right way. The plain visuals don't help make this exploration any less exhausting, nor do the quite underwhelming little morals/'hints'. I know there is an interactive wall map that supposedly shows you where you're missing spots, but it's so vaguely designed that it doesn't help at all. What is the difference between a rectangular hallway end, a circular hallway end, and an arrow? Which one of those should I be looking at? The game refuses to explain. There's also little arrows that appear on the walls and floor sometimes but as far as I can tell those are moreso hints for navigating certain 'mind-bending' architecture, not pointing out areas you haven't explored yet.\n\nAntichamber has aged Very poorly and I wouldn't recommend playing it unless you ADORE the visual style and consider your patience with these puzzles to be limitless.

I've owned Antichamber for years, and I've always really wanted to conquer it but ended up stopping fairly early in the game every time that I tried. I recently gave the game another shot, only to yet again lose interest in it and quit playing. It wasn't until a week or two later that, after all this time, I finally had a revelation: no matter how much I want to, I do not like this game.\n\nI feel like I SHOULD like this game. It's a first-person puzzle game with a simple-yet-abstract visual style and think-outside-of-the-box brain teasers to conquer, and all of these elements are exciting and interesting to me. Also, the game is solidly designed: I never ran into a bug or technical issue, and the visuals, sounds and background ambiances are interesting and well-rendered.\n\nAdditionally, as far as I've gotten in the game, a majority of the puzzles (while ranging in difficulty) seemed understandable and like all of the information that you had to solve them was either given to you already or just around the next corner, so to speak. (With that said, there was a couple of puzzles that I seemingly solved by sheer coincidence, leaving me confused and with no clue as to what I just did to advance in the game.) The puzzles are usually presented as different rooms and sections of a giant world that you're exploring. If you hit ESC during the game, you're transported to a main room that contains a large map, showing what puzzles you've unlocked and/or completed. You can use this map to quick-travel to almost any place that you've been to, which is handy if a puzzle stumps you and you want to take a break and try something else. \n\nSo, after much thought over Antichamber, I finally have come to identify the 2 main elements that ultimately kill my interest in it. The first is the use of matter guns and how they're used to solve puzzles. After you've made a decent amount of progress at the beginning of the game, you're given the first of several matter guns which you can use to manipulate the environment in various ways, and this is necessary to solve puzzles. Also, there are several areas with translucent \"fields\" that you can walk through but will disintegrate all of the matter stored in your gun. Restarting a puzzle via quick-travel seemingly resets in that area the available matter needed to complete the puzzle and advance, but you can also, during normal play, organically wander across and gather additional matter that can make solving problem areas easier. Should you wander into a disintegration field or restart an area, you've lost all of that extra matter, and when attempting puzzles that seem difficult enough with the additional help of the matter, losing it and finding that you have to try again without the extra matter can be off-putting. (It's also worth noting that almost all matter in the game world can be recovered, but it usually takes a healthy amount of backtracking.)\n\nFinally, the second thing that was a negative aspect to me was the implementation of a hard 90-minute timer. It's not unheard of for a puzzle game to have a time limit, but it feels really unnecessary here. Antichamber is not a very action-heavy title, and I really enjoyed observing the world around me and appreciating the visuals in the game, but I felt like I shouldn't because I was losing time meant for solving puzzles. Perhaps it would've made more sense had I advanced to a certain part of the game, but in my experience, it just felt like an odd design choice.\n\nI do want to again stress that my opinion of Antichamber is only formed by how far I got into the game, and I know that I probably wasn't even half-way done. However, I feel that it says even more if a game entertains a player so little that they don't want to finish it as opposed to the same player completing it and deciding that it was a bad experience.", "timestamp_created": 1675023133, "timestamp_updated": 1684286804, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.44147154688835144", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131778455": {"recommendationid": "131778455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187006042", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 663, "last_played": 1675628407}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple, well-written, fun, visually satisfying puzzle game", "timestamp_created": 1674970051, "timestamp_updated": 1674970051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131777343": {"recommendationid": "131777343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093548612", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1674967779}, "language": "english", "review": "Creatively clever with fortune cookie-esque riddles and puzzles in progressing. \nAs brilliant mechanically as portal, but without any of the narration or story. \n\nMy only struggle was likely due to bad luck, but I'll share it here.

Your aimless wandering will, for a mercy, put checkpoints on your map so you can return to various areas you've been when you are equipped with the right cube gun to solve their particular puzzles. The map and warp system cuts down on the wandering almost but not quite enough to make the game worth playing. Almost, because this game does not respect your time, and there are far too many dead ends or places where it loops pointlessly back to the beginning or elsewhere, accompanied by attempts at little life affirming messages which range from obnoxious to pretentious.\n\nUnfortunately, the puzzles are not interesting enough to offset the aimless wandering, and the much lauded \"non-Euclidean environments\" are accomplished using a variety of cheap tricks in regular Euclidean space, like just warping you around and hoping you won't notice. People are apparently very impressed by these cheap tricks, but they are in no way ground-breaking.\n\nAntichamber thinks it is way smarter than it actually is, and appears to have fooled a great many people, but it's just baby's first puzzle game wrapped in third-rate magic tricks, and sadly, it's too boring to even finish.", "timestamp_created": 1671583163, "timestamp_updated": 1671588227, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.351628214120864868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128871999": {"recommendationid": "128871999", "author": {"steamid": "76561199209315143", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1671482233}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an artwork, even though the game is almost 10 years old it's artstile is so beautifully minimalistic that it makes it timless.

Nothing else! \nFrom the amazing concepts and their creativity, to the eerie soundtrack and quickly recognizable environments, this game features high replayability while being perfect for one sitting, too.\n\nCheck my [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Kej4MFOqY] gameplay [/url] and subscribe!\n\nIf you're wondering whether you should play this or not, well... you obviously should! \nWhatever you'll do, I'll share some more thoughts below.\n\n[h3]Complex Simplicity[/h3]\nWhat you'll see is a puzzle game with straight to the point mechanics. What you'll feel is something different.\nI've played Antichamber many times through the years, always coming back to it because I was (and still am) fascinated by its patterns, level design and overall concept. \n\nThis game features visual tricks that change your perspective on the various rooms which you'll come across. \nI always admired the simplicity in its design, all while being practically complex in reality. How meshes dynamically change with your interactions and how you'll need to revisit most of the rooms you've already been to while adding more and more.\n\n[h3]Sound Leads The Way[/h3]\nWhen I think about Antichamber, I immediately think about birds, eerie ambiance, focused sounds, no narrative whatsoever. That is because it's so well made that it become instantly recognizable and likeable. \n\nFrom a sound design perspective, this is the kind of things I love seeing on games.\n\n[h3]Powers[/h3]\nAlthough it may resemble portal at first glance, with its weapon and all, Antichamber actually has a different mechanic. Your goal is to place cubes correctly, and managing your resources accordingly, in order to overcome the various obstacles you'll come across while playing. \n\nObviously, placing cubes isn't the only mechanic present in the game. You'll learn how to modulate these cubes, in order to multiply or elongate shapes to solve various puzzle.\n\nWhat I've appreciated the most is that it all started with a simple cube. And everything revolved around it, creating a consistent gameplay loop. \n\n[h2]Go Ahead[/h2]\nI'd suggest experiencing Antichamber. \nIf you've never seen it, I'm a bit jealous. I would really like to experience again something like this. \n\nWell, not that I haven't! Manifold Garden, although different, provides a similar surreal experience.\nOther than that, even at full price, this game is worth it. I hope to see more of this developer sometime soon. \n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/recommended/]More reviews here[/url]!\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/@bottolo/videos]My YouTube channel[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1671210173, "timestamp_updated": 1671210271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495412856340408325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128644122": {"recommendationid": "128644122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046249871", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 821, "last_played": 1688339568}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent Game that will bend your mind.

Veremos que hay paredes y techos que desaparecen a nuestro paso; armas que disparan y absorben cubos; pasillos que, al girar sobre nuestros pasos dar\u00e1n lugar a otros escenarios y toda una serie de habitaciones cambiantes y puzzles complicados que har\u00e1n de nuestro avance una ardua tarea. Todo ello a pesar de la ausencia absoluta de enemigos. Estaremos solos.\nGr\u00e1ficamente es un t\u00edtulo muy especial, porque a pesar de su est\u00e9tica simplista, la combinaci\u00f3n de colores resulta muy acertada y da al entorno una apariencia muy original.\nLa banda sonora es aceptable. No se hace pesada pero tampoco resulta pegadiza. Agradable pero simple.\nLa jugabilidad es bastante buena en cuanto a los movimientos de nuestro personaje y a su simplicidad, pero quiz\u00e1s se hace algo complicado el llegar a controlar bien el disparo de cubos y el control de sus movimientos con nuestra pistola.\nLa dificultad es muy elevada por la ausencia de l\u00f3gica en el mapeado, que hace aparecer paredes, desaparecer techos o suelos, modificar el entorno con solo mirarlo o un sin fin de din\u00e1micas surrealistas que son dif\u00edciles de comprender y que poco tienen que ver con la intuici\u00f3n. Solo por ello, la durabilidad del t\u00edtulo podr\u00eda ser de cientos de horas, en especial si quieres obtener todos los posters que iremos encontrando en nuestro camino, y que nos obsequiar\u00e1n con refranes existenciales.

It's got some great puzzles for sure, and if you gel with the mechanics and the Escher style puzzles then I think this game will be right up your alley.\n\nHaving now finished the game, I think it has a few too many rough edges for me to recommend it. On multiple occasions, some of the puzzle mechanics like lasers would not activate on the first try, or some gun functions would seemingly break without reason. Given the ever-changing nature of the game's mechanics, this often lead me to believe I hadn't done the puzzle in the proper way, or wonder if it was the game glitching out.\n\nGoing forward, I'll intentionally be a bit vague just in case anyone reading this would still like to see the game for themselves:\n\nOn many of the puzzles, especially after getting the yellow matter gun, they can be easily cheesed. It would be understandable if there was a clear and intended order to complete the puzzles, that way the first time you run into that puzzle it's easy to design around the tools at your disposal. However, it happens even during end-game puzzles when the devs thoroughly know what mechanics you have access to. \n\nThere are just so many ways to abuse the matter gun mechanics to bypass the puzzles entirely. This isn't even done in a difficult or obscure fashion either, it's done by using the tools with their intended functions in a puzzle that didn't account for it. This really took me out of the whole thing. Often, the puzzles do not respect your time, making you do repetitive tasks or crossing through the same areas multiple times. For some later puzzles, I'd see the intended method to solve a puzzle, then opt to cheese it to save myself time and repetitive effort. As a player, being incentivized to skip the main point of the game isn't a great feeling. \n\nApart from that, many of the puzzles of the game are more about first impression trickery rather than logic. That's not to say it's bad, and on a first playthrough it's pretty novel to have your mind blown seeing the world bend and morph around you. But with the backtracking nature of the game, having to redo these segments to progress to new areas is once again a time sink, and with nothing new introduced to keep it fresh.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting game with interesting mechanics, but I can't recommend a game with this many rough edges for the current asking price of $20.

You really feel like an outsider trying to find your way in an alien world. And you start restricted, lost and unsure. But as you progress you learn the identical blank white walls and where they lead. You see empty areas you have been and find them familiar, stumbling back through memories of your thought process piecing it all together. Only now in retrospect and with a greater understanding. \n\nA lot of this sounds like a metaphor for life and I think it was intended as such. The main landmark you get are these black illustrated signs, and on each of them you get some kitsch quote. None of them are that meaningful and on their own are vapid. But the charm of them is that they are familiar platitudes in an familiar world. Their vapidity is comforting when everything else is alien. They have meaning because of the context. It starts to feel like the voice of a distant friend. \n\nBut obviously it's not a friend, it's the developer. This is the world they created, and these are the words they wrote. They created this uncomfortable world, and they also comfort you through it. I don't even count this as meta as you can find some of the development history of this game in the game. The comforting words and the uncomfortable world are not different entities, they are one and the same. \n\nAnd that's how you feel playing, in the limbo between familiar and unfamiliar, trust and fear, comfort and discomfort. This is the meaningless limbo the developer has created for you to explore. It's a nebula, a catalyst, or maybe an opportunity. The developer wants to show you something, but we are all on our own journeys. This is not a painting or a song with a static message. This is a video game where how you interact with it changes the experience you take. From that, the message changes as well. You are putting the last brushstrokes on an M.C. Escher painting, what message or meaning it holds is up to you. \n\nThis is the art of video games, a painting only completed by each viewer. Each viewer and artist, each save file an artwork.

There isn't really a plot, you're just solving puzzles/overcoming obstacles as you try to make your way to the exit and finish the game. I found myself playing through nearly all the game in no time, though 100% completion of it isn't required in order to finish it and reach the actual ending.\n\nThe entire game world is very non-euclidean and surreal in style, and requires a lot of abstract, outside-the-box thinking. Personally I got the hang of it quickly. The spectacle is all in the gameplay- you have to be more clever than the game and try to learn how to play by its weird rules. Navigation is never in a straight line, and pathways open in close in the most unexpected places. Aside from the puzzle of navigation itself, most of the puzzles focus on using a gun to manipulate cubes in various ways, and although it's simple the mechanics of it feel satisfying and rewarding to test out. There are a lot of moments where it almost feels like you broke the game, but no, it's just working as intended.\n\nIt's also quite soothing. The sound designs of the game and its calm, background ambient noise give it quite a dreamlike feel. The game constantly gives you little pieces of advice that almost always are both good advice for life, and a hint to help you in your current puzzle, and you can freely leave a puzzle and go visit a different one at any time.\n\nNot too long of a play, not too challenging but still highly engaging, with a simple and well done aesthetic. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1660762205, "timestamp_updated": 1660762359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120762643": {"recommendationid": "120762643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115646766", "num_games_owned": 1370, "num_reviews": 321, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1489528712}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1660706475, "timestamp_updated": 1660706475, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.347222208976745605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120707221": {"recommendationid": "120707221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055478960", "num_games_owned": 7617, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1386, "last_played": 1654300981}, "language": "english", "review": "A minimalist puzzler with some nice elements of exploration and self-discovery.

The biggest fault that I have with the game is it wastes the players' time. While it seems open world, it's actually linear. You MUST get the blue gun, then the green gun, then the yellow gun, then the red gun. There's nothing that alludes to this so unfortunately you waste a good chunk of time figuring this out because there are multi-step puzzles that seem possible to solve only to figure out they aren't without the right color gun halfway through. Something that further adds to this element of wasted time is this game is equal parts memorization game as it is a puzzle game. It's kinda like playing hop-scotch blindfolded and when you get it wrong you have to start over and remember there was a pit there or you used too many blocks and don't have enough leftover to complete the last part of the puzzle to open the door at the end to open up another part of the map. Lastly, I ran into a few bugs that forced me to start over in the map room. After around 7hrs, I was just done. I've got a TON of games in my backlog.

My main gripe would likely be the progression difficulty within the first 2 hours (before you get better equipment), as the game lets you explore a lot of places simultaneously and as such, it might be quite difficult to know where you are \"supposed\" to go next.

I had the most fun closer to the end when you get access to incredibly powerful tools with tons of potentials, which somehow don't even make the game trivial.\n\nAs a final note, I found one gamebreaking bug, where the game would let me spawn as much cubes as like (a feature that's intended) to a point where the game would quickly crash.\n\nThat being said, it's definitely worth it if only for its unique characteristics.\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1657141563, "timestamp_updated": 1657141563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519841313362121582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118347359": {"recommendationid": "118347359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003776191", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 111, "last_played": 1664307355}, "language": "english", "review": "Legendary", "timestamp_created": 1657141559, "timestamp_updated": 1657141559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118320800": {"recommendationid": "118320800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080643294", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1535446709}, "language": "english", "review": "Not Portal, but still worth a try.", "timestamp_created": 1657111324, "timestamp_updated": 1657111324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118309399": {"recommendationid": "118309399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020996622", "num_games_owned": 762, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 515, "last_played": 1657218203}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel like I never hear about this game anymore.

Hard. I spent hours exploring, and while I would find new rooms or connections, I could not find what I know I needed to progress.

With this concept in my toolkit, I was able to blow through most of the rest of the game fairly quickly.\n\nI appreciated that there are multiple solutions to each puzzle.

It\u2019s a first-person puzzler that feels like an acid trip. Rooms don\u2019t logically connect up with each other, areas change depending on what direction you look at them from, and illusory floors and walls are everywhere. Crucially, though, unlike Disoriented it fills the space with interesting aesthetics and mechanics. Though the beginning rooms are in stark black and white, the environment ends up a kaleidoscope of shifting colors filled with bizarre and fascinating objects. A lot of puzzle games claim to be \u201cmind-bending\u201d, but this is the first time I\u2019ve felt that was really accurate.\n\nThe central mechanic is that you have a \u201cgun\u201d that can absorb and place little cubes scattered throughout the environment; you can use them to wedge doors open, make steps or bridges, and a few other things. Unfortunately, this interacts with 3D really badly, since your cursor can only move in two dimensions. It\u2019s impossible to place a block anywhere but adjacent to another surface, since the cursor will snap to the farthest point it\u2019s directed at. This makes several puzzles much more frustrating than they need to be, [i]especially[/i] the ones about using blocks as elevators. First-person platforming is terrible, stop doing it!\n\nThe other issue is that \u2014 well, in Toki Tori 2, there are no hard barriers, and you\u2019re limited only by your knowledge. That\u2019s not the case here. Your gun gets several upgrades with additional abilities necessary to solve certain puzzles, meaning that it is possible to run into puzzles you literally can\u2019t solve with your current equipment. This is a problem: because puzzles are supposed to be non-obvious anyway, it\u2019s not immediately obvious whether you\u2019re missing the tools you need or if you\u2019re just not looking at it the right way. This leads to the frustrating side of Metroidvanias where you run in circles for ages not certain how to progress.\n\nDespite that, once the game gets rolling it is very fun. The puzzles were genuinely clever and inventive, and though the mechanics are strange they [i]are[/i] consistent, and it is possible to learn them over time \u2014 crucial for any puzzle game. It gave me the sense of exploring an alien world and slowly piecing together how everything worked.", "timestamp_created": 1649950111, "timestamp_updated": 1649950111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113829180": {"recommendationid": "113829180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088915250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 839, "last_played": 1658428221}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a trip.

The game that made my brain go form healthy to abc. It's certainly an experience and you should try it.\n\nAntichamber is a first-person \"shooter\" (I hesitate to call it that) where you solve puzzles using a gun which allows you to move blocks around. The main appeal of the game, for me at least, is the confusion it brings. The world morphs around you in ways that hurt your brain. From this point onwards, I'll be talking about different parts of the game. You should play it blind for the best experience.\n\nThere are times where you walk down a hallway, find two stairs, come back to that hallway, only to realise it's now a new green hallway. Maybe then you walk into a room, see a window and look through to see a blue room. Turns out, you're now in that blue room. It's hard to explain, but it will melt your brain. However, that isn't the biggest reason why I like Antichamber. It's because of speedruns.\n\nThe fastest I've completed Antichamber in was 8 minutes. It feels amazing to have memorised all of the routes and confusing things, and it's an easy game to speedrun if you put a bit of practice in.\n\nThe story of the game is kind of like a life-lesson as you are told this guy's story. Collect all the pictures, figure out what happened. Stuff like that. You're taught morals along the way, which is certainly what I needed after my brain had been melted. The graphics are simplistic and not distracting as well, which helps.\n\nAll in all while I didn't write much for this review, it's because I can't explain this game. The best thing you can do is pick it up and play it for yourself.\nGameplay: 9/10\nStory: 7.5/10\nMusic: NA (From what I can tell, there was little to no music in the game)\nGraphics: 8/10\nFinal Score: 8/10 (Excellent)", "timestamp_created": 1647681927, "timestamp_updated": 1647681927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112458599": {"recommendationid": "112458599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053531044", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 499, "last_played": 1656487289}, "language": "english", "review": "A fascinating experience in puzzle solving, thinking differently, and questioning everything.

If you don't adhere to this, you won't have a good time. And In my case, the game can not be completed. \n\nThe concept and the exploring aspect of this Antichamber is a pretty fun and unique one. The glaring downside is the options are so incredibly bare, and the lack of hotkey mapping makes the game impossible, in some cases. In my case, I have no middle-click on my 'mouse'. There was a guide to change hotkeys through config files, but that didn't even work for me. I'm an ESDF player, with an unconventional keyboard, with no normal mouse. \n\nAs I mentioned in the TLDR, if you play WASD have a normal mouse with a middle click, you might have fun with this. \n\nThe game is a first person platform-like puzzle exploration game. You wander through the facility following signs that have 'cryptic words of wisdom' on them. Things akin to \"Some times rushing a solution is not the best choice.\" or \"If you look at a problem long enough a solution will reveal itself.\" Which makes some interesting story telling and makes you want to really try to figure out all the puzzles, and even explore the nooks and crannies you run around.\n\nI found no way to \"exit\" the game when I kept trying to edit keybindings in the configs. I had to alt-tab and \"end task\" from task manager. So take that with a grain of salt, or just chalk it up to my incompetence.\nI would have loved to try and finish the game, but sadly, no keybindings means it's not possible for me, otherwise I would normally recommend this game to others.\n\nYour mileage may vary.

Unlike Manifold Garden, which is a very heavy on atmosphere, this game focuses much more on the puzzle aspect. I will say however, that the asthetic of the game, such as the little signs spaced throughout the map, are really pleasant and nice.\nThe ending was a perfect mix of surreal, confusing, and completely left field, but still had me feeling like I had completed something, which is often lacking in puzzle games in this similar vein.\n\nOverall, Antichamber is a 9.8/10 game. The only thing that is missing from the game is more, which isn't really a complaint, but I digress. Even If you aren't the biggest puzzle game fan, I highly recommend this game.

Although, it can get pretty overwhelming at times and I can understand if this game makes you ill.\n\nOverall, this is a good experience that will surely challenge what our small Euclidean brains can comprehend, but the puzzles can get pretty annoying and guide-reliant by the end.

De esta forma, y a pesar de esconder una cr\u00edptica trama y un peculiar apartado gr\u00e1fico, lo que de verdad llamar\u00e1 nuestra atenci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 su mundo interconectado donde cada sala es un puzle (o varios) y que podremos recorrer con casi total libertad para resolver los rompecabezas que comprendamos y abandonar los que no para, m\u00e1s adelante, poder hacerlo al darnos cuenta de nuestros fallos o al haber adquirido una nueva habilidad. Podr\u00edamos decir que \u201cAntichamber\u201d es algo parecido a un \u201cmetroidvania\u201d de rompecabezas en el que, como tal, su mapeado cobra una importancia vital y es parte de c\u00f3mo el videojuego habla con nosotros y hasta se r\u00ede de nosotros con la intenci\u00f3n de fomentar nuestro aprendizaje. \nNos atascaremos en innumerables ocasiones; nos desesperaremos en otras tantas y hasta puede que deseemos abandonar, pero al final cada peque\u00f1o paso supondr\u00e1 una gratificante victoria que nos har\u00e1 desear alcanzar la siguiente y las que despu\u00e9s tarde o temprano habr\u00e1n de llegar.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- puzles complejos pero que premian nuestra perseverancia: la resoluci\u00f3n de cada uno de ellos se siente como un gran triunfo;\n- el juego juega contigo y con tu exceso de confianza; \n- un mundo interconectado sin, aparentemente, un \u00fanico camino trazado: es como un metroidvania de puzles;\n- la facilidad y rapidez con la que el mapa nos deja acceder a las distintas \u00e1reas agiliza mucho el proceso de prueba y error. \n\n[b]Contras:[/b]\n- tienes que esforzarte para que los apartados art\u00edstico y gr\u00e1fico te gusten: parecen patrocinados por SketchUp;\n- el nivel de los puzles es muy bueno, pero algunos rozan lo il\u00f3gico e incluso dan la impresi\u00f3n de que sus mec\u00e1nicas pueden romperse por parte del jugador;\n- algunos elementos y mec\u00e1nicas del juego parecen haber quedado inacabados y nos inducen a confusiones y a complicarnos m\u00e1s de la cuenta.\n\n[h1]ENG[/h1]\n\"Antichamber\" is one of those video games that seems to be made specifically for puzzle lovers: an almost absolute simplicity and austerity in all its parts are not an impediment for developing an intelligent maze full of environmental puzzles. In this way, and despite hiding a cryptic plot and a peculiar graphic design, what really catches our attention is its interconnected world where each room is a puzzle (or more than one), and the fact that we can almost freely explore it to solve them or leave the ones we still can\u00b4t because, later on, we will reach the moment of being aware of our past mistakes or the moment to acquire a new useful skill. We could say that \"Antichamber\" is something similar to a puzzle \u201cmetroidvania\u201d with a map of vital importance that is part of how the video game talks to us and even laughs at us to foster our learning. \nWe will get stuck countless times; we will despair in so many others and we may even want to give up but, in the end, each small step will mean a satisfying victory that will make us want to reach the next one and those that sooner or later will have to come. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b] \n- complex puzzles that reward our perseverance: solving each one of them feels like a great victory; \n- the game plays with you and with your overconfidence; \n- an interconnected world without, apparently, a single traced path: it is like a puzzle \u201cmetroidvania\u201d; \n- the ease and speed with which the map allows us to access the different areas speeds up the trial and error process. \n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- You have to make an effort to like the artistic and graphic design: it seems sponsored by SketchUp; \n- the puzzles are very good, but some feel a bit illogical and they even look like their gameplay mechanics can be broken by the player; \n- some elements and mechanics seem unfinished and can lead us to confusion and unnecessary complications.", "timestamp_created": 1641067798, "timestamp_updated": 1641126660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554140150547027588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107064049": {"recommendationid": "107064049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010827368", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 492, "last_played": 1681593229}, "language": "english", "review": "This is hands down one of the best puzzle games/non-euclidiean.

Just because you've already run down a corridor and it has led nowhere, doesn't mean you can't then walk down the same corridor and have something else happen, or jump down the same corridor and have a different thing happen, or walk backwards down the corridor and have another thing happen. However, this does become rather tedious as the world expands and you start to find more and more dead ends. You come to a corridor, and think to yourself, \"have I already run down here, walked down here, jumped down here, walked down here backwards? Have I walked to that corner, then turned around and tried all of these separate things? I got to a point where I had approximately 30 different chambers, and after another half hour of getting nowhere decided to call it quits. Call it a lack of patience if you wish, but as something of an achievement hunter I have spent inordinate amounts of time on single achievements, so I don't think it's that. I just don't have any drive to discover the next door I can get through or platform I can open, because it simply means that the number of rooms I need to mindlessly explore has increased. Normally, I might use a guide if I was stuck on a particularly challenging puzzle in a game, but this doesn't drive me to want to want to get to the next stage.\n\nStory/Content: I didn't see much in the way of a story from my brief gameplay. You're in a room, trying to get into another room, and then into another one etc. The little snippets of wisdom were fun and allowed you to reflect on your solution to each puzzle as you got through it. Some were particularly relevant to what you'd just encountered, some more tangential.\n\nMusic: The music is what you might expect for this game - a slow paced, ethereal sounding track that you don't really notice unless you're listening out for it. The rest of the sounds are made by the player/environment. They fit the ambience well even if the sounds are a little annoying at times.\n\nGraphics/Visual: Visually, the game is designed to be out there. It has a blocky feel to it which is intentional, and feels fairly retro in that aspect when coupled with the vibrant colours. That being said, I did not enjoy the bright white, and had to turn the brightness of my screen down considerably to avoid my eyes hurting (and then back up again in the rooms where it was very dark).\n\nI would say, if this is on sale for cheap, give it a go. I certainly wouldn't recommend it at recommended retail price.\n\n\u201cThe most tenacious, infuriating obstacle you\u2019ll face throughout the game is yourself.\u201d\n\u2013 PC Gamer\nNo, it's the endless running around in circles going through rooms trying to find what you've missed.", "timestamp_created": 1638489638, "timestamp_updated": 1640621944, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621472775936126709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105057592": {"recommendationid": "105057592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385343988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1638824474}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a game that has a lot to teach you without saying a word.

Makes you feel like a complete moron and the biggest genious, like a great puzzle game should.\n\nI'll try to decribe it without spoilers as best I can but if you are super spoiler sensitive I'm going to just say it's probably a game for you (and what are you even doing reading reviews anyway?). Might sound weird, but I think that if you are here because you are curious about this game (i.e. likes first person puzzle games) and also very sensitive to spoilers about puzzle games, then you'll like this one.\n\nIt has a weird sense of progress. Not weird as in \"bad\" necessarily, but weird. There's the conventional progress towards the end goal, and then there is the completionist progress. Which, so far, not that weird. But it's a game where the end goal is not super clear, so you probably need to care about the completionist bit at least some to enjoy it properly. If you are the type of person who get's frustrated when you solve a puzzle and it turns out that you are not directly closer to the end goal, you might hate this game.\nI want to make clear that it's very well designed though. As a puzzle game. It's not that there are all these dead ends that are only good for the completionist, added on top of the route to the end goal to just flesh out the game. No, all the puzzles still have a purpose to get to the end goal. You just don't always realize *how* right away when you solve them. But solving a puzzle almost always feels like learning something new about the game. There is a huge amount of \"Oooh! I can do like *this*\" and \"So *that's* how it works!\" -feelings when playing this game. Solving a puzzle will almost always either get you \"physically\" closer to the end goal, or it will teach you something new about the rules of this world that you need to know to krack the other puzzles that does get you closer to the end goal. Or both. There's a lot of both.\nAnd sometimes you will not realise that you made progress until much later.\nIt's weird. It's amazing.\nI wrote an essay about this game for school so I could go on about it for a while, lol. I'm not going to.\n\nOne thing to note if you are interested to buy it:\nIf you are sensitive to motion sickness from playing first person games, this might not be your game unfortunately.\nYou can always buy it and see if it works for you and refund it if you don't.

Once the novelty of this has worn off, Antichamber is basically a normal puzzle game. Which is not a bad thing, there are some satisfying puzzles to solve, but it's not as \"psychological\" or \"brain-frying\" as some reviews might lead you to believe.\n\nOnce you've gotten used to Antichamber playing some 3D space warping tricks on you, you can start to focus on the puzzles. The puzzles in this game mainly involve the Brick Gun, which is capable of picking up, storing and manipulating small bricks you find throughout the maze. You progress through the game by finding upgrades to this gun, eventually getting one that has the abilities to unblock the exit. In your way of getting these upgrades are several puzzles involving bricks which can be manipulated by the Brick Gun.\n\nThere are more things to find than just the exit though. The most common thing are signs which tells you something profound about life. At times I personally found these a little pretentious, but the way they usually parallell the things you did to find them made them entertaining most of the time.\n\nThere are also rare purple blocks which are way more hidden than anything else in this game. I didn't feel the need to hunt down all of them.\n\nIf I can give one piece of advice that I felt the game should've told you about, is how to interpret the map.\nIn the Antechamber (no not a misspelling), which is where you begin and where you can go anytime by pressing ESC, there is a map of the whole maze. Large squares represent rooms in which you haven't found all the exits. Small squares represent rooms where you've found them all. Round \"cul-de-sac\"s are all dead ends. If you're stuck, check any rooms that are still large squares. Another piece of advice is to study the bricks you can manipulate with your Brick Gun. They have a few quirks that you need to make use of in order to progress through the maze.\n\nFinding all the signs and the exit to the end took around 7 hours. It might take longer depending on how long you're stuck. For me I'd say 2-3 hours were spent being stuck.\n\nIf you like puzzles, give this game a go. Make sure to marvel at how many corridors lead to the room \"Stairway to Heaven\".\nSeriously, that corridor is white like almost every other corridor in this game and you still just know that room is around the corner.", "timestamp_created": 1636495909, "timestamp_updated": 1636495909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0,

It differs from those games mostly in its presentation and its physics.\n\nAntichamber is not a pretty game. This is likely a combination of artistic style and budget constraints but you will be wandering the same white polygonal hallways over and over again with very little change in the scenery. This is function over form as this does make it very clear what objects you can interact and what you can't.\n\nAnd this is very important in Antichamber because its hallmark feature is that physics in this game bare no resemblance to our own world. Rooms move and disappear merely by not looking at them anymore. Turn a corner and the place you were just at has disappear. Which is not to say the game has no logical consistency. It does try to explain the rules by which this world operates. But there are still many times you'll just stare quizzically wondering why the ground fell out from under you or a room just disappeared, as it'll often seem capricious. This makes exploring a massive pain as you simply don't know if you can backtrack or not, as very likely the room you came from was replaced by something else entirely.\n\nWith that preface out of the way, [u]Antichamber[/u] does have some good puzzles. You will eventually start manipulating cubes to create matter, build bridges, and solve jigsaw style mazes. Some of these are very satisfying, others less so. Its other big foible is that this is less self contained puzzles rooms than it is Metroidvania. You won't know for sure if a given puzzle solvable because you lack a specific item/upgrade. Like most Metroivanias there is some color-coding going on to help you know but this isn't always present. \n\nThere is no story to speak off and sound design is passable. There is quite a lot of extra puzzles and Easter Eggs if you like what you see.\n\n[u]Antichamber[/u] gets a marginal thumbs up.

But then, it got more and more obscure and intentionally obtuse.  Crucial gameplay mechanics were *not* introduced to the player *at all* - forcing me, and probably others, to seek out a walkthrough to get through a few of the more obscure puzzles.  Two mechanics used in those puzzles I would have *zero* clue about, as the game likes to use really smarmy \"hur hur hur I'm so smart look at this vague hint about something you must have figured out by now\" comments on the walls.  \n\nAt a certain point, if the game doesn't tell you how to play it, it's the game's fault - and that is the problem with this game.  At the end, I just wanted the game to end - and that \"wanting the game to end\" lasted me more time than my initial enjoyment of the game.  For some of the puzzles that I had to look up, even with the walkthrough, I'm *still* not even sure if the puzzle was solved correctly or did I get lucky somehow brute forcing my way through particular sections?  If the player isn't sure what the game mechanics are, then the game did a poor job of communicating that - and this is done throughout.\n\nComparing this game to Portal does a disservice to Portal.  Portal always provides the means to solve the puzzles through actual hints - this game simply says stuff like \"you can make a garden anywhere\" which, without knowing what the heck that's supposed to mean, is completely meaningless - and even though I know now, because again - *walkthroughs* - I still wouldn't know what that meant if it was just me stumbling around [spoiler] you can make blocks if you do blocks of them and let them be filled in, but I didn't even know that was a mechanic! I didn't know why blocks would fill themselves in, it seemed completely random to me and I just went through them if I could!

This game does that to a degree, but it mostly forces you to stretch your creativity muscle and come up with new ways to solve the puzzles yourself. That is a very important distinction, and it makes Antichamber quite unlike any other 3D puzzle game out there.\n\nAs you've already seen from the screenshots on the store page, the game's visuals mostly consist of solid colours splashed onto featureless white rooms. This serves an important purpose, because the game contains a lot of instances of non-Euclidean geometry. Examples include hallways that end at the exact same point that you walked in and hallways that go right through each other yet don't actually seem to intersect. The visuals are built around the purpose of orienting you in this strange world.\n\nThe soundtrack is soothing, aids in concentration and doesn't distract you from the puzzles at all. More impressive is the way sounds of nature are sprinkled throughout the puzzles. Moving particles often sound like birds flapping their wings, landing on the ground after falling from a great height sounds like splashing into a pool of water while the game doesn't actually contain any sort of liquid anywhere, and sounds you'd normally hear in a rainforest form a subtle hint to move towards areas decked in green.\n\nAll of these elements in amalgamation create a unique, surreal atmosphere that makes the entire game feel like a very abstract dream. Antichamber will stay in your mind long after you've finished it, and you might find yourself coming back to it now and then.\n\nGoing through this game blind is, in my opinion, the main prerequisite to experience its brilliance in full. Unfortunately I spoiled myself with some parts of the game, and it made my adventure not as mindblowing as it probably could've been. Don't make the same mistake I did.

Where it falls short, however, is the at times non intuitive mechanics with the matter guns as well as a lack of indication to players that a room is just a room and sometimes that room is simply from the Devs. Puzzles felt smooth and doable and once you figured them out, there was certainly a satisfying \"aha!\" moment to revel in. That being said, I would have liked to see a bit more direction or indication where Dev rooms existed as I was literally stuck in one for a good chunk of time thinking I had a puzzle in front of me to solve (here's looking at you \"Over the Edge\"). Additionally,  controls for the matter guns could be frustrating for some of the longer puzzles. One instance that comes to mind is dragging blocks where you want them in a puzzle where the null barriers exist. Sometimes, you would misplace your end point and cause your entire block formation to march to their inevitable suicide into the unflinching conflagration that those barriers act as. As well, with the red matter gun, the default flow of blocks appears naturally vertical in nature. You can make a horizontal flow but at a very specific angle and setup and again, this is not intuitive to the player. Finally, being unable to capture this game in a full screen window was a minor annoyance, but not a deal breaker. It's surprising to stumble across a game that can't do that these days. All in all, if you are a fan of games like Portal or Myst where spacial puzzle solving is a sure thing to block your progress, this game is for you. 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1624374543, "timestamp_updated": 1624375129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618614733219146729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94121638": {"recommendationid": "94121638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169075831", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 442, "last_played": 1663173723}, "language": "english", "review": "Its really good!\n9.9/10", "timestamp_created": 1624292949, "timestamp_updated": 1624292949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94083374": {"recommendationid": "94083374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020977186", "num_games_owned": 4968, "num_reviews": 495, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1624223657}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly difficult, but certainly entertaining, puzzle game.

What I WANT is to put the powers of my mind into practice, and enjoy working towards epiphanies; what I DON'T want is to spend my time guessing at solutions that feel random, or trying ever more ridiculous alternatives because the correct solution, when I first try it out, doesn't seem to be panning out. In my opinion, the ideal solution shouldn't be obvious at first, but SHOULD FEEL obvious once you've figured it out.\n\nI try not to look up solutions, but if I start to suspect that I've run into a game design issue, I'll eventually hit the wiki, and usually when I do that I feel it was the right decision. I made it through Braid and maybe Portal without help from outside the game, so I really appreciate how they made me think without setting me up to waste my time guessing at what exactly the devs wanted from me.\n\nI'm not sure what kind of a game Antichamber wants to be. Most of the puzzles make you think to some degree, and that can be a lot of fun, but others merely ask you to reuse simple mechanics that you've already mastered, and still others are pretty random. For one of the game mechanics, there's no logic to it, you just have to try different things until you discover what the devs want you to do with it, and for a long while it's not clear that they want you to do anything at all. The map that shows you where you've been and which rooms you've solved is confusing, and when you're in the rooms, it's difficult to tell which colored walls are supposed to be interacted with and which just happen to be colored.\n\nI have a feeling that the devs wanted this to be a psychologically or spiritually educational experience, and that this explains why so many of the puzzles are designed to \"waste\" your time -- to help you learn the value of being persistent and attentive in real life, and of not being discouraged when some paths are a dead end, stuff like that. The game has a lot of posters with different life tips that are connected to the puzzles, like \"Patience can be rewarding\" and \"If both paths go to the same place, it doesn't matter which you choose.\" One room in particular, the trick is simply to keep doing the same thing over and over until, long past the point of reason, it starts to work for you. One particularly revealing poster: \"The more you've explored, the harder it is to find what you've missed.\" In other words, \"Welcome to the walking simulator part of this game.\" So it seems that most of the game-design \"flaws\" were inserted on purpose, to make you think about the limitations of puzzle-solving in real life, to prepare you to think as a person who has to make their way in a world that's often confusing and can't always be gamed.\n\nHow do I feel about this? I do appreciate the attempt to undermine what I call \"the gaming mindset\" -- \"Someone has told me I can 'win' by doing XYZ, so I'll spend dozens of hours trying to do just that, for no other reason than to hear someone tell me I succeeded.\" I'm glad they tried to offer something better than that. At the same time, I don't appreciate that this involves me running around to different rooms for thirty minutes at a time trying to figure out what exactly still needs doing and whether I can even do it yet. That's not a real alternative to the gaming mindset -- from one angle, it's a distillation of it: I'll keep doing XYZ, not because I enjoy it, but because I have to do it to \"progress.\"\n\nThis wouldn't be the case if I really felt I learned something new and precious from this game. I'm fine with being bored and frustrated for a while if I get something greater out of it, even in a game. But I already have the rest of my life to drill these lessons into me through personal experience. When I fire up a game on a Friday night, I've spent 40+ hours that week working as a cog in the corporate machine, reviewing documents for ultimately insignificant errors, and \"collaborating\" on projects and meetings that will have to be undone the next week with more projects and more meetings. If I'm going to play a game that wants to teach me something about that sort of experience, I'd like it to teach me without submitting me to EVEN MORE of that experience. At least, it should warn me at the start what kind of game it is, in no uncertain terms. That way I can devote my leisure time to activities I actually like, and if I suspect that I need a little more practice with patience, I'll know just where to go.\n\nUltimately, I stopped playing just before the end of the game. Couldn't convince myself that it was worth another minute of my time. For me, escaping the \"gaming mindset\" with Antichamber meant putting the game down. That's particularly unfortunate because it's pretty obvious that it was made by clever and thoughtful people.", "timestamp_created": 1622576285, "timestamp_updated": 1622576309, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574383795261383057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92991910": {"recommendationid": "92991910", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998944556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 545, "last_played": 1518351731}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1622553986, "timestamp_updated": 1622553986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92892482": {"recommendationid": "92892482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198973199385", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 416, "last_played": 1697697907}, "language": "english", "review": "Its one of if not my favorite games.

Anyone can add together the best elements of a game, but when summed together, they don't achieve greatness unless the ideas that brought them all together (the user experience, not just the interaction experience) has followed a vision and been masterfully crafted towards that vision. I loved what this game gave to me and am really thankful that someone went to the effort of making it. It was hard and frustrating at times. But I could think about it while being away from the game, leave it for a long period, and then come back with fresh eyes and often move forward. I think if this game kept going forever, I would play it forever. I've been gaming for 32 years and this gave me something new and one of my best gaming experiences.

It is based largely around using a \"brick gun\" and using it to place and manipulate different-colored bricks. It heavily rewards exploration and experimentation\u2014so heavily that it doesn't actually reward them but rather it requires them both in copious amounts. It is not for everyone: the garish, abstract graphics and topological spaces will make some peoples' heads spin.\n\nWhat I like about Antichamber is that it's utterly unique. The only thing I've seen that comes remotely close to capturing the essence of Antichamber in recent years is \"There Is No Game\" and its sequel, and even then, those games are vastly different because they're illogical, whereas Antichamber is logical. Antichamber makes [i]you[/i] into the puzzle. Like the trailer says, you are your own greatest obstable, and every aspect of the game is there to get you out of your comfort zone and challenge your presuppositions. Almost every puzzle has its own idea, and some of them make you feel like you\u2019re breaking the rules.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t like about Antichamber is how stupid it makes me feel sometimes. But other times it makes me think my brain is too big to fit inside my skull.\n\nI would recommend it to patient puzzle-lovers who aren\u2019t sensitive to the graphics or the disorienting geometry. This game is like a seven-course dessert (at least for me): don\u2019t consume it all at once. Take a bite, and when you\u2019re full, walk away for a bit and come back for more later.

It makes heavy use of rooms with geometry that is seemingly impossible in the real world. This non-Euclidean style of gameplay makes for some interesting and fascinating puzzles that I thoroughly enjoyed. While great, I would have liked to see Antichamber make even more use of them. While some of the cube puzzles were really fun, others felt like they didn't have much or anything to do with the non-Euclidean geometry that made this game so fun. The gameplay is absolutely the core of Antichamber. If you won't enjoy non-Euclidean puzzles, you won't enjoy this game. If you are interested in this however, I think it is a wonderful experience.\n\nThe game has no plot beyond teasing you with the exit of whatever non-Euclidean complex you've found yourself in at various points. There is, however, signs. When interacted with, they provide vague hints for the various puzzles that double as life advice, which I felt was a neat touch.\n\nThe game's music is very well suited to the game. The tracks aren't distracting, fading into the background as you focus on puzzles. The game's music fits the ambience very well, though when removed from the context of the game it is not particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe simple graphics prevents visual distractions from the puzzles, and in my opinion is fairly enjoyable. However, many people have reported motion sickness from this game so if that affects you I would definitely keep that in mind.\n\nOverall I found Antichamber a highly enjoyable and unique puzzle game.

If you blink or turn your camera .00001 degrees you'll be sure to miss something. And even with this barrage of mindf**kery, Bruce does a fantastic job of balancing intrigue with stress.

[/i]\n\nCon todo lo anterior aclarado, te invito a continuar:\n\n[h1] AntiChamber [/h1]\n\nUn juego de Puzzles y desaf\u00edos mentales que intentara mantenerte atento para que no te pierdas en las extra\u00f1as reglas por las que se gu\u00eda este lugar que estas recorriendo, con una meta relativamente clara; explorar y superar desaf\u00edos, tendr\u00e1s que enfrentarte a tu propia mente y hacerte capaz de abrirla para asi aprender y entender todo lo que te rodea.\n\n[h1] Apartados Considerados [/h1]\n\n[b] Jugabilidad [/b]:\n\nAntiChamber es un juego de primera persona y lo que mayormente estar\u00e1s haciendo ser\u00e1 recorrer el mapa y pensar, y mucho. Con controles simples de mirar objetos e intentar complenderlos junto a las mec\u00e1nicas del juego sentradas en hacert\u00e9 pensar, observar y aprender\u2026 poco se puede decir de este apartado para crear un gran peso. Pero si es por decir algo relevante, no pase un mal rato al caminar por todo el recinto de AntiChamber.\n\n--------------\n\n[b] Visual [/b]:\n\n[i] Aunque este campo lo considero necesario, no soy bueno al momento de Juzgar correctamente este apartado [/i] (T\u00e9ngalo presente)\n\nLa tem\u00e1tica y dise\u00f1o es tan simple como puede, superficies de colores planos y objetos completamente c\u00fabicos en su mayor\u00eda te dar\u00e1n una experiencia visual muy comun, pero la magia aparece con los juegos mentales que estos simples pero enga\u00f1osos entornos intentaran jugarte mientras recorres los pasillos, escaleras y otros lugares mas. No te dejes enga\u00f1ar por lo simple que todo se ve, esconden su belleza e inter\u00e9s en lo profundo de la mente.\n\n--------------\n\n[b] Historia [/b]:\n\nSi es por referirse a una historia, con seguridad puedo decir que AntiChamber posee un final, posiblemente no habr\u00e1 un desarrollo de personajes ni nada por el estilo, pero si tenemos un objetivo, que se nos presenta antes de jugar; el explorar todo lo que este juego nos quiere mostrar. Mientras mas tiempo pases en los pasillos, AntiChamber te guiara hacia nuevos objetivos, por lo que no temas, nunca perderas el norte. (Quizas si el camino\u2026 pero sabes a donde tienes que llegar)\n\n--------------\n\n[b] Dificultad [/b]:\n\nEste no es un juego facil de catalogar en niveles de dificultad, pero no lo mostraria como algo f\u00e1cil, pero a la vez tampoco dif\u00edcil, es tan ambiguo como el juego mismo. La dificultad para superar los desaf\u00edos estar\u00e1 a la par con cuanto te niegues a ver lo que ocurre, algo que haras en los primeros minutos de juego inconscientemente. Si eres bueno pillando detalles, sin duda pasaras las pruebas, o al menos las descifraras con rapidez. Pero este juego lo catalogar\u00eda como una aventura, no te apresures en superar los desaf\u00edos, aprecia lo que vas aprendiendo, busca los desaf\u00edos, no por el querer terminar este juego, sino porque quieres ver que tienen para ense\u00f1arte.\n\n--------------\n\n[h1] Veredicto [/h1]\n\nAntiChamber es un juego Hermoso, su apartado grafico es simple, pero es el como pinta en tu cabeza l\u00f3gica y entendimiento lo hermoso. Siento que debe verse como una experiencia, no como un desafio, disfrutar de como te plantean los desaf\u00edos, tener que estar atento al mas m\u00ednimo detalle, son las cosas que le entregan una belleza muy curiosa a este juego. Pero algo importante, para este juego sin duda tienes que poseer paciencia, el bloquearte puede ser algo com\u00fan en un juego de este estilo. Se consciente en lo que te metes, tendr\u00e1s que usar bastante tu cabeza.\n\nEn resumen: un juego altamente recomendado, nunca esta mal entrenar la cabeza, mas aun cuando se trata de cosas que se escapan a nuestra l\u00f3gica com\u00fan y corriente. Y poco mas, tan simple como esto, pero expandido en otro transfondo. \n---------------\n\n[i] Toda esta rese\u00f1a est\u00e1 basada en el gameplay subido en el canal de Youtube a nombre de esta cuenta de Steam (No dejo link ya que considero que mi contenido es basura) [/i]\n\nMuchas gracias por leer, espero, estimo y deseo que est\u00e9n bien.

The game is also a bit short but for the quality and the low price it's really not a problem, there are even a few secrets to find that give cool information about the game and it's creation.

It's a beautiful example of hard dev work and a unique experience for sure. It\u00a0might throw some people off because there is no standard tutorial. You have to find everything on your own. That said, it's not that big of a mindfuck as I thought it would be. There is still an elementary logic to your paths and they stay the same every time\u00a0you take them.\nAlthough I didn't have the patience to finish Talos Principle on my own (some secret puzzles relied on you finding the \"needle in the haystack\" solution, aka where to put your crystal staff) I tried to finish Antichamber with no help at all.\nI did not succeed because, again, I did not have the patience but I would suggest taking your time with each puzzle. The ones I missed were only three and it took about 3 seconds of video total to find the missing link. If you are a bit like me you will hate that you were 99% done with the solution and didn't wait for the last \"struck of lightning\" in your head. Then again, time is money, so choose whatever.\nI comprised a list of those I didn't have the patience for so you can check it later if you will get stuck:[spoiler]1. Managing Resources - I haven't found a way how to create more cubes. It's dead simple if you know how to do it. You need to close a border of a 3x3 rectangle and the middle piece will appear. 2.

Antichamber happens. No other puzzle game matches Antichamber for the mind games it plays with the player, and it does all this with minimalism and simplicity at its forefront. Somehow, this works. The puzzles will stick in your mind for quite a while, and its difficulty curve does a great job keeping the player engaged and curious.\n\nThere's not too much of a plot here; you're plopped into a map hub room. One wall has game options and controls which are interactive (removing the need for a menu), another has an inspirational saying, a third has a rudimentary map, and the fourth has a big window showing the exit door. In order to enter the game, the player has to choose a room from the map and then go from there.\n\nThere's not too much to explain about the puzzles. You'll eventually find a tool that allows you to manipulate colored blocks in order to block beams or make walkways, but most of the rooms will have multiple solutions based on your actions. For example, you might find something that tells you to walk. Walking will produce one result, while running another. Maybe turning around and leaving will elicit a third exit. What Antichamber does is manipulate the environment to move you to an entirely different room or to change something without you seeing it, and it does it so well that you won't notice until it's too late. The joy in the game is finding all the solutions to a room and seeing where it takes you. And if you want to go back there, it's as simple as pressing escape and selecting the room again from the map hub.\n\nThe environments are pretty spartan, even though they are a masterclass in designing non-Euclidean spaces. More inspirational messages dot the walls before and after rooms, and lighting and colors help the player quickly identify important landmarks and doors, even from a distance. As some downsides to the game, a lot of it is black-on-white which is hard on my eyes and forces me to take breaks before I end up with a headache. Another is the lack of decent sound; there is a mix of ambient sounds and music, but they aren't memorable and just kind of blend into the walls as you won't notice it after an hour or so. The third (and a personal opinion) is a particular texture which is a giant eye. That thing is massively creepy, but requires you to [spoiler]stare at it[/spoiler] to beat the game. I hate it, and in one particular room, ALT+F4'd right out of the game after one showed up out of nowhere. I wouldn't care if it looked like a normal eye, but the way it's drawn just keeps me from replaying this more than I do.\n\nAnother complaint is that the game is short. Like, 10 hours max, less if you're skilled at puzzlers. Finally, the map in the map hub needs a legend. I don't believe you should have to search up what the symbols mean in order to know where you went or where you came from, but you should be able to figure it out after a bit. But overall, Antichamber is a great puzzle game.

And when you start to eplore the rooms and get to new spots and learn new ways to go through the game you find new places to get. \nAlso when you earn new abilities and can use them in spots that you thought \"what am I supposed to do here\" before, just an amazing thing. \nAlso the nice \"ahhhh yes\" moments when you cet the tricks on puzzles that you could not solve before, had that for the 100% a few times.\n\nAlso, I thought the map and stuff doesn\u00b4t make any sense first, the game just randomly puts you in a spot. At the end I started to learn how the map works and I could start to plan my moves for the missing rooms.\nWould allmost say I promise you will start to understand how things happen when you play through the game, you learn where to not go without getting somewere you don\u00b4t want to get and were to look to finish up everything you want.\n\nThere was only one puzzle that I didn\u00b4t liked that much, a puzzle were it was random if you could get through it or not. 100% people may know wich one. Luckly its not required to beat the game. I had the right idea but I had to look that one up to get through it, happily to say its the only one I looked up.\n\nAlso, I had not the best PC for playing it, it lagged at some spots, but never to be unplayable. \nAlso the simple grafic with the white/colorlight theme is nice to watch, makes it feel like a weird puzzlegame were you could just get somewere you were before and the way changes behind you.\n\nTotally recommend that one if you like puzzlegames, it\u00b4s worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1609281434, "timestamp_updated": 1609281962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83504499": {"recommendationid": "83504499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198437021090", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 334, "last_played": 1609533676}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing brain puzzle.

The frustration comes because you're wrestling with your own brain as you unravel the ways in which your own thought process prevents you from moving forward. \n\nThe joy of playing comes when you change your own brainwaves, and suddenly everything falls into place.

It's an extremely tight puzzle that respects the player. The whole game is a trick box, and not a single polygon of it is wasted. There's no filler, nothing is arbitrary. The laconic presentation reinforces the feeling: you're here for the puzzles, and every single one of them is worth it.\n\nEvery. Single. One.\n\nUnlike the vast majority of puzzle games, [i]Antichamber[/i] does everything to avoid self-repetition. There are no 'series' or 'types' of puzzles, no 'stages' here; sure, some principles and tricks repeat themselves, but most puzzles are unique. A [i]Talos Principle[/i]-like \"you get less keys than doors\" puzzle? One. Jumping pads? Seen twice. Unlocking a door by breaking a chain of cubes into several pieces in a labyrinth? Seen twice \u2014 before you find a mathematically unsolvable one.\n\nIt's not unsolvable, of course. It just tricks you into thinking you've found another puzzle in a series, while in truth the principle behind it is different this time.\n\nThis is what [i]Antichamber[/i] excels at, and this is what makes it brilliant: most puzzles in the game \u2014 and there are quite a lot \u2014 have very simple solutions and demand lateral thinking rather than counting or sleuth of hand. Found a ladder? Actually, you need to go through a wall. A jumping platform facing a ledge? Actually, you need to jump in another direction [i]through[/i] a ladder. A floor-less room?\n\nHave you tried using the hint hanging above you as a physical object?\n\nThere are some unlocks that make progress possible and add new rules, but very few of them. Most of the game's variety hinges on the insane inventiveness of the puzzles, redirecting attention, and toying with the player. As a result, every single rooms becomes a unique challenge \u2014 and solving each of them feels [i]great.[/i]\n\nThe closest comparison I can make is [i]The Witness[/i] \u2014 clearly taking a lesson or two from [i]Antichamber's[/i] book. It's another puzzle game that also emphasizes wholeness, unexpected solutions, and where nothing is random. [i]The Witness[/i] has a much more chic presentation and does some things better, like teaching new rules (it took me way, way too long to get adjusted to how the Red Gun works). And yet even [i]The Witness[/i], however great, pales in comparison; its series of similar puzzles seem clunky, same-y and unnecessary.\n\n[i]Antichamber[/i] isn't perfect. Some abilities are a bit clunky (like shifting cubes), the very ending has a puzzling jumping challenge that doesn't fit the game's tone, and it's also very hard to get back to if you've abandoned it for like a week. But these are all minor points.\n\nIt's a great game. You should play it. Everyone should. It requires zero special skills, only ingenuity, logic, perceptiveness, and the ability to think outside the box. This is an absolute paragon of what puzzle games should be about \u2014\u00a0and one of the best uses of gaming medium I've ever seen.", "timestamp_created": 1608082367, "timestamp_updated": 1608082521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.802290380001068115", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82459828": {"recommendationid": "82459828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043137099", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1608072247}, "language": "english", "review": "Reviewing puzzle games is quite difficult.

I just revisited it after a while and finally finished it. I hardly can compare this game to any other one. \n\nThis was an experience. Somewhat like life is. I can only recommend it!\n\nLike in real life you question things: shall you believe in what you see and the thoughts and concepts you had about the world and your environment? These questions will linger with you throughout the whole journey. And as you happen to get to know the world around you, you will get more experienced, you can tackle the challenges you were not able to before. With the experience you can reach new places, and new places come with new tools. These tools can help you greatly and what was difficult earlier becomes one of the most easiest tasks you've ever seen. You will revisit these unsolvable challenges several times (within the game and life as well), but with the skillset, experience and tools you collected throughout your journey they are not impossible anymore.\n\nThe game is not holding your hands by any means. Whatever signs you see you shall listen to them, all of them have a purpose. The game will provide you philosophical ideas which have hidden hints and also things to bring with you to real life. You have to learn, question things, and yes, you will be driven crazy sometimes, but so does life with us.\n", "timestamp_created": 1606158220, "timestamp_updated": 1606158220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589289486408233643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79705730": {"recommendationid": "79705730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079855593", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1606133728}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool", "timestamp_created": 1606133960, "timestamp_updated": 1606133960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79686798": {"recommendationid": "79686798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031997711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 335, "last_played": 1629238330}, "language": "english", "review": "I made it to the sign that says \"EXIT\" that they tease you with in the beginning and the game tried to mess with me some more, and I was like; \"Nope, that's it.

You cannot disable view bobbing. You can only choose from THREE preset mouse sensitivity settings. You can only completely disable ALL sound - no separate controls for music, ambiance, and effects/feedback. You cannot remap colors in a game dependent on colors.\n\nThis game is presented as an open-ended puzzle exploration game. There is, apparently, a path you need to (loosely) follow to unlock tools and learn mechanics - but the game makes no attempt to nudge you to this path or indicate that you literally cannot solve the puzzle you're working on, no matter how long you plug away at it.\n\nIn fact, the in-game map has a ton of different icons that are both not explained with any sort of key and completely out of line with standard UI affordances. That flashing area isn't a suggested next puzzle - it's where you last were. \n\nAs a result, if you get off the \"intended\" track early on, you will spend a lot of time banging your head against currently impossible puzzles until you realize there *IS* a necessary order, falling through space surrounded by unavoidable flashing colors, walking your little view-bobbing body in circles through hallways trying to locate more puzzles you CAN complete, and trying to distinguish between \"small\" and \"large\" squares (the difference is a handful of pixels) on a map three or four times your height.\n\nAs for the puzzles themselves: They were fine, if easy. The ones I had the tools to solve mostly flew by with no challenge, either because they were easy or because I accidentally found \"the catch.\" I didn't get any satisfying \"aha!\" moments, but I also didn't play long.\n\nSome people might love the meta-puzzle of determining what you are supposed to tackle in what order. Personally, between the lack of hints, misleading interface, smarmy posters, and nausea, I found it a downright infuriating waste of time.\n\nEven at 50% off, I don't recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1604285195, "timestamp_updated": 1604285195, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485361695289611816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78557352": {"recommendationid": "78557352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024088293", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1604270217}, "language": "english", "review": "A fucked up journey for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1604270369, "timestamp_updated": 1604270369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519026279449462891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78545648": {"recommendationid": "78545648", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998424663", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1604257285}, "language": "english", "review": "Alzheimer simulator", "timestamp_created": 1604257312, "timestamp_updated": 1604257312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78501743": {"recommendationid": "78501743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198841027663", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1658809675}, "language": "english", "review": "just beat my first run, probably one of the best and most challenging puzzle games i've played to date.", "timestamp_created": 1604201152, "timestamp_updated": 1604201152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78493505": {"recommendationid": "78493505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284234525", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1656180746}, "language": "english", "review": "head feels swag", "timestamp_created": 1604188272, "timestamp_updated": 1604188272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78473210": {"recommendationid": "78473210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424820369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1677525935}, "language": "english", "review": "What the hell is this game?

When I first played Antichamber I didn\u2019t like it.  The visuals put me off, not because I wanted better visuals but because I had this dumb notion that if the graphics were not good then how could I trust that the puzzles were watertight?  Once I finally overcame this utter stupidity, I was ready to play Antichamber.  Not all puzzle games need to be visually awesome like Talos, Witness and Portal.  I honestly don\u2019t know what I was thinking.  Maybe I was high\u2026..but I couldn\u2019t have been high because when I started getting into Antichamber I felt like I was REALLY high\u2026.like call me an ambulance, my brain is turning into jelly, high.\n\nDon\u2019t be like me.  Please, if you like amazing puzzle games, play Antichamber for more than 3 hours.  You have to cross that threshold.  Let getting the blue gun be like \u201csomewhere outside Barstow on the edge of the desert,\u201d and then you can really dive deep into the rabbit hole.\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n\n[list]+  incredibly complex, yet simple.  Yes you will be baffled at the start.  Don\u2019t worry.  That\u2019s the point.  Antichamber wants you to take everything you think you know about puzzle games, maps, geometry, physics and even life itself and take a step to the left into the 5th dimension.  Up is down, down is strawberry jam and backwards is yes.  Antichamber will not allow you to take full control until the very end and will do its utmost to marinade your brain for as long as possible.  But at the right time you will be Neo in The Matrix and you will laugh at how all these puzzles confused you at first.[/list]\n\n[list]+  experimentation.  So if I pull a cube on the x-y axis I can move it into position to open a door!  Awesome!  Wait\u2026.this is just a crazy idea but what would happen if I pulled it along the z-axis?  Would that even work?  The only way to advance in Antichamber is to be creative, think outside the box and don\u2019t be limited by your own imagination.  You will find yourself up against impossible odds\u2026..and quite frankly they are impossible by definition because they defy the laws of physics, so thinking about them rationally just won\u2019t do.  You need to figure out your own lifehacks to this bizarre dimension.[/list]\n\n[list]+  wait\u2026.are those electrons\u2026.pigeons?  The sounds in Antichamber are fantastic.  The music is great and is so subtle as to not take you out of the game or to give you a false hope you are gaining traction in a certain area.  The whole soundboard and soundtrack is sublime.  Mad flashing electrons flutter around like pigeons in a coop, you will fall through huge holes to crashing thunder and land in a puddle of water despite everything being white walls and floors with almost no frills attached.[/list]\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n\n[list]-  difficulty curve.  While most puzzlers start small and scaffold you up, Antichamber, well, does the anti of that and starts big and then the game gets easier over time.  This was incredibly frustrating for me because I didn\u2019t know if what I was trying was even correct and I didn\u2019t know if I could trust the programming or puzzles of the game.  Were there glitches and bugs?  Was the puzzle logical?  I can say now looking back that yes, the game is solid but I see a ton of friends who own this game who never made it past the 90 minute mark.  Either they farmed it for cards or they just gave up.  And I totally understand that.[/list]\n\n[list]- am I doing this right? There are no cheevos for Antichamber.  So I think I did all the extra stuff?  But I\u2019m not sure.  This game is very much like The Witness in that the rewards for completing the hard tasks is the knowledge that you completed them but even in The Witness there are 2 cheevos.  One for completing the game and then one for COMPLETING THE GAME.[/list]   \n\n[h1] THE CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nAntichamber is an incredible game.  The poor developer Alexander Bruce was the only developer and he got so burnt out by the game it looks like he has given it all up and is now a regular software engineer for a tech company.  Even if this is the only game he ever makes it will stand as a testament to how insane you can push the limits of something and people will still manage to unravel your madness and not only will they solve it\u2026..they will enjoy it.\n\nI am so happy I pushed through Antichamber.  Don\u2019t be like 90 minute Antichamber me.  Challenge your mind and defeat String Theory.\n", "timestamp_created": 1602011682, "timestamp_updated": 1602011682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912538290023803711", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77138937": {"recommendationid": "77138937", "author": {"steamid": "76561199016660343", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3996, "last_played": 1631463839}, "language": "english", "review": "Not fun.", "timestamp_created": 1602008155, "timestamp_updated": 1602008155, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45267486572265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77114156": {"recommendationid": "77114156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855167071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1601960785}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing puzzles", "timestamp_created": 1601967456, "timestamp_updated": 1601967456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77107620": {"recommendationid": "77107620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119361158", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 950, "last_played": 1698652078}, "language": "english", "review": "its just cool, man", "timestamp_created": 1601952847, "timestamp_updated": 1601952847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77099403": {"recommendationid": "77099403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043188359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 621, "last_played": 1665852440}, "language": "english", "review": "Mind bending fun", "timestamp_created": 1601936318, "timestamp_updated": 1601936318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77025780": {"recommendationid": "77025780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032186568", "num_games_owned": 654, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1601831272}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished it after 7 Years and I am still as clueless as before.

YES. This game feels like both an adventure and a series of puzzles, but it doesn't need to be in a systematic order. The fact that the puzzle doesn't have an order (except for block guns) makes you feel as if you're in the void, but it's just so... relaxing. Straightforward thinking gets you nowhere in this game, and instead you have to break the boundaries of rationality by not only using reasoning, but also imagination. This might make no sense, but when I explore in this game and encounter puzzles I feel like my mind is all over the place but also nowhere, and it does not disturb me, it's mesmerizing. The art style perfectly fits with the 'void-like' atmosphere of the game, and how it's simultaneously simplistic and complicated. The music almost feels sleep-inducing, but it's so relaxing that it just makes me forget about my mental exhaustion... it helps my mind think like crazy and stay calm at the same time. I think every aspect of this game's design is all too well-calculated, and it is deserving of more popularity among the Steam community and Puzzle gaming community. The price might be a little rough, but if you have plenty steam money or find that the game is on sale (I had to buy it when on sale), you really should buy it and experience the same serene (and HOW-DO-I-SOLVE-THIS) experiences that I had when playing this game", "timestamp_created": 1601339983, "timestamp_updated": 1601339983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76721385": {"recommendationid": "76721385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026491146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1395, "last_played": 1601312908}, "language": "english", "review": "Non linear lateral thinking puzzle, might make you dizzy at first.

That is not a typo.   You are exploring a space that defies normal geometry trying to find the exit.  Maybe.  You're not given a lot of information.  Just a central room you can return to at will, a map in that room to chart your progress, and a door marked EXIT behind a glass wall.\n\nOh.  And there's a countdown timer.\n\nThis game is made to mess with you.  There are places in it where you can go along a path, than backtrace your steps and not return to where you started.  There are places where you can make ten right turns in quick succession and not be looping.  There is at least one door that always closes when you look at it.  Cubes that show different contents depending on which side you look at.  Floors that aren't.  Steps that may be.\n\nThen there are the motivational posters.  Sometimes they give hints on what you're supposed to do to get past some puzzling situation.  Sometimes they try to encourage.  Sometimes they come off as smug.  Examples include \"Failure to succeed is not failure to progress.\"  \"Sometimes what you come back to is not the same as what you left.\"  They are collectible, in that there's a status wall at the center of the game that tracks which ones you've encountered.\n\nIt's pretty.  It's an art piece.  It's entertaining.  A chunk of work went into designing it all, I'm sure.  But I got it in a HB bundle, and I don't see myself spending the current store price of $19.99 for it.

People keep using words like rewarding, interesting, and awesome, and I'm trying hard to see it, but I just don't see it.  First I thought it maybe just wasn't for me, but I absolutely love games like Portal and The Turing Test.  I thought maybe I was just mad because it was too hard, but I love minimalist puzzles of all difficulties from Zork to Tametsi, and I routinely marathon through unconventional adventures with no hints.  I thought maybe it was too psychological and non-linear, but I love The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide.\n\nSo I pushed myself for several hours past the point of losing interest early, and I actually covered a lot more ground, unlocking what appears (on the wall that tracks you) to be over 2/3 of the game, having solved over half of that.  I did not find the new abilities interesting, and I did not enjoy seeing what came next.  What am I supposed to do with a game where the puzzle solutions don't feel satisfying to me and the environment doesn't interest me enough to even use a walk-through so I can see it?\n\nSo I'm writing this review to say that even if you like hard, psychological, unconventional, minimalist first-person puzzles, that doesn't mean you'll like this game.

If it were only for the puzzles, I don't know if I would recommend getting this game at full price (but I definitely would recommend it on sale), the puzzles are not what makes this game great, in my opinion. So if all you want is a Portal-style puzzle game, then you probably wouldn't enjoy this game as much as Portal.\n\nInstead, what I personally really enjoyed is the atmosphere of the game. You are basically wandering in what looks like a strange \"\"\"\"\"lab\"\"\"\"\", full of strange shapes and objects (which most of the time are only marginally related to the actual puzzle), without any explanation about why you are there, or what is the actual goal. Speaking of the goal, there are a lot of puzzles, but only 4 sets of puzzles, plus the final part, are actually required to finish the game. Everything else is just there, but there is also no way to know if a certain puzzle is one of this 4 (you only know that for sure [spoiler] once you collect an upgrade for your gun. [/spoiler] ). Again, this may be really frustrating if you prefer a more linear story such as in Portal. However, each section of the \"lab\" comes with its own twist, not only in the form of new puzzles, but also because there are a lot of black squares scattered around the whole map. These squares all contain images and a brief description, that are somehow related to the puzzle, but most of the times also have a deeper meaning. [spoiler] One of these squares is actually revealed when the fake 90-minute timer in the hub runs out. [/spoiler] Finally, there are some hidden purple cubes all over the map, which you can look for if you are a completionist [spoiler] although there is no reward in-game for finding them all [/spoiler].\n\nSo, this is a puzzle game, but the exploration part is arguably even more important. In the end, playing this game should feel more like reading a book. A very confusing book, sure, but ultimately one of those books that you end up appreciating, and maybe read again. Or maybe a book you'll NEED to read multiple times before \"understanding\" it. In my opinion, this is how you should approach this game to enjoy it the most. [spoiler] Or just consider it an LSD-less way to have an LSD trip. That also works.

It's such a great game to replay and explore, It really does subvert your expectations. You think that you have an idea how to solve a puzzle, and 2 puzzles later you realize you were doing it way harder than you needed. It's interesting how linear yet non linear this game is, how many hidden places can be revisited after you have learned new things.
