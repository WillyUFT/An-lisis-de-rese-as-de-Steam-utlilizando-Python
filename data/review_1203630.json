It wants to be Symphony of the Night, to the point of lifting the main character's walking animation, but falls miserably short.\n\nThe biggest problem in this game is the map design, as there is none whatsoever. Rooms are randomly chained together without making any kind of sense, either thematically or in progression/gameplay terms. There is no reason for any room to exist in the way it does other than wasting your time and making travel from boss A to boss B slightly longer. Exploration is unrewarding and boring, as enemies pose no threat and most of the time you can destroy them way before they attack (except in cases where their placement puts them out of range, which is not fun to deal with). You can skip some travel time thanks to teleporter rooms, but they are often poorly placed, far from any checkpoint, boss room or interesting location.\n\nIn any case, backtracking is not generally required as the game follows a linear progression with separated 'zones'. You get some rewards in terms of weapons or stats if you backtrack and explore, but those are minor and not needed. All weapons play and feel the same so you should just simply get the one which deals more damage. A few weapons implement some gimmick, but it's always useless. For example, a sword drains enemy MP, but it drains so little you'd need to clear an entire room in order to gain enough MP for a single spell, or some bows fire multiple arrows, but then divide the damage between them, so it's also useless.\n\nYou get movement upgrades, which are a highlight of the game because your character handles well once upgraded, but most of the exploration areas are unlocked by colored doors instead.\n\nCombat is simplistic. The game relies heavily in a elemental mechanic where you can change your color and everything has elemental affinity. This mechanic is poorly executed and removes the fun from dodging enemy attacks since it very often becomes a game of matching colors. \n\nBoss design is bad. The game overuses humanoid enemies all the time. In addition, bosses with multiple phases are poorly designed, more often than not with a second phase that has absolutely nothing to do with the first one. Boss attacks sometimes have missing or broken tells, but fortunately the game is easy and very often you can simply exploit boss weaknesses and magic to chesse them from a distance.\n\nThe story makes no sense and has nothing to do with Lodoss, and neither are the locations you visit. The characters have a Lodoss skin but that's all.\n\nAt the end of the day, there are a ton of far better metroidvanias to play, many of them with very similar mechanics and handling.", "timestamp_created": 1700054538, "timestamp_updated": 1700054538, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150095508": {"recommendationid": "150095508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019190274", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 255, "playtime_at_review": 503, "last_played": 1700010033}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet.

As a result I am only narrowly recommending this.\n\nA decent enough short Castlevania-style Metroidvania that is overpriced considering the length of the game.  \n\nI chose not to finish the game, but it was fine enough.\n\nThe most notable thing is that your character has 2 forms, and you can press a button at any moment to switch between them.  When in one form, you are immune to red attacks, when in the other, blue.\n\nThe earliest example of this that I'm aware of is in a bullet hell shoot'em up game called Ikaruga.\n\nThis system is both good and bad, but I lean more toward bad.  While for the purposes of avoiding attacks, this mostly works, it can also lead to plenty of frustration as a result of the other things that occur when you switch forms.  Most notably the ability to hover in the air, which only works in one form.  If you avoid a bunch of attacks by changing form then need to jump and hover, it's very easy to lose track of which form you are in and end up taking needless damage.\n\nThe exploration has plenty of different ways to go, though the rooms are very small, and as a result often one-dimensional.\n\nThe camera is also too zoomed in, the game feels claustrophobic.\n\nAll in all, it's a fine metroidvania, though somewhat unremarkable.  It was narrowly playable/enjoyable enough to finish up in my C tier.  It is very overpriced as well.  I wouldn't pay more than $5 USD.  At that price it would be easier to justify the purchase.\n\n=====================\n[b]My Metroidvania Tier List[/b]    [i] (excluding Metroid & Castlevania titles)[/i]\n=====================\n\n[b]S Tier:[/b]  Aeterna Noctis | Astalon: Tears of the Earth | Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom | Hollow Knight | Cathedral |\n\n[b]A Tier:[/b]  Doomblade | Afterimage | Elderand | Ori and the Will of the Wisps | Environmental Station Alpha | Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights | Depths of Sanity |\n\n[b]B Tier:[/b]  Blast Brigade | Alwa\u2019s Legacy | Steamworld Dig 2 | Islets | Blasphemous | After Death | Pronty | Haak | Outbuddies DX | Mortal Manor | Escape From Tethys | Treasure Adventure Game | Chasm | Haiku, the Robot | Monster Sanctuary | Rabi-Ribi | Elliot Quest |\n\n[b]C Tier[i] (enjoyed playing)[/i]:[/b]  Momodora: Reverie under the Moonlight | Lone Fungus | Aggelos | Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night | Death\u2019s Gambit: Afterlife | Catmaze | Omega Strike | Plague of Yamorn | Sheepo | Infernax | [b]Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth[/b] | Carrion | Wuppo | Iconoclasts | Ato |\n\n[b]D Tier[i] (liked some things, but had issues)[/i]:[/b]  Moonscars | Rusted Moss | The Messenger | Castle In The Darkness | Alwa\u2019s Awakening | Pharaoh Rebirth | Yoku\u2019s Island Express | Guacamelee! 2 | Shantae and the Pirate\u2019s Curse | Shantae: Half-Genie Hero | Headlander | Axiom Verge | Strider | Minoria | Souldiers | Bone Appetit | The Witch & the 66 Mushrooms | Transiruby | Destroy Space Aliens | La-Mulana | Guacamelee! | 8Doors | Gato Roboto | Super Panda Adventures |\n\n[b]E Tier[i] (Didn\u2019t like)[/i]:[/b]  Wonder Boy: The Dragon\u2019s Trap | Rain World | Dandara | Vernal Edge | Blaster Master Zero | Medusa | Sundered | Salt & Sanctuary | Valdis Story | Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet | Chronicles of Teddy | B.I.O.T.A. | Shadow Complex | Grime | Timespinner | Rex Rocket | Phoenotopia: Awakening | Aquaria | Nyaruru Fishy Fight | Apotheon | Bad Pad | Lootbox Lyfe | Angel\u2019s Gear | Fearmonium | Dust: An Elysian Tale | \n====================", "timestamp_created": 1689197949, "timestamp_updated": 1690647639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141873956": {"recommendationid": "141873956", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972351208", "num_games_owned": 923, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 833, "last_played": 1689124329}, "language": "english", "review": " Weak recommendation.\n\nThe Short of it: It's a gorgeous and hilariously short metroidvania that might be among the easiest in the genre based on a old anime that was itself based on a D&D campaign.  Movement feels fantastic and there's some love, but most of it comes off feels shallow and forgettable, including the dialogue.  Their other game, Touhou: Luna Nights, is more unique and feels more complete, and I recommend that one over this one unless you're a big Lodoss fan.\n\nThe Long of it: I love the license this game is based off of, and the other works of team ladybug, but it's still a little difficult to recommend this one too much.  The fundamentals are there and feel incredible, and Deedlit has a decent repertoire of skills and equipment at her fingertips- hovering, two elemental states, magic, bows, five melee weapon types, a familiar that shoots automatically, an amazing backdash and three or four other simple metrovania pickups over the course of the game.  You get most of your abilities very quickly, which is both a blessing and a curse- you're stacked from the beginning, but it doesn't really feel like you get significantly stronger over the course of the game.\n\nWhat works: The graphics and movement are stellar, and it's included most of the important players from the setting as well as well-realized the titular character's abilities.  There's a lot of items to choose from and the boss sprites are impressive in motion and have appropriate amounts of lead-up frames.  The later boss battles are all pretty interesting and can prove to be at least some challenge.\n\nWhat's neutral: The soundtrack is solid, but not very memorable and maybe a bit ambient.  There's not a lot of the stings or tracks from the show (presumably way too expensive on a team like this's budget).  The story is pretty whatever and the characters are thrown in at points, but most everyone relevant (besides the story's actual villain and narrator) show up somewhere; some of the emotional beats land alright, but it fails somewhat as a companion piece and Record of Lodoss War probably could have been replaced with almost anything.\n\nWhat doesn't work: You get almost all of your abilities off the bat with some jumps and things later.  Most of the hidden abilities don't do a heck of a lot.  Since your capabilities don't really expand, you end up just pressing switches to open things up.  What does increase is your damage- and if you're not entirely asleep at the wheel or doing a level 1 challenge,  you will generally be murdering non-flying enemies before you even know what they do up to the last area.  There's a couple enemies like the Dryad that take so long to even attack that I had to let them try to see how they attacked- and it still wasn't dangerous.  There's a couple tricky rooms, but all and all you will level and steamroll 80% of the game without even trying.", "timestamp_created": 1689126291, "timestamp_updated": 1689126291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141800988": {"recommendationid": "141800988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320154053", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 438, "last_played": 1674256427}, "language": "english", "review": "\u592a\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u753b\u98ce\u4e86\uff0c\u5f88\u8d5e\u7684\u6076\u9b54\u57ce\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1689039974, "timestamp_updated": 1689039974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141778031": {"recommendationid": "141778031", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963982895", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 521, "last_played": 1644858273}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice metroidvania game!

I don't have anything special to say about it, so I'll highlight a few things I liked and didn't like during my playthrough.\n\nLet's start with the positive aspects. One of the enjoyable features is the ability to switch between Fire and Wind affinity to exploit enemy weaknesses. It's even more fun because you become immune to the element you're currently attuned to. The only downside is that the game only offers two elemental forms, so if you come across an enemy weak to the earth element, you better hope you've already found the earth spell, otherwise, you'll have to make do with Water or Fire. On top of that, the pixel art is simply stunning, and the game's environments and characters are visually appealing.\n\nAnother cool thing about the game is the unique healing mechanic. It rewards you for avoiding damage for a while, which coincides with the main way to heal. I haven't seen this kind of mechanic in many other games, and I think more games should try something similar. If you hit or kill enemies enough, you gain experience points for the element you didn't use. When that element reaches Level 3 (the maximum), you slowly regenerate HP when using it. But if you get hit, the element you're using loses one Level. Essentially, you're rewarded with some passive healing for playing well.\n\nNow let's talk about the aspects that didn't sit well with me. Some of the challenges and achievements felt poorly designed. For example, the Bow challenge didn't actually reward me for aiming well; it was more about memorizing patterns and finding the best shooting angles, as the targets and obstacles always had the exact same movement patterns. Additionally, the achievement to \"Acquire all weapons\" required me to own all weapons at the same time, so I had to farm money and buy back some I sold, thinking I just needed a full weapon log. It became more annoying than fun to farm weapons from enemies, and it took a while due to the reliance on lucky drops.\n\nLastly, I must mention that the game is quite short. My total playtime was around 7 hours, but I estimate that the actual gameplay was closer to 4 hours. The remaining 3 hours were spent farming weapons, doing the archery range, and similar activities. I only played the Boss Rush mode once, achieved an S Rank, and didn't feel the need to revisit it. Considering the price of \u20ac16.79, I found the amount of content to be lacking compared to other games like Hollow Knight, which is priced at \u20ac15 and offers a much longer and more fulfilling experience.\n\nTo sum it up, if you're looking for a decent Metroidvania game that can scratch that itch after playing top-tier titles like Hollow Knight, Blasphemous, or Bloodstained, this game might do the trick. It has its positives, like the elemental mechanics and gorgeous pixel art, but it also has flaws, such as poorly designed challenges and a relatively short gameplay length.", "timestamp_created": 1688913692, "timestamp_updated": 1688913692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689918220043182373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141646083": {"recommendationid": "141646083", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976651283", "num_games_owned": 473, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1688869400}, "language": "english", "review": "Good metroidvania, but I'm downrating because this needs an epilepsy warning.

I'd seen absolutely glowing reviews, putting it up there with Symphony of the Night and, umm, not quite.\n\nIt does a lot of good. I suspect the main reason it gets compared to SotN is the animation and controls. Deedlit controls wonderfully, with subtleties to the control like different attack angles during a jump and such, and is very well animated, top notch. It's nice to have different weapon types ALA SotN (daggers, straight swords, large overheard-swinging swords, boomerangs etc), and the skill and Spirit systems add a bit more depth.\n\nIt's weaknesses are the same ones shared by 95% of Metroidvanias, and wouldn't really be noticeable if SotN hadn't been looming over the entire genre for the past quarter of a century; the weapons aren't varied enough to be interesting, the map and room layouts are far too samey, it doesn't make good enough use of it's upgrades, and there aren't enough cool little secrets. Let's get design document-y, and go over these one at a time... just keep in mind that this isn't really criticism of Deedlit specifically, but more just the entire genre missing what made SotN magical.\n\n(If you want to avoid spoilers, then stop reading now. Suffice to say, this is a solid Metroidvania with great controls, I'd recommend it, but don't expect something as good as SotN.)\n\nLike I said, Deedlit's has a range of different kinds of weapon, that's all good. This problem is that, within each category, there's a pretty linear progression; later daggers are, for the most part, the same as the older ones, just doing a bit more damage and maybe having a slightly different attack speed. I think there's only one weapon that breaks the pattern, a sword that absorbs HP, but that's it. There are no unique weapons, no special moves, no combinations with other skills/equipment. Deedlit has no equivalent to a Shield Rod, or Sword Of Dawn, or Crissaegram, and that's a shame, because it makes the choice of weapon to use purely utilitarian; you'd never pick a weapon because it does something fun, or has a special move that's circumstantially useful. You just pick the one with the biggest DPS that has enough range for what you're fighting. Things are slightly better with Bows, with a couple having effects like multi-shot, homing arrows, or MP stealing, but that's about it.\n\nIf you look at Symphony's map screen alone, it's evocative and clear. You can see long corridors, staircases crawling up, tunnels down into the depths. Areas are clearly delineated by position and style, just from the map layout alone, and it's easy to learn how to get between areas. Deedlit (again, like most Metroidvanias) instead bunches the whole map. The completed map has no space; it is a big jagged rectangle, devoid of character, and finding your way from your one area to another always involves dropping to the map and tracing your zig-zagging, bunched-up route.\n\nThis is mirrored with the individual rooms. In Symphony, almost every individual room is identifiable on sight. They all have different visual touches, platform arrangements, and often completely unique backgrounds; to a seasoned SotN player, if you showed them any given screenshot from the game, they could easily place a pin on the map showing exactly where it represents. In Deedlit, it again has an issue common to most Metroidvanias, in that almost every room is either a mostly straight horizontal corridor,  or a vertical room with zig-zag of platforms on the sides and middle to let you up, all done up in whatever the area's standard tileset is.\n\nThat isn't a separate issue to the map layout; the two matters are inter-related. In SotN, for example, the Grand Staircase works because it isn't a set of straight horizontal/vertical rooms, but one massive diagonal space. By having it this way, the room itself is distinct, with it's long upwards slope matched with enemies to make it in interesting climb, and that aids the distinctive map layout, with the room visually mirroring a staircase, and connecting lower and upper areas without just having a bunch of vertical chambers with zig-zag jumps... Which also spaces out those related areas to make them more clear and identifiable. Metroidvania devs, I am begging you, find more creative ways to let players go upwards through the map than zig-zagging up vertical rooms. You can do that, just... also do other things, y'know?\n\nI said the game doesn't make the most of it's upgrades, so let me link that in with the map design thing. In Deedlit, one upgrade is water breathing (from a mermaid statue, a direct SotN reference). This is used in about 4 places in the games. They're all the same layout; a horizontal corridor, with the bulk of it being a straight, waterlogged path slightly lower than the doors on each end, with a couple of crocodiles in it as enemies, and usually one of the same sword barriers opened with a bow that you get elsewhere in the middle. And... that's it. The item serves no other purpose other than going through these rooms, and these rooms are essentially identical, and without any creative challenge coming from the water you're in. It may as well have just been a key.\n\nImagine how much more could've been done. Imagine small waterlogged areas in earlier stages hiding secrets. Imagine a boss battle where you have to enter the water to do damage, but can't stay in the water because it slows you down. Imagine a whole water area, with different thematically appropriate enemies. Deedlit gives you ~4 identikit corridors with 1 (one) water-based enemy that doesn't require any special tactic to defeat, and no special physical obstacles to overcome. There are really only 4 upgrades that have a functional, interesting use outside of a couple of specifics rooms, and 2 of those are the two spirits you get in the first area, essentially being core mechanics of the game. The other two are both varieties of double-jump.\n\nThe flame spirit can be used to destroy big boxes. There are about 3 of these boxes, all in the first area of the game. You never use it in a way like this again.\n\nI mentioned little secrets, and... Deedlit does have a little of this. There're the little rooms dotted about with side tasks to perform, those are good. There's an interesting meta secret in one room that I won't discuss here, anyone who's found it will know what I mean. A couple of particular actions can get you lines of unique dialogue. And... I think that's about it? Of course, this is all an outgrowth of the above issues. If your weapons aren't interesting, and your levels aren't interesting, and your upgrades aren't interesting, there's not really a lot of room for clever little things.\n\nThis is hard to discuss, because the point is that these things aren't obvious, but their lack is notable. Like... Think about SotN's chapel room, where you get secret little interactions based on sitting in chairs and waiting. Or the bat summon. which behaves differently if you use the bat transformation. Or the sword summon that becomes a usable sword if you level it enough. Or Red Rust, a sword that gets stuck in the scabbard half the time you try to use it. Or the bridge you destroy by luring an enemy to chuck a barrel at it. Or getting secret items from the merchant by high-jumping up into his chair from below. Or the fact that [i]a full half of the game is hidden away behind a fetch quest[/i] in such a way that some players never realised they hadn't completed the game.

It's a good solid game, and it you like Metroidvanias, you should buy it. It's a fine modern example. It's just a shame that the modern Metroidvania so often falls so short of the example they're all drawing from, and despite everything I'd heard, Deedlit doesn't hit anywhere close to that height.

I can still recommend the game, as long as you understand that this is a good, but not the best metroidvania on the market. It's better than average, sure, but it's not on the same level as \"Ori\" or  the \"Hollow knight\".\n\nThe only aspect that is definitely an S-tier about this game is bosses. Every single boss fight is beautiful, memorable, exciting and... easy enough, which is great for those of us who don't have the teen's reaction speed anymore. On average most bosses will take 1-3 attempts from an ordinary gamer. The last one is a b**ch tho, stock fully on HP and mana potions before engaging him.\n\nEverything else is between an A to C tiers.\n\nEnemy variety - A-tier, many different opponents to play with, you won't get bored with them.\n\nWeapon variety - B-tier, while there are many different weapons, the truly unique ones are sparse, while the rest have the same patterns and move sets.\n\nLabyrinth layout - C-tier. Well, you have seen a similar layout countless times in like 90% of metroidvania games, not much to talk about here. \n\nMusic - between A and B tiers depending on your tastes. Each zone has it's own melody and i'v liked most of them.\n\nMovement - B-tier. Mostly fluid and responsible, but the \"dash\" works only backwards and is kinda unreliable, while the forward one needs a flame spirit to be present and 2 buttons combo instead of 1 button. I did not understand the dev's reasoning behind that and in the end finished the game practically ignoring it.\n\nPlay time - between 6 to 8 hours, depending on how fast you are. For me (personally) this is definitely an S-tier, i prefer shorter games, rather than artificially inflated ones, but for those who measure a game's worth by length that would be C-tier i guess?\n\nSo in overall i'd say the game sits somewhere between an A- or B+ tiers, depending on the personal tastes.\nWith a very reasonable price it's definitely worth a buy in my opinion.

But the twist this time is the implementation of Ikaruga's polarity system. With the press of a button you can switch between fire and ice spirits. Each spirit makes you absorb attacks of their element, and deal elemental damage. Some enemies will be weak or immune to an element, some attacks can be completely neutrilized by having the correct spirit, and so on.\n\nNot onlt that, but each spirit can range from levels 1 - 3. Dealing damage and killing enemies raised the level of the opposite spirit you have equipped, while taking damage lowers the level of your current spirit. Being at lv 3 regenerates your health slowly. So your goal is to always have a lv 3 spirit equipped (unless the enemy requires a specific element), a design decision made to further incentivize the constant swapping of spirits.\n\nThe story might be more meaningful if you know the source material, but to me it was pretty whatever. The pixel art as great, with a fantastic care for the animation. The gameplay is fast, fluid and responsive. The exploration is a bit more straightforward than most metroidvanias. Not once I felt stuck, just looking at the map was enough to figure where I needed to go, and new bosses kept popping up constantly.\n\nThe only major complaint I have with this game is its length. I beat the game with 100% map completion in around 5 hours. This is not an expensive game of course, but it is pretty short even compared to most metroidvanias on the same price range. It is bittersweet because the game is such a joy to play that I really left wanting more.

Excellent visuals and a kickin\u2019 soundtrack accompany an accessible, entertaining experience that feels a bit like \u201c[i]Symphony of the Night[/i] Lite\u201d and is worth the $20 asking price.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThis game leans towards the \u201cVania\u201d side of its genre; some of the developers also worked on [i]Symphony of the Night[/i] and it shows. You\u2019ll utilize melee weapons, a bow, and spells to work through enemies, along with movement tech that expands as you go. The game\u2019s standout mechanic are the two \u201cspirits\u201d you\u2019ll acquire early on\u2014one wind and one fire\u2014that you can swap between on the fly. When a spirit is \u201cequipped\u201d, matching attacks and obstacles will be absorbed as MP, and a good chunk of the game\u2019s challenges come from juggling the spirits. This is most apparent with the game\u2019s bosses, which use attacks of both types (and neither)  that you must quickly swap spirits to counter. Defeating enemies (and just landing attacks on bosses) raises your unequipped spirit\u2019s level to a max of three, and the higher their level, the more damage you do with them equipped, and at max level they\u2019ll also heal you. However, getting hit drops their level, so you\u2019ll need to manage swapping them to keep them as powerful as possible.\n\nIn combat, enemies have resistances and weaknesses to various elements (including those of the spirits, which apply their elements to all of your weapon attacks), represented by a six-sided die: 1-3 means weak, 4-5 means resistant, and 6 means immune. Spells and weapons will have the elements not represented by your spirits, like earth or water. Defeating enemies gives you XP to level up, but each level only marginally increases your damage output and defense; HP is raised through a few pickups, and there\u2019s no apparent way to raise MP (for spells/arrows) at all. The majority of significant upgrades come from the weapons, spells, movement abilities, and spirit upgrades scattered about the map.\n\nThe game presents a smallish map by Metroidvania standards, though not cramped. There\u2019s a sufficient variety of zones, each with unique enemies and challenges\u2014unlike many MVs, the game doesn\u2019t reuse palette-swapped enemies at all, which keeps each zone feeling fresh. There are a few bow-related puzzles as well that provide the occasional non-combat challenge. Unfortunately, the map is [i]very[/i] light on discoverables, with precious few upgrades and no real secrets to discover; a few are out of the way and not immediately available, but you\u2019ll clearly see them while exploring and can go back for them once you\u2019ve opened the door they\u2019re stuck behind. There\u2019s a [i]lot[/i] of backtracking as well, though mercifully there [i]are[/i] portals that allow you to warp around the map.\n\nFor the most part, this game is fairly easy; even the most casual gamer is unlikely to struggle with it much until the last stage, where dominant strategy may trip them up a bit. \u201cDominant strategy\u201d is where a player will stick to the simplest way to address the game\u2019s challenge, and ignore more complicated mechanics if they aren\u2019t needed. For most of the game, it isn\u2019t necessary to juggle equipment, spells, movement tech, items, etc. because the game doesn\u2019t present challenges that really require it\u2014until the last stage, when doing so is suddenly [i]required,[/i] and may present a wall to players who haven\u2019t gotten adept at utilizing the full breadth of the game\u2019s mechanics. Be aware that you have a lot of abilities to use, and to try all of them if you run into trouble. And [i]remember the shop,[/i] which provides healing items; I totally forgot about the shop at the end of the game because I hadn\u2019t needed it at all up to that point, and acquiring a few restoratives made all the difference.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe pixel-art visuals clearly show their [i]Symphony[/i] heritage\u2014the character even has Alucard\u2019s \u201cafterimage trail\u201d (although you can disable it in the options if you prefer). They are masterfully crafted, with fluid and varied animations, and though the environments aren\u2019t particularly unique\u2014a planty zone, a castley zone, an underground zone, etc.\u2014they are colorful, diverse, and well-executed.\n\nMy only real complaint with the visuals is the HUD, which is quite large; while it looks very nice, it also takes up a [i]lot[/i] of the top of the screen, which can get in the way, especially when climbing upwards. The amount of information it conveys could have been condensed a great deal and spread to the other corners without sacrificing flourish. \u2026Also, I\u2019d have liked to see a more interesting dialogue font, but that\u2019s getting picky.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThis soundtrack [i]slaps,[/i] providing energy to the sometimes slow traversal of the environment, but I kept finding myself thinking \u201cthis music is perfect for a Mega Man X game\u201d. It\u2019s excellent, but the rock stylings are, [i]in my opinion,[/i] not a perfect fit. A bit more orchestration might have blended it better with the tone of the game\u2019s environment and story. Aside from that nitpick, however, the soundtrack is solid.\n\nThe overall sound design is clear and balanced, and I while I thought the voice calling out \u201cLEVEL THREE\u201d every time you max out one of your spirits would get annoying quickly, it actually proved to be quite helpful when the action got hectic and a subtler sound alert could have been lost in the chaos.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story in this game is quite light, with only a handful of interactions with other characters carrying the entirety of the story. It tips its hand quite early in the game; the ending is fairly easy to suss out well before any reveals happen. The lack of deep story doesn\u2019t detract from the gameplay experience, however, so it\u2019s just a bit of a missed opportunity.\n\nAs a part of the [i]Record of Lodoss War[/i] franchise, it draws characters and themes from that lore, but it doesn\u2019t provide any introductions or backstory for the player unfamiliar with the franchise (like myself). As such, if there\u2019s any significance to or subtext in any of the interactions between the characters, it will be lost on many players, rendering them fairly generic fantasy placeholders. This is a shame because [i]Lodoss War[/i] is, if the wiki is any indication, a fairly deep well of lore to pull from, and providing even some of that backstory could have helped set this game apart from others in its genre and introduced and enticed players to the franchise who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have known it existed.\n\n[h1]Additional Thoughts[/h1]\nBeing so relatively small, this game feels very much like a \u201cfirst step\u201d game for this dev team that may have been limited in scope by budget and time constraints. The end teases a sequel; I quite hope it gets one that allows the team room to make a larger and more full experience, as it\u2019s clear they know how to make a polished and enjoyable game in this genre.", "timestamp_created": 1675027827, "timestamp_updated": 1675027827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131827660": {"recommendationid": "131827660", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991453705", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1675022850}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe the best Metroidvania since Symphony of the night. 6 hours of pure joy.", "timestamp_created": 1675022980, "timestamp_updated": 1675022980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131800078": {"recommendationid": "131800078", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989728632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 656, "last_played": 1674984566}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, really reminiscent of Castlevania:SotN.

There's nothing truly memorable about the game aesthetically, but the art is clean, & never interferes with the gameplay in a negative manner.\n\nThe gameplay is snappy & fluid, with the two element system making for some interesting gameplay moments. There's plenty of weaponry to find, but the majority are simple stat-sticks with nothing really noteworthy about them. Spells are passable, & mostly just seem to exist as hard counters to certain bosses: None of them feel particularly meaningful to push outside of those few scenarios. \n\nGame difficulty is very low without some sort of self-imposed challenge. I found several bosses to be comfortable one-shots, & while it wasn't comfortable, even the last boss died first attempt without the use of any potions. A no magic replay might be an option, & would undoubtedly offer a very tough challenge for those who fancied it, but if you're the kind of person who just wants to get through the game as fast as possible using the tools at your disposal, you might find yourself done in 4 hours.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game, it's just nowhere near the quality of Ladybug's previous title TLN, & my overwhelming feeling having finished it is wondering what could've been if the game just had that little bit more going on, both mechanically & length-wise.

The mechanics are fun and satisfying, and the bosses deliver spectacle though only few are challenging. With a runtime of about five to six hours, Deedlit doesn't outstay her welcome.\n\nAlthough the main cast of RoLW is present here, I wouldn't say they are well represented: the sprites are beautiful, but their interactions are so minimal that the characters are effectively absent.

The sprite combat system is interesting and gives you a bit of challenge during combat, and lets you pause to think for environmental puzzles. WL rewards you for paying attention, as it really pays off especially with boss fights when you keep your eyes open to enemy strengths and weaknesses.\n\n WL is generally a forgiving game. I love that WL is not a grindfest like Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, because you can focus on gameplay. Another nifty thing about WL is you can skip the shop and worrying about credits because the weapons you find through exploration are more than adequate. While upgrades are limited and simple, the gameplay mechanics like HP healing when your attach meter is full allows for worry-free exploration in most areas. (There were only a few after mid-game where I started sweating looking for a save point.) \n\nEven then, most areas on the map are forgiving enough that you can just switch rooms back and forth and farm to build up your attach meter to regenerate HP. Map-wise, I was able to get 99% completion playing on my own without online resources, so this is a pretty accessible title. Boss fights can usually be finished in two or three tries (most require pattern recognition, while some are first time goes that allow you to face tank if you're equipped with the right spells and recovery items). Enemies are generally pretty easy to defeat once you figure them out (and somewhat repetitive), but thankfully you can run through most of them when backtracking which is much appreciated compared to some titles. \n\nPlot-wise, it's nothing to write home about, but again, the focus is on gameplay. It's a fun, relatively quick jaunt that rewards you for being a player rather than farmer slogging through half an hour to get a spell like in other games. Price-wise, I paid about $16 and it's a bit more compared to similar titles when on sale, but I think it's fair.

This is going on my fav game list. Would def recommend. \n\nPlayer sprite - Very smooth and silky, very reminiscent of Alucard in Castlevania SotN\n\nCombat - I was unsure at first since I hate it when games make you lose your powered up state when you take a hit, but after I understood you have 2 power states that you ebb/flow between if you take a hit, I was totally into. I LOVE the dual element system in this, I wish more games had this combat mechanic.\n\nDifficulty - Bosses are a good challenge, and the difficulty curve as you progress thru the game is prefect.\nAs long as you stay calm and remember all the battle mechanics/tools, you'll be fine after a few solid tries. \n\nStory - Good, I was touched by the ending, cried a little. I never watched the original anime, but that didn't make it any harder to follow. I actually want to try and watch it now after beating this.\n\nOverall - Great experience, no technical issues or bugs. Would definitely recommend if you like metroidvanias, or like the original anime. \n\nSide note - I'll mention this on the separately since I don't really fault the developers for this. There are many color-coded doors that you unlock on the map as your progress, and I have partial color blindness, so it was difficult at times to tell which doors to revisit, I ended up spending time revisiting them all until I found the right one. It would've been great if the devs could've assigned a unique symbol in addition to the colors for the various doors, probably would've helped me a bit.

Easily the best Metroidvania I've played since Symphony of the Night, and it isn't even close.  Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth hews a little closer to Metroid in terms of game design than SOTN, despite its appearance, in that it relies a little more heavily on backtracking.  But it doesn't overdo it.  It doesn't get tiresome (like, say, Circle of the Moon).  \n\nI'd say the biggest difference is where in Symphony of the Night, new areas feel like areas to conquer, and bosses feel like a part of those areas, in this game there is less of a sense of distinctness to the different areas, and the bosses are kind of their own thing.  While the game is divided into \"stages\" they don't really feel that distinct, like a thing to be conquered independent of the whole.  That's also how the game reminds me of a Metroid game.  Your immediate goal is always to reveal the blank parts of the map.  The various areas are obstacles to that.  \n\nThis game gives most of the standard mobility power ups, but perhaps uniquely grants you the ability to fly almost immediately.  It is less useful than it sounds.\n\nThere are no overpowered game-breaking weapons.  As you open up the map, enemies scale to continue to pose a threat.  Every boss will kick your ass if you don't use the right strategy.  Almost everything every boss does can be countered or avoided.  There is nothing cheap in this game.  \n\nIt has been a while since I enjoyed a game this much.", "timestamp_created": 1672471126, "timestamp_updated": 1672471126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129749190": {"recommendationid": "129749190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301018275", "num_games_owned": 952, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 346, "last_played": 1672462592}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Como si metroid y el hollow knight tuvieran un hijo.

The experience and leveling system is useless since you do enough damage as you progress through the game and enemies give very little experience making grinding inefficient.

I played without grinding or using restorative items (which could make the game easier).\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nIt wears Symphony of The Night on it's sleeve, but that's not a bad thing. If you're gonna copy your homework, make sure you copy from the best.\n\nIt was a great palette cleanser after I didn't like Blasphemous. I loved it so much that it made me check out the anime. Game is a bit short, but pretty sweet and the only real issue is some jarring difficulty spikes and maybe a bit too much linearity in progression.\n\nRecommended to any Metroidvania fan.\n\n[h1]Description[/h1]\nI will refer to this game as \"Lodoss War\" since full title is too much.\n\nLodoss War is a metroidvania very similar to the granddaddy of the genre - Castlevania Symphony of The Night, down to the long-ass title.\n\nYou play as Deedlit - an elven warrior who finds herself trapped in the titular Labirynth. She doesn't have any memory of how she got there or what's her goal, but she receives weird, sometimes sinister visions that slowly uncover the truth. The game does the bare minimum to provide context for the story, but I'm sure knowing the source material would be at least helpful in easing yourself into this one. I didn't know anything about it before playing and it didn't really bother me. I will say that the game could very much contain spoilers for the original material, since it's set after the events of Record of Lodoss War.\n\nGameplay-wise this is, again, a copy of Symphony of The Night. You have a jump, a backwards dash and an attack button. Where it differs is how fluid your attacks combo together and that you can attack in more directions (although I may just misrimember that Symphony had no diagonal or upward/downward attacks). You will also unlock 2 spirits - fire and wind - which you can switch between. Spirits provide immunity to their damage type as well as provide other abilities like gliding or dodging, some of which get unlocked later on. You also unlock a bow, which you can use to solve puzzles and of course - shoot enemies. You also have some magic spells, some for damage, some for support.\n\nA lot of the game's bosses and platforming segments rely on quickly switching between your spirits to make use of their abilities and dealing damage whenever you have the chance.\n\nThe world is divided into several, non-linear levels that usually contain some key items you need to obtain to move on to the next boss.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]+ Responsive[/b]\nControls are snappy. You can switch directions quick, you can control how high your jumps are, switching between spirits and using different abilities works as expected...\n\nReally this is just fun to play because you feel in control of every move, as opposed to something like Blasphemous (a game I played before this), where your character woudln't react in a busy avalanche of button presses. No matter what amount of inputs you throw at Deedlit - she has no problem with responding in the way you tell her to.\n\nJust like a woman should.\n\nDid the joke land? Man, I hope I haven't insulted anyone with this one.\n\nIt's not altogether true though, I just said that for the joke. Some inputs, like attacks for some weapons, commit you to pretty long animations (compared to quicker weapons). This may result in having to wait to readjust your orientation or stop you from ducking quickly. You could say that this is acceptable due to slower weapons having usually longer reach and higher damage, so you need to learn to use them more mindfully.\n\n[b]+ Looks great[/b]\nMovement animation is smooth just like in Symphon...\n\nIf I have to say that name again...\n\nEnvironments are crisp and nice to look at. Would love native resolution to be a little higher, but that's not a huge problem. Enemies explode in a satisfying manner and visual detail goes well to form a cohesive whole with the game's mechanics. You can clearly tell when you kill something or when it's immune to your damage, etc.\n\n[b]+ Dynamic[/b]\nI probably wouldn't mention this if I haven't played Blasphemous before it, but Lodoss War is quick. Most enemies take just a few hits to kill, they explode and you move on. It's satisfying to rush through stages. Enemies also respawn when you re-enter the room, so having a quick fighting system was a must and this game delivers. Especially compared to Blasphemous, which was slow, cumbersome, unresponsive and felt like a horrid grind with enemies having far too much HP and being able to do a lot of damage per hit.\n\nSituation in Lodoss War is further helped by the spirit system, which powers you up to the point where you regenerate HP if you can deal a lot of hits without getting hit yourself. It's integral for making good progress or when fighting tough bosses.\n\n[b]+ Takes me back[/b]\nTo the time where a lot of stuff were simple. Deedlit is a good-looking female protagonist who achieves being a strong fighter without sacrificing her feminine beauty. The mechanics are similar to... other metroidvania titles without much new, but also without anything feeling implemented badly.\n\nIt's very easy to like Lodoss War for what it is, because what it is was already tried and tested before and it's not a bad thing that it follows the footsteps of those games.\n\nInnovation is good, but sometimes it's good to play something familiar and fun.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]- A bit short[/b]\nIt's always nice when the main bad thing I have to say about a game is that I would have liked more of the game to be in the game. Maps ain't big and since it's not super-difficult - you will probably finish it quite quick. 4.5h - that's what I got for my first playthrough.\n\n[b]- Uneven difficulty[/b]\nThis is a pretty easy game for about 95% of it, most bosses I would defeat on first try. Some I would have to redo 2-3 times, but nothing too tough. But then there are just a few bosses that are HUGE difficulty spikes, with very nasty stunlock attacks, huge damage and attack patterns that are quite difficult to react to.\n\nI feel the game would benefit a lot from an even difficulty curve where you could get eased into the difficult parts gradually instead of having just some bosses be that much of a difference.\n\n[b]- Linear[/b]\nThe only non-linear part of the game comes in form of special items hidden about or behind abilities like double-jump (which you unlock during main quest). Unlike some Metroidvanias that have whole areas hidden behind optional key items - this one does not seem to have that.\n\n[h1]Lowdown[/h1]\nIt's not cheap for the amount of playtime, so you may want to wait for a discount. But game itself is quality and if you like metroidvanias - you will enjoy it.\n\nI'd give Lodoss War an\n[h1]8/10[/h1]\nIt's been a nice palette cleanser after slogging through Blasphemous, which was overdesigned, slow, cumbersome, inconsistent and frankly not fun, despite looking great. Lodoss War is a great example that it's more important to focus on making the game play well than making it look nice.", "timestamp_created": 1671470054, "timestamp_updated": 1671470361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537815093994140625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128694818": {"recommendationid": "128694818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016377780", "num_games_owned": 953, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 770, "last_played": 1671238696}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely charming tribute to the legendary anime, this metroidvania is a good time whether you're a fan or unaware of Record of Lodoss War.", "timestamp_created": 1671238829, "timestamp_updated": 1671238829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128400150": {"recommendationid": "128400150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173327989", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1670810640}, "language": "english", "review": "A must have game if you like Metroidvania style... but you must be skilled... with 4,9 hours you can finish...", "timestamp_created": 1670808704, "timestamp_updated": 1670808704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536290287971496582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128332300": {"recommendationid": "128332300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078263093", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 887, "last_played": 1670722772}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No hay mucho que decir de esta belleza, Metroidvania inspirado en CV-SOTN cuya trama y lore est\u00e1n basados en las Cr\u00f3nicas de las Guerras de Lodoss y plasmado en el motor del Touhou Luna Nights, hermoso pixel art, animaciones y transiciones pulidos (buenas coreograf\u00edas en pixel art) mec\u00e1nica arcade adictiva, si bien es un RPG side-scroll difiere en profundidad al mencionado CV-SOTN (ver Strider Hiryu e Ikaruga) y una variedad de armas, enemigos y bosses de las OVAS.\n\nEste juego palidece tanto en su OST que no es malo pero nada memorable y su duraci\u00f3n, la cual es muy corta, solo son 6 capitulos :c pero epa!!!

Short, but that's kind of to be expected with it's lower price tag.\n\nI'm totally green when it comes to the Lodoss franchise, so the characters were unfamiliar to me. Yet, despite typically skipping cutscenes I actually found myself somewhat invested nearing the end of the game, wishing that I had taken it a bit slower.\n\nMy only real gripe is the arrow puzzles, which were often dead simple and could either be removed all together or made significantly harder.  The only time these puzzles (if you can even call them that) ever posed any sort of challenge was when you end up just searching the magic angle to shoot at by spamming arrows, gradually lowering your aim until you find it.  Another, smaller gripe is that the coolest/most interesting weapons are obsoleted very quickly after obtaining them, or in my case, I found many of them while cleaning up the map before the final boss, already completely obsolete by the most easily attainable mid/endgame weapons.  My other, very minor issue is that it is occasionally hard to tell what constitutes as background and what constitutes as foreground: background assets are occasionally just foreground assets that have been very slightly darkened making it hard to tell if you can walk in front of an object, or if it's a wall of some sort.\n\n/Nitpicking aside, the combat is fun and the Ikaruga style switching mechanic is very satisfying to get a hold on.  Movement is very tight and responsive, and barring one specific enemy it was rare to get hit and feel cheesed by janky hitboxes.  Music/sound design was generally pretty good and captured what I think they devs were going for well.

A few minor- to medium-tier complaints worth noting, though:\n\nFirst, the game does have some persistent flashing effects (e.g. magic power gauge when full) that I didn't see any option to turn off.  It was limited enough that I didn't really notice, myself, but a friend of mine sensitive to strobing/flickering had to stop watching on account of it.  A video options control to turn it off or at least moderate it substantially would have been helpful for players (and viewers) with optical sensitivities, and it's not as though flashing lights in video games being a problem was unheard of in 2021.  Frankly it's a little weird for any modern game to neglect flashing issues.\n\nSecond, while the air/fire elemental mode thing is a cool mechanic, it can be pretty annoying to get the hang of, and the fragility of the fully powered state, together with the time needed to recover it and the amount of damage Deedlit takes from most enemies means that stopping to grind magic levels is a thing.  If the power gauge didn't get knocked down so much faster than it builds up, or HP weren't quite so precious, the impact on the pacing of the game wouldn't be so significant.  The mode swapping during boss fights is fun and makes it feel really dynamic, which is great, but then you get hit twice and pretty much have to stop the boss fight to rebuild your gauge and heal and hope you don't get hit again while doing that.\n\nThird, a few of the controls are either a little odd or absent.  A few that especially stood out to me were: (1) the controller mapping seems confused about the face button numbering, (2) the control guides in-game only specify default keyboard key bindings but not the controller bindings, (3) the timing on the downstab feels very strange and it's been a bit of a struggle to get a feel for it, and (4) there's no control to look up/down which is especially annoying during some blind drops and when dealing with enemies in tall chambers.  The last especially seems like it would have been a great use for the analog sticks standard on modern controllers.\n\nAgain, overall a great game, especially for those of us with late-90s platformer (and anime) nostalgia, and the flaws are limited in scope... but they also all seem like they should have been easy to fix in beta, especially the flashing issues, which makes them that much more grating.

The game itself feels like a tiny, but polished castlevania game. It sets itself apart with a few features, but every other feature feels like it's a dumbed down castlevania feature.\n\n[h1](unique feature) Elemental spirits and Elemental damage/weakness[/h1]\nIf there's one thing I think this game will be remembered for it's the way it handles elemental damage. In most castlevania games (and RPGs) elemental weaknesses are only useful against a handful of enemies and having elemental immunity was rarely very useful. I rarely picked an elemental weapon/armor over more general use ones, because it's just a nuisance.\n\nAt a glace this game uses the usual formula: Enemies take less damage if they are resistent to element or more if they are weak to it, The main difference is it makes different elements accessible using spirits and spells on the fly, which means exploiting elements is no longer a hassle, even if you only need to beat 1 specific enemy. Another big difference is elemental damage/defense is used as a central combat mechanic.\n\n[b]Elemental spirits[/b]\nYou get 2 togglable elemental spirits, which you can freely swap between. They give you special effects (boring ones), matching elemental damage and complete immunity against damage of that element. These spirits also have something like a level that affects the damage you do while they are active. They can also heal at max level. You deal damage to charge the level and if you get hit you lose a level. You do not lose a level if you get hit by element you're immune to!\n\n[b]Effect in gameplay[/b]\nDespite there being more elements, many enemies have some sort of affinity towards the 2 elements you have full control over, so swapping between those can affect your damage a lot. \nSpells are only slightly strogner than normal attacks, but if you pick the corrent element, they can often nuke even strongest enemies (including some bosses) in seconds.\nSpells can also grant elemental affinities, which means access to more elemental immunities.\n\nBecause getting hit means losing spirit levels (damage buff), and getting hit by element you are immune to does not reduce that level, avoiding damage or using elements to gain immunity well is rewarded with higher damage output.\n\nBosses (as well as few normal monsters) often spam attacks that are difficult to avoid, but easy to defend against by swapping elements. It's a very clever way to make elemental damage a part of gameplay. \n\n[h1]Combat(7/10)[/h1]\nCombat is polished. Movement controls are tight, attacks always feel right (in terms of range and speed) and spells feel valuable (powerful and MP recovers slowly).\nMonsters feel well balanced (nothing too strong or too weak) even if there are a few monsters with surprize attacks.\n\nIt resembles Syphony of the Night, however smaller weapon selections (and less weapon behaviors), does mean combat gamepaly variety suffers. \n\n[h1]Progression(6/10)[/h1]\nStraightforward, linear and generally unremarkable.\n\nYou have 2 weapons (melee and bow) both of which have attack speed and attack damage.  Few weapons have special effects, but nothing too exciting.\nAs you go through the game, you constantly get better weapons and I never really had to wonder if it's worth keeping previous weapon over the one with better stat.\n\nThe other form of progression is spirit upgrades (they sometimes attack and their attacks gets stronger - boring), spells (very useful) and HP/MP upgrades (too little to matter).\n\n[h1] Exploration(8/10) [/h1]\nNothing groundbreaking, but for how short the game is, it manages to keep things interesting. There are just enough metroivania puzzles to keep track of without map markers and taking notes. You're rewarded with weapons, spirit upgrades, spells and HP/MP upgrades as you explore. If it was a 20+ hour game, I would say boring progression ruins exploration rewards, but in ~8 it doesn't reach the point where it feels like busywork.\n\n[h1]Presentation (8/10)[/h1]\nTo say this game draws stylistic inspiration from Castlevania games would be an understatement. Music, structure, animations and even most gameplay screams Castlevania. Whether it's a good thing or not is up to you, but it certainly invites comparison.\n\nI would say it delivers everywhere apart from 2 areas\n[list]\n[*] Some enemies look stylistically out of place and some have awkward animations, but that's like 5 enemies total.\n[*] Projectile sprites. Look at bullet hell \"bullet\" sprites (blue and orange) and tell me they fit in this gloomy visual style.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Comparison to Castlevania: SotN[/h1]\nIt might not look it, but it feels increadibly similar to Castlevania: SotN. Movement, combat, weapons, music and many other things.  Here's the list of differences in Record of Lodoss War:\n[list]\n[*] Smaller.\n[*] Dumbed down stats/items/equipment: less weapon types (and behaviors); no unique weapons; no armors or accessories; less stats (presumably because they would be pointless without equipment); barebone selection of consumables.\n[*] Bow added as an alternate weapon. You can freely aim in ~90\u00b0 arc. I can't say it's makes a huge difference, but I did use it to kill a few out of reach enemies.\n[*] Elemental damage stuff I mentioned Above.\n[*] Spells are on a button, rather than command based.\n[*] Visuals. Art has similartities in how gloomy it is, and atmosphere is similar, but the style is more aimed at fantasy setting.\n[/list]\n\n\n\nElemental stuff I mentioned creates fairly unique gameplay, so I do recommend it, but don't expect anything groundbreaking.", "timestamp_created": 1661361300, "timestamp_updated": 1661361384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121150716": {"recommendationid": "121150716", "author": {"steamid": "76561199376250167", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 621, "last_played": 1673895761}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Para iniciar en los metroidvanias, es un juego magnifico, simplemente un juego de 10.

This was previously seen in Ikaruga and Outland. It allows the bosses to throw full screen of attacks at Deedlit, while making it relatively easy to dodge once you master the system. I always liked it in Ikaruga, and here I really got the \"Ikaruga 2D\" vibes.\n\nWhile red and blue represent wind and fire, there are other elements in the game, and those act outside of \"Ikaruga\" system, so you need to dodge them properly. For map traversal I found out that instead of finding out \"proper\" way to deal with most monsters I could just outright kill them before they managed to make their attacks by mixing my weapon attacks with first magic attack you learn in the game. Within 30 minutes you start to feel like overpowered build in some Castlevania games, but here it is just natural state for the game. Even most of the bosses are pushovers, and you can abuse the element system to take them out easily on first attempt. There are some exceptions, but even those are on easy side.\n\nThe most abusable element of the game is autohealing. If you use one element the opposite element levels up when you damage enemies. If the element you're using is at level 3(max) you're recovering health rather quickly. If you get hit your current element drops by 1 level. By switching between elements and keeping at least one at level 3 at all times you are very hard to kill. Against bosses you can easily turtle them out, and just attack from the distance until you've recharged the opposite element. Not useful for speedruns, but for regular players easy to use.\n\nYou also get a bow, which is useful for most of the puzzles in this game, and some monsters are much easier taken out with it. It's useful against some bosses too, but overall I didn't use it that much. The puzzles were decent, mixing a little bit of thinking with a little bit of dexterity. You also get access to few spells, and few mobility options, like hovering, double jumps, higher double jumps etc. Controlling Deedlit with the upgrades is fun, although I found the \"higher double jump\" input to be a bit irritating to do. There are many jumps where you have to use 95% of your double jump/higher double jump range to pass.\n\nWhat I didn't care about too much was the map design. Unlike some other vanias where you get interconnected castle, and the areas flow into each other rather naturally, this game divides the map into stages. Each stage is pretty much micro-map, which is \"solved\" separately from all other stages. There are few rooms where you can't enter until you got an upgrade from the next stage, so you need to backtrack, but otherwise the map is... rather uninteresting exploration wise.\n\nAll you can find on the maps are weapons, 7 spells(1 is mandatory) and few HP/MP/power upgrades. The weapons also drop from monsters randomly. You can have up to 1 copy of each weapon. There are no usable items that you collect, the only source of such items are the shops you find in the dungeons. I've never used or bough any of those. Somehow the rewards from exploration are quite unrewarding, for the most of the game I had better weapons than I was finding.\n\nThe equipment system is very limited - you only select your two weapons, and they don't affect your stats or each other. So you just can select best weapons for the job and kill stuff. Usually you can settle for the higher raw damage, but against monsters with high weakness you can opt to choose elemental weapons. Or weapons with an animation that makes monsters easy to hit, or with some added special effect (like homing arrows). You won't be spending much time in the equipment screen.\n\nAs you can see on the screenshots and trailers the game is a sight to behold. Some areas make great use of parallax scrolling, and there are a lot of details in the environments. The music is serviceable. The story is serviceable and predictable. But still cool. There are no hidden endings, or time-consuming mechanics, unless you decide to collect all weapons or something.\n\nIn the end I've enjoyed my 5 hours with this game, completed it, but I don't think I'll be replaying it, unlike Castlevanias. I highly recommend this, but think of it as \"Vania lite\" or platform game with some Vania elements. \n\nSteamDeck note: I've completed the game fully on the Deck. If not the launcher where you might want to press F1 to toggle vsync this game probably would get \"Great on Deck\" instead of \"Playable\" label it currently has.

It moves well, the challenge stays strong even when you've leveled up and gotten good.  Can you take ten of the enemies who used to kill you out in a row?  Flowing from one to the next?  Eventually, yes, you'll get there.  Will a mistake also have a single enemy wreck you?  Yep, the threat is real.  Unlike games that throw cheap shot deaths at you instead of balancing a difficulty curve, this one just hits the mark.\n\nGameplay: tight and responsive, you'll rarely find yourself calling BS on a creature killing you, or messing up a puzzle because controls didn't work.  In fact, you might get used to pulling off tricks.\nGraphics: How is this actually pixel art?  It looks much better than it should.  Multilayered backdrops that shift and move, the details they managed to get out of it is impressive.  Deedlit moves better than AAA game characters.  \nStory: Ok, one minor issue here: it's not the Anime.  Lodoss war was a big thing for me as a kid, and this is sort of a \"look at these characters we made\" game.  It feels like a mod to SoTN, and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible.  \nFun things: I managed to figure out how to get around a puzzle by \"BotW'ing\" the challenge, and I felt good about that.  \n\nHighly recommend this game.\n\nSome things I want:  \nExtra bit where you play through as Pirotess?

I think it's a solid enough game, but there's definitely some drawbacks.\n\nIn summary, it's similar enough to SOTN or Bloodstained.  There's distinct areas, you gain weapons as you progress along with a couple of spells, and it's the usual platforming with attacking to kill stuff.\n\nPositives:\nInnovation in some gameplay, especially with the red/blue energy system.  I liked switching between them and it generally added a lot of depth.\nArt style was great.\nMusic was phenomenal.\nNo bugs (though one crash to desktop).\nThe map will mark locked doors you can't progress past yet with the appropriate color automatically.  Personally, I'd rather have pins ala Hollowknight, to place myself, because it feels more like exploring, but it's definitely better than having a plain map with nothing at all marked.\n\nDownsides\nIt's short.  Like, really short.  I wouldn't necessarily mind that it's a condensed SOTN clone, but there were more than a few times where I picked up a weapon that was then immediately superseded by another weapon I'd pick up.\nItem drops from enemies didn't really seem to be a thing past the first few enemies.\nCombat is very bog standard, and there's not really spots where there's choices in what weapon you use.  Simply pick the one with the highest numbers.  Same for spells.\nNormal enemy combat is super boring, excluding the final area.  I don't even know what the dark elves attack is, because none of them ever lived long enough to attack.  Excluding the final area every single enemy dies incredibly quickly (except maybe the crocodiles who are evil).  Bosses were the right kind of challenging (or maybe even slightly too easy), and all normal enemies and areas were incredibly easy.  I just breezed through the whole game.  Walk into room, spam attack, everything dies super quickly.\nThe shop is pointless, both because the game is so easy and also that I found more than enough swords and bows that I never needed to buy any.\nSecrets are barely a thing.\nExploration is barely a thing.\nNo interaction with torches like in Castlevania, so less need to pay attention to the background (personally I enjoy the constant need to interact with the environment).\n\nSo, in the end, I feel ok with this game.  Overpriced for what's there, but at least what's there is solid enough.

Wanna stand still and aim melee? Too bad, your lock in place button is overlapped with your backdash. Game lets you float and use position lock to aim bow or melee in air, except if you were moving down then it just doesn't work? But it will while moving up? Want to buffer a slide after your attack? Too bad, your attack animation can't be slide cancelled so your jumping right into what you wanted to slide under. Want to use the elevator platform by shooting a gear wheel? Too bad, you didn't hit it at the perfect angle while your on a moving platform or you just shot it too fast so now it's lowered and you have to try again and again till it decides you were lucky enough. Hope you didn't run out of mana either or your stuck here for 30 seconds. Did i mention it resets your aim back to default position after each volley?  Enemies have almost no windup and you either kill them before they try or you have pretty much no time to react. No reason to re use old weapons. all the weapons fall into 1 of about 5 animations that are used interchangeably same with bows the only differences you get are damage output, sometimes a passive that's barely even noticeable, or more arrows on the bow attacks. Magic is just 1 button easy mode and the first frickin spell they give you is just Tetra Spirit but shiny and takes up more screenspace than needed making it even harder to see what's going on in a cramped space (which is every...single....room outside of a boss) Majority of backtracking to find stuff that is optional isn't worth collecting or is just an extra 10 manna or health here or there. Map is blocked off into sections unlocked by colored switches and corresponding colored doors meaning there's pretty much no original routing options. No sorting your inventory.  Music often feels subpar. Game starts at 25% volume otherwise it will blow out your speakers. They trust you to press and hold a button while pressing another on the right side of your controller but then don't give you anything challenging to do with it. There's straightup unused triggers yet controls are frustratingly stacked ontop one another in a way that causes you to avoid using them The gambling mini game is fun, the archery range is fun, the art is beautiful, there's so much good here but It's a pale imitation of good ideas packaged in a subpar expirience. Enemy designs even blend in the backround at times, or just make you stand infront of them till they stop guarding. is it a pattern? No, they just start guarding as soon as you get close and then you have to wait. Want to use the I frames on your slide? Too bad, it makes you stop at their feet. Sometimes you can get another one out in time, other times it just slaps you for trying. Especially on slopes since your slide can't handle them and forces you into an airborne state removing your I frames. No zoom on mini map, every room look the same on the map. Are you colorblind? Good luck trying to figure out where you need to go since the colored doors are basically your only guide and there's no other routes. Story is non existent. Betrays ALOT of the source material in general when presenting it. The amount of tech in the game to learn is slim and the majority of it is functionally useless outside of speedrunning. Even then it is laughably hindered by it's own design decisions. Like a built in stunlock that will kill you at full HP from getting tapped once.\n\nTLDR:\nThis is not even close to SOTN.

"review": "Overall: B+\nNormally in reviews I like to start with a bit of a preamble but since this game is so obscure and my review might affect someone buying decision: this game is really good. It is a fantastically constructed Metroidvania (though leaning far more on the Castlevania side) whose short length and relatively easy difficulty makes it a great choice for those wanting to get into the genre. With fantastic visuals and surprisingly catchy music, there is little not to recommend about the game\u2014other than the absolutely horrendous name which I have to look up every time I want to mention it to someone. \n\t\nWith that out of the way, let\u2019s talk about the game in more detail. Firstly, this game takes HEAVY inspiration from Symphony of the Night (and all of its bastard children) in terms of aesthetic direction and general game feel. Despite this, Record of Lodoss War has enough fresh ideas to keep things interesting. Most notably, it features two swappable spirits, one red the other blue, to change some basic properties about the main character and absorb incoming attacks of the same type. The red spirit controls fire and the blue, wind. Some enemies are weak to one or might resist the other so switching becomes important. Or it would but despite every enemy in the game having some amount of elemental weakness, having attacks of any other type than \u2018fire\u2019 and \u2018wind\u2019 is uncommon. The only good way to get attacks of all the element types is to hunt down the optional magic spells. For the record: magic is absurdly overpowered\u2014especially against bosses. Having the right spell can almost invalidate the bosses in the game and break any remaining difficulty. The element system overall is woefully underutilized since changing your attack\u2019s element isn\u2019t easy for large sections of the game. It also uses the faces of a die to represent weakness and resistance for no good reason. Maybe dice play a big part in the franchise but I can\u2019t be bothered to go down a Wikipedia rabbit hole right now.\n\t\nThis is not a challenging game. If you play games mainly to overcome trials, this simply isn\u2019t the game for you. The joy of this game comes from how enjoyable moving about the world is and the very tangible sense of progression. New, more powerful weapons get handed down frequently and the primal joy of seeing \u2018number go up\u2019 feels great when exploring the world. The locals are different enough to give a sense of progression but they fall back on typical location tropes. \n\t\nOverall, the game grabbed me and hooked me in until the end. It is a thoroughly enjoyable game with wonderful visuals. If you like Metroidvanias, you should absolutely give it a shot. While, I don\u2019t think this game will be on my mind in a month, the short time it had my attention, it did so fully. \n", "timestamp_created": 1658334032, "timestamp_updated": 1658334032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631031215190887451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119087832": {"recommendationid": "119087832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355465109", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 607, "last_played": 1658256705}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta bueno \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1658256871, "timestamp_updated": 1658256871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119078457": {"recommendationid": "119078457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017292896", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 555, "last_played": 1659627940}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are a great fan of Lodoss like me, do not hesitate!", "timestamp_created": 1658246913, "timestamp_updated": 1658246913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119045885": {"recommendationid": "119045885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306546886", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 511, "last_played": 1658187579}, "language": "english", "review": "Good metrodivania game.

The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the controls feel perfect, and it's constantly throwing new abilities and enemies at you.  If anything, I feel like the pace of the game is maybe a little too fast; near the beginning of the game, you acquire upgrades in such quick succession that it feels like you've barely had any time to use the previous one.  It smooths out a bit as you progress, but this definitely isn't like some Metroidvanias where you have to spend hours exploring before you find anything interesting.\n\nThe most interesting twist on the gameplay is the wind and fire spirits that Deedlit can equip and switch between at will.  Switching to a spirit causes all of your attacks to take on that element and also lets you absorb attacks of that element, and each one also gives you a movement upgrade (wind lets you hover, fire makes you invincible when sliding).  There are a few segments of the game where it gives it an Ikaruga-like feel where you have to rapidly switch between elements to protect yourself from enemy attacks, and there are a few puzzles where you have to switch between them or use their movement abilities to navigate through rooms, although it does feel like more could've been done with them.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the story just isn't very interesting.  If you're not familiar with the Lodoss franchise, you will be completely lost; it does absolutely nothing to introduce any of the characters or references it makes.  If you are familiar with Lodoss, though, there's still not really anything compelling here; plenty of old characters will show up, only to say a few cryptic lines, maybe fight you, and then disappear.

Instead of perfecting the gameplay, refining the flaws, improving on the presentation; they instead highlighted the negatives. The presentation has no style, which will absolutely age horribly in a couple of years (it already looks worse than SOTN). It is featurecrept up the butt, with crafting/grinding/LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG rooms with slow gameplay, and a story that is so laughably predictable and boring that its biggest sin is the game's emphasis on it.\n\nNow, I enjoyed ROTN, I am mainly highlighting the stuff I didnt like in that game because I felt like it was such unnecessary stuff to add in a game like SOTN. 20 or so years to theorycraft a great sequel, and instead the game feels like a step back.\n\nNow WL.... where do I begin. Let's tackle its weakness first: WL is short.... really really short. Compared to SOTN, and ESPECIALLY ROTN, you are going to breeze through this game..... but that is a potential weakness for you, not for me fam.\n\nThe pacing of this game is so TIGHT that you will enjoy every single second of it. Comparing it to ROTN, this game is a 4th of its length, if even that, but in ROTN you will be counting the hours you have until finally getting it overwith. While ROTN overstays its welcome by a long mile, this game shows that shorter experiences can have a far better impact on the player.\n\nNow that we got the \"weakness\" out of the way, let me speedrun of the positives for you:\n\n1) The music is fantastic.\n2) The visuals are STUNNING and stylized, compared to ROTN, this game will NOT age a day decades from now.\n3) The story is intriguing yet not intrusive.  The presentation is laid out quite quickly and it does not kill the pace of the game in the slightest.\n4) The map is VERY straightforward, and a lot of the mental map is diminished as the ingame map highlights doors that are locked for you.\n5) The gameplay is very similar to SOTN and ROTN.

Two different elements are tied to the melee hits (with the rest being accessible only though magic spells), with are the wind element for added mobility in the air, and the fire element which has a longer slide with i-frames. Enemy attacks of the same element as the one you're using can be absorbed as MP, making spellcasting and arrows much less prohibitive to use in combat, and allowing to properly exploit the elemental weakpoints though magic and letting you in on ways to hit the enemy from long range even while dodging. The Ikaruga-esque elemental mechanic also allows for interesting scenarios during combat, as several bosses will shoot out attacks that will require quick switching in order to avoid damage. \n\nDeedlit's movements are also very responsive, without delay between input an action. She also can attack in most directions and has a bow to deal with long range or flying enemies, in case they were becoming annoying. My only two gripes with the controls is that trying to slide in the middle of a down attack will instead lead to a jump (which wouldn't surprise me if it was made on purpose, to not make Fire Deedlit near invincible), and the bow will cancel itself when you don't fire in like 3 seconds, forcing you to aim again.\n\nThe main negatives you could probably draw from the game are the lenght, map design, and difficulty. I cleared the game in 7.5 hours, at like 99% of the map completed, so probably you'd be seeing about 5-6 hours of regular play to just see the ending, though there's some additional content to get upon game completion. Some people might see this as too little for what they pay, others will be seeing a game they actually get to complete in their limited free time. For the map, the areas look really pretty, but are also mostly lineal, with few big rooms to tackle. There're secret passages (visible if you pay attention) and rewards from backtracking (sometimes a bit too many, as I replaced my weapon like 3 times in 15 minutes from simple backtrack), but it does have a sort of claustrophobic feeling at times. Regarding difficulty, Deedlit actually takes quite a bit of damage per hit, but the game has an auto-recovery mechanic though usage of the elemental switch system, letting you recharge HP so long as you don't get hit, and in the meantime you're also charging the other element's level through hits and kills. I could use this mechanic, together with long range and MP recovery on hits, to recover from potentially deadly scenarios, so more avid players will find much less of a challenge.\n\nAll in all, the game plays too well and is lots of fun to not recomment, even if you are like me and knows Lodoss War by name only.

Some attacks being the same color as others that are elemental (you can ignore if the right element) while not being such so you think you can be safe but take damage. You'll learn these after taking damage/dying a bit to the enemies that do it... but it still happens often enough to be annoying on bosses.\n\n-It bugged out so after I beat the final boss... it wouldn't continue on the ending cutscene area, I had to restart and it wanted me to fight the final boss again... I just watched it on youtube.\n\n-Lacking lore or interesting story. It's extremely bare bones, and pretty predictable what the ending is just a short bit into the game.\n\n\nNow, all these cons aside... it's not terrible. The core gameplay is... different and somewhat unique from other metroidvanias. You have an elemental type, wind or fire. You can swap between them and you wont take any damage from elemental attacks of yours type. Some enemies are like this and wont take damage from you if you're the wrong type as well. Controls aren't perfect, sometimes it's hard to do what you want too... but overall it's mostly pretty good, if simplistic compared to many others by the end. It's still an interesting aproach to a metroidvania and I did like it as an interesting variation, but with the overall story lacking so, setting being meh... and short and buggy ish game time I just don't think it was worth the cost I payed for it. If it was like five to ten then it'd be more ok.\nHonestly I had somewhat high hopes since I've liked this story/setting from the past, was thinking a metroidvania of it could be awesome... but again if you want story... you'll get basically nothing new or interesting here. One single main concept is all it has that is easy to predict and while something I like seeing explored... not nearly enough on it's own like it was done to really make me think the game was enjoyable or interesting lore or story wise while playing, or very memorable afterwards. That one mechanic is all that feels memorable after beating it now...\nSo ya, not terrible, buy on super sales maybe, but don't expect way too much.

As someone who loves the Genera I found quite a bit about this game I really liked, but that isn't without some criticism. \n\nThe comparison to Castlevania especially is very direct. It takes a lot of inspiration from that game and it might be a little too derivative of that game. The formula works quite well and the mechanics of the game are very good, but you'll never get as good of an experience out of this game as you would from Castlevania Symphony of the Night. This isn't to say the game is bad, its not, just that it very much lives in the shadow of another game and does too little different to stand out.\n\nAnother set of criticism I have is with the bosses. Quite a few of the bosses in this game are repeat bosses with new skins and maybe one or two new abilities so as you grow in skill at the game as well as levels with stronger equipment the game becomes much much easier as their patterns aren't much different. There really isn't any boss in the game that'll really stick out except maybe the last boss.\n\nLast major criticism I have is with some of the sound direction. Now, I'm extremely sensitive to sounds around me. The \"MAX LEVEL!\" that played honestly was a bit overwhelming for me and there was just a lot of other noise pollution in the game. Music is a person taste thing but I didn't personally care for it. It was alright but nothing that was defining as Castlevania, Metroid or even as memorable as Ender Lilies for me.\n\nI know I've been somewhat critical of the game up until this point, but now I get to talk about what I loved about the game.\n\nThe art direction was really good. The areas were distinct, the enemies all looked quite interesting and some of the unique capture animations such as with the mimic or when a boss grabs you or binds you was quite nice to see since they are unique sprites. The visual clues on your outfit was also really great to see with a blue cape or a green cape depending on which element you are attuned to at the time was helpful. The team really put a lot of effort into how the character looks and all the skills and it shows.\n\nThe gameplay is really fun. The wind and fire elemental swapping was very enjoyable and using that for puzzle solving and optimizing against bosses is a delight to use. The power sometimes can be a bit too strong at times trivializing some bosses in combination with magic. No boss was overwhelmingly difficult but they could provide a decent challenge for sure as well as testing your pattern recognition and reflexes with this elemental swapping skill as later bosses would use both. The two elements also has unique abilities which where required for puzzle solving and progression like blowing up barrels or hovering, so its a bit of a shame it wasn't used a bit more in unique ways since most the time it was just a means to pass a barrier.\n\nThe story was nice. It kept me engaged just enough to keep me interest even though I've never watched the anime its based off of. It takes place after the anime so it does have some spoilers for sure and it does go in expecting you to have at least some knowledge of the anime. This isn't too much of an issue since Deedlit's story is very relatable and easy to follow.\n\nNow the question of do I recommend this game? Yes, even with the criticisms I have they're fairly light. If you can't get enough Castlevania than I absolutely would recommend trying this one out.

There's nothing bad about the experience, but it has nothing innovative whatsoever.  It's modeling itself heavily off Symphony of the Night and plays very similar, but lacking the scale.\n\nFirst off - this game also has nothing whatsoever to do with Record of Lodoss War.  It's like the devs made a generic dungeon game and then decided to paper the IP over top of it.  The story is super short and exists in a vacuum.  But I haven't seen Lodoss War in a long time, and it's pretty nice seeing the characters again.\n\nGameplay, just take the base Symphony of the Night experience.  You start with little, you beat bosses, you find new weapons, you level up a bit, you get better traversal skills, you unlock doors, you go to new areas, you beat more bosses, repeat.  You got your primary weapon which changes a bit how it attacks depending on what you equip, you got your bow which can shoot from a distance but costs a bit of MP with each shot, and you got your magic spell which does decent damage but costs a lot of MP.  \n\nThe only interesting wrinkle the game adds is that you shift between two element modes, fire and wind.  When you're in wind mode, you're immune to wind damage and deal wind damage with your weapon attacks, and vice versa with fire.  Some enemies are immune to fire so you have to attack with wind.  Some enemies attack with fire so you can ignore attacks by being in fire mode, and so on.  When you're in one mode and hit an enemy, you fill a gauge of power for the other mode, and when it's at level 3, your attacks do more damage in that mode and you passively regen HP.  But conversely, if you get hit you lose power in the gauge of the mode you're currently in.  So unless the enemy is weak to specifically fire or wind you kind of dance between the two modes keeping their gauges topped off.  There's a moderate amount of environmental puzzles where you have to switch between the two modes (which you do instantly with just a button press) to get passed obstacles.  \n\nThe real problem is this mechanic should have been the focus of the game but it's underutilized.  Most bosses only have one or two attacks using the mechanic.  Each mode is supposed to have an environmental traversal power - wind lets you hover a bit off the ground which helps traverse spike pit floors, and fire is supposed to allow you to blow up barrels.  Yet the fire specialty is used about three times the entire game, right after you get it, and then never again!  They should have been building on their only signature mechanic but it's like they forgot about it.\n\nThe game is insanely short too.  Where in a normal metroidvania you'd get a whole new zone to explore with your new traversal ability you just unlocked, in this game you get to the next boss within minutes.  The lack of build up leads to mental exhaustion, because the bosses are pretty fun but hitting them one after another lessens the enjoyment.  I took only 4 hours to completely clear the game.\n\nLet it not be said that the game isn't fun - it's fun, but it's just so fleeting.", "timestamp_created": 1653792256, "timestamp_updated": 1653792256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116134666": {"recommendationid": "116134666", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976944918", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 433, "last_played": 1653575865}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game.", "timestamp_created": 1653738265, "timestamp_updated": 1653738265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116112812": {"recommendationid": "116112812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967263346", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1653703990}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy corto", "timestamp_created": 1653697212, "timestamp_updated": 1653697212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116023890": {"recommendationid": "116023890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865090693", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1674176639}, "language": "english", "review": "Play it.", "timestamp_created": 1653543608, "timestamp_updated": 1653543608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426474660634994507", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116018349": {"recommendationid": "116018349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967772575", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 542, "last_played": 1653531483}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutly amazing game, visuals, score, every was breath taking. if your looking for a metroid-vania game like the old days this is for you 10/10 cant recommend highly enough", "timestamp_created": 1653531584, "timestamp_updated": 1653531584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115923156": {"recommendationid": "115923156", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966535888", "num_games_owned": 563, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1653361253}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent Symphony of the Night clone with absolutely gorgeous art and a nice twist in gameplay that rewards quick thinking.

There will be spoilers. This is also my first Metroidvania. Overall I enjoyed the game and my introduction to the genre, but the execution of certain elements bring down the experience. I recommend this game with caveats - probs not worth the $20 price tag considering how short and unpolished it is, but if you're bored and it's on sale, it's not a bad way to pass 10 hours.\n\nSTORY\nThis is a sequel to the events of the Record of Lodoss War's two animes, but I don't think you need to understand the original story's content. The story gives away that it's been 100 years since the titular character Deedlit adventured with the rest of her classic fantasy posse. And the title is of course a reference to Alice in Wonderland. So it's pretty easy to surmise that she's in a dream world of sorts. Due to that, what little dialogue the paperthin story has is pretty much deliberately obscure philosophizing, as all of the characters she runs into aren't actually themselves, but mouth holes for the voice of the author. It tries to be really deep when it's basically just another 5 stages of grief narrative.\n\nCORE MECHANIC\nI quite frankly liked the gameplay early on. The movement and combat centers around fire and air elemental spirits, which you can toggle between. Both allow you to regenerate MP from attacks of that element, though you do type specific damage, and enemies have particular resistances. Air lets you levitate while fire... well, I guess it later gets a better slide attack with invincibility frames, but that doesn't really feel meaningful. Both elements have energy bars that fill up to level 3 from successful attacks using the other element. Taking damage in an elemental form reduces the level, and at level 3 you get HP regen. So switching between forms is highly incentivized, and one is rewarded for their versatility and skill at dodging attacks with near immortality. Would probably make this a fun game to speedrun, if it wasn't for...\n\nEXPLORATION\nA lot of other reviews mention how linear the map design is. And yeah, there are few pathways that are objectively unnecessary to explore. Although this is my first Metroidvania, it was pretty obvious to me which powerups I could anticipate based on the artificial exploration limits in maps. Which is unfortunate. Early on the exploration was soft-gated by puzzles that were all elemental spirit or bow related, which were at least interesting. Later portions of the map were hard-gated by power-ups or color coded doors that open across the map with a switch. The fast travel and saves made backtracking through earlier sections easy, especially due to the...\n\nRPG MECHANICS\nI genuinely feel like the levels and stats bring down the experience of this game towards the end. Early on all the enemies and bosses are perfectly balanced for the kit that you have. But once you get to the \"4th stage,\" it spirals out of control. Other reviews that mention the late game difficulty spike are universally because they are more seasoned Metroidvania players who weren't trying to 100% the game. I actually tried to 100% the game, and because of that I was rewarded with being hilariously overleveled. When I had unlocked enough of the key abilities that made it worthwhile to backtrack (as well as discovered that certain parts of the wall are breakable and lead to new pathways), the enemies from earlier map regions became a chore to spam through. All that backtracking rewarded me with more gold than I knew what to do with, so I loaded up on health pots and other consumeables. Going forward those made me horribly overpowered, even against bosses. This is made extremely clear by the odd choice to have a boss rush as the miniboss to the final boss - the old bosses hadn't scaled with my level and most of them died within 10 seconds of spamming the attack button. \n\nA similar thing more or less happened with the game's equipment. There's a main weapon as well as a bow, with many variants for sale that only differed in 1 of 3 ways: attack speed, damage, and utility. Items with added utility, like multishot or homing bows, are literally so much better than the single shot, slightly tweaked speed/damage bows that even if something did 10 more damage per shot it wouldn't be an effective trade-off to never having to deal with the non-satisfying aim mechanic. For the main weapon, the clear advantage was in the two thrown weapons, the boomerang and the shuriken - they had the best range for their attack speed, but also the ability to hit the enemy as it returns to you. Every single other weapon the game tries to throw at you becomes pretty meaningless. I would've much preferred if they simply made the bow modular (penetrating, homing, multishot, lifesteal, etc) as power ups to be earned through exploration, rather than trying to scale player stats with enemy encounters.\n\nOTHER GRIPES\n- There's an archery training area, which on top of the arrow ricochet puzzles would make you think the bow is necessary. But in boss fights, actually aiming the bow is completely unnecessary, you just spam. While some boss maps have the metal walls needed to ricochet arrows, this is never actually necessary. It should have been if one is going to justify an archery training area/minigame.\n- The best bosses are the humanoid ones. The small hitbox encourages aiming, and the fact that they can move as quickly as you makes it seem like a real fight. The dragons or the final boss are all so big that they just become spam magnets.\n- Very surprised at the lack of enemies recognizable from the Lodoss War anime. Instead there's a grab-bag of generic fantasy creatures, most of which have movesets so slow and predictable that late-game they die before having a chance to attack.\n- While the core mechanic revolves around fire and wind elementals, there are actually a good number of other elemental types in the game, which are poorly fleshed out. Dark and Light are the obvious other pair, which is the reason why everyone mentions the Will o' Wisp (Light) spell (most enemies of note are Dark). The introduction of elemental weaponry simply waters down the need to master the fire/wind core mechanic, so I don't really understand why they were included.\n- Speaking of Will o' Wisp, the most broken spell in the game is actually Invisibility, which leaves behind an afterimage for the enemy to attack. Neither attacking nor taking damage while you are invisible breaks it, and even bosses are fooled by it. And it costs barely more than Will o' Wisp.", "timestamp_created": 1651012062, "timestamp_updated": 1651012062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114507538": {"recommendationid": "114507538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113610453", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1651672333}, "language": "english", "review": "Damn.

I feel like Luna Nights from the same dev was a bit more bang for your buck when it comes to an individual Metroidvania game since more aspects of the combat were pretty unique and standalone. \n\nIf you have the money, but neither Luna Nights or Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth, I would heavily suggest you get Luna Nights instead. It's a little cheaper, but far more unique when it come to approaching the Metroidvania genre while tackling it with a weakened version of Touhou's character that you play as. I don't really know anything about Touhou I just know she can stop time and likes knives.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/851100/Touhou_Luna_Nights/\n\nNow onto the actual review.\n\nI've played plenty of Castlevania, and barely any Metroid. Most of what I know about Metroid is from outside sources like YouTube or just word of mouth from friends and watching friends play. This feels like a simplified Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.\n\nThe story is pretty dog dukey. I didn't care about it much at all, I didn't skip or anything on my first playthrough but I did get tired of the story really quickly. It seemed flabby and emotionless, a lot of characters come off dumber than I think they should've and a lot of talks between characters are highlighted as very important by the \"director\" but it all seems like low level gibberish that a teen made for some sorta edgy Japanese short-story that they wrote for their literary class trying to sound like they're \"in the know\" with poetic speak, but didn't even hit the dart board.\n\nGameplay is nice. It's very fun and I very rarely had moments where I felt like the game screwed me over, or threw things at me that I couldn't react to.\n\nI said I very rarely had moments though, which means I had moments and I'll try to explain.\n\nOne thing that's really annoying is trying to slide after an attack. Even though you're \"physically\" done with an attack and could cancel into something else if they game allowed you, you simply can't. You have to wait until the [b]ENTIRE ANIMATION[/b] is done before you can slide, which isn't a good thing in a fast paced metroidvania where being ready to dodge tight stuff is very important.\n\nStun locking is a very real threat in this game and it's way too punishing whenever it happens. A lot of the times, if you don't go out of your way for HP upgrades from secrets and just general progression, most stuns will pit you near death or just outright kill you. I don't really see the purpose of stuns in this game and I genuinely don't think this game would suffer that much if you were to hypothetically remove them.\n\nThe Will-o-Wisp spell is overpowered. It deals considerable damage, and restores chunks of your gauge very quickly for basically no effort. Speaking of no effort, they heat seek, and It also freezes the screen (every one of the spells do this though) which can give you a breather to plan your next move which makes evading things really easy. They have no risk to them. The only downside is MP cost which is a measely 15 MP, and most fights will outright give you the ability to just pretend you're in a manawell. At the halfway mark you get a sword that just gives you MP on each attack, and a bow that gives you HP on each attack.\n\nFor example, shining star boss you can pretty much just sit in the lava and spam will-o-wisp in fire spirit with no downside. If you get a bow that uses a specific element, or none at all, you can also use these same manawells to just spam on the boss for free. I don't think they really thought too hard about the abusability of elemental immunity when they gave you element specific/non-elemental weapons, but I digress, there's many times you can be very egregious with it's usage.\n\nThe damage or effects of the other spells don't really make much a difference. They're way too expensive in mana cost to be used regularly, and the few times where I could use them for a burst, I'd just use Will-o-Wisp for more advantages. I literally never used Invisibility or that dark bat spell once beyond when I immediately got the spells. They are extremely underwhelming.\n\nThe wind slide is so useless. No iframes and weak travel. The flame slade has iframes and very good travel, while also doing decent damage that you can weave into a bow shot or melee. I can only assume that this was done to give each spirit their own mobility gimmick, because once you get the double jump extension the ability to hover never becomes needed at all. Plus flame spirit gives bonus damage to everything that doesn't guard against flame, so there's that.\n\nMap detail is really nice. I hear a complaint about map sense being off, but I don't really care about that stuff and don't entirely see how it affects the gameplay. When it comes to the layout, I feel like teleports and save stations can sometimes be put at really awkward spots which make them very inconvenient for the majority of stages.\n\nMusic is really good. Same with art in general.\n\nI genuinely enjoyed my time with this game but [b]20 bucks[/b] for [b]4 hours[/b] of playtime and [b]no extra content[/b] beyond boss rush (not even a hard mode or a remix) is [i]ridiculous[/i]. I really hope they patch in some extra content as free dlc eventually.

It's not the game I was hoping for and there are a few reservations, but if you enjoy the genre, there's plenty of fun to have with this.\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n+ Excellent game feel. Controls are extremely smooth.\n+ Most of the bosses are really great, Karla and Narse are probably the two highlights.\n+ The element switching mechanic is an awesome idea (could have been incorporated a bit more deeply into the game, though).\n+ Fantastic art and a lot of great monster designs. Deedlit also animates beautifully and it's just a joy to see her jumping and dashing around.\n\n= Story is just there. Not a big deal to me, this will depend on what you're looking for.\n= Music isn't bad but isn't that memorable.\n\n- Too linear.

Mysterious circumstances bring her to a megadungeon alone, ever unsettling as fragments of her past come forth without warning. What has happened, and why is this old-school gish here? Only for you to find out.\n\nThe tale plays like an Igavania game boiled down to its essentials, but with its own style. Various weapons are at Deedlit's disposal, and secret spirit magic spells can grant her advantages with the elemental rock-paper-scissors of enemy weaknesses. However, two elements are integral to her -- fire and wind, manifest as familiars who let her \"absorb\" their elements. Understanding which of these two spirits to have out when will be integral to survival -- both to regain MP for spells, and to regenerate HP when a spirit is at full strength.\n\nMastering this game relies on being skillful with melee weapons, using your bow to fight from afar and solve mechanical puzzles, casting spells and understanding what magic to use when. You know, as any elf is wont to do. Traversing the environs is treacherous and boss fights are brutal, forcing you to think on your feet and use all at your disposal. \n\nDeedlit's max HP and MP are relatively static, and returning to shops for consumables isn't reliable. Luckily, restarting from save points is quick, and boss rooms are preceded by a means to power up your familiars to be at full strength beforehand. Expect to replay most boss fights at least once to master their attack patterns. And as with any Igavania, backtracking with new traversal skills (and unlocking certain colored gates in the labyrinth) will serve you well.\n\nThe translation isn't perfect, but it's still legible and feels like old-school JRPGs you'd grown up with. You know the ones. As someone who has only seen a few episodes of the Lodoss War anime, the big reveals caught me off-guard but proved satisfying by the end nevertheless. If you're an outsider to the series, the game does well enough to present its story without holding your hard. I'm sure Lodoss War fans will adore the shoutouts that flew over my head much more.\n\nIf you're looking for a short-and-sweet, challenging Metroidvania that innovates on the genre's design, you've come to the right table. The DM may not go easy on you, but the brave will see their skills reward them and enjoy the wonders within this labyrinth.", "timestamp_created": 1643001662, "timestamp_updated": 1643003468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557364583015441895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108659387": {"recommendationid": "108659387", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980238525", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1642991482}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night? Then you know what you're in for and would like this (with one major asterisk).\n\nThis game is in desperate need of separate music and sound effects volume sliders. Music and sound effects are tied to the same *one* slider. This is a problem because, everywhere you go, the music is blaringly loud and energetic. It gets extremely grating. When I was on the verge of a headache, I'd mute the sound just to get a reprieve. Further, it's hilarious that they're selling the soundtrack separately because, in addition to being uniformly bombastic, I can't recall a single tune. Utterly bland and generic. Forgettable. Indistinct. Meanwhile, Symphony of the Night's soundtrack I'm still humming 20+ years on.\n\nIs that an unfair comparison? Probably, but having suffered through 6.5 hours of that soundtrack, I'm not exactly feeling charitable. Patch a slider in, guys. You're not Nintendo and this isn't the 90s. Games have settings these days.\n\nAlso, it's rather short with very little inherent replay value. I've been playing a lot of metroivdanias lately and as far as replayability goes, this one's at the lower end of the spectrum. Finishing the game only unlocks a boss rush... which blows my mind because the next-to-last boss of the game is a boss rush, so... what's the point? There are no alternate playable characters. No alternate play styles. Either play it again or... don't. I probably won't.\n\nSo why am I recommending this while sounding so negative? Like I said at the beginning, it's very comparable to Symphony of the Night (soundtrack aside): solid gameplay, movement, and combat. It feels good to play. It looks wonderful. It's absolutely worth playing... but buy it on sale... at least until they fix the sound options. $20 is a bit steep for a short, one-play game that might cause headaches.", "timestamp_created": 1642993977, "timestamp_updated": 1643166538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108656175": {"recommendationid": "108656175", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967623102", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 566, "last_played": 1642988811}, "language": "english", "review": "100% completed the game in 9 hours even though I was finding one last weapon a long time (the game info didn't show which monster is dropping it) and one achievement was so unclear.

It's such a mechanically satisfying game to play. If you're used to playing hard games you will absolutely destroy this game and one shot most bosses, but somehow the game feels very satisfying. It's on the easier side of games that expect mechanical prowess, but not to the point of not having fun.\n\nThe writing was very anime and cliche, but to the point of being kind of campy and fun.

The first sign is the archery minigame that's the hardest thing in the game by an incredibly wide margin & is required for 100% weapon completion (and therefore two achievements) but requires none of the skills involved in the rest of the game.\n\nAfter that, the signs quickly pile up. Long hallways that repeat the same enemy pattern. Long hallways full of the same enemy. Enemies who just sit there & let you kill them. Straight lines of enemies you can just jump/float over/slide through. Bosses who just sit there & let you kill them. A mandatory boss rush that's filled mostly with bosses you'll kill in several seconds because you're over leveled now but also includes the two bosses you just beat, one of whom is a slight variation of another boss you've beaten twice.\n\nIt even fails at the basics of metroidvania design because most of the backtracking you'll do is to unlock earlier doors that require keys you suddenly start getting really quickly right before the end of the game or breakable walls in obscure spots or tall shafts you needed the double jump to get through. Then there's the room you can only access by jumping on a certain spot 50 times. Literally 50 times!\n\nWorst of all, the map is designed to make you go through some of the most pointless filler hallways countless times to really maximize the artificial lengthening. The bosses are either braindead easy or are given ridiculous stats just to make you find the cheese that turns the fight into a joke.\n\nThere's a lot of cheese. There are moves that make you invincible, enemy attacks that potentially heal you, weapons that heal you, & there's even a spell that's not hidden that makes you invisible while draining your MP so slowly that it lasts the whole fight in most cases while the boss attacks a decoy & you just stab it in the back the whole time. Made worse by the fact that because they can't see you, you're free to stand around absorbing the elements they liberally fire at you so you can fully heal repeatedly throughout the fight, restoring your MP in the process so you stay invisible.\n\nIt's plain to see that even a lot of the people who say the game is good don't really like it because their excuse for the bad optional content (in a genre about completionism) is \"Don't play it.\", their excuse for the OP moves (almost all of the moves) is \"Don't use 'em.\", & their response to people who don't like the game in general is \"Don't play it.\"\n\nThe writing is terrible too. The game constantly acts like its characters are speaking in deep riddles even though it's constantly screaming its twist at you so there's nothing to look forward to because you know how the game is gonna end almost immediately after you start playing it. It's pretty much in the title of the game.\n\nDue to circumstances that admittedly make sense, everyone is behaving out of character all the time by talking like robots & due to reasons that don't make sense, no one just says what they mean. As a result, you don't know anything about any of the characters if you haven't watched the show so it's impossible to care about anything.\n\nThis game is good for a little over 2 hours as a way of coasting off of bias caused by buyer's remorse to get good reviews from people who backed it, people who liked it at first, people who like Symphony of the Night, people who like Luna Nights, & people who like the show. Luna Nights is tons better despite being made by the same people.

There are no difficulty modes and after beating the game you unlock a boss rush time attack mode.\n\nThe graphics and music are excellent and control is solid. Has pretty fun boss fights and a polarity mechanic ala ikaruga/outland that functions well. There are some very basic puzzles sprinkled throughout using only a couple gameplay mechanics. These environmental puzzles never surprised me and kind of felt like a chore instead of something engaging.\n\nAs a weak point the environments and level design feel a bit soulless/predictable and the world map doesn't convey a feeling of a cohesive whole. Progression is extremely linear & obvious (kind of like Metroid Dread, except more so). You generally proceed to the next set of color-coded doors that you unlocked, with one or two exceptions. \nThese things make me question why this needed to be a metroidvania instead of a straightforward stage-based game like rondo of blood with more focused level design. The game even refers to large areas as levels so maybe the direction was different at some point during development. On top of that the stores around the map have mostly useless weapons by the time you have money for them. Money & health/mana upgrades dont feel significant.\n\nThe game has a nice amount of control and graphics options for the user. The menus and general UI are really smooth.\n\nI'm not familiar with the Lodoss series but I got the impression this game doesn't really add much to the story / world. It's a tiny side story where perhaps only the opening and ending have any significance.\n\nLightly recommended if the game is on sale or you have interest in the Lodoss series. The game is a decent if super straight-forward castlevania SOTN clone with excellent presentation. Just don't expect it to have a lot of content, a real sense of exploration or be a challenging action game.\nI wouldn't recommend this game at base price. There is a lot of competition in the genre and at this price point you could most likely get another game with more fleshed out level design & content. Similarly for games with more rewarding action, exploration or story experiences. \n\nWhat's here is pretty good but nothing stands out apart from the clean presentation. The level design and lack of difficulty modes is a main sticking point for me. I'm all for short games if they're tightly designed and encourage replaying.\nThe movement mechanics are so typical that I don't feel incentivized to do a challenge/speed run through the game after getting a hang of its mechanics, it'd be like any classic metroidvania since SOTN except probably even less going on in movement.

Which is fantastic, because that is one of my favorite games. I found it to be fun immediately, albeit a bit easy. The animations are amazingly smooth, the pixel art is phenomenal. The music is great. The game is fairly straight forward, kill stuff, level, unlock doors, beat bosses. Most enemies can be killed before they attack you, but a few rooms later in the game pose a challenge. The arrow puzzles were simple yet a nice diversion to getting some items.\n\nI wasn't even sure who the dev was for this game, I just bought it because it looked like SOTN. But, as soon as I saw the Team Ladybug logo, I knew I would probably be playing a game similar to Touhou Luna Nights. It definitely has a similar feel. A lot of similar gimmicks are in the game, though they are gimmicks I enjoyed. I liked swapping between wind and fire states, how that changed game play and what I could absorb.\n\nSome gripes. Pressing hover, bow, and the stationary button all at the same time to aim in air is very impractical. This is a great feature, but it is not functional. It's a design choice, but I would have expected pressing the bow button in air to make you stationary. It would have been far more practical and enjoyable IMO. However, the bow is mostly useless in the game, at least the way I played.\n\nI watched the anime in preparation for this, and I can say, it is much better than the anime lol. You need only watch the first anime to understand the relationships of the characters, but really you don't need to at all because there is a very limited story. The second one you definitely don't need to watch, as there is only one small reference to a character from the second one, and I guess one from the manga as well, but I didn't read them.\n\nThe game took me around six hours to beat with 100% of the map. Asking price is steep for the amount of content. I did not bother to get all of the achievements, but I would imagine this adds a few hours of gameplay. That being said, this is a high quality product and may be worth full price to some. Definitely pick it up if it's on sale though.\n", "timestamp_created": 1641607732, "timestamp_updated": 1641607732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107551660": {"recommendationid": "107551660", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086124230", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1642655303}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bonito", "timestamp_created": 1641595361, "timestamp_updated": 1641595361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107474031": {"recommendationid": "107474031", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059773107", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 176, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 619, "last_played": 1641581110}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un p\u00edxel art hermoso que se nota que lo hicieron con ganas y con mucho amor.

However, the difficult really ramps up towards the end of the game, and like Touhou Luna Nights (Team Ladybug's other Metroidvania type game), the last bosses are absurdly difficult. I'm an older gamer, and I just don't have the patience anymore to slog through overly drawn out boss battles that require you to learn many MANY patterns that change on the fly. I don't mind dying and retrying once, twice, 10 times even. But eventually I just had to stop because I don't have the patience. It is frustrating as hell and it's not fun anymore to have to redo a boss battle over and over and over again. These types of old school 16 bit era difficult ramp ups just aren't fun anymore. I had the patience to deal with them when I was young, but anything that makes me want to smash my controller just isn't OK in my book anymore. For some of you hardcore gamers out there, the final bosses will be a walk in the park. You live and breathe pattern recognition and fast reflexes.

Like its predecessor, Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth is a m*troidv*nia with lovely 2D sprite work and a killer soundtrack. Yet there's something missing from Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth that made Luna Nights so great.\n\nWhereas Luna Nights had several gimmicks like bullet hell boss patterns, freeze time (that can be used to build up projectiles) and grazing bullets for MP, Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth has an Ikaruga-like polarity mechanic. And a bow. The polarity gimmick is implemented well enough - wind spirit takes no damage from blue projectiles and fire spirit takes no damage from red projectiles - but they made a really odd choice. Your cape is blue with the wind spirit equipped, which is fair enough, but when you equip the fire spirit your cape turns... green? I have no idea what they were going for there. During the more chaotic boss fights it's confusing to read visually, and while I got used to it eventually, it's just a really insane and counterintuitive design choice. Oh well. The polarity mechanic is fine but Luna Nights got a surprising amount of mileage out of its bullet time gimmick, while Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth slightly... predictable. It does everything you expect from polarity, but not much else.\n\nI should mention there's also a sublevel system that reminded me of Cave Story. If you kill an enemy with wind spirit equipped you get red cubes, and vice versa. Each spirit can be leveled up to three with these cubes. Instead of powering you up, they slowly heal your health at level 3. To that effect Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth feels easier than Luna Nights. I don't necessarily mind this, but it does cause a certain lack of urgency in boss battles. I wouldn't get rid of the mechanic entirely as I do think it's interesting, but it would probably benefit from a nerf. Namely, every single time you hit a boss you get points for your sublevel. Maybe dial that back a little.\n\nYou get a bow as a secondary projectile weapon, but it's also used in some light puzzle solving. This is actually one of my favorite parts of Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth. At first you're shooting arrows at gears to life gate doors, but it slowly gets more complex as the game progresses, requiring some additional platforming and planning. There was one puzzle in particular I thought was really clever, but I won't spoil it if you do end up playing Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth. There are also multiple spells to acquire throughout the game, but I always stuck to the default homing missile spell, so whatever.\n\nAs mentioned before, the difficulty leans a bit on the easy side. You'll probably die a dozen or so times to boss fights, but on the whole you can manage to take them down if you spam magic and arrows enough while occasionally getting close enough to sneak in some proper attacks. Regardless, the boss fights are usually quite enjoyable. They don't throw anything particularly unique at you but learning their patterns and deftly switching polarities is a fun time overall. The penultimate encounter is just a boss rush, which is annoying because the first five or so phases are easy enough to just tank out their attacks and spam them. The final boss fight felt like something I've fought in a thousand other games, so that's a bit anti-climactic. Still, fun times overall.\n\nRecord of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth is fairly short - I beat the game with 97% of the map uncovered just shy of seven hours. I had a mostly fun time with it but couldn't help but feel it was a bit lacking in inspiration. As such it's a solid m*tro*dv*nia but falls short of the higher echelons.

There are a number of flashing cutscenes and transition effects that cannot be turned off or disabled.  At the end is a series of flashes that are painful to watch even without being photosensitive.\n\nAnother very solid Metroidvania-lite from Team Ladybug, who made the wonderful Touhou Luna Nights a few years ago.  Like their previous game, this is a \"lite\" form of the genre, where you have the game broken up into stages (while still being interconnected) and it is much more linear than some of the other examples of the genre.  Each stage after the first contains one major progression ability, two bosses, and a scattering of other upgrades, spells, and weapons lying around.\n\nMovement and combat feel amazing, it is super fluid and satisfying to move around.  The different abilities mesh well, and can be used for both platforming and combat segments.  There is a lot of enemy variety in each stage, and bosses for the most part are well designed and distinctive.  A few of the late mid-game bosses feel a bit \"samey\", but the quality of the others greatly outweights it.  There is a late game boss rush which is intense and extremely fun.\n\nLike Touhou Luna Nights, there is a bit of bullet hell inspiration in the boss fights.  This time, the inspiration is the game Ikaruga.  Shortly into the game, you'll gain the ability to switch between wind and fire attunements.  While in fire attunement, fire attacks will regenerate your MP instead of doing damage.  Likewise for wind.  Switching attunements is a key method of progression and surviving boss fights, with one of the chapter 2 bosses being the peak of this mechanic.\n\nThe artwork works well, the sprites are beautifully done and well animated, and aside from the flashing, the visual effects are good.  There are a lot of sounds reused from Luna Nights, though most of them work well here.  The \"level 3\" sound clip makes me feel like \"it's on!\" and is very satisfying even if a bit repetitive.  Music is good, but not quite as memorable as Luna Night's soundtrack.\n\nStrongly recommended to anyone who likes the more \"vania\" side of Metroidvania, and don't mind the slightly more linear

I finished the game in 6 hours and was left wanting more because I was having fun the whole time. \n\nI don't really have anything bad to say about the game at all, except that knockback is kinda wonky and lasts forever. The game is also a bit on the easy side and has no difficulty options, but challenge modes are available once the game has been beaten. \n\nAlso the game is based on a pretty obscure (in the west at least) IP, so I had no idea who any of the characters were or how I was supposed to feel about them. The story isn't really the focal point of the game though so I'm willing to overlook it.\n\nThis game is a must-own if you like Metroidvanias.\n", "timestamp_created": 1637470978, "timestamp_updated": 1637470978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103110197": {"recommendationid": "103110197", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988264448", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 572, "last_played": 1637379250}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little Castlevania-like!

Symphony of the Night is an eternal classic and we all hope Konami releases it on Steam soon with high-res remastered original PS1 sound and the levels from the Saturn version added in, but Wonder Labyrinth will tide you over.  It scratches the itch even better than the GBA and DS games, which I would highly recommend as well. The biggest imperfection here is that you can't turn off the music without turning off all sounds, and I'd like to play the SotN soundtrack in the background, however, it's not too big a deal as Wonder Labyrinth has a great soundtrack, just not as good as SotN, but so few games/movies do. Other than that, there are really only very minor imperfections, overall the developers did an amazing job advancing what SotN and its sequels for the GBA did so well. The only thing I could really ask of the game is more of itself, but I'd rather have it be solid from start to finish than have it padded with a bunch of fluff like so many so-called \"AAA\" games do these days. It's just that Wonder Labyrinth is so fun to play I want more of it to explore and experience. Even though the game is a bit short, it has massive replayability and speedrunning potential.

TOO. SHORT.\n-A bit on the easy side.\n\nRecord of Lodoss War is a Dungeons and Dragons inspired sword-and-sorcery series of novels that was adapted into a manga, a fantastic OVA series, as well a follow-up series and movie. As far as games, the last Record of Lodoss War game I can remember was the Dreamcast game that came out in 2000, and it was decent at best. Now, 21 years later a small, independent developer working alongside series creator Ryo Mizuno gave us Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth.\n\nAnd I loved every minute of it.\n\nThe best way I can describe this game is if Record of Lodoss War had a baby with Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but was having an affair with Ikaruga on the side. I had an absolute blast from beginning to end with this game and could not put it down. The silky-smooth animations, addicting Metroidvania/Ikaruga hybrid gameplay, and the wonderful soundtrack had me engaged throughout the entire experience. Even the story was superbly presented, and all of the original Lodoss War cast made appearances.\n\nIf there are any negatives about the game is that it is CRIMINALLY short. I beat the game getting 100% of the Labyrinth in 4 and a half hours. Also, the difficulty is on the easy side, with really the only challenge being in the boss battles which is where the Ikaruga spirit-switching gameplay really tests your reflexes.\n\nI absolutely LOVED Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth and did not want it to end. Aside from the length, this is one of the best Metroidvania games ever made. Record of Lodoss War deserves more attention in the world of video games, and hopefully this game is enough of a success to get us a sequel or more titles in the universe. For the price this game is a steal, and I highly recommend picking it up if you are a fan of Metroidvania games, the Record of Lodoss War universe, or just adventure games in general.", "timestamp_created": 1636599870, "timestamp_updated": 1636600806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102540791": {"recommendationid": "102540791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010210572", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1636555195}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not for me but people will love the SOTN-esque spiritual sequel that this game provides.

Recommended: 8/10[/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\n[i][b]For Linux & Steamdeck: [/b] Gold experience. Mostly Playable, tested on Proton 6.3-7. The game often crashes after a few hours. Remember to save often. [/i]\n[hr][/hr]\nFor long time fans, Ryo Mizuno\u2019s Record of Lodoss Wars is a familiar franchise that harks back to early days of anime, manga, novels and video games. Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth is a decent entry to this franchise in the modern era. Borrowing mechanics from Ikaruga and Symphony of the Night,  it recreates a faithful adaptation to the source material, playing as the High Elf Deedlit as she wanders through a labyrinthine castle to uncover it\u2019s mysteries. \n\nControl and movement feels great with a respectable list of moves, the sprites are large and well animated, the enemies are varied, the bosses are interesting and the level design is above average, all in all, Wonder Labyrinth hits many of the right notes for a good metroidvania with the few drawbacks it has is it\u2019s underwhelming story and characters as well as platforming. \n\nBut as it is, the 7 hour long game will satisfy existing Lodoss Wars\u2019 fans. Recommended. \n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]What\u2019s Excellent[/h3]\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [td]1. Good design and animation[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]2. Game mechanics are well executed.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]3. Combat, controls and movement are responsive and tight.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]\nThe 32-bit retro-style visuals are designed and animated well. The sprites are large, detailed and fluid. The enemies and bosses are varied and they look good. It shows that the developers put some love and effort into faithfully recreating these characters. In terms of 32-bit retro-style graphics, Wonder Labyrinth is definitely one of the better ones. \n\nThe Ikaruga inspired dual polarity does make the game interesting and it\u2019s a pivotal part of how to play the game right. You will be constantly switching between Fire and Wind for battles and puzzle solving. Certain enemies and bosses will be immune to your attacks base upon which polarity that you\u2019re equipping at that moment. \n\nControl and movement are tight and responsive. You will notice that Deedlit\u2019s animation bears a striking resemblance to Alucard and I dare say, her control and movement also shares that resemblance. Combat is inspired by the fast and fluid hack and slash of Castlevania as well as a dash of strategy involved when switching your spells, equipment and polarity to take down enemies and bosses. \n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]What\u2019s Good[/h3]\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [td]1. Puzzles and levels are well designed.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]2. Spells, gear and consumables are well thought-out and fun.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]\nThe castle in the Wonder Labyrinth is divided between sections that are locked by color-coded doors and interconnect with each other. There are also teleportation rooms that makes fast-traveling to another end of the castle convenient which is appreciated. The puzzles to open certain paths are also quite clever, and the reward you receive when you solve them is considerable. \n\nThere are just the right amount of spells, equipment and consumables the game offers that are useful and fun to use. Weapons with varying degrees of reach and attack speed as well as spells with different attributes can be strong or weak against certain types of enemies and bosses. While by no means deep, the level progression is good enough to feel substantial.  \n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]What Could Be Better[/h3]\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [td]1. Story & characters are not great for non Lodoss Wars fans.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]2. Platforming is lackluster.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]\nThe biggest drawback of this game is it\u2019s story and characters. Anyone going into this game without knowing the history of the Lodoss Wars will find themselves feeling lost as the game presumes that you are already familiar with it\u2019s lore. You also won\u2019t be able to connect or relate with any of it\u2019s characters as it too assumes that you are versed with the Knights of Lodoss. As such there is very little character development for the player to get invested in. and there is very little to motivate non-fans to see through the game to the end other than the game play. \n\nWhile the levels and puzzles are designed well, I can\u2019t say the same about it\u2019s platforming. Truthfully, the absence of good platforming challenge from this game contribute to a less than satisfactory experience, making the game feel incomplete. \n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nFor fans of Lodoss Wars, this game will more than likely satisfy their itch for more content. Wonder Labyrinth isn\u2019t a good entry point to the franchise for new players, but if you\u2019re looking for an above average Symphony of the Night clone, this game will provide a good experience.

The plot wasn't relevant for me in the decision to buy it, maybe if I watch the anime, but certainly the SOTN overall touch was enough to give the money and enjoy the game. In comparison to the Castlevania - Symphony Of The Night, there's no complex special moves and body parts items to equip, only handed weapons and bows with a slightly different stat and level system, however, there are new gameplay concepts added, some not so new to metroidvania fans.\n\nSome Steam reviews said the game is short, and I think it's just a little bit shorter than the average metroidvanias around, but it's worth playing for sure. \n\nIt might be easy on the beginning, however, depending on you familiarity with the genre, it becomes moderate or hard across the chapters, forcing you to understand the new mechanics, use correctly the skills and learn the enemies and bosses patterns. In some cases I just threw a plenty of stones everywhere to beat them, but I had to avoid some attacks and absorb MP to keep spending stone spell anyway hehehe.\n\nIf you're a metroidvania fan, go head, it's one of the best available. \nIf you know the genre but it's not your type, try it out for the time steam give us to test. But try to go beyond the early chapters where the game becomes more challenging.  \nIf you never played the genre, check some videos before, especially from Super Metroid and Castlevania - Symphony Of The Night enthusiasts to see if your spirit matches.\n\nMetroidvania in a nut shell, is about wide free walking exploration map with many sections, adventure action RPG, items to improve yourself and unlock new areas, good fighting moments and peculiar bosses. Aside from the Mother and Father of the genre and it's kids, there's a whole world of similar games that contributed to fulfill our hungry for exploration and unlock things in 2D block like maps. My favorites are Axiom Verge 1 and 2, Ori 1 and 2, Guacamelee 1 and 2, and Bloodstained - Ritual of The Night (you need to check this last one if you eventually become a SOTN fan).\n\nGL HF!", "timestamp_created": 1635824165, "timestamp_updated": 1635824165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102063468": {"recommendationid": "102063468", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980658013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 278, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1635814522}, "language": "english", "review": "A good one of these.", "timestamp_created": 1635814726, "timestamp_updated": 1635814726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53608250617980957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102056634": {"recommendationid": "102056634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086181523", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1635906263}, "language": "english", "review": "Very heavy Symphony of the Night vibes.

I wish I could rate it \"meh\" but honestly it flips more towards \"not recommended\" than \"recommended\".\n\nThe game pales in comparison to Touhou - Luna Nights both in terms of visuals and mechanics. It's not that the game is \"uglier\" - it's not - or that it doesn't have cool mechanics of it's own, but it doesn't come close in terms of how memorable it is.\n\nTo start off, you get strong way too quickly, to the point where you're basically breezing through almost every boss at the first encounter. Even bosses with multiple forms, you quickly wonder \"is there going to be an actual stronger form afterwards?\" only to just end the fight in a non-climatic way.\n\nThere's a spirit system in the game, where you can control both wind and fire spirits, and they're responsible for about 50% of the gameplay mechanics, maybe a bit more. You have to change between fire and wind to deal damage to enemies or overcome obstacles, but due to the level system where your damage raises and your health regens based on the level of your spirit, you can quickly become way overpowered if you learn how to balance between the wind and fire spirit. Your spirit level is separate from wind and fire, and you get \"exp\" for a spirit by using the opposite spirit when killing enemies. At first it might seem like it's harder to improve the spirit you want, but it quickly becomes the opposite - you can only get to max level 3 on the spirits and lose a level on the current spirit you're using every time you're hit, and using the opposite spirit means that you can get hit as many times as you want provided you're switching between them often enough (this is mostly true for bosses that drop the spirit exp like crazy).\n\nMost of the map looks same-ish, and being a Metroidvania game very remnant of Symphony of the Night, it really pales in comparison. It's separated into chapters (the chapters' names are not translated from Japanese), and I have no idea why: the map is interconnected like any metroidvania, separating the game into weird \"chapter change\" pauses really doesn't make sense, specially since nothing is stopping you from just going back the very instant you enter the new chapter area, and it's not relevant to the story build up or exploration. I guess it's because of the demo version which only had chapter 1 I believe (?) but in the full game it really doesn't add up.\n\nLastly, and I am totally aware that this is a personal problem, but I feel like it's important enough to mention since most of the people playing this game will face the same issue: Record of Lodoss War is based on an rpg series of the same name that exist almost exclusively in Japan - being a game that heavily draws from its lore, it becomes really hard to really grasp the importance of the characters being introduced, as they are NOT original or exclusive to this game (with the exception of one or two I believe) and the story focuses on key points from previous games/media, and even though you don't have to know the background of the story, it really makes it hard to truly appreciate what you are looking at, and sometimes even understanding it at all.\n\nThat being said, I really ONLY recommend this game to people who are really out of options for better Metroidvania games (as I feel replaying SOTN or Touhou - Luna Nights would have been a better use of the time spent playing this game) or to people who are already fans of the Record of Lodoss War series. I wish I had a better opinion on this game, as it was gifted to me by someone who was important to me, but alas it was a dissapointment.", "timestamp_created": 1634953579, "timestamp_updated": 1634953579, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52775120735168457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101334452": {"recommendationid": "101334452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275844770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 940, "last_played": 1634720873}, "language": "english", "review": "Speechless", "timestamp_created": 1634721097, "timestamp_updated": 1634721097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101249167": {"recommendationid": "101249167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040905776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 479, "last_played": 1634951048}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is a wonderful spiritual successor to SOTN with a similar gameplay, but increased depth and difficulty, yet not to a punishing degree as it still allows for a relaxing, enjoyable experience. \n\nBosses are creative and well designed (meaning learning attack patterns will serve you well).

Here, fight fight fight! And that's it. If you haven't read the manga, which I didn't, then you have no clue who anyone is. I mean it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, castlevania games don't need a story but if it had a really gripping and engaging story I wouldn't be sitting here complaining that the game should have had less of a story, would I? \n\nGame play is basically just castlevania. Difficulty is very low with all your spells auto aiming, so most bosses just turn into you running around dodging and repeatably casting spells (or rather just the stone blast as that thing is clearly the strongest spell in the game yet you get it as the 2nd one). The enemies have varying immunities and weakness, yet your main attack can only switch fire and wind, so again amplifying the OPness of spells. \n\nAlso there is no need to have your element levels to constantly flash in the middle of the screen when they reach level 3. After a while you get used to it and stop looking there but it is what initally stopped me from even considering buying the game by just looking at gameplay footage. \n\nA lot of people call this the best metroidvania of the year and they are right but not because it does anything really well but instead because a lot of companies seem to have a very hard time figuring out what makes a good metroidvania game and even trip over the low hurdle of just 101 copying castlevania.", "timestamp_created": 1634368493, "timestamp_updated": 1634368493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525316417217254639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101122067": {"recommendationid": "101122067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046210239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1634360509}, "language": "english", "review": "wonderful trip back of nostalgia in a solid game", "timestamp_created": 1634360737, "timestamp_updated": 1634360737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101111111": {"recommendationid": "101111111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028002660", "num_games_owned": 839, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 514, "last_played": 1634340179}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though this is not my kind of game genre (I want a modern JRPG about Lodoss!), I have to admit that the pixelart is beautiful as well as the fluid animations and music.

I must say that i haven't been huge into Metroidvanias very recently aside from my roughly yearly play through of SotN.  (that's a kicker, more on that later.)  i tried getting into a few recent ones like Hollow Knight, Bloodstained, The Messenger, but none held my interest enough finish the games to completion.  that's nothing against those games, maybe i was just in the wrong head space for metroidvanias at the time.  \n\nAnyways, let's talk about the game at hand.    \n\nI honestly haven't been captivated to play one game straight through in a long time. Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth has broken that streak.  the graphics are beautiful and really call back to Symphony of the Night.  I know right, an SotN reference, in the first paragraph.  \n\nThe sprite work is amazing, Deedlit looks great, random monster fodder designs are nice, and the bosses can be very impressive.  Your avatar even has a shimmering shadow effect when she moves...like Alucard from SotN!  and a back dash too!  The backdrops for each section or \"stage\" of the Labyrinth are amazing looking as well.   Overall if you're looking for a Sprite-based Metroidvania, that looks a lot like Alucard's Doppelganger, this maybe the one for you!\n\nThe game play revolves around searching the castle for clues as to where you are and what is happening around you.  You do this by exploring and murdering pretty much everything in your path.  Early on you come across two spritis who then aid you on your journey, They give you the ability to swap between wind and fire elements and increase your damage to enemies and nullify incoming projectiles depending on elemental alignment.  Like Ikaruga, if you've ever played that. It is very satisfy swapping elements during the bigger boss battles, as they are constantly throwing various mild bullet hell type projectile patterns for you to dodge and swap through.  you feel pretty bad ass as your doing it too.\n\nSpeaking of boss battles, i only died during a few, and felt like I died more just exploring the castle.  I feel as though this game falls onto the easier side of the spectrum,  it was really a breeze to play through and maybe that's why it clicked with me.  I don't think a Metroidvania needs to be really long, I spent about 10 hours on this game, and to me, that is probably on or around the perfect amount of time for a Metroidvania game to last.  \n\nThe story is good, I've never read or watched the source material, although I've always wanted to.  I'm not confident in my ability to convey any information from this game regarding that particular facet of the story.  I don't know if this is a \"what if\" kinda story or canon, or if it's related to events from other media.  some say it could be lacking, but it drove me enough to finish the game in a couple of gaming sessions.\n\nThe music and sfx are great, there are a few tracks that vibed with me, but I don't know their titles so I can't reference them  here,  a few even sounded like they called back to *gasp* SotN. \n\noverall I was very satisfied with this purchase, and I highly suggest it to fans of the Metroidvania genre, or Castlevania in any of it's forms.  it was a treat to get to play this love letter to one of my favorite games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1633455780, "timestamp_updated": 1633455780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100460217": {"recommendationid": "100460217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083601581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1633288917}, "language": "english", "review": "Lacks depth of game play.

For a given playtime of about 6 hours, switching between Slyph and Salamander while ricocheting arrows left and right gets to be quite the decently fun romp.\n\nA downside is that this combination of spells, elemental switching, and regeneration (MP absorption and healing) can easily let you cheese and overwhelm any boss and enemy getting in your way.

It is a labyrinth all yours to explore and uncover its secrets. It has many weapons that give variety in the \u201cfeeling\u201d of the weapon and movement while striking. Apart from melee weapons you get bows and magical abilities that create a fun atmosphere in this maze. Enemies don\u2019t have a few differences either so you won\u2019t get bored battling the same monster over and over again. The graphics are nice \u2013 but not top \u2013 and aesthetically pleasing. The soundtrack and sounds are ok but nothing memorable.\n\n All in all it is quite fun and it offers many things. From simple upgrades to new abilities, exploring becomes a happy activity. There is a high chance that many times you will feel lost in this maze and won\u2019t know where to go or what to do, but you\u2019ll eventually discover the correct path. New power ups, weapons and abilities help with this. In some way, this is a good thing for your level up and the level 3 charging of skills to make you feel powerful but without making the game a breeze. It\u2019s always challenging in some way! In between all the combats you get to solve many puzzles in this labyrinth to progress further in the story.\n\n The game has no real tutorial and you get taught what you need to know and how to use it from progressing. Usually this is not a problem but you still may have some questions. There is a help book but not a \"hint path\" or directions. The controlling is solid and fluid and I doubt you\u2019d want to change something. One more feature I liked \u2013 and I like it everywhere it exists \u2013 is the market system, I love buying and selling stuff and collecting all the gear!\n\n I would say the best mechanic in the game is the spirit system, that\u2019s what makes it the most fun! I only wish they had utilized it more for progression\u2026 There is a big con in this game and this is its story. It\u2019s very confusing and most of the times you won\u2019t understand what is going on. The dialogues are fun and funny on their own but in the scale of the big picture they don\u2019t mean much\u2026\n\n [b]Be very mindful if you are epileptic or light sensitive that this game \u2013 without a warning \u2013 has flashing images and changes in color all of a sudden!!![/b]\n\n This game lived up to my expectations and I have no major disliking in something.

It has a strong beginning with offering you fluid control, combat, and aesthetic reminiscent of the beloved Symphony of the Night with an Ikaruga-esque polarity element to encounters and traversal. The game looks and feels very good, the music is nice on the ears, and the idea of the fire and wind spirits is very interesting. Unfortunately it doesn't offer anything too diverse as the game progresses. Exploration isn't as intricate as other metroidvanias, the puzzles are minimal and are often rather finicky when involving the bow, and enemy encounters don't leave too much of an impact. That last point is both bad and good because this game very much intends on acting as a power fantasy, starting strong and only getting stronger as you progress. That feeling is very much achieved, but the variety of movement abilities and spells can feel a bit lacking. The bosses are generally very good and actually do feel like a decent challenge compared to the enemies. The story is rather lacking overall. I was not aware of the Record of Lodoss War franchise before getting this game, but you honestly don't need much prior knowledge to play this game. While the premise and ending are decent, it does little to establish or flesh out its characters, likely assuming you already know who they are so they don't bother. This might sound contradictory to what I said previous, but considering the story isn't presented like a major focus to the game here, it all mostly boils down to callbacks and fanservice at the end of it.

The graphics and aesthetics seemed nice, and reviews were positive, so why not? However, this game's rating seems to be far higher than it has earned. It wasn't bad, necessarily. It is clear that the developers put a lot of love into the game. That said, when held up against its compatriots in the genre, it falls extremely short. This is my first real review, so I'll follow the format, starting with pros and cons. But first, a quick warning:\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]This game has a few sequences in it (one of the final cutscenes in particular) that would be EXTREMELY problematic for epileptic players. I did not see any warning of this in game, so I wanted to point it out here. I'd stay away if you suffer from epilepsy.[/b]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]\n- Great aesthetics. The characters all look and move beautifully, and the environments are easy on the eyes.\n- The spirit mechanic is interesting and seems to be pretty unique. Swapping elements as the situation requires to pass gates, perform platforming, and defeat enemies was mostly intuitive and felt fun. Additionally, having to switch back and forth between the two in order to keep their power up and regain HP in the event you took damage was a clever way to require the use of both, and did not feel intrusive. It added a nice element of thought, and swapping out became second nature quickly.\n- Varied trash enemies that matched their environments well added to the atmosphere.\n- Controls, on the whole, were quite tight and responsive. The character typically did exactly what you expected it to do. The only minor issue I had was [spoiler]with the high jump acquired later on. It seemed, in my opinion, to be pretty sensitive. If your input was not mostly directed upwards, the height would not be applied.[/spoiler]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]\n- Combat was lackluster. Typically, you would only really use one weapon and one spell. Most of the mission-critical enemies have a weakness to Light, so just spamming Will O' Wisp will do some serious heavy lifting. Most enemies are too weak to pose much of a challenge, and will die before they even manage to get an attack off.\n- Exploration was just... not there. Despite the apparent size of the map, rooms felt very similar and the game ended up being quite linear. There wasn't even much in the way of backtracking for secrets. Now, to give the benefit of the doubt, I did not go for 100%. I was disappointed with the game, which killed my desire to seek out every secret, That said, I was able to reveal 95% of the map without much other than just moving forward. Every new movement option was only used in a small number of places after it was acquired as well, so acquiring a new item was less \"look at all this great new stuff I can go explore\" and more \"ugh, I can finally move forward\". So many doors could just as easily have been replaced with some form of movement trick acquired at a similar time, if the rooms had been given more variety, and it would have felt better. Instead, we got the feeling of playing Super Mario World 2 and hitting switch palaces, only they were REQUIRED to progress the game.\n- Boss fights were mostly boring and extremely easy. Typically the strategy would involve identifying a blind spot (pretty much every boss had one) and spamming from within it. This is probably my biggest source of disappointment, because the bosses all looked great, but they were all bark and no bite. Spoilers for later fights here: [spoiler]Additionally, forcing the player to boss rush every fight in the game up until a certain point and calling that a boss fight is disingenuous at best. Seemed like the developers were padding for time here, especially considering both the dark elf and witch are fought twice already beforehand. It wasn't even particularly challenging, since again, none of the bosses are, but if you slipped up and got stunlocked, it was back to square one, which never feels good.[/spoiler]\n- The story was confusing, and that is being polite. The resolution is not satisfying either. Perhaps if I had more knowledge of the source material going in, I may have had a better time here, but I felt no attachment to any of the characters or their plight from the context given in the game.\n- The game falls into some of the pitfalls of its older predecessors. You can argue that it is trying to be as faithful to the genre as possible, but improvements have been made for a reason. Plenty of blind jumps and enemies placed just out of sight to tax you. Sure, you'll remember they are there the next time, but their placement added nothing but frustration. Additionally, many games have adopted a \"save wherever, spawn at checkpoint\" style, and for good reason. It makes deaths less frustrating, as well as making it easier to pick the game up and put it down whenever you choose. This game was not designed with that in mind. Then, later on, you will encounter a fast travel room right near a save room. This will make later encounters a lot easier, since every fast travel room becomes, effectively, a save room, which does not feel like the way the game was intended to be played. When games like this mistake frustration for challenge, it makes players more likely to use first-order optimal strategies rather than taking their time and exploring, which drives playtime down.\n- The bow mechanics were clunky at best and, more importantly, added nothing to the game. The gears were not creative, they just broke flow. The developers did a great job with the feel and flow of the spirit system, and could have just as easily made use of it in puzzles. Blow a fan or light a fire to get things moving. It would have felt nicer to work with, while leveraging probably the best mechanic the game brought. Instead, the clunky aiming of the bow and the somewhat janky design of some of the puzzles (looking at you, pendulum-sack doors) added nothing except a momentary, immersion-breaking gap in gameplay.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nAll of the above contributed to a disappointing experience. On top of all of that, the game was SHORT. Now, I did not go for 100%. I'll give the benefit of the doubt and say that I only experienced half of the \"secrets\" the game had to offer, though with 95% map completion that seems generous. Even accounting for that, I'd only be getting 10 hours of gameplay. Comparing that to similar titles at this price point, and can get more than twice that amount (in some cases, before even reaching an ending!). Personally, I find that a good benchmark for whether I am happy with the purchase of a game is whether I get about an hour of playtime per dollar spent, and I couldn't get there if I tried, short of spamming boss rush again and again. Not reaching this doesn't mean the game is a bad purchase, it just means that it needs to make up for its length with much more impressive gameplay to compensate, and that is where this game falls short in many ways.\n\nIn closing, the devs definitely tried their best, and a lot of love was put into the game. However the ratings and reviews seem to paint a picture of a masterpiece of the genre, and this game is just not that. It's not BAD, and I cannot stress that enough, but it is certainly not GOOD enough for me to recommend as a huge fan of its genre. For those that love these games like I do, there are plenty of other better options out there at this price point to try.", "timestamp_created": 1630205726, "timestamp_updated": 1630256492, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544978439807891846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98347555": {"recommendationid": "98347555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072615277", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1694181574}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a damn good metrovania.  gameplay is mostly smooth minus the sylph jumping.  playing this game made me smile.

I've been introduced to the Record of Lodoss series before via OVA but never looked further into it (other games and media). I won't say that playing this has inspired me to do that, but it's a good experience for what it's worth and I can tell a lot of work went into making this.\n\nFirst off, the combat is a bit of a mixed bag for me. The positives are that the movement abilities you get along with the variety of weapon types, and number of weapons themselves is pretty huge. There are a number of weapons that are Easter Eggs to the series as a whole and some which are references to Team Ladybug's other titles. Weapons are split into two categories, swords and bows (even though sword technically is any weapon that isn't a bow including a chakram or a spear, [spoiler] or even a chainsaw [/spoiler]. The weapons (mostly) attack differently too, from overhead swings, to stabs, toe slashes, so changing weapon types can benefit you if the current weapon you use doesn't seem to get the job done. Bows on the other hand implore more subtle changes like firing more than one arrow, being able to fire faster, or elemental damage. These are all great as you can choose to play the game with whatever tactic works best for you. The not so great is that most weapons are effectively useless once you get one weapon or the other. That's to be expected as you progress yes, but there are certain points in the game where you can get weapons that are objectively better than anything you might find after them. That means that even though you're weak, your arsenal could mean a game that is far easier than it, to a degree already is.\n\nWhile I'm on that, let's talk about difficulty. For someone like me, the quest becomes \"How easy is it for me to grind a couple of levels above what's necessary for the next boss or even the next area?\" I'm that kind of guy when it comes to these and other RPGs. I like walking into a boss room and walking out seconds later as if I had a stern talking with them instead. Sometimes this isn't possible, and that's fine; I don't always have to play that way. But for someone who isn't like me, this game is still relatively easy to manage. Aside from bosses, most enemies early only really don't attack you \"in-time\" before you kill them. This isn't to say thjat they're pushovers however, as plenty of enemies in the game can screw up your progress or even stunlock you into oblivion should you take them too lightly, but a lot of enemies, especially with a decent weapon in hand, become little more than a physical obstacle in the face of you just spamming attacks or arrows or magic (which is another thing that this game has).\n\nI died a total of maybe 10 times, most of which were from a boss until I learned his pattern and proceeded to curb stomp him, and once from being stunlocked at the worst possible time in a room full of enemies. Other than those, I breezed through this game like a summer wind. Bosses can prove hard to manage if you're not careful but even they are mostly cheesed by the silliest things. It wasn't too difficult for me, but the bosses could still be a threat to the unweary. I know it seems like I'm ragging on the game but trust me, the cons are not as high as the pros. The weakness system is actually pretty straight forward too when you stop thinking about them as dice and just numbers. Overall, combat is enjoyable I just wish that, in regards to how many weapons there are in the game, there were more useful things to do with them (maybe puzzles that can only be solved with a specific weapon or weapon type; though there are technically bow puzzles, but I'll get to that). As a contrast, enemies do vary greatly in look and attacks, despite my earlier comment. Again, you really should be able to kill most of them before they have the chance to really show off their moves but if you actually SEE some of their moves, it's deadly stuff. It's like \"Are you curious to know what this enemy does?\", or \"Do you want to make it to the next save room?\"\n\nAs i said the, uh, \"story\", is passible. [spoiler] Deedlit, the protagonist, was one of the heroes of the Lodoss War long ago. She awakens in this strange place and finds her old friends as well as her lover, Parn, whom she chases after in the maze while trying to figure out why she's there or what the place is. [/spoiler] There's a lot of name-dropping and cameos of characters from the series that I'm sure fans will know and enjoy, but for me, I honestly did not know what was going on. Not like, confused, just unengaged. Like if you didn't know anything about the series before, this wasn't going to be your introductory course into it. I'd say it could spark interest if you loved the game enough to check it out, but outside of that spark, there is no explanation of who the characters are, their importance to the story, the lore of the world itself; none of that. You get your necessary evils of what you can do and what to \"look for\" but this is no, \"I'm from a fabled line of Vampire slayers and I've come to destroy Dracula and end his reign of terror on Humanity.\" Again, this isn't a knock on the game but what your motivations are as a character are not really there. You just kinda end up here and need to find a way out but also you're not sure where \"here\" is, so you look around.\n\nThere are other things this game offers. A gambling mini-game, as well as an Archery mini-game, some \"challenges\" to unlock a few weapons and a Boss rush mode for the absolute over-achiever. The mini-games can range in enjoyment. I beat the archery mini-game and I was staring like a crazied zebra at the screen all the while doing it. I touched the gambling mini game once and if you're good, you can win big money, but there's no achievement for stacking cash and by the later half of the game, buying up all the items at the shop is child's play with some enemies dropping really good money. I farmed a handful of enemies back to back in the same room for about 10-15 minutes and was already 20k richer. The weapons that require a certain thing to unlock really were not  at all difficult, just time-consuming, but I'll, be honest, I'm not sure what challenges could have been made that wouldn't have frustrated someone. Like I said, they're there for you if you're looking to vary your experience but are not necessary. Along with the that, the bestiary can be completed as well as a list of all weapons, and magic in the game. Getting 100% for these is also not too hard but it's definitely not worth it if you're not someone who likes to grind.\n\nLast thing I'd touch on is the soundtrack. It's pretty good. music for different areas seem to convey their environment pretty well, bosses all share the same song (except the final boss) but it's not a bad track to hear on repeat. Not the most groundbreaking sounds but the music, along with the sound design work well. That's pretty much it. a good game that isn't too fancy but it's pretty fun and I enjoyed the time I spent on it (except that archery mini-game; fuck archery).

However, when it comes to gameplay and mechanics, it's very different and probably has more in common with the highly influential Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (although you utilise and accumulate magic in an entirely different way, which I don't want to completely spoil for you but it's similar to the elemental switching in bullet hell game Ikaruga). Bosses are creatively implemented and require you to strategically alternate between abilities (spirit powers) and think/react quickly when doing so. Exploration is about as creative as in any standard metroidvania in the last 5 years, not amazing but good enough.

Also, each element granting some mobility aspect is good, but I found myself using just one of them for most of the time.\n\nSimilarly, having a dedicated bow slot and arrow reflecting surfaces make for some nice puzzles, although all of them are simple and adequate to the game flow. Also, as the game progresses, the bow became a serious weapon, and made short work of some bosses.\n\nThere is a mechanic of elemental affinities which was good, and very clever in having different degrees of resistance/vulnerability without slowing down the game. Nonetheless some of the elemental affinity ideas feel underused. For example, it is quite easy to have wind and fire attacks, but for others, I had to rely exclusively on spells and some items found through the map or as random enemy drops. Maybe, exploring more the enemies drops I could have good weapons for other elements, but it was tedious to farm for such items, and usually bashing my head against some boss fight was faster. Also, the game would feel more rounded having armor slots, allowing the player to increase some defensive elemental affinities as well, but I understand this would require a lot of testing and balancing.\n\nThe ability to heal by having high level companions seems overpowered at some battles. Also, there are status ailments in the game that seems to affect very little if nothing at all. Considering the diversity of elemental affinities, it seems that the mechanics for status was introduced but not fully developed. Having status affect the way healing or changing spirits work would ante up some challenges.\n\nI think the game might have additional appeal for people familiar with the Lodoss War IP, which was not my case. Because of this, the story seemed vague from time to time, and also appear to reference some characters or events that could make for more shocking moments have I had any prior knowledge of the Lodoss War lore. Nonetheless, there are some interesting plot points, and I enjoyed the story, for what I could make out of it. Also, for people who might feel discouraged by this, the game is relatively short, and does not require you to follow the plot to proceed and have a good time.\n\nOverall, for the price point, it surpassed my expectations, and I would recommend it for any fan of the metroidvania genre looking a game to finish in some 4 to 7 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1629226295, "timestamp_updated": 1629226392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97706351": {"recommendationid": "97706351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198932628115", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 931, "last_played": 1629156194}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego", "timestamp_created": 1629156270, "timestamp_updated": 1629156270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97652483": {"recommendationid": "97652483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198971412197", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1641179822}, "language": "english", "review": "classic metroidvania", "timestamp_created": 1629082521, "timestamp_updated": 1629082540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97648647": {"recommendationid": "97648647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041498853", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 420, "last_played": 1630284634}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Castlevania SOTN, you will like this game.

This is one of the best games I have played in a while of this genre. There is so much to do and see here. Team Ladybug did not hold back with this one making it feel like a spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night for anyone who had the honor of experiencing that game in it's prime.\n\nSwinging your blades and magic around in this game feels so smooth. Of course, the smooth combat is made even more impressive by the fact that there is a variety of weapons items to find. Unlike anything in Symphony of the Night, they did add an interesting element switching mechanic in Deedlit and a ranged attack through the use of a bow. These tools feel absolutely fantastic. Nothing in Deedlit feels like it is too overpowered or too under-powered; all of the options given to the player allow you to even alter difficulty to your liking through the equipment, which is a warm welcome.\n\nAlthough the equipment you find is great, it is not the only tool in your arsenal. You will also gain abilities in the form of magic spells you can use against your foes. There are a good variety of spells that all are really unique and useful in their own ways really allowing for some expressive playstyle for the player. Also, like everything else in Deedlit, your magic is not going to break the game by being too strong, but on the contrary will be found to be just right in its application. Magic is very useful without being broken.\n\nNailing the fluidity of combat was not all they did right when developing this game. These developers really knew what they were doing with balance as well. All of the enemies and bosses in this adventure all feel really well made by giving the player a real varied challenge without being too harsh. Each boss really has their own personality that comes out with their fighting mechanics, which makes each of them a joy to learn to overcome.\n\nTo be honest, this is one of those titles I could sit and gush over for hours because of how good it is.

First and mostly, this game has zero story. It has negative story. Like touhou nights (from the same developers) the game happens in some kind of dream or parallel dimension. Characters appear in and out, you don't know who the hell they are. They talk about things you don't know neither understand. This game has a pretentious name, but might as well be named \"Warrior Lady elf\", There is no record, i dont know what happened in the war, I dont know what lodoss is. The only thing i learned is that the protagonist is Deedlit. Apart from that, there's the game mechanic, (like in touhou nights) where you can heal to full whenever a source of magic is available. It takes away tension from fights and exploration, and makes the game way to easier that it should be. The use of Ikaruga polarity of attacks is really cool, and i wish was used en every boss fight, and hope another game really takes advantage of it.

WARNING.\n\nReally nice, fun little game. I picked it up on sale and was able to clear all the bosses and get 96% map clear on the first playthrough. It took about 5.6 hours. I really enjoyed the back and forth wind / fire spirit magic that became more prevalent throughout the game and the 3/3 spirit magic level up system was one of the best feedback loops I've ever seen in a game.\n\nBasically, when you deal damage with one spirit magic type it levels up the other spirit magic type up to a maximum of 3 levels per and they fill very quickly. You can sit back at a safe distance to spam magic and arrows that use mana to refill your spirit magic levels in a pinch and get back to a spirit magic of 3, but eventually you run out of mana and you can only slowly refill mana. It makes your damage dealt so much more meaningful as you get lower on resources, but it is possible to rebuild yourself from any position just by dealing damage. All of your damage dealt, including melee, bow, and magic, will contribute to leveling up the not-currently-in-use spirit magic.\n\nWhy would you want a full 3 in wind or fire magic? Because you deal more damage with maxed out level 3 spirit magic and when you switch to that level 3 magic you refill your health. You want to be on your level 3 magic to deal the most damage, but you also want to refill the non-level 3 magic and you want to have both ideally at level 3 so you can swap between to give yourself back to back health boosts. Plus, there are a couple benefits to each of the wind / fire magic that I wont go into detail, but they are useful behind just letting you pass through the requisite color safely.\n\nThe way this plays out in practice is that you're never really out of a fight, of any kind. It doesn't matter how down and out you are, so long as you can salvage enough damage to hit a spirit level of 3 and switch over, you can sustain yourself with life regeneration. I regularly fought bosses where I got slapped around while figuring out the mechanics, then mid fight discovered a new tactic to counter their mechanics and because of the constant, rubberbanding feedback loop of one strong magic type rebuilding the other magic type and allowing me to regen my health by playing safe around those mechanics once I figured them out... I was able to overcome some boss fights in the first try or first couple of tries.\n\nIt also turns boss fights into platforming puzzles, along with action side-scrolling since you have to be mindful of what color is required of you and how to utilize it on the screen at any given time. Overall, a very stimulating experience.\n\nThat comeback mechanic being seamless and not requiring me to pop potions or stall the action to heal myself actively coupled with the obvious save points right outside boss rooms mitigated my frustrations with learning boss patterns quite a lot. I did have to rage quit a couple times and just take breaks, but honestly I beat the game in the same day that I picked it up because you can melt bosses as soon as you figure out a winning strategy. It was so easy to bounce back from defeats and portal around the map to use the newly acquired movement mechanics for exploration that I didn't grow tired or bored of the game. It was very easy to explore the new map sections, pick up the new mechanics, backtrack to use them to overcome map challenges, and bounce back from boss defeats. It's one of the cleanest, most quality of life focused Metroidvania's I've ever played.\n\nThe fact that I motored through it in less than 6 hours is a testament to how well built the game is and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a classic Metroidvania experience.", "timestamp_created": 1627779975, "timestamp_updated": 1627781486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96707689": {"recommendationid": "96707689", "author": {"steamid": "76561199034866640", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1629554938}, "language": "english", "review": "Achievements dont work for profile features.

There is some backtracking for secrets, but it's honestly pretty minimal, and you don't have to pixel hunt for hidden walls (they're all visibly cracked and pretty hard to miss).\n\nIt's fairly short compared to some of the more sprawling games in the genre, but it makes good use of its environments and nothing ever feels like wasted space. There are plenty of bosses, but they're almost all on the easier side, and I think throughout my entire playthrough I only had 1 death in total.

As it turns out, familiarity with the series isn't very important. Every Cutscene or bit of dialogue fairly quickly establishes Deedlit's attitude toward a given character, so you get up to speed pretty fast.\n\nThe central gameplay hook is Deedlit's ability to toggle between two elements. Very early in the game, you unlock a wind state and a fire state and can swap between them at will. This serves multiple functions: immunity to damage from the matching element (you actually gain MP in addition to blocking the damage), the ability to infuse your weapon attacks with elemental damage (useful against many enemies), and mobility bonuses. It gives certain parts of the game a bit of an Ikaruga feel.\n\nAs you defeat enemies (or in the case of bosses, simply land hits), you'll fill up a gauge which applies to your back-burner element (each element has a separate gauge), powering it up and encouraging you to swap. When you swap to an element with a maxed gauge, you'll get a slow refill on your health. Getting hit will reduce the gauge on your current element. This feature massively improves survivability and makes the search for the next save point much less scary. I was little thrown off in the early game, as I had to get used to whether announcements about my \"Level\" increasing pertained to my element gauge or my character's XP level (which is a thing in this game).\n\nIn addition to fire and wind, there are five other elements represented (water, wood, stone, light, and dark), and each enemy in the game has varying weaknesses and resistances which will be displayed on screen when you attack. In the majority of cases, one or both of your elemental states will be reasonably effective, but if you want to exploit a weakness that isn't fire or wind, there are spells to discover as well as a few elemental weapons.\n\nYou have two separate weapon attacks: a melee weapon (or, in some cases, a boomerang) and a bow attack. The bow requires a little bit of MP to use, but it can be aimed before you release the button. There are several doors that require trick shots to open, and there's a pretty fun minigame designed to train your bow skills (although I wish there was more variety in the training). You can get new weapons by finding them in scripted locations on the map, occasional enemy loot drops, or by buying them from a vendor NPC who pops up in several locations.\n\nI've never been a big fan of loading a metroidvania up with dozens of different lootable/salable weapons with different patterns or effective ranges and planned obsolescence via an attack stat; I usually find one that I really like and stick with it, only replacing it with a higher-stat model of the same type. In this game, I prefer the swords with a big overhead swing because of the number of flying/overhead enemies and the amount of climbing.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was the weird button configuration. Jumping is mapped to the \"east\" button, and melee attack is mapped to the \"south\" button. This felt clumsy to me at first and took a lot of getting used-to (you CAN remap the controls but I decided to trust them), but eventually it made sense as you use the \"north\" button for your bow, and you can jump while aiming. Over the course of the game I did have several mis-jumps or accidental magic casts due to muscle memory, but overall it wasn't too bad.\n\nThe boss fights were hit-or-miss for me. Every boss room is essentially the same size, but nearly all of the bosses themselves fit into two categories: Gigantic boss that mostly stands still but shoots at you, or person-sized boss who can outrun you and control the space and will charge at you, fling stuff at you, and generally fill the arena with chaotic crap. \n\nThe game is fairly generous with fast-travel points (considering the size of the map itself), and you're not really forced to backtrack much. The map is pretty straightforward with where to go; there are color-coded locked doors, and after the first few areas are filled in it's usually pretty clear whether exploring in a given direction will lead to progress or items/upgrades. \n\nThe pixel art and animations in this game are absolutely stellar. Idle animations, knockback, lighting, environments, Deedlit's twirl when she gets double-jump-- just chef kiss.\nThe music is exciting and well-made but doesn't really stick with you after you exit the game.\n\nZebra / 10", "timestamp_created": 1627150784, "timestamp_updated": 1627151728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603960394859313965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96272249": {"recommendationid": "96272249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027078924", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1627101691}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent metroidvania, had fun blasting through it", "timestamp_created": 1627099339, "timestamp_updated": 1627099339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96237066": {"recommendationid": "96237066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187496702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 346, "last_played": 1626110434}, "language": "english", "review": "A pretty decent Metroidvania that doesn\u2019t require foreknowledge of the anime it\u2019s based on (which is good, because I last watched it in high school and remember basically nothing). The big gimmick is that you have fire and wind spirits that accompany you, and you can swap between them with a button-press, and each comes with both special abilities and immunity to certain attacks. While the puzzles are often clever and the maps are linear but not painfully so, I think my complaints revolve around the lack of ability to grind (most normal enemies give very little XP, so you can\u2019t really level past problem bosses) and the fact that so many of the bosses are humanoid rather than monstrous. Humanoid bosses are consistently the hardest in Castlevania games, and they\u2019re similar here, because they have a lot of varied patterns and are very mobile. And in several places you have double bosses that you can\u2019t save between; the final boss of Chapter 5 was a major speedbump for me because I had such trouble with his first form, and then there was a second form as well. The difficulty ramps up even more after that; the sixth area has long stretches of powerful enemies without save points, but nothing you can grind or buy gives you any real advantage over them. The Invisibility spell, which creates an image that enemies target, is a very clever spell and honestly rather broken; but it\u2019s also the reason I was able to finish the game.

The game wears its inspiration on its sleeve by the way, from the afterimages you leave as you walk around and backdash (which you can turn off if you want, as even the idle animations have them, it's a bit much) to some of the move sets for the bosses. \n\nMoment to moment gameplay is about what you'd expect: exploration, fighting the goons that populate the map as you wander around, finding secrets, running into bosses and having a big encounter. Lots of different weapon types to work with, swords, daggers, spears, two-handed swords, each type has their own move set so there's more for you to consider beyond \"which one has the big number?\". Wonder Labyrinth throws in a couple twists of its own on top of that, like the element system where you can switch back and forth between wind and fire to exploit weaknesses and use different movement options. Some spells that you can find also utilize other elements to let you use more than wind and fire. You also get a bow to work with, allowing you to not just hit things from far away, but ricocheting arrows off of metal surfaces to either hit enemies behind you or around corners. The bow is also used to solve puzzles, which doesn't get stale over the course of the game as they introduce new mechanics and puzzle types to keep things interesting and there's a very indepth bow mini-game you can sink a lot of time into learning how to do cool shots.\n\nMusic wise the game is great both the boss tracks, the big plot beat music, and the general dungeon tunes. Visually the game is great, genuinely amazing pixel art, the monster designs are very well done, the backgrounds obviously had a lot of work put into them with excellent use of parallax scrolling. Great use of color as well, the world could've ended up very gray and boring but instead there's a lot of visual distinction between different areas of the game. The character designs from the show also easily translate to the game.\n\nSpeaking of the show, you don't need to know anything to enjoy the game, I hadn't seen it, only heard of it. You get more out of it if you know the background info obviously, but you can glean enough from whats in the game to learn what people's relationships are. If I'm gonna be honest the game was so good that I kind of want to go watch it now.\n\nDeedlit in Wonder Labyrinth is a great game, would recommend, The developers did NOT need to go as hard as they did but they did it anyway and that quality shines throughout.

That being said overall the game is a fun (though very brief and linear) metroidvania.\n\nGraphics 6/10\nI mean - its pixel art and I cannot help but feel that really detracted from the game overall and having grown up in a age of pixel games - I did not like the retro-feeling they might have been going for - it felt more like a effort to save time on art.\n\nMusic 7/10\nNothing incredible going on here - fairly generic music and I was surprised not to hear music from the original show in game.\n\nStory 5.5/10\nThis really bugged me - first off was the choice of setting will be COMPLETELY alien to players if they never seen the Record of Lodoss Wars (which I recommend to any DnD anime fans) but the really contrived method they used by attempting to be \"deep\" which I felt really derailed the over-arching story they were going with - which I am not going to spoil but it becomes apparent about an hour into the game. I felt they could have done so much more with this game - but the story felt like it was tagged onto a good solid game (and kudos for the effort regardless - just wasn't really a exciting story)\n\nGameplay 7.5/10\nThis is where the game both shines and does some stuff that players might find a big put off. The gameplay is very much as some have said \"Symphony of the Night\" minus any voice-acting and what felt like lower quality art. The game allows you to approach encounters with bosses in about 3 ways. Melee / Magic / Archery with varying strengths and weaknesses to each (spoiler - learning all the magic makes many fights a LOT easier). Sadly the game is really short - at about 8 hours as I played it off and on and the game makes it really easy to move you to where you got to go next and makes sense in that regard. There is a spirit system where the player will toggle between wind & fire and will often need to be done in many boss fights as their attacks may be unavoidable. A skilled dodger however can also regenerate health when at max affinity for either of the two spirits which was a really good feature. The game does abuse the \"one more fight\" concept as many bosses often are multiple boss fights in 1 encounter (about 4 or 5 of the fights) which is kind of an annoying gotcha as you push to victory only to realize this and reload your last save. \n\nOver-all if the game is on sale I think its a great deal; even around 20$ it probably worth it for a bit of off and on gameplay if your trying to change gears and play something you usually don't. I find the skill level of the game is fine for mid-range players of action games. Overly skilled players will probably blow through the game in 4-5 hours and find it too easy though.\n", "timestamp_created": 1626817977, "timestamp_updated": 1626817977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96095421": {"recommendationid": "96095421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198877221241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 717, "last_played": 1661374863}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game!

The devs know this genre too well. Snag this game on whatever price you can. This game worth full price. I bought this game during early access and no regret at all.\n\ngameplay 9/10\nit's well designed. there's a unique mechanic that makes this game different from Castlevania games. you'll be able to swap elemental state by swapping early acquired elemental spirits and this will be used a lot during the gameplay both for platforming and also during boss fight. Good amount of weapon library. You'll be able to use wide variety of weapon style plus bow which is super useful both for puzzle and also during boss fight. Bow is also the thing that makes this game very unique. both melee and bow is balanced in some way that you'll be needing both. Idk if there is skill that helps you find hidden breakable walls just like peeping eye from Castlevania Aria of Sorrow. But without it some hidden breakable walls seems too hard to find. I found some by accidentally hit them with wide ranged weapons. The difficulty is just right. The new game plus is also good especially after the latest update patch. There is a boss rush mode if you have finished the game. It's cool and that's the right challenge for Castlevania fans. There is also a difficulty adjustment if you seek for more challenge after you beat the game.\n\nstory 6/10 \nthe story is pretty straightforward. not much to tell and you'll probably be able to guess right from the start if you pay attention to details. not gonna spoil the story but the progression is almost like Castlevania games.\n\nart 9/10\nthe art style is just amazing. if you're looking for nostalgic feeling of playing SOTN, you'll like the art style. It's not the same but pixel art is just perfect for this game. It's more like blend of Aria of Sorrow with SOTN.\n\nmusic 7/10\nthe music is not perfect. not as majestic as Castlevania music. But fair enough cause this game is not set in a castle. There are some music that doesn't represent well the location but they're really catchy and just enough to pump your adrenaline while roaming and beating enemies,\n\npricing 10/10\nas I mentioned at the start, this game is really good for its price. 6 chapters/stages, good enough amount of content. you won't feel enough just beating the game once. \n\nverdict 8.5/10\nI wish I can give more than just 8.5.

The game may be shorter and more linear than your standard Metroidvania fare, but it never felt lacking to me.\n\nMost importantly the game is just really fun. Every time I stepped away from the computer I was always looking forward to coming back to play again. The gameplay is solid, the combat is fun and keeps you on your toes, and the game brings enough new ideas to the formula to stand out among its peers.\n\nLet's talk about the visual style. [i]Deedlit[/i] has colorful and beautiful pixel art and the characters and monsters are all very well animated. Speaking of monsters, the game does a great job of taking advantage of background elements and layering to make encounters just a bit more interesting, especially near the late game and during a few boss fights.\n\nThe game world is sectioned off into stages and each stage has a unique visual style that ensures you won't forget where you are. I suppose these stages could have had a bit more character to them, but I didn't mind. I find that toning down the backgrounds helps me focus on the action and some games easily go overboard with detail. While the main path is linear, there are several shortcuts and side paths that open up as you play and the map does a great job of helping you keep track of what locations are now open to you thanks to the color coded doors.\n\nLength wise I finished the story in just under 7 hours, but those looking for all the achievements, or to finish all the game modes will likely get a few more hours out of it thanks to the Boss Rush and NG+ modes.

Y esto lo s\u00e9 porque me vi como un par de OVAs hace literalmente 20 a\u00f1os y a\u00fan as\u00ed he disfrutado el juego.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n: Si te gustan los metroidvanias y este te llama la atenci\u00f3n p\u00edllatelo.", "timestamp_created": 1625744981, "timestamp_updated": 1625744981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714285731315612793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95305732": {"recommendationid": "95305732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856600621", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 737, "last_played": 1668223366}, "language": "english", "review": "Completing this game was a lot of fun. I'll highlight the parts you should know about.\n\nIn this game, you fight a lot of enemies as you explore the maze. For me, the combat system was one of the best parts. You have multiple ways to harm enemies. Some enemies are immune to certain attacks. You have to figure out their weakness. You can also become immune to some attacks by switching to the right element. Switching between elements gives the combat system an extra layer of complexity. The element system was well utilized. I was surprised there are only 2 elements, while Earth and Water are reserved as magic abilities. The nice part about this is being able to quickly switch between elements during combat.\n\nSomething I should warn you about is the bosses. They start at a standard difficulty. However, I felt the bosses from stage 3 onward were too hard compared to everything else in the stages. It felt like a sudden difficulty spike. I had to memorize their attack patterns over the course of multiple attempts in order to beat them. And this was with the strongest gear I could have at those points in the game, which leads to my next point.\n\nConsidering the genre of this game, you probably expect to backtrack a lot. However, there is not much incentive to. As you  find keys and new abilities, you are able to access new routes. These routes usually lead to sightly stronger weapons. You don't need them to progress, which will leave you wondering if the backtracking is even worth it. Even with every ability, you will likely struggle on stage 6. It has a lot of high-HP monsters placed in narrow hallways and small rooms. It's the on;y stage where I felt the level design was less than good.\n\nThe graphics are some of the best I've seen in a \"pixelated\" game.\n\nLastly is the story. I won't say what I think it is to avoid spoilers. What I will say is you have to piece the puzzle together to interpret what the story is. Based on my interpretation, the story is really good.", "timestamp_created": 1625721593, "timestamp_updated": 1625721593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95299701": {"recommendationid": "95299701", "author": {"steamid": "76561199055151328", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1626098140}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed the classic 'Castlevania' games, you will love this.

The characters and enemies move fluidly, animations pop nicely. Weapons looks cool.\n\n- The background visuals can be nice and some of the Dragon bosses are a real treat.\n\n- Soundtrack is great. Clearly inspired by SOTN, but that's ok.\n\n- Neat little conceit using an Ikaruga-like elemental system to absorb enemy attacks. The idea is solid and could be fleshed out a bit more. Easily breaks the game in ways, however.\n\n- Spells are cool, nicely animated and feel good. They end up being a bit overpowered later in the game however.\n\n*Cons*:\n\n- Map is rather small, but that's not implicitly a bad thing. However, the level design leaves a bit to be desired. Nothing feels terribly inspired. The arrow puzzles seem promising at first, but they don't really make them super elaborate. The world does not seem very cohesive like it would in a better Metroidvania. There aren't enough secrets and breakable walls.\n\n- Missed opportunity to bank on the source material. What's there is pretty thin.\n\n- Weapon selection is nice, but ultimately pointless. You switch up to the next strongest weapon constantly, there are artificial constraints put on some weapons like the Chakra, to keep them from proc'ing too often (i.e. making them interesting). The movesets are really limited; no street-fighter style special moves in sight unique to each weapon or innate ones Deedlit might have.\n\n- The million different kinds of bows seem largely useless.\n\n- The abilities you gain are very mundane. Very little creativity to be found.\n\n- The inventory system is just plain bad. There's no reason consumable items should share the same slot as magic. Scrolling through the list on the fly feels really off and trying to use items immediately in the heat of battle often results in going make to the ability selection menu.\n\n*Consensus*:\n\nDefinitely worth giving it a spin.

You may be wondering whether you need to be familiar with the source materials to enjoy this, and the answer is not really. You'll have absolutely no clue who anyone is or what on earth they're talking about, but it's a metroidvania \u2013 these aren\u2019t really games that benefit from an in depth plot and you can mostly just skip past it. Don't be tempted to read the novels or watch the anime - even when I watched it over 20 years ago it was painfully generic, and the novels were literally some guy's D&D campaign with the serial numbers filed off. \n\nIn terms of how it plays, we're basically looking at Symphony of the Night, again. The main twist in the formula is an ikaruga style colour switch between wind and fire - being in one element will allow you to absorb attacks of the same type, and changing on the fly is required to survive the game's many boss fights. If you're familiar with Touhou Lunar Nights this is very similar, though Deedlit never reaches the utter bullet hell chaos of that game. However, the boss fights are still rather messy affairs that I sometimes beat basically by accident by mashing the attack button and spamming magic while a thousand projectiles filled the screen.\n\nDespite the chaotic boss fights Deedlit in Wonder labyrinth is a pretty sterling example of the genre being extremely pretty, well designed and paced. It is a rather short game, taking me around 6 hours to 100% while only having to consult a guide once for a particular item (the only developer troll in the game, needing the player to jump on a particular floor panel 50 times \u2013 why?). This means that the map is compact, pace is very brisk and there\u2019s no time to get bored. While I wouldn\u2019t put it up there with the absolute best in the genre, if you fancy something pretty and fun that you can complete in a couple of evenings, I\u2019d say it\u2019s hard to go too far wrong with Deedlit in Wonder labyrinth.\n", "timestamp_created": 1624898779, "timestamp_updated": 1624898779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579514861106872559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94584171": {"recommendationid": "94584171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227020728", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 525, "last_played": 1624888671}, "language": "english", "review": "Review in Indonesian language\nGame Metroidvania yang bagus, cukup menantang saat boss battle tapi tidak terlalu sulit.\n\nBisa diselesaikan dalam 5-6 jam dengan cerita ringan yang cukup memuaskan.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1624889204, "timestamp_updated": 1624889204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573907434940338135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94556326": {"recommendationid": "94556326", "author": {"steamid": "76561199143687476", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 422, "last_played": 1624855232}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost as good as symphony of the night.

I really liked Tohou Luna Nights and I was hoping I would enjoy this game as much as Tohou Luna Nights, if not more. Unfortunately, this is definitely a tier below Touhou Luna Nights. It's still a good game though.\n\nIn RoLW, you have a melee attack, a magic attack, and a ranged attack. The melee attack is standard in any Metroidvania game, and the type of attack depends on the weapon you have equipped. The magic attack freezes time when you cast it and the attack covers a large area (sometimes outright homing in on enemies). It also does a lot of damage. Obviously, to balance it, it costs MP. The ranged attack is unique in that you can freely aim it. This comes into play in \"puzzles\" where you have to shoot your arrows in a way that causes them to ricochet exactly as you need in order to hit a trigger. In battle, this allows the ranged attack to be flexible as you can hit enemies above and below you. Of course, you can also just rapid fire the ranged attack without aiming and you'll hit whatever is straight in front of you. Of course, the ranged attack also costs MP in order to keep it balanced.\n\nWhile the above attacks are more or less standard in most Metroidvania games, what's unique about RoLW is that you also have a spirit gauge. You can switch between a wind spirit and a fire spirit instantaneously whenever you want. Attacks in wind mode causes enemies to drop fire orbs and attacks in fire mode cause enemies to drop wind orbs. Collecting enough orbs increases the spirit gauge, up to level 3. A higher spirit gauge means higher damage. Taking damage reduces the spirit gauge by 1. Having a spirit equipped will cause all your attacks (except magic) to deal that spirit's type as damage. In addition, any enemy attack that matches the spirit that you have equipped will be completely negated. \n\nWhat's cool about this system is the risk reward element of it. You see, an enemy that uses fire attacks is likely weak to wind damage. That means that you can either play it safe and attack the enemy in fire mode, or you can attack in wind mode and be skillful enough to switch to fire when it attacks, and then switch back to wind. It should also be noted that some enemy attacks have no element or are an element other than wind/fire (e.g. light, dark, earth, water, etc\u2026). This requires you to really learn enemy patterns and what type of elements they attack with, since getting hit not only damages you, but it also reduces your spirit gauge which you then painstakingly have to refill. I like this system as it rewards flawless gameplay and punishes mistakes without relying on annoying 1 hit kill mechanics.\n\nThe game does a great job of making everything really flashy. The game already looks great in my opinion, with an art style that I particularly like. However, the developers go the extra mile with all types of additional effects. Getting to level 3 spirit gauge has a very audible sound cue and the gauge flashes at level 3. The double jump and high jump have a cool animation to them. Hell the game overall is beautifully animated. The game overall looks really good in both its art and animation, which makes the game really fun to experience.\n\nNow, let's move onto the negatives:\n\t\u2022 The game is too short: You can beat this game in like 4 hours\u2026\u2026\u2026 that's too short. I am all for quality over quantity, but there needs to be a balance here. \n\t\u2022 The progression system isn't exciting: I feel this is a byproduct of the game being too short. While you can find HP and MP ups and new melee, ranged, and magic weapons, it doesn't feel very exciting. This is because you get a new weapon like every 10 minutes. So who cares if you got a weapon that deals more damage? You know you're going to get another one really quickly. It's not like there's any synergy between items, so there's no item that you're ever specifically looking for. \n\t\u2022 The game is too easy: This game is way too easy, and what's sad is that it could've been so easily fixed. You see, when your spirit gauge reaches 3, you regenerate health passively\u2026\u2026\u2026. This was a really bad idea. This combined with the fact that you can gain spirit by attacking bosses at range (through either your arrows or your magic) means if you ever get low on health, you can simply run away from a boss and kite them and wait until you recover all your health before going back into melee range. There were so many bosses that I had no business beating because I got hit like at least 10 times, but I beat them on the 1st try because the HP regen is way too generous. What's sad is that this could've easily been fixed by simply NOT having your HP regen at spirit gauge level 3.\n\nThere's a story, but I can tell you're not going to appreciate it if you're not a fan of the related light novel/anime. This is because there's absolutely no character development done. You play as Deedlit who wakes up in a mysterious area, and she needs to escape. Various characters are introduced throughout the game, but they're introduced as if I am supposed to know who they are. Like \"EMPEROR BELD!!!!\" Who? Hell, I don't even really know who Deedlist is. The fundamental story revolves around the love that Deedlit has around this \"Parn\" guy, which is apparently behind this entire world. The problem is that this \"love\" is not shown in the game at all. I am simply supposed to accept that Deedlit and Parn love each other. Welp, this is a problem because I don't accept it (because I haven't seen any of it) and so any of the emotional moments fall completely flat.\n\nOverall, while I had fun with this game, I was disappointed with how short and easy it was.

It's a game based on an old Japanese fantasy novel series created for an RPG styled on D&D and mostly known to the western audience through the anime and manga that adapted its story. As obscure as the franchise is these days the game does a not particularly good job of conveying its backstory in an appropriate manner to newer audiences. Mostly you get the gist of what is going on in the game but you're hard-pressed to ever care about Deedlit or the rest of her crew or why you're there in the first place.\n\nThis, though, isn't the biggest issue with the game, it's ultimately minor compared to the others. I'm not a big fan of \"It-was-all-a-dream\" stories or even stories where I don't care too much about the characters if the gameplay is solid then I can easily forget the plot. But it's an indication of just how wrong-headed this game is designed from start to finish. Before I start with my main issues I just have to mention the positives, which are the soundtrack which is really nice, the visual which are beautiful pixel art graphics, and in general, the engine this game is running on that reminds you of Symphony of the Night or similar games and usually handles really well.\n\nWhen you start out you don't realize this but the level design is really terrible. Every area is really just a couple of rather uniform, non-descript corridors until you reach the next boss, something that is repeated ad nauseam until you reach the end of the game. You meet a couple of cool-looking enemies along the way but soon everything will just feel the same. Yes, the graphics are quite nice to look at but still, every area looks really so generic and it would be difficult to express for each area what its theme and unique aspects are except what you see on the most surface level. The Castlevania metroidvania after which this is fashioned occasionally suffered from this too but from Symphony of the Night through Circle of the Moon and until Order of Ecclesia, each and every one of them had many areas with unique and distinct features that I remember the games and their levels even years after.\n\nThis leads to the second problem, which is just how forgettable the overall level structure is. This is the same problem with the levels on the macro level. Most metroidvania create a world that feels like a real place with lots and lots of memorable areas be it SR388 or Dracula's everchanging castle or Hallownest. The maps of these places themselves are something fun to explore and remember. Record of Lodoss War doesn't have that, the overall shape of its world is just a random blob with lots of small corridors thoughtlessly clustered together.\n\nIt doesn't stop there though. Since the game is basically a barely hidden boss-rush where you survive a few corridors until the next one, it should have at least well-designed bosses, right. Wrong. Every boss fight is a puzzle, two glass cannons trading shots until you figured out what you have to do to win. A good boss fight is one where you can use your skill to evade boss attacks, find the right pattern and attack yourself. Bosses here move so extremely fast that you can't do this. It leads to most boss fights feeling extremely gimmicky where you have to figure out how to beat them but executing that isn't satisfying and becomes tiresome after some time.\n\nSomething that isn't just restricted to boss fights but becomes really annoying there is the stun effect that can hit you and leave you unable to do anything for a couple of seconds. Often the seconds you need to survive. There's hard and then there's unfair and the stun effect feels mostly like a punishing, unfair mechanic that downgrades the whole experience of fighting those bosses, who already aren't well designed. It's like adding insult to injury and makes me want to strangle whoever designer on the team thought this was a good idea in the first place and everybody else who hasn't yet patched this terrible thing out.\n\nThe rest is minor, the whole system adapted from bullet-hell shmups with the absorption of blue or orange bullets is neat but ultimately becomes just as tiresome as some of the other aspects of the game. Same with the gears that you have to hit with arrows to move. The game has a lot of compelling ideas on the surface that in practice are flogged to death so that you don't want to see them anymore but they really pale in comparison to the other flaws of the game.\n\nOne thing to add is that this is tagged and usually talked about as a metroidvania and it honestly barely functions as one. Yes, it has a large, interconnected castle to explore and you get a couple of new upgrades to get past some obstacles but backtracking in the game is relatively minor. The only reason to ever go back to earlier areas is for some weapons that you don't need anyway and a few minor bonuses. It's technically a metroidvania while disregarding the spirit of metroidvania where exploration is king and one of the most compelling activities you can do in-game. This game has almost zero exploration and almost zero other reasons to play it.

Some tough paths lead to a merchant or a locked door (later \"shortcut\") instead of an actual game objective or reward. The story telling is obscure at best, you'd better know the novel already. \nThere are also cool mechanics, the pixel art is nice, I liked the soundtrack... but the end feels so badly rushed.

It\u2019s very concise, though, the runtime is not that long and there are no three or more surprise twist world swaps doubling or tripling the game size. There are no premature endings and the game doesn\u2019t ask you to find a walkthrough just to see how to get half of the content hidden behind a moon logic secret.\n\nThe gameplay is perfectly fine, but there are a lot of things present only as token mechanics. Ledge-dropping introduced on the second screen is never used again. The store is useless, the best things it sells are medkits and energy drinks. None of these weapons can compete with basic things you will find essentially right outside the store. There are very few locations and almost all of them are in inconvenient places, so you will rarely see the shopkeeper anyway. Also the prices of shop-weapons are so high you can\u2019t even grind enemies at any reasonable pace. So, basically, the store is only for medkits if you are not very good at the game. I ever went shopping for them only for a couple of specifically spammy bosses, including the final one. The archery is pointless. Without a proper mouse aim, you can\u2019t properly hit anything that is not directly in front of you. You can enter the aim mode, but it\u2019s so bad and inconvenient you should forget about shooting on the move or trying to catch a moving target. The damage is so pathetic it\u2019s not worth it. But the bow is still used pretty often for the puzzles. Mostly it\u2019s okay but any bow-puzzle involving movement is rather irritating. The spent ammo is directly subtracted from your mana and you can run out of it by trying to solve a crucial moving puzzle. The archery mini-game highlights all that is bad with not having a proper mouse aim. (But thankfully it runs on pure maths.) This very same semi-6-directional semi-aim makes most melee weapons very situational, so in general, i only used the swords with half-circle swing arcs. Hitting flyers with the diagonal directional weapons\u2019 strikes that make you walk is really hard. And there are a lot of flyers. On top of it the official Microsoft gamepad is quite bad at diagonals. Also, the attack direction is sticky. If you are striking to the right you can\u2019t just turn around and start striking to the left. You have to perform a full stop and let the elf chill. The necessity rarely arises, but when it does it\u2019s irritating.\n\nThe game heavily relies on magic. Once you learn how to read the resists on enemy life bars, it\u2019s much easier to just spam something effective instead of trying to catch the pesky parasites with your low-damage sword. I wiped the floor with the boss rush room. Yet if someone didn\u2019t master the elements, that can be quite challenging. But generally, if you stumble upon a boss being cancer you can bring 10 life potions with you. The GUI for healing is a part of the crooked spell-wheel which is cancer, but with 500 additional HP even the really tough spots are manageable. Though, you might have to grind pennies a lot if you can\u2019t master any boss at the beginning of the game. Starting with the fourth stage even common rooms start to be assembled in a really challenging way and generic enemies start to spam attacks filling half of the screen with projectiles. Later stages are quite challenging even with the max-out HP bar. The last area has only one non-boss save-point, and it\u2019s very far from the previous one. Still, it\u2019s doable due to the colour-coding mechanic. Making half of the enemies immune to your real-time strikes is generally not that good of an idea. Especially when mixing both types in one fight. But in this game, the right colour makes you as well immune to some attacks, and if you max out the blue or the orange spirit it will start to regenerate your health. So by playing slowly, keeping one colour as sacrificial and the other one as emergency healing between fights you can break through end-game corridors filled with dragons and dinosaurs. Shadow stalkers are still cancer and a waste of time, though. And the levelling system where you don\u2019t make any decisions is utterly superfluous. Though, if you are absolutely bad at the game you can grind easy-to-kill enemies for weeks to hit the level-cap of 99 and have more raw damage for the part you are stuck on.\n\nThe animations are quite good, but the faux pixel-art is irritating. It\u2019s a mix of pixel-built elements with just low-res jarring traditional jpegs and unfitting visual effects of different resolution. It\u2019s like those old PS1 non-3D graphics which are not here nor there. You don\u2019t have to have stupid low-res graphics to have a good game. Bloodstained is a great game without making you feel like a caveman. And the eye and fonts from the menu and cut-scenes are the worst. The music is really screwed up too. It sounds like it was speed-up 30% for some reason. I really thought it\u2019s something wrong on my end. Even the sounds of the protagonist are borked. She sounds like a dude trying to pitch up his voice in post.\n\nStory-wise she is journeying in some metaphysical purgatory or something, trying to escape her cycles of guilt. The writing is abrupt and cryptic. Somehow the guy is dead and she has to learn to forgive herself. But the last thing i saw is them both lovebirds riding into the sunset.\n[b]\u0418 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0451\u043d\u043e\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f.[/b]\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, the plot is redundant in this game, just as the whole setting. You can reskin it to any other IP and it will be the same game. There are no breakthrough innovative mechanics, it\u2019s just a solid game in itself even despite the flaws. And it\u2019s the best game of the year because this is the first game released this year that is worth anything.

Won't distract you for too long unless you're a competionist but still good.\n- A nice amount of challenge; not disheartening \n\nNeutral\n- Pretty linear game despite being a \"metroidvainia\". You'll be rewarded for doing so, with more powerful weapons and spells, but you won't need to rethread old grounds once you \"complete\" an area. There won't be some \"thing\" easily missed on the first playthrough that will unlock an upside down castle or the \"true\" ending.  Some will appreciate this while others may feel it's a staple of the genre. \n- There's an optional spell you can get halfway through that let's you cheese a lot of the enemies and character sized bosses. There's also a sword that can supplement it making it even more breaking. They're nowhere near as bad as Alucard shield, but it's just a peeve of mine and I realize it's a personal issue and not necessarily a flaw. \n\n\nNegatives:\n- The shop is underutilized (though I could argue the same for SOTN) and unless you do zero exploration the weapons you'd buy will be a short lived upgrade.\n- With the lack of need for money, the gambling game feels a bit wasted. If you're the completionist type that needs every item this is a godsend; otherwise skip it. \n\nOverall:\nThe length of the game as others have mentioned doesn't really feel like a detriment, as what's there feels pretty fulfilling.

Didn't spend a single cent the entire game. Weapons better than the ones at the store are easily found through natural progression, and I would imagine potions are useless seeing as Level 3 heals you anyway, \n- Some enemy placement is cheap, such as flying enemies (that aren't even spirits) that can just pass through walls and hover outside the map and shoot projectiles at you, \n- Map layout is uninspired, linear, and lacks mystery. No emphasis on exploration or backtracking which is a core element of a game with the tag \"Metroidvania\", otherwise it's just a platformer, \n- Short. Started at lunch and finished before dinner,  \n- Forgettable music. Just background noise, \n- No puzzles which are, again, a core element to Metroidvanias, \n- Adding achievements after release makes it force a second playthrough. Cheap replayability, \n- Lacks any excitement or danger, leaving it feel like a hollow experience after the credits roll, \n- It's 2021. Metroidvanias have evolved to include things like map markers. Why hasn't this? \n\n---Positives---\n- Art and character designs are great, \n- Smooth and precise controls, \n- Eyegasm to a fellow animator, \n- Element-swapping mechanic was a good idea (even if it was their only original one) \n\n---Summary---\nEh. The gameplay and handling are there, but it's not really \"fun\" per se. Switch your brain off and kill a few hours, but it lacks any excitement or danger which leaves you feeling empty after the credits. The developer stuck to everything traditional without leaving their own mark on the genre, making it quite generic content-wise. They just went through the motions which basically makes it feel like they just followed a recipe without experimenting, which is a shame because it looks good.

The game doesn't seem to be as ambitious or fleshed out as SOTN, Hollowknight, Metroid Dread, or other Metroidvanias in it's catagory, but its still a must play nonetheless.\n\nThe game takes HUGE inspiration from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, going as far as to have Deedlit (the main character) replicate the exact running animation of Alucard from SOTN.  The graphics are also almost an exact recreation.  Swords, leveling, map design, boss fights, and even the UI are glorious recreation of SOTN.. right down to the same BACK DASH of Alucard.  The game seems to be an intentional TRIBUTE to SOTN and not a knockoff.  The graphics/pixel art are beautiful. \n\nI haven't watched the anime or read the manga but that didn't dampen my play-through at all.  I'll admit, I didn't know or care about the characters upon first seeing them, but toward the end I felt connected to each one as if I've been a fan from day one.  I do have an interest in checking out the manga/anime after this play-through.\n\nYou do not need to know the source material to enjoy this game.\n\n[h1] Small Nit Picks [/h1]\n\nSmall complaints I did have with the game is that you as a character, are grossly overpowered.  You're an elf girl who has access to a Sword and Bow, but you can also Fly, use magic, become invincible, slide, Double Jump (and even extend your Double Jump), and regenerate health- and you gain all of these powers within the first 5 minutes of the game... and a handful of weapons in which seems like the first 3 rooms.  You also meet the shopkeeper in the first 5 minutes of the game, which was hours in SOTN when compared to it. \n\nThe bosses also seem to be too easy as well, as just spamming the sword attack seems to win the fight majority of the time.  Further through the game, you even obtain a magic spell called, \"SHADE\", which allows you to become invincible for about 5 seconds.. all of which you can still attack.  Using this spell I was able to beat bosses without a challenge.   I also wish the map was more fleshed out with more exploring similar to that of SOTN.  Far too many times the game seemed to finish a boss fight.. only to give me the exact weapon I need to enter another boss fight 3 rooms later.  The game is a metroidvania, but at times it seems VERY linear with no places to get lost or explore.  The game tends to give you exactly what you need when you need it.\n\nThere are small gimmicks such as switching from your attacks from WIND to FIRE and some enemies/bosses being immune to one or the other, but majority of the time I just used this 'elemental switch' to regenerate health' in the heat of battle.\n\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\n\nThe music in Wonder Labyrinth surprised me.  A few times I had to pause and turn up the music, as it immersed me with the story and characters.  Here's a track below that plays after you run through the labyrinth in desperate search of someone in one of the later levels.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY9t-finmRU\n\nFor an anime I knew nothing about and characters I could of cared less about.  Record of Lodoss War Wonder Labyrinth, is a 8.5/10 for me.  I will be checking out the anime and manga on this one.

(It will say 8 on my review because I left the game idle at times). \n\nFor a game on sale at 15.99, I think that's fine. The game can also be really easy with the magic you can get and usage of health items. I, personally, did not use any health or magic regeneration items once just to challenge myself, and I did make the game more exciting for me (it also didn't feel unfair or much of a handicap to not have resupply items). The way you get health back is quite generous which makes health items unnecessary to me. However, if you do use regeneration items, the game becomes too easy. \n\nOverall, this is an 8/10 for me.

The Air/Fire Spirit boss fight.\n- Also why does Air/Fire have \"Levels\"? Other than to hit stack to 3 so you can get health regen. If the level lowers you need to switch elements and kill enemies to gain back levels for the opposite elements, which becomes real obnoxious when you just need to float but the monster is immune to air, so you are forced to switch elements... it just becomes tedious fairly quick. \n\n\nThe story here is very niche to Lodoss War fans, I'm a little rusty on lore and I found it impossible to follow along, and therefore care. \n\nI would recommend this for 10$ or less, it's an decent, level based metroidvania if you are hungry for the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1622762521, "timestamp_updated": 1622762521, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925341129302979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93135020": {"recommendationid": "93135020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246176492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1646347816}, "language": "english", "review": "high elf pretty", "timestamp_created": 1622760867, "timestamp_updated": 1622760867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93089149": {"recommendationid": "93089149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038488459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 451, "last_played": 1622697144}, "language": "english", "review": "This is overall another solid metroidvania from team ladybug.\n\nI know nothing about Record of Lodoss War; only really hearing about it in passing and unfortunately unlike Touhou Luna Nights, team ladybugs previous game this feels a fair bit more reliant on knowledge of the series to get full enjoyment of this. Thankfully the game itself is fun enough that not knowing won't ruin the experience.\n\n [h1]The Good[/h1]\n\nOnce more team ladybug knocks it out of the park with the sprite work, even when tackling what is a considerably different and more conventional style compared to the chibier style used in Synchronicity and Luna Nights. The visuals express everything rather clearly to the player with no overly ambiguous gameplay elements that hit you out of nowhere. The controls are tight and responsive which helps the platforming and general navigation of the game feel incredibly enjoyable. Enemy variety is rather large with a lack of many repeating enemy types making each zone feel fresh. The Ikaruga style switching elements is used well in both the combat and general exploration introducing some very interesting combat and platforming challenges. The equipment system [strike]Ripped straight from SOTN[/strike] introduces some light customizability changing the way you play with every new weapon. The element system makes the game a bit less of a just mash the attack button the whole game to kill everything as you may need to switch per enemy to get damage off or enhance your damage. The magic adds into this introducing more elements to play around with and exploit. The level design is a big step up from luna nights with a lot more interesting exploration and navigation and a bit more of that classic metroidvania old area revisiting for new things previously locked off. \n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\nGame is an absolute joke difficulty wise which was rather disappointing coming off of the challenging but rewarding luna nights. Every single boss can be very easily brute forced just by running up to them and mashing the attack button or taking pot shots with the bow from across the stage in complete safety. A lot of puzzles can be easily exploited either by just taking hits to skip it with iframes in the the damage based ones or standing directly in the door to shoot the gear without rebounds in the bow ones. Speaking of the bow puzzles while interesting they are often times frustrating as some require very specific positioning and shots to get which is just annoying. \n\n[h1]The Meh[/h1]\nMusic was pretty standard across the board. While far from bad I can't say I recall any of the tracks after playing and it mostly just fell into the background. The story is obviously very reliant on knowledge of record of lodoss war. While you are given a very short intro (hero kill bad guy, girl love hero) no information is given on any of these other characters or even the main character besides that she loves the hero. The bonus 100% map ending is especially confusing as it seems to maybe tie into a newer series but my unfamiliarity leaves me thinking what as opposed to surprise. The element levelling system is rather underbaked. It is interesting in concept and encouraging not eating hits to keep it up is nice but it is far too easy to keep up where it counts in bosses and losing it is barely a punishment considering how quickly you can get it back. The mini games are largely ehhhhhhhhh; just kind of existing to either get a mid tier bow or get way too much money that you will never need. Speaking of the shop; it's fine. Adds little besides making an easy game easier. \n\nOn the whole this is another really solid release from team ladybug who is quickly becoming one of my favorite developers. While I prefer touhou luna nights on the whole this game was still very solid and a step up in a lot of other areas compared to that game, primarily level design.\n\nGood stuff 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1622699636, "timestamp_updated": 1622699676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51776653528213501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93086720": {"recommendationid": "93086720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930324579", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1623682044}, "language": "english", "review": "The most GBA-Castlevania game there is.", "timestamp_created": 1622694927, "timestamp_updated": 1622694927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93081696": {"recommendationid": "93081696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027695694", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 615, "last_played": 1622685463}, "language": "english", "review": "A wee bit short but quality development and gameplay assured.\nHomage to such a classic fantasy anime was certainly a treat.\nA difficulty setting would have been nice.", "timestamp_created": 1622685618, "timestamp_updated": 1622685618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93077221": {"recommendationid": "93077221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050777091", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1622677055}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed it and really wished it was longer and had more depth to it.

Best part is that this game didn't show much signs of padding aside from a forced boss rush mode towards the end which I'll admit I wasn't too much of a fan of, but for story reasons it kinda made sense. This game does pose a decent challenge especially with it's elemental switch mechanic (obviously comparable to Ikaruka) when fighting the various types of enemies and bosses. The mechanic changed how I approached the campaign in comparison to other previous metroidvania games by allowing me to be somewhat creative with traversing. I really love sprite work done in this game even if Deedlit's sprite animations are way too similar to Alucard's in Symphony of the Night. As of this review, there's no new game plus mode after completion, but since this is done by a very small team I'll let it slide since so far they have a good track of indie games based other Japanese IPs. Now I did get this game via early access by a friend on my birthday which I'm really grateful for (if you're reading this). The game is fully out of early access and is priced at 20 dollars which may seem steep for some people. I would only say it's worth it only if you're a huge fan of Record of Lodoss War and wanted a reminder as to why your younger self was so attached to the IP.

Defense increase feels like more, but the insane amount of knockback which enemies inflict will make you feel like even more of a loser than just straight up getting one-shot.

This game takes place after the original series and is a prequel to a new novel series written by the original author \u2013 set a full 100 years later. Despite that though, the game is designed to be welcoming to newcomers \u2013 and I myself fall into that category. However, if you\u2019re going to be playing it for the story \u2013 there isn\u2019t really much there in the first place. This is a much more gameplay-focused title and the story is mostly just random bits of dialogue before and after boss fights, just enough to provide the foundation to hold it all together.\n\n[h2]Gameplay:[/h2]\nHere you have a metroidvania with nice combat, cool abilities and upgrades, a bunch of different enemies and bosses, and a decent sense of exploration too. It\u2019s divided into six stages, but takes place on one map that opens up as you gain access to new abilities. It is not the biggest map, but exploring it does yield some nice bonuses and as this is a metroidvania, there is some backtracking. The game does not go overboard with it though and there are teleporters that can get your around the map.\n\nThe overall gameplay avoids that feeling of repetition because you\u2019re always entering some new area and encountering new enemies. Although it may only take 3-6 hours to beat, the experience is very well-paced and I never felt bored with it.\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nCombat has a bit of a unique spin to it as well. It\u2019s divided into two \u201celements\u201d that you can swap between at any time. Depending on the enemy type, one element may do more damage and it can also have an effect on movement. The two elements also have their own distinct level that grows as you defeat enemies with it and shrinks when you get hit. Having one at level 3 allows you to heal over time while using the other, so the game encourages you to swap between the two to maintain a decent HP pool.\n\nIt is a very cool system and makes the combat more than just another metroidvania hack and slash. That\u2019s not to say that the core combat is bad though \u2013 it\u2019s actually pretty nice. There\u2019s ample combat feedback and you can aim your melee weapons in any direction. Experimentation is encouraged and you will find a variety of these different weapon types as you explore.\n\n[h2]Graphics, Music, & Performance:[/h2]\nThe graphics are also good. It\u2019s composed of some really detailed pixel art \u2013 the perfect fit for this type of gameplay and very reminiscent of Castlevania. The music is fine too, but I honestly can\u2019t say I remember any of it now that I\u2019ve cleared the game \u2013 so not something that left an impact on me. Performance-wise, the game is solid. I had no technical issues of any kind and my only complaint there is that the game is locked to 60 fps.\n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2]\nDeedlit in Wonder Labyrinth is a short, yet fun metroidvania that emphasizes what makes the genre great. Polished combat, some nice exploration, a bunch of different enemy types and boss fights \u2013 it\u2019s an easy recommendation for fans of that genre.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews + videos!", "timestamp_created": 1622222596, "timestamp_updated": 1622222596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511399745941162109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92742416": {"recommendationid": "92742416", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968301870", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 133, "last_played": 1622494584}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Metroidvanias definitely give this one a try.

When in Wind you get Fire energy (and vice-versa). Energy can raise your spirit level up to 3, which auto-heals you when at max. But if you get hit, it drops a level. This ends up being interesting enough, since when you get hit it now becomes a game of avoiding the *second* hit until you can get the other level raised.\n\nBeyond that, I just kept waiting for the game to shake something up and give me a new experience, but it never happened.

I have no reliable access to the books in my country, neither is the OVA or anime available for purchase. I discovered the series through a friend upon sharing to him an amv which made use of Kiseki no Umi, the opening song for Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight.\n\nNeedless to say, once I discovered this game during a brief sale, I [i]had[/i] to play it. And so I did.\n\n[b]About this game:[/b]\nRecord of Lodoss War - Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth, is a sequel to the initial series of novels and a prequel to Diadem of the Covenant, a sequel series of novels which follows Deedlit a hundred years following the original fable. It is a Metroidvania, which is one of my favorite genres following my exposure to a certain Castlevania game you may or may not be aware of.\n\nThe game follows Deedlit as she traverses a deadly new world where things are not quite as they seem. Old enemies return to hinder her journey, while old friends aid her on her way. As she slowly uncovers the hidden truths of the Labyrinth, she must face the reality she denies if she is ever to escape.\n\n[b]My Experience:[/b]\nThroughout my eight hour run, I had an absolute blast. The weapon variety, although small, was nonetheless enjoyable, the arrow puzzles did their job, enemy variety is [b]fantastic[/b] and the level design was alright. I loved the work that went into the sprites and animations, although some sprites were not as impressive as others [strike](Shooting Star chief among them)[/strike].\n\n(Previously I mentioned that Shooting Star's sprite was unimpressive. While I feel it isn't as great as Narse, I don't think it's as unimpressive as I initially said it was.)\n\nNavigating the map was fun and discovering little secrets here and there was a treat. However, I doubt I explored everything, certainly the main areas and spaces where I'd find an upgrade or two, but I feel I missed quite a bit, especially when I was nearing the final boss. Total tunnel vision on my part.\n\nA lot of the bosses frustrated me. Let me be clear here, I beat the game with a keyboard with the magic/attack keys rebound to arrows and movement/ducking to WASD. My biggest issue with the bosses, is that not all of them have a noticeable opening. Pirotess is especially difficult in her second boss battle, not once during it did I feel like I could take advantage of her. Beside's Nihilim, I had the most trouble with her. Other than that, the boss battles are fun, challenging and rewarding, very pattern heavy.\n\nKnowing the patters really does help and I did my best to notice them when I could, and strike when I found it. Enemies having weaknesses to certain spells or the type of spirit you attack with was a neat touch of D&D sweetness which just goes to show that even a Metroidvania can hearken back to Lodoss' roots. I thought that was a very good touch.\n\nWhat got me most, was the length. I back tracked a lot, because I love exploration, so my hours are quite possibly inflated relative to the games actual length. It's shorter than I was expecting, which isn't unwelcome.\n\nI also quite enjoyed the difficulty, challenging when it has to be, but decidedly forgiving. Sure, I felt overwhelmed in places but it's not like the odds were insurmountable.\n\nThe ending itself was very nice. Despite my lack of proper exposure, I am at least partially familiar with Deedlit's story and place within the series and it was enough to make me emotionally invested.\n\n[b]Negatives[/b]\nOnce again, I didn't like how [i]some[/i] boss battles felt really cheap, or lacked a noticeable opening. A lot of the times I was spamming will'o the wisp, especially during the second Pirotess boss battle which I found incredibly tough. She's always on the move and immobilizing Deedlit and doesn't really pause long enough to take a hit.\n\nMP stays roughly the game throughout a play through while health gets boosted quite a few times. Throughout my entire play through, I'd only leveled up my MP bar [b]once[/b]. The fact the shop keeper (Ghim) did not offer any upgrades for it was especially hurtful.\n\nSpeaking of Ghim, he's the shop keep. Now, he doesn't offer much. Better weapons as you progress and healing items are the best he's going to give you. I think the devs totally missed out on having him sell cool extra items like a talisman that will regenerate your MP faster, or collect more gold loot, or even a onetime use revive for when you fall during the second phase of a boss battle. He offers [i]nothing[/i] but the essentials but even then, that's a minor complaint.\n\nA major complaint I have, however, is that the end of the final boss battle should come with an epilepsy warning. Flashing white lights as Deedlit's adventure is shown in green tinted stills is going to get somebody hurt.\n\nA final issue to address, is that V-sync doesn't always work like it's supposed to. It happens on and off and becomes noticeable fairly easily.\n\n[b]Closing thoughts:[/b]\nI wish that Record of Lodoss War was easier to access in my country. For what it's worth, knowing what I know about Lodoss and its characters at least allowed me to follow along and even remember certain characters who I've known only through images on the internet (the wiki is an incomplete mess).\n\nPlaying as Deedlit is awesome, I've come to really like her and sympathize with her. I can see myself starting a fresh save and playing through again when the mood strikes me.\n\nIf you're new to the Lodoss War series and you're thinking this game would be a good start, I would reconsider. The game doesn't explain much about the events of the first series, nor does it go into detail about the book characters enough to be invested in them without prior knowledge of them and their story within the universe. However, the game can easily be played just as well without the context.\n\nClassic Lodoss fans may enjoy what the game has to offer.\n\nI know I certainly enjoyed what I got.\n\nMight I add that the cover art is [b]stunning![/b]\n\nCompletion date: 25/5/2021.", "timestamp_created": 1621955799, "timestamp_updated": 1622091568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92574888": {"recommendationid": "92574888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046577166", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 562, "last_played": 1621953472}, "language": "english", "review": "Muy lindo juego!

The boss battles are more about having the right weapon/magic whereas Touhou was more about balancing precision platforming with dealing damage (which I definitely enjoyed). Luna Nights is a bit more of a challenging and intense experience compared to this, which is a bit slower and more relaxed most of the time.\n\nThis game has a few great ideas, namely the \"puzzles\" (they're not logic puzzles whatsoever) that you do with the bow! I though they were really fun, but unfortunately there's only like 15 times in the whole game you use them and they're all really easy. There was definitely more potential for introducing the bow into combat, since it's relatively useless in boss battles.\n\nAs far as the story goes, similar to Luna Nights, it's not particularly deep or gripping, and most of the characters are literally incomprehensible due to the lack of any kind of exposition. Still, the story is pretty minimal, and I found this one a little more endearing than Luna Nights.\n\nIf you've played platformers before, you can easily finish this game in about 4 hours with no replayability value or post-game content.

This gimmick was previously by the same developers in the excellent \"Shin Megami Tensei Synchronicity Prologue\", which was released for free, as it was meant to be more of a joke game to troll fans, but I am pretty sure they started work on this project  when they saw how well received that game was.\n\nThe other unique mechanic, is that attacking with each element give you Charge level for the other element, once you reach max, the maxed out element will regenerate your health until you take damage..causing it to level down. Leading to some chaotic boss fights as you are constantly switching between elements, to both avoid damage, and to restore your life. You can buy health potions, but in the first few stages they are not affordable, so its much easier to learn to switch efficiently.\n\nI found this game to be perfectly balanced, it was never too easy but also not too hard, if I ever got stuck in a boss, I either grinded a level or two, switch my weapon, or learned their pattern and eventually defeated them. \n\nOne thing that may be a con for this game... is that as I mentioned, its based on a japanese franchise, so people who are not familiar with it, may be totally be confused about the story or miss out on alot of implications, however this game is mostly about the gameplay for 95% of the time, and the story is not THAT complicated...youll just miss out on a few references. Aside from that one complaint, everything else in the game was great.\n\nOverall I had a blast playing through this game, beat in in a single day (about 8 hours), so the price is a bit high, around 20$ CND at the time of this review, but I am definitely gonna be replaying this game in the future, as I have replayed Symphony of the Night a few times.

Add New Game+ and make Pirotess a playable character. Having such a great Metroidvania without New Game+ is pretty much a crime at this point, though I'm pretty sure Team Ladybug might already work on that.

You spend most of your time exploring alone and [spoiler]interactions with the other main RoLW characters is extremely limited[/spoiler]. Although this is somewhat justified by the game's setting.\n[*]Deedlit's colorful personality doesn't show much.\n[*]A bit of wasted potential for some mechanics: Sliding, backdodging are barely used (zoning mobs and bosses at the edge of your range thanks to your insane aerial mobility makes these almost obsolete in combat), the bow's precision aiming mechanic is never used outside of puzzles and outshined in battle by magic, and the fire/wind spirit's \"assist\" projectile barely does anything. This is mostly due to the player's kit quickly becoming overloaded with very strong options.\n[*]While it is a metroidvania, its level design is extremely linear. Outside of the little secret every now and then, there is always [i]only one location[/i] you can progress towards at any given time. This is a plus if you prefer handholding, but a minus if you're in for the open-ended maps this genre is known for.\n[*]Difficulty is a bit weird, it's generally very easy but sometimes throws one-trick-pony difficulty spikes at you. Bosses at first mop the floor with your face with some untelegraphed quick attacks which you then completely handwave on your second try with proper spacing, given you're not cheesing them out by constantly fleeing and spamming on-element spells.

Gameplay is pretty tight and feels quite good, it just took some time to get used to, like dodging being a backstep instead of a free dash in any direction, or attacking while flying etc. The bosses are fun and have good patterns, but are very forgiving, it's not unusual to tank some damage on your first try before you learn the attacks and still win. And that's probably about it.\n\nAs for the things I found weak it would be the high amount of weapons, which are mostly crap and not very unique, which is a shame as various weapon types have different attack animations like a front slash/stab, overhead swing or a short range throw, but ultimately it doesn't matter what you use unless it's some early game weapon with bad stats. There is also a shop in the game, but I never really felt like I needed to buy or sell anything, except maybe some healing potions for rare bad situations. The weapons being sold are mostly crap or overpriced and you'll still find equivalents out in the open that are just as strong, if not better.\nThere are also a bunch of elements monsters are weak or resistant to, but you'll mostly deal air or fire damage based on the spirit you are currently using, with the rest being tied only to a single spell or a unique weapon that ignores the element of the spirit and uses its own. So it's kind of a wasted opportunity.\nAlso some bosses are made out of paper and can be easily cheesed by just keeping your distance and spamming bow or even casting a spell a few times, which is really a shame.\nAs for the level design, it's very simple, the rooms are basically just rectangles with some platforms in similar layouts, there are no secrets and the progression through the map is very linear for a metroidvania. Some of the traversal abilities aren't utilized enough too, for example the slide, you have to use it only like three times.\n\nThe game was still enjoyable, but short.

I don't, so my feelings are on the gameplay.\nIt's not quite as good as a Castlevania game, like SOTN, or Bloodstained. It lacks somewhat in depth. \nIt's very light on the inventory, you only choose weapons, Melee and Bow, there's no armor or defensive trinkets to equip. \nYou can buy new weapons from a merchant, but he's more supplemental as often you'll find stronger weapons(or pathetically weak ones) sitting in rooms behind a locked door, an archery puzzle, or need an item to reach. \nThe bosses are probably a little easy, most were beaten on my first try. The first spell you get in the game is very strong and useful on almost every enemy, activating a spell will pause everything while its animation plays to give a bit of a breather to assess your situation. \nYour defensive options are a bit less than what SOTN has however, by default you have a Backstep, then you are given two elemental spirits of Wind and Fire that you can switch on the fly that protects you from and absorbs their respective element to gain MP and leveling them to their max cap of lvl. 3 gives you a generous HP regeneration. Wind allows you to hover and later Fire gets invincibility frames on the slide. Getting hit will level your Spirit down however, but it's easy enough, even during a boss fight, to get it back up to lvl 3.\nSpirit management is key, keep them at lvl 3 to heal. There is no armor in this game.\n\nOffensively your Melee and Bow attacks take the respective element and later increase base attack power when equipped, some enemies will be weak to one of the elements, some neutral, others outright immune, you'll be swapping Spirits alot, they are your lifeline to making progress.\n\nAll of this is really nitpicks. My only grievances is not understanding the source material and the minimaps position, I wish there was an option to move it, resize it, maybe change the zoom on it.\n\nTo conclude: It's worth a playthrough, replayability seems low as there isn't achievements yet.", "timestamp_created": 1621423039, "timestamp_updated": 1621429137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92250818": {"recommendationid": "92250818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054531127", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1663503900}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games I have ever played.

This turns big fights into Ikaruga, which is dope.\n\nHowever, like Luna Nights, I bounced off of the exploration pretty hard. Your life total is really low, and while you have some i-frames after getting hit, you also have recovery frames after getting hit, so it's not impossible for combinations of enemies to juggle you. The low life total also means you go from healthy to dead in only a couple misplays, and there's pretty decent distances between save statues, so you may find yourself repeating a lot of progress.\n\nThere's no armor equips and no defense stat, so it's play good and play consistently or die. And I can do the first one, but never the second one.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this, but with the caveat that if what you like about metroidvanias is specifically the rpg elements, this still doesn't really scratch that itch.\n\nIf you like platforming action games that require a little bit of thinking, that let you style your way through fights, and that are probably pretty fun to speedrun, I'd suggest picking this up.", "timestamp_created": 1621364837, "timestamp_updated": 1621364837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92193739": {"recommendationid": "92193739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075539513", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1621321755}, "language": "english", "review": "As far as recommendations go, this one is something of a mixed bag.

When a friend bought it for me I jumped right in, eager for more Metroidvania games. It started as one would expect from an RPG based Metroidvania games, side-scrolling, exploring, leveling, changing weapons, but the game's core mechanics came to light soon enough. The sylphs, while they could have definitely been expanded for more variety and use, were really intuitive and fun to use, often acting with Ikaruga effects that blend very seamlessly with the gameplay. The controls are nice and tight, movement is very fluid, and combat allows for much more variety in attack angles than a lot of Metroidvania games and is very welcome. The story was told and characters were introduced in such a way that, as someone who is only familiar with the series in a passing way, didn't get too bogged down in lore from the series to the point that I got confused or lost. It's a great game, if a little on the short side, but the mechanics are solid, the visuals are great, and there is a pretty solid soundtrack too.

The soundtrack is really freaking good.  I didn't find the length disappointing.  I think it lasts just long enough to not overstay its welcome.  Being able to complete a game in a few sittings these days is a boon to me.  I got full map completion in about 8 hours. The quality of play for those 8 hours was consistently good, so I felt good about my $20 spent.  I really like this trend of short metroidvanias like this, Carrion, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight, Timespinner, and Dandara.", "timestamp_created": 1621115187, "timestamp_updated": 1621115421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606753230094909668", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92059763": {"recommendationid": "92059763", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995370472", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 361, "last_played": 1621108110}, "language": "english", "review": "I stopped playing from the boss gauntlet thing.

Feels fairly short. It's a good game, but I wish I waited for a sale.\n\nSo I haven't seen the anime that this is based on, and they don't explain anything about who anyone is or what their relationships are. The game just assumes you already know. By the time I finished the game I still don't really know who these people are. The....explanation......for what is going, I accurately guessed within the first few minutes. Which is a bummer, because it made me care about what was going on, basically not at all. Oh well, who needs a story in a metroidvania game.\n\nSo you basically play as a gender swapped Alucard, from SOTL, but instead of having vampire magic, you get elemental magic.  Many of Deedlit's moves and controls are exactly the same. There are a few new mechanics; you get a bow and have two elemental familiars. The bow isn't a super big deal, you can aim up and down, but I mostly just used it to hit switches and open doors.\n\nThe familiars are a big deal. The air elemental lets you hover, feather fall, add wind damage to your attacks, and makes you immune to wind damage. The fire elemental adds fire damage and makes you immune to fire damage. It's nice to be immune to lava or a dragon's fire breath. They add more damage the more hits you get without taking damage (basically a combo system) and give health regeneration when full. This is how you'll get most of your healing, and you lose 1/3 of you combo bar when hit. Also using fire charges up the air elemental and using wind charges up the fire elemental. The total gameplay effect is that you'll want to switch elementals a LOT, to add the right damage, regenerate health, or block elemental damage. Sometimes twice in a single jump or every second or two. It's a neat change, but it's really easy to lose track in the heat of combat, take a few hits, get stunned then get killed. In most boss fights you'll either totally dominate them and never get hit more than twice, or you'll get hit a third time, stun locked and killed while you just stand there watching. Feels pretty cheap, but not awful.\n\nThe map is set up in exactly the same way as SOTL, including where they like to hide items.

Great graphics, simple but working story, and some weird game design decisions. Overall I recommend it if you like Metroidvanias.\n\nA couple of possible improvement which shouldn't be too expensive and improve the game further :\n- Hard/+ modes. In this kind of game it's mandatory. Just tweaking some numbers in damages and health should be enough to allow player to tune the game experience.\n- Nerf the boomerang and the chakram. I ruined half of the game abusing the first and rushed the final boss with the second. In most Metroidvanias games ranged weapons are often largely lower in raw damage than their melee counterpart. Those two weapon are doing way too much for their convenient usage.\n- Remove both, erh, meat? From the [spoiler]Shooting Star[/spoiler] arena. It makes the fight impossible to fail as whenever you're a bit low, you just have to go to the side and beat your m.... well you got it. I doubt removing them well make the fight that harder as this boss pattern is fairly easy to learn.\n- Add either a mp cost or a maximum duration between two landing to the hovering ability. It makes a certain number of monsters plus a fair bunch of boss attacks absolutely unthreatening.\n\nSome others improvements but might be harder to implement :\n- Some monsters attacks hitbox should be tweaked, noticeably the minotaurs. When they use the jump-slash attack you can litterally pass through the axe unharmed.\n- Some monsters pattern make them particularly weak in some situation, noticeably the crocodiles\n- A fair bunch of your attack pass through walls, while most enemies can't. Now imagine that with the Boomerang and Hover. Yeah I'm flying and killing all flying enemies from below, wall or not.\n- I never figured out what poison does. If a threatening mechanic can't be figured out, it's not threatening enough.\n- Some songs are just... too darn 00's techno for such a fantasy game.\n\nAgain I mostly appreciated it, but I felt like underlining what could make it great.", "timestamp_created": 1620910278, "timestamp_updated": 1620910278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91924070": {"recommendationid": "91924070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168706573", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1626255033}, "language": "english", "review": "WHAT WAS WITH THAT ENDING?!

Fans of the \"Igavania\" [i]Castlevania[/i] entries, especially [i]Symphony of the Night[/i], will find some real similarities in Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth.\n\nThe game stars Deedlit from the old-school anime/manga/light novel [i]Record of Lodoss War[/i]. I watched this OVA over ten years ago, so I didn't remember a lot of it. That's okay because the story here isn't too concentrated until the end. You can easily get by with no knowledge of the source material.\n\nIn [i]Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth[/i] you will traverse a labyrinth of mysterious rooms and corridors laden with enemies and traps. Unlike the gothic, sci-fi, or Arabian Nights-themed aesthetics of other similar games, [i]Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth[/i] uses classic [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i] creatures in a dark fantasy world. Combat is really fun, and Deedlit has a small array of powers that can be combined to get some amazing effects. By switching between air and fire spirits, she can absorb MP from enemy spells and even regenerate health, along with being able to hover and use spells, melee weapons, and bows. I was so impressed with the game in minutes after starting.\n\nMusick, sound effects, and graphics are top-notch. The musick replicates [i]Symphony of the Night[/i] in some areas (mostly the intro), and I am fine with that. The musick goes from rock epics to more ambient fare. Sound effects sound crisp and forceful. The audio really made the game feel alive, and so did the graphics. From the moment I saw Deedlit's cape flitting about, backgrounds slightly rotating to adjust to the player's movement, and the animations of the various enemies of the game, I was blown away. This is really good stuff.\n\nI can't recommend [i]Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth[/i] enough. It's not super long, but the hours I spent playing it have been a real highlight. I'm excited for new features that have been promised soon (boss rush), and I will have to finish exploring the labyrinth to get the last few percentage points to 100%.", "timestamp_created": 1620742059, "timestamp_updated": 1620744011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91802799": {"recommendationid": "91802799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001715477", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1620694695}, "language": "english", "review": "A quick and fun Metroidvania with a lot of polish and charm.", "timestamp_created": 1620707664, "timestamp_updated": 1620707664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91745529": {"recommendationid": "91745529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138974989", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1620616648}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1620616664, "timestamp_updated": 1620616664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91745009": {"recommendationid": "91745009", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972468761", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1620783384}, "language": "english", "review": "Very much in the vein of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.

This one has \"Wonder\" in its title, and it deserves it. \n\nLadybug yet again basically made a fanfiction game using an official license and yet did something so lore appropriate than the tragically bad sequel trilogy of Star Wars that it makes me wonder why anyone dares to call them canon. Why did I waste a couple sentences hating those movies? Because they are terrible, I am still offended by them, and because I can find better writers off the side of the road than the morons involved with writing that tripe, as often is proven by labors of love like this game. Previously they made Lunar Nights taking place in Touhou, and now they have this amazing game taking place in Record of the Lodoss War.\n\nSo, how faithful is it? Well, if you ever watched Lodoss War, you know it is something that is extremely niche for a reason. Stiff voicework, classic music as a soundtrack, and looks like it was made on the budget of two shoe strings and a ball of yarn. So, who the heck cares, go watch Rune Sodlier instead.\n\nAs for this game's gameplay? Well, good bend like a reed in the wind combat action and worth the effort. A little less impressive than Luna Nights, but dang this group impresses me. I did not like the element shift mechanics because it altered how you moved in the environment, but apparently there is some game called Ikaruga or such that has a similar mechanic.... now that I think about it, this game borrows a shmup mechanic for a metroidvania game, while their previous game was a metroidvania game based on a shmup franchise. There is now way to not think about the mindset of this company while I review this game, is there? Well, better than pointing out how bad Star Wars Episode 8 is.\n\nMusic? Not all that good. Passable. When they made Luna Nights, they were able to borrow from that franchise's amazing OST list, but Lodoss War had nothing of quality in its music, so this game gets less quality music than the other title. It is 1:24 as I type this sentence. I am barely awake, allow me to vent about random stuff as I review this good game.\n\nWas I disappointed by anything in this game? No Rune Soldier cameos or references were found on my playthrough. That is all. That is my only complaint, because both of Lodoss and Rune Soldier are in the same anime continuity or whatever.\n\nStory: Corn and Orange out of Banana and Apple.\nIt good. I won't spoil anything, but knowing what I do, I expected the ending I got before I even had purchased the game. Some of the trailers kinda made me realize right away what I was getting into.", "timestamp_created": 1620023252, "timestamp_updated": 1620023252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91332378": {"recommendationid": "91332378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027519418", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1620013901}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has the stupidest title I've ever seen.\n\nThe story is almost completely incomprehensible. Deep down, it's just a tale about learning to let go as part of the grieving process after losing someone you love. But they hide it under layers and layers of useless information about a war in the \"kingdom of Lodoss\" and by  introducing like 10-15 characters that the main character supposedly knew during this war. It's like jumping into the Lord of the Rings at chapter 18 of The Two Towers. Horribly, awfully written and the charm of the final moments of the game are ruined because of it.\n\nThe bosses in this game aren't just equally awful, they're even worse than the story. If you're actually fighting the bosses, you're an idiot. All you have to do is find the spell that is a boss' weakness, then spam it over and over while dodging. If you run  out of MP, every boss has at least one attack that you can stand in to \"drain\" MP out of. Just dodge and spam, and cheese every single boss. The only point of weapons is getting around the map.\n\nBUT\n\nIt is a perfectly serviceable Metroidvania. It has an interesting gimmick, though it doesn't feel like that is ever really used to its full potential. You can switch between an air element and fire on-the-go, which give different benefits such as floating or being invulnerable to fire. Standing in pockets of the same element you are using \"drains\" MP, but hitting an opposite element hurts. There are a few situations where this is used to the best, where you have to switch back and forth between them to get through puzzle-like rooms, or while falling like a platformer, or while fighting enemies. Overall, it feels underutilized, but it's still a cool idea.\n\nThe music is AMAZING. The art and animation is BEAUTIFUL. It's almost like the budget went entirely to the soundtrack  and art design. If you like metroidvanias, it's almost worth it just for both, since really good pixel art is kinda rare nowadays with indie games.\n\nThe moment-to-moment gameplay is decent, and great to look at  and listen to. The story and the bosses are trash. Overall, I'd give it a 6.5/10. I recommend to anyone who likes metroidvanias and has a little cash to spend, but keep in mind that it's pretty short. I got through in ~5.6 hours with 99% map completion, probably only missing one or maybe two tiles.

Very pretty pixel art throughout and not so complex in its powers/challenges, so easy to grab a short session in the evening after work while still making good progress. Was able to complete it at a reasonable pace without any major obstacles (except trying for S-Rank on the Archery Training - pointless frustration for completionists only - elemental and other bows are more useful than the reward).\n\nIn-Genre:\nI probably prefer Hollow Knight as a Metroidvania (literally my favourite in the whole genre), but it's a very all-encompassing game that both needs and deserves a lot of attention, whether it be for the challenging bosses/areas, worry of losing your accumulated Geo, deep exploration or breathtaking art. All great points if you consistently have the chunks of time to take advantage of it, but I found Deedlit much easier to pick up and play. Some bosses would need a Retry, but many could be adapted to and cleared on the first attempt, without any restoration items. Elemental attributes are a big deal mid- to late-game, so once you amass a decent armoury of Spirits/Bows you can usually exploit most enemies' weakness to make short work of them, including bosses.\n\nStory & Final Thoughts:\nI hear that Touhou Luna Nights is probably their trickier game, and on the strength of this, would be happy to pick it up for my next dip into the genre. I had no prior familiarity with Lodoss, but still was readily drawn to the characters and interested in seeing how their story played out. If you want a charming Metroidvania that doesn't ask too much but gives a lot in return, this is a good one. If you only want a Metroidvania that tests your legacy skill in the genre, this might be too light (or just good for a speedrun).", "timestamp_created": 1619964860, "timestamp_updated": 1619965731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91292662": {"recommendationid": "91292662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028354201", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1630081460}, "language": "english", "review": "========\nSummary:\n========\nAnother great title by team Ladybug which features again a metroidvania gameplay just like Luna Nights.\nThere are a lot of different weapons and powers to use and the experience is fairly short yet satisfying (I finished the game in 7 hours despite many deaths).\nThe soundtrack as always is very good, the animations, sound effects are also great and the bosses are all challenging and have intresting patterns and design.  \n========\nDifficulty:\n========\nEnemy wise, the game is surprisingly fair until the very last chapter which features some really tough enemies (more on that later).\nOn the platforming side, it's pretty fair with a few difficult sections but overall most of it is manageable and you probably won't die too often due to the level design.\n\nGameplay wise however, the game will take some getting used to as the main character is able to switch between two elements (Wind and Fire) which allows you to absorb the same type damage but also affect which type of damage you inflict.\nAnd since most enemies will have different vulnerabilities to elements, it is strongly recommended that you look at what their weaknesses are (displayed at the bottom right of the screen) otherwise the game will be SIGNIFICANTLY harder (trying to kill a fire monster with fire for instance).\nThese elements are represented with two gauges at the middle of the screen with 3 different levels.\nThe higher the element's level, the higher the damage you inflict.\nAnd if the gauge is at level 3 you automatically regenerate health.\nYou will however lose levels if you get hit.\nThe game also has a very low amount of invulnerability frames or Iframes (a period after being hurt during which you cannot get hit) which means you WILL get severely punished later on in rooms that have multiple enemies that can make you fall on top of another enemy making you take damage twice with no way to avoid it sometimes leading to your death.\n========\nBosses:\n========\nProbably this game's strongest point, the bosses are fairly difficult to deal with and will pose a fair challenge to the player the first time they fight them. \nSome will still remain a challenge even after multiple fights due to their number of different patterns and how fast some of them are. \n========\nUnlockables:\n========\nMost of the hidden powers/weapons are found by destroying secret walls and are pretty obvious to find if you look at your map.\nYou will sometimes have to explore a fair bit to find switches or keys to progress but there aren't many instances of that.\nWhile most of them are on your path, some require a bit of looking around by using your collected items or powers.\nYou'll also be able to purchase some gear and items from a merchant with in game gold collected from beating monsters or selling unused weapons.\nWeapons have different swing speed and reach which allows you to play however you like.\n========\nLength:\n========\nAs mentioned earlier, the game should roughly last 7 or more hours depending on how you fare against the bosses and enemies.\n========\nExtra Content:\n========\nWhile I couldn't find it, there's apparently a boss rush mode but the game features no New Game + from what I saw.\nThis may change with future updates as the game just got released.\n========\n100%-ing the game and achievements:\n========\nAs of now there are no Achievements in the game and you can't exactly track what Items you got from which level like in Luna Nights which makes it difficult to know if you've 100% the game or not but it isn't necessary to get all the items/powers to beat the game.", "timestamp_created": 1619963058, "timestamp_updated": 1619963058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91288522": {"recommendationid": "91288522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102082367", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1619941731}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is excellent.

The bonus part is, if you watch the old japanese anime (in the 80-90s) of Record of Lodoss War, you will feel very familiar with all the characters in this game. \nI haven't completed the game yet, but so far the game progression is very good, you got various attack type (melee, ranged, elemental and magic) with extra perk for elemental part and some good ol key puzzle that needs you went back and forth to various area. \nWill update this review once I finished it, but I very confident to recommend this game. 2 thumbs up for the developer", "timestamp_created": 1619856849, "timestamp_updated": 1619856849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91201307": {"recommendationid": "91201307", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973057524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 635, "last_played": 1693024638}, "language": "english", "review": "While not as long as some of the heavy hitters in the metroidvania genre, or as challenging as Team Ladybug's Touhou Luna Nights, this game is still a beautiful adventure worth undertaking, especially for any fans of Record of Lodoss War and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.

I'd been sitting on it since it came out in EA ages ago, waiting for it to be finished. The overall core is fine, nothing outstanding, but the enemy+room+combat design all put together leave something to be desired - with some improvement in any of those areas I think it would have been much better.\n\nBasically, standard 2D platforming castlevania-esque combat. If you touch an enemy, you get knocked back and lose a bunch of health, if an enemy attack hits you, you get knocked back and lose a bunch of health, if you get hit I think 3 times in a moderate time span you get straight up stunned. Because the knock backs are so huge and hit recovery is so long there were times when I went from full health to dead against normal enemies where I literally couldn't react. Adding more frustration to this, the hitboxes of enemies are not super clear, and some enemies have attacks that basically require you to just retreat across the screen to avoid because they overlap with other enemies' attacks so broadly. It's also far too difficult to tell which spirit you are using on the fly when looking at your character, which you need to constantly because you need to be moving pretty much all the time (and thus, dodging). There's an easy marker at the top of your screen, the opposite of where you are, but it really needed to be more present on Deedlit herself.\n\nMaybe as compensation for the general difficulty of actually using weapons on enemies, magic and bow attacks are quite strong, but capped by mana, but mana is easy to recover - sometimes, and against some enemies. You can go several rooms in a row with no easy mana recovery options or just room after room of basically infinite mana. Spamming magic or arrows is relatively effective against some of the more annoying enemies if you sit there and change your spell constantly. Some enemies are also just mega tanky, require jumping to interact with because they hover offscreen, and you quickly learn you're best off just trying to get past them or knocked back past them.\n\nIt technically fulfills the requirements of calling it a metroidvania but the exploration is pretty limited, there's usually 1 room in each stage that requires an upgrade you get later (or unlocking a door you can later), otherwise just breakable walls hide things. There is very little reason to backtrack as I think all the upgrades you'd want are available as you progress naturally.\n\nThe boss fights are pretty good, except for the last two boss fights, which I don't want to spoil but it does the whole \"fail a phase? Here, waste your time on everything easy all over again!\" except it's even more egregious how pointless it is due to some specifics of them. It literally felt like padding, in a pretty short game, for no reason. Some of the worst lack of checkpoint design I've seen in a game.\n\nI was aware of Record of Lodoss ages ago but never watched it, I do know it brings in a lot of characters from it to have a few lines of dialogue here and there, but it is not really a story game.\n\nOverall, just OK. I would put it pretty far down my list of metroidvanias. It tries to emulate Symphony of the Night in various ways but not in enough of them to bring it up a notch. The enemy design and level design is just pretty bad and the combat does that no favors.

You get plenty of mobility, weapons feel good to swing and there's a decent number of them. Not a million, but enough for you to care. \n\"Spirit Switching\", i.e. the Ikaruga color-switching mechanic is also pretty fun: it makes you invulnerable to attacks of the same element as your active one, changes the properties of some of your moves (jump becomes a freeform glide with Wind mode, slide becomes an i-frame'd Cannon Drill with Fire mode) and raises your total damage based on the current power level of each mode (caps at 3, you always lose 1 on hit regardless of HP, also like a shmup). \nMy only real gripes with gameplay are the lack of a \"turn\" button when you have your bow out and the fact that spells and items are in the same equip slot. You can only equip a spell or an item at a time, bound to the same button. You'll get used to it, but they could both make moment-to-moment slightly better if adjusted.\n\nIn a way, it feels just like watching the 1990 OVA: a short, easy-watching, lavishly-produced experience with plenty of memorable moments, but also minor details that could have been done better. Speaking of the OVA, by the way...\n\n/// DO *NOT* PLAY THIS AS YOUR ENTRY POINT INTO RECORD LODOSS WAR ///\n\nThis whole thing is basically a curtain call for the original book cycle, which is about 7 volumes long. They were also never translated in english, so that makes the 1990 OVA your only option (aside from Wikipedia), and lemme tell you: you will not understand a single thing of anything that is happening without it. Or rather you will, but some moments won't hit the way they were designed to because you'll be going \"who the fuck is this\" every 2 seconds. So basically, watch the OVA before even thinking of booting the game up. It's a nice watch anyway, so don't worry about it.\n\nAlso, EXTREMELY important detail: in the original DnD campaign that would serve for the basis for the novels, Deedlit was played by the author, Ryo Mizuno himself. Try to keep this in mind as you get to the ending. \n\nIf you're already into Lodoss War though, what awaits you here is both a lovingly crafted tribute and a bittersweet sendoff to the tale of Parn, Deedlit and the Accursed Island - and more importantly, to Ryo Mizuno's tale. To the good times long past, and to the uncertainty of the future. \n\nGodspeed, Lady Deedlit.", "timestamp_created": 1619790926, "timestamp_updated": 1677575391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91166259": {"recommendationid": "91166259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005861504", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 365, "last_played": 1619785550}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty cool and semi-short game.

The presentation is very nice, with great animations for the pixel art, and a good soundtrack to go with it. The gameplay is also well-done, with just a handful of issues here and there. The game is not as responsive as it could be when it comes to shooting arrows and then sliding to avoid damage, or switching between the two spirits you have to use the different moves/properties they have, for example. You get nice (if a bit simple) mobility upgrades as you progress, and your movement speed hits a sweet spot from the start, turning the exploration of the map into an enjoyable affair. You get a decent array of spells, although some are much more practical than others. The weapon selection is perhaps a bit too limited, however, if not in number, at least in functionality, with too many similar melee options.\n\nAs mentioned before, the game is extremely easy, and I think I got everything there was to find in 6 hours. Then again, this isn't a 60 dollars release, and the easy difficulty at least doesn't hinder the pacing of the completion.

Off the top of my head it's one of the hardest games for me to explain why I even like it so much. There's so much for me to talk about from the characters, the gameplay, the music! Man the music in that game is something I can never get enough of it. Lost Painting is probably one of my favorite video game songs ever.\n\nDue to sotn though I have a very particular taste in metroidvania games. I remember being recommended some Metroid games and when I gave them a shot I wasn\u2019t really interested. Through that I learned I\u2019m more of a fan of fantasy settings and the use of swords and whatnot. Being in Space with some space guns is just not the most interesting thing to me personally. \n\nThat\u2019s what eventually led me to Team LadyBug. These dudes are great at making metroidvanias out of whatever property given to them. I found them initially though Touhou Luna Nights. This game managed to get me to still play it although it did not even have weapon variety like in Sotn.\n\nAlthough it lacked things that usually would pull me in I still played this game to 99% completion. Yeah 99% because just like in Bullet hell games these bosses are HARD! And I just could beat that final boss but great game nonetheless. This game was enough to make me believe that Team Ladybug can make the types of Metroidvania games I\u2019m looking for.\n\nThat Led me to this game in which I was more of what I was interested in. \n\nWhile I didn't know anything about Record of Lodoss War I still played this game and I found it fairly interesting. I\u2019m not going to go into detail because there ain\u2019t much to tell and honestly I feel experiencing this game without knowing the story is the way to go here even if it isn\u2019t something all too deep.\n\nAs a metroidvania this game is great especially for someone who prefers more of an Igavania I had such a fantastic time with this game. Something you quickly notice about this game is that its movement is great and when attacking depending on what you\u2019re using. \n\n\nThere\u2019s 3 different types of primary weapons in the game. One-handed weapons, two-handed, and throwables. One handed weapons are your standard type deal that allows you to attack in 8 directions. Two-handed weapons cannot swing in as many directions but they always attack with a giant overhead swing that makes them overall very useful especially if a two-handed weapon is the strongest you have. \n\nLastly as I said throwables which there were only two of that I could find. They\u2019re your basic boomerang style weapons that are neat but not all too useful and in terms of swinging. That\u2019s the general breakdown of the weapons but there are still different types of weapons but they\u2019re only visual. \n\nSomething else in this game is Bows and Arrows as your secondary weapon. Bows serve as your long ranged weapon that sports different qualities depending on the bow that you have. It could range from shooting multiple arrows to having homing arrows. They\u2019re especially helpful during later game boss fights since they can get chaotic especially when you\u2019re upclose where you\u2019re more likely to get hit.\n\nBows are also used in some puzzles to open doors or spin various gears. \n\nAnother thing this game has is magic. While its not used in the same sense that it is in Sotn, it's still something you can find and equip throughout the game.\n\nMagic is unlocked by finding it throughout the game. They\u2019re all equippable like items that you scroll through. Some are clearly more useful than others, especially the wind and fire magic as there are enemies that clearly take damage to one or the other.\n\nOverall as a metroidvania style game I enjoyed it a lot and I can thoroughly recommend it. Although the start of it feels a bit slow to me personally once you start getting into the actual meat of the area you traverse through you really start to feel it all come together as a very fun game that will really push you. \n\nThe boss fights in this game is possibly one of its best qualities as it takes influence a bit from what Team LadyBug did in Luna Nights by making the bosses have some bullet hell influence on occasion which as I said earlier paired up with some weapons like your bow makes the fights all the more interesting. \n\nThere were some problems I had with the game though for example maybe I was just expected to grind but the end game areas felt a tad too difficult as I felt very weak in comparison to most of the enemies there but the bosses felt fine and pretty balance in my opinion but I also could\u2019ve just cheesed them by using the bow. \n\nSpeaking of bosses one thing this game had that I did not like is that for the final boss you have to beat the boss beforehand again if you die due to no save in between and I wish there was a checkpoint there. You do end up learning how to quickly beat the boss easily rather fast so it's not the BIGGEST of deals but it's still annoying. \n\nMy final issue with this game which is a similar problem I have with Sotn is that there is no new game plus meaning that once you beat this game unless you haven\u2019t played it in a while there really isn\u2019t much of a reason to come back.\n\nOverall this is a very fun game that I recommend a lot as aside from Bloodstained which was literally made by Igarashi this is the first metroidvania in a while that really hooked me in and I wish it released on more platforms because currently as of this video its only on PC but considering its minimum requirements I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be too much of an issue for even those of you rocking a craptop.\n\nDeedlit in Wonder Labyrinth really surprised me with its quality and is a fantastic game for the price of simply 20 bucks which is honestly the perfect price for the game. Great combat, fantastic music and sprites, and just absolutely fun as hell boss fights that I would love to fight again. \n\nIn Conclusion\u2026. \n\nBuy this fucking game.\n\n(If you read this whole thing then yes I posted a whole youtube script I wrote on this game with a few minor tweaks)", "timestamp_created": 1619338693, "timestamp_updated": 1619338693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90871826": {"recommendationid": "90871826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012336770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1619404814}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice blend of SOTN and Ikaruga, wish it was longer, completed blind  in 7 hrs", "timestamp_created": 1619316106, "timestamp_updated": 1619407212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90869309": {"recommendationid": "90869309", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993615631", "num_games_owned": 1586, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1619311603}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, good and great art!

As a long time fan of both the anime series Lodoss War and the metroidvania genre, I was the target audience of Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth, and I was ultimately disappointed by it.\n\nThe graphics are great, featuring large, beautifully made sprites with a lot of frames of fluid animation. The music is evocative and driving; nothing that will stick in your mind, but keeping you in the moment. The controls handle well and are properly customizable. The story was confusing to a point, but ultimately resolved well, and was probably simple enough that even those who aren\u2019t fans of the anime could enjoy it (I think my confusion was mostly trying to place it in the existing Lodoss story).\n\nSwitching between the fire and wind spirit, the primary mechanic in the game, was probably its strongest attribute, and I would have loved to see it expanded. Much like Ikaruga, the idea is that your fire spirit absorbs fire attacks, but also causes you to attack with fire, so you have to keep switching to balance your offense and defense based on the enemies and obstacles around you. The aspects that utilized this mechanic well were definitely my favorite parts of the game, and I wish they had been expanded on.\n\nThe metroidvania elements are where it starts to come up short. The map is very small, made worse by the extremely compact layout. The large sprites and mostly unremarkable hallways make a lot of the screens go by quickly as well. The design changes between the six stages weren\u2019t terribly remarkable, and the last stage was basically a set piece for the story with two boss fights, with no meat to it: no enemies, no obstacles, no puzzles.\n\nThe rest of the game is similarly lacking in \u201cdiverse\u201d and \u201cmemorable.\u201d The enemy sprites are great, drawn straight out of the anime/manga, but the roster isn\u2019t especially robust, even less so when you take palette swaps and other small changes into account. The main collectibles in the game are weapons and spells that don\u2019t make the game play that differently, so going back to find a secret room often left me with an underpowered weapon or a spell I might cast once or twice.\n\nThe main premise of a metroidvania is the idea of gating off areas to encourage exploration and backtracking. Most of the areas of this game were gated off with colored doors or keys. The few powers that were present included the omni-present double-jump and water-breathing, along with a slide that felt like it could have been a core mechanic. The way that the game handled its super jump was probably my favorite feature, especially combined with the air spirit\u2019s levitation ability.\n\nIn the end, I feel like this game would have benefited from more focus being put on the platforming, rather than releasing a short, watered down Symphony of the Night. I would have loved to see more flavor and length to each stage, more creative uses of the core mechanics, and more challenging jumps, puzzles, and bosses.

It is a game that some are destined to love but everyone else will find themselves unimpressed.\n\nThe Positives\n\n-The gameplay is simple and fun. There are no complicated weapon/magic/platforming systems, which makes DiW accessible to even non-hardcore players.\n-Exploration is enjoyable and works organically in the game. I never felt like I was wasting time not knowing what to do or where to find what I was looking for.\n-The spirit system is a clever mechanic with a lot of potential.\n-There is a decent variety of enemies, most of them with their own unique set of moves.\n-Controls are exactly the way they need to be, movement feels smooth and there were only a handful of times when Deedlit did not immediately do what I wanted her to.\n-Visually the game is a joy to watch and it is bound to age amazingly. I cannot imagine a better pixelated version of Lodoss.\n-What I said about the visuals is also true for the music. Excellent work.\n-I cannot overstate how happy I was to see Record of Lodoss War being brought back to the light. Nostalgia is a absolutely a factor that helped me love this game to an extent that I otherwise may not have. I wish the future will bring us more games from the Lodoss universe and maybe even from other titles of the same era (I'd love a game for Vampire Princess Miyu, Guyver or Arslan).\n\nThe Negatives\n\n-DiW is extremely short and there are no extra modes or rewards, so other than enjoying the game again from the start there is no incentive in replaying. I get that this is an indie project but I think it needs a few more additions.\n-Even worse, DiW provides next to no challenge. I am far from being a seasoned Metroidvania player but at almost no time did I feel like I had to signifantly up  my game to progress. An easy/hard mode would help spice things up a bit.\n-There are many weapons but less than a quarter of them feel distinct in some way.\n\nOverall Deedlit in Wonderlabyrinth is a title made for Metroidvania fans who want a relaxing time and old-school Lodoss/anime fans.

Most games with enemies and spikes would never want you to have something like that.\n\nBow and spells are of course tied to MP, but the drip regen + ikargua style polarity mechnic MP regen/damage nullification take care of you greatly, meaning you can actually feel more like one of those slick battle characters instead of hack, hack, hack, hack, one spell, hack for rest of battle. Health regen tied to a gauge you lose when you get hit seemed like it wouldn't be good, but they nailed that too. Now you have the incentive to flip between your polarities for health, damage, damage nullification, and magic regen. Gets pretty hectic.\n\n\nBiggest cons is that most of the game is way too easy.

Otherwise towards the end the standard mobs get good and the other bosses are pretty fun.\n\nLadybug - take this same exact mechanics, art, everything and just expand the levels, enemies, boss fights.

Back then you only had trickles of info from EGM or other contemporary videogame publication. \n\nI have been following this game for quite some time and have been intrigued just solely on the art direction and visual aesthetic. Upon watching trailer after trailer and gameplay previews from early builds I was hooked.  This was going to be a day one buy for me.\n\nThe moment I started it up and played it I was transported back in time to that memory of me in that local used game store.

But for the asking price, I think that's very reasonable. The controls are responsive and satisfying and the mechanics are all very well polished.\n\nAt times I felt the game had a bit of a problem with enemies piling on damage while I was recovering from the last hit or being stunned, leading to a few deaths. But because of the abundance of save points and versatile attack strategies to counter these enemies, these deaths were never irritating.\n\nThe music and visuals are amazing and brings the presentation together with a lot of flair.\n\nIf I had some critique it would probably be the following:\n\nThe equipment system feels somewhat redundant, especially from the shop, since you will progress the game and find better weapons before you have time to start appreciating the ones you already have. While some weapons have elemental properties that deal more damage to certain enemies, I never found myself relying on this to the extent I had to switch gear. Speaking of elemental attacks...\n\nThe expanded elemental system feels entirely pointless. You always have access to Wind and Fire element at the press of a button, and no enemy is resistant to both. If they guard against Wind, hit them with Fire, and vice versa. Therefore the addition of Light, Dark, Water, Wood, and Earth elements added almost nothing to the game whatsoever. Equipping high power gear, relying only on Fire and Wind, and casting the Wisp spell for its homing ability got me through the game just fine from beginning to end.\n\nHowever, neither of these critiques detract from my enjoyment of the game whatsoever, they just seemed superfluous.

I think in terms of style and control this is the closest a game has ever gotten to emulating the legendary Castlevania Symphony of the Night. The game is absolutely gorgeous and brought me similar feelings to when I first booed up SotN back in the late 90s. Deedlit feels lovingly inspired by Alucard's gorgeous animations and the control has been slightly expanded upon on with the introduction of being able to attack in 8 directions, much like in Super Castlevania IV. Despite this, Deedlit feels ever so slightly stiffer than Alucard ever was. Animation canceling through jump attacks is nowhere to be found in the game, which can lead to frustrating situations of feeling like the game isn't responding to your controls. This is most likely to be seen when you\u2019re trying to come down from a jump mid attack and then slide. Deedlit will just proceed to jump back up into whatever you were trying to avoid with glee or even worse, stand perfectly still and get walloped just as hard. There\u2019s also no way to increase your speed in the game as far as I know. Movement enhancing tech, like back dash canceling, shinesparking, or even just a sprint button of some sort, is nowhere to be found. This leads to Deedlit feeling quite slow and makes any form of back-tracking feel more tedious than it should be. The best form of movement is the super jump. I would be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t thrilling to shoot up through the air, it is heavily underutilized and only provides extreme vertical gain. Good for some of the tower rooms, but, not practical for the quick room to room sprinting you may be doing to find that last one percent [spoiler](small hint here, jump a lot)[/spoiler]. Not that the absence of any of this adds much to the game\u2019s difficulty. Every enemy encounter, boss or not, in the game can easily be face-tanked without a second thought due to how easily you can damage race most enemies. Save points are extremely plentiful and are around every corner. Being able to heal by swapping to a tier 3 elemental style feels ridiculous and I never once felt like my life was in danger. I did not die a single time during my play time and any resets came from my own personal challenge, beating all the bosses without taking a single hit. This challenge is something I would recommend if you are to pick Wonder Labyrinth up by the way, otherwise you will blitz through the game from 3 to 6 hours easily. Regardless, while being ultimately less engaging, shorter, stiffer, and easier than SotN in every aspect, this game was still a fun and worthwhile expenditure of my time. I would say its price tag currently is justifiable if you love these style of games, but, you probably already own it if you do. Otherwise, wait for a sale.

The end result is a game that demands skill and strategy from the player while eliminating nearly all reliance on random elements or exploitative tricks.\n\nWhile some visual similarities with Castlevania: SOTN are apparent, arguably the biggest visual influence is the animated series which provides the source material, Record of Lodoss War. Aside from her basic run cycle, Deedlit's animations and poses are pulled virtually frame-for-frame from the source animation. The same trend can be seen with the game's backgrounds, enemies, and non-player characters.\n\nNow, graded on just the gameplay and visual design, \"Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth\" would still be a shining example of what small development teams are capable of producing; but it is the story and treatment of expanding the source material that elevates the game to the realm of a masterpiece. I really can't emphasize enough how clever and moving the story ends up by the end, particularly since it could easily have degraded into the trash-tier nonsense typical of most fan projects.\n\nStory spoilers incoming.\n\n[spoiler] Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth explores surprisingly deep themes of resisting change, leaving a legacy of work during your life, and honoring loved ones who have passed away while staying absolutely true to the story and setting of the original work, incorporating elements from the source material. It delves into the pain and sadness Deedlit must have felt outliving all her human friends and loved ones during the centuries which passed since the events of the animated series while still maintaining a hopeful and inspiring overtone, punctuated with an almost chilling final cutscene.

The graphics are charming and communicate the action well, and have obviously inherited the DNA of Symphony of the Night.  The gameplay is very tight and snappy.  It innovates with systems like the 3 level cube mechanic, but still feels wonderfully comfortable and home for Castlevania fans.  My few VERY minor gripes are: the music, while well composed, gets repetitive and lacks in variety.  And as of stage 3 I don't recall finding a single breakable wall or hidden room, so the gameplay loop is just slightly more linear.  Final judgement: As a Castlevania successor, I find that it deviates just slightly enough to be it's own thing, so fans looking for a CV fix should flock to Bloodstained and its' spinoffs.

Sin embargo a poco que hayas completado algunos de este estilo, Record of Lodoss War aporta muy poco.\nY es una pena tener que decir esto, porque el mismo estudio hizo hace unos a\u00f1os el Tohou Luna Nights que es altamente recomendable, con mec\u00e1nicas innovadoras para el g\u00e9nero, rebosante de personalidad y una banda sonora \u00fanica. Bueno, todo eso, no lo tiene este  juego muy a mi pesar, porque esperaba mucho de \u00e9l. \n\nEso ser\u00eda el resumen. Ahora pasar\u00e9 a desmenuzar cada aspecto del juego a mi opini\u00f3n. \n\n- Graficos: sin duda el punto mas alto del juego. Tiene un pixelart hermoso tanto en calidad, como en cantidad de frames de animaci\u00f3n. Hace que cada cuadro te haga babear solo con ver a Deeldit caminar. \n\n- Historia: entiendo que est\u00e1 basado en un anime de anta\u00f1o, pero no lo he visto. A\u00fan as\u00ed la historia se sostiene por s\u00ed misma y tiene un costado tierno. Es un punto a favor.\n\n- M\u00fasica: no es mala, pero tampoco destacable. Apenas acompa\u00f1a, y en algunas zonas es mon\u00f3tona. El Tohou Luna Nights est\u00e1 a a\u00f1os luz en esta cuesti\u00f3n. \n\n- Jugabilidad: aqu\u00ed empiezan los problemas. Por empezar el juego te plantea que ir\u00e1s cambiando de modos (viento y fuego), digamos incorporando mec\u00e1nicas como las del shoot'em up Ikaruga. Al ser un metroivania uno espera que este sistema se vaya complejizando, cambiando a mas tipos de modos y forz\u00e1ndonos a utilizar distintos elementos. Pues no... solo usas esos dos todo el juego. Ademas el personaje pr\u00e1cticamente no cambia jugablemente con un elemento u otro... solamente con viento planeas, y con fuego haces un slide con invulnerabilidad... nada mas en todo el juego. En cuanto a builds es uno de los mayores problemas. Solo tienes 4 tipos de armas mas una: tipos de cuchillos, tipos de estoque, tipos de espada, tipos de espad\u00f3n, y el bumerang que es \u00fanico (solo hay uno). El modo de jugar no cambia en absoluto solo son armas mas r\u00e1pidas o con mas hitbox, y el resto mejoras de estad\u00edsticas. Con los arcos pasa lo mismo. Un solo arco cambia un poco la mec\u00e1nica de disparo y el resto son iguales, pero con mejores estad\u00edsticas. En definitiva el personaje cambia poco a lo largo del juego, y es una pena porque con haber utilizado mas elementos, diferenciar mas al personaje seg\u00fan elemento, o que las armas fueran realmente distintas mec\u00e1nicamente, creo que habr\u00eda mejorado mucho.\n\n- Dise\u00f1o de niveles: sin dudas el punto mas flaco del juego. En muchas zonas te encontrar\u00e1s pudiendo ir a los dos lados de una puerta, sin poder abrir la misma. Esto en un metroidvania me parece inadmisible, porque la mec\u00e1nica del \"puente roto\" se siente artificial y completamente arbitraria. En muchas zonas los cuartos simplemente ser\u00e1n un pasillo con enemigos con mucha vida y ya. No se siente que cada cuarto tenga una funci\u00f3n mas org\u00e1nica o sea distinto de los anteriores. Esto pasaba un poco en el Luna Nights, pero all\u00ed los puzzles o las zonas de plataformeo estaban mas inspiradas... aqu\u00ed comienzan de manera insulsa y terminan de la misma manera, pero con estad\u00edsticas mas altas. \n\n- Dificultad y duraci\u00f3n: me ha durado poco mas de 8hs tom\u00e1ndome bastante tiempo para hacer backtracking y explorar. Y a pesar de ser relativamente corto para un metroidvania, me ha parecido largo... pasando la mitad del juego, salvo por la espectacularidad de ciertos bosses ya no esperas mucho del resto del mapeado. La dificultad abusa de las estad\u00edsticas para intentar ponerte las cosas mas complicadas y creo que a\u00fan as\u00ed no lo logra... algunos jefes y enemigos simplemente te complican un poco porque te meten un stun de 5 o 6 segundos y el resto simplemente es a\u00f1adir damage y mas damage. \n\nY como si todo esto fuera poco, el juego no tiene logros de Steam... algo que ser\u00eda anecd\u00f3tico si todo lo anterior no tirara tan para atr\u00e1s. \n\nUna vez mas, lo siento, pero no puedo recomendarle el juego a nadie que haya jugado otro metroidvania antes. Si quieren probar juegos del g\u00e9nero que sean poco conocidos, tienen el Tohou Luna Nights que es del mismo estudio, y otros como Valdis Story, Kunai, 3000th Duel, o Minoria. Todos ellos les dar\u00e1n alg\u00fan punto alto de innovaci\u00f3n jugable o de estilo que no encontrar\u00e1n en Record of Lodos, salvo, el simple hecho de ser exageradamente bonito. \n\nUn saludo, y si mas adelante actualizan el juego mejorando estas cuestiones, cambiar\u00e9 mi recomendaci\u00f3n.", "timestamp_created": 1618185594, "timestamp_updated": 1618186011, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500910758972167969", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90160394": {"recommendationid": "90160394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003732441", "num_games_owned": 965, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 463, "last_played": 1626128785}, "language": "english", "review": "Top-notch game.

When it screen shakes this problem becomes even more exacerbated.

I will try to explain this for new players but if you are interested in this game only for be record of lodoss war then is enough decent for say buy, but if you like metroidvanias and dont have tohou lunas night then play that, and if you had play that well keep reading: \n1. story is well semi interesting but lack the impact of tohou lunas night, why that is better cause the game tell you all at start and then do a good plot twist, but here there is no plot twist the game dont tell you anything at start so you have to guess what is happening and sadly you will figure it too soon and boom you know the rest, and that makes that is good made but this is not a good story game... well at least is not a zero game as atelier ryza 2 so not get a not recommend from me. \n2. music and images, go to youtube and see them or buy game and try it, but if have to decide between tohou and this .. tohou wins again. Now controls are good comparable with tohou, and combar is fluid but have a big problem that really make me wonder if recommend or not... well i will recommend but here comes the last part. \n3. Combat is too hard and no good for new players, even if you play tohou and can do it without die, i see you dying here a lot. The combat go from hey easy to what the hell they are thinking. A lot of 1 hit moves, and is not that hit you and die, is more that stun and see how your char recieve damage until die... that is not a good form of lose, takes time, you can't do anything.. a good fast retry will help a lot in that sense. Now i finished all game ( if there is a secret boss ok i will find it but for now 95% map completion and dont see where i miss something) and well i kill all boss so is doable and probably a pro can speed run this, basicly if you are good enough can kill without getting hit but that those deaths happen a lot could get you stress and probably quit before ending where the games start getting more and more unfair. \nSo at the end even if the story is not great, is not bad and actually work for a normal game. Combat is too hard going for my top 10 hard game i had finished, and map is not fun to travel, too many blocked paths with doors that open too late, actually a lot of times i tought.. why the door couldnt open before, and no, I'm not talking about about a chest, im talking about doors that i go to both sides and open way later in map cause devoloper tought was a good idea.", "timestamp_created": 1618099405, "timestamp_updated": 1620916051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90092837": {"recommendationid": "90092837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046190619", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1617920839}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything in this game is good: controls, combat, bosses, music, story, animation, graphics, everything... except for the map design.\n\nThe map just doesn't form a cohesive location.

You got your Ikaruga in my Symphony of the Night!\n\nRecord of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth is a fun little game, very obviously inspired by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but throwing in enough new material to... not be original, but at least not feel stale.\n\nIf you're familiar with \"Metroidvanias\" as a genre, there isn't much to add in terms of the gameplay here.  It's a bit more linear than most, with the whole castle being traversable, but still clearly divided into stages (even with a scene transition preceding each one.)  What sets it apart is Deedlit's spirits.  She can switch between Sylph and Salamander, with some enemies being weaker to one than the other, and Deedlit herself being able to absorb attacks of the element she's currently attuned to.  Absorbing attacks helps to refill MP (which regenerates anyway, but absorption refills it much faster.)\n\nStory-wise, you're likely to get a lot more out of it if you're already familiar with the Record of Lodoss War story and characters.  While it's very clear that the main character is dealing with loss and an inability to accept that loss, you'll feel a lot more for her if you know just who Deedlit, Parn, Ghim, Etoh, Slayn, Woodchuck, and all of the other characters are.\n\nDon't expect the game to take a long time to complete.

This Game came out in 2021, and some feel it is lacking in the Castlevania levels of love, but for a game that is just a celebration, I think it is fun and people that like this Genre of games or especially like Deedlit or The Lodoss Universe In-General Should Give this a try.", "timestamp_created": 1618018452, "timestamp_updated": 1618018452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90030951": {"recommendationid": "90030951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315027916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1065, "last_played": 1689480695}, "language": "english", "review": "Very reminiscent of Castlevania:SOTN.

It's not necessarily bad, but it is boring to explore and does not really do anything interesting with the formula, nor does it execute it particularly well. Looks great though.\n\nLet's get good things out of the way:\n- the game is gorgeous: amazing art, great animations, decent backgrounds\n- music is kinda good, but more on that later\n- some game mechanics are genuinely good, Ikaruga style of switching element is great\n- despite its shortcomings, does not outstay its welcome - it is short enough to stay mildly enjoyable\n\nNow, the reasons why I don't really recommend this game.\n\nThe first and most important thing, the thing I love the genre for: sense of wonder and exploration. It is just not present here. The map is uninspired and boring to explore. The variety of layouts is lacking, a lot of similar rooms with the same backgrounds. Exploration is surprisingly unrewarding, there is barely any point to it.\n\nCombat is... It's there, it's present and functional. Most enemies take a lot of time to wind up their attacks, so for the most part you can destroy them before they even do anything. Any damage you take throws you away across half of the screen, staggers galore and after getting hit multiple times, you get staggered for even longer. As a result a single hit can easily result in game over. Some of the attacks are almost impossible to avoid, so it makes sense to make the wind up longer. It doesn't make the game any more exciting though. Bosses are a pleasant exception, but they are few and far between, as you would expect.\n\nStory makes so little sense it seems intentional. It is either very dependent on the player being aware of the setting, characters and lore, or the translation is bad. Most of the time I was as confused as the protagonist. Ending barely gives any answers.\n\nMusic just plays on the loop while you explore an area. It's generally not that bad, but gets old eventually. There's too much of it and the variety is lacking.\n\nThe game is rather short, but considering all the shortcomings, it's really not a bad thing. It barely outstays its welcome. 3 hours give or take are enough to complete it without obsessing too much about 100% it.", "timestamp_created": 1617963390, "timestamp_updated": 1617963390, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596723735332489014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89990050": {"recommendationid": "89990050", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966009790", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 365, "last_played": 1617959819}, "language": "english", "review": "This is what a current Metroidvania game should look like. \n\n* Though using the standard toolset for Metroidvanias (i.e. Double Jump, etc), it still adds enough of its own gameplay mechanics, so it always feels like your walking a very well know path, but something feels nicely different. \n* The pixel art style is off the charts, with beautiful animations for friends and foes alike. \n* Backtracking is optional and, praise Cthulhu, kept to a Minimum.

I mainly bought this because of my experience with Bloodstained.  I have no experience as a kid playing SOTN.  I am aware of the SOTN \"genre\" but never played a SOTN style game until I backed Bloodstained.\n\nCompared to BS, this game is very short.  We're looking at 4-6 hours of playtime if you power through it, more if you are trying to 100% it.  It feels very much like a \"side story\" version of a full game.  I personally got this because I am an older millennial that watched anime during the same time this series was prevalent.  Seeing such an old license/franchise being turned into a game was quite a pleasant surprise.\n\nOtherwise this game fits the Metroidvania formula to a tee.  You pick up items along the way to give yourself additional abilities, and weapon and bow upgrades can be found if you search far enough into various nooks and crannies.  If you find yourself unable to make a certain ledge or have a door locked in front of you, you will have to come back at a later time to access it, usually with a newfound ability or some sort of universal Super Mario World-esque \"P switch\" you'll hit after a boss battle.\n\nBoss battles were kind of a brute-force sorta deal for me, but there's plenty of opportunities to find blind spots and weak points for bosses if you try hard enough.  Gameplay itself is solid.  The Ikaruga-style element switching system is kind of interesting though it's not my cup of tea.  Combat is fairly straightforward.  Triangle for bow, Cross for melee.  There isn't a \"combo\" or special move system like there is with BS.\n\nThe map compared to BS' map is pretty small and straightforward.  Lots of save spots and transport areas.  Fair amount of backtracking to advance the game.  Controls are tight but this game has a lot of \"take a hit and fall into something that makes it worse\" moments, more so than BS.\n\nThe story is kind of straightforward.  It is more or less a very short \"OVA\" of what happens after the entire anime finishes, I believe.  Won't spoil the ending.\n\nGraphics are beautiful.  Old school painfully crafted 2D sprites and animations.  So many characters were drawn and I was hoping I'd be able to play them in the future.  Speaking of content, that's also one of the weak points of this game.  It lacks a serious amount of content.  There are no extra modes, no gallery, no higher difficulties, no way to \"replay\" endings.  Also, for it being a Steam game, there are no Steam-related achievements or trading cards or anything that takes advantage of the Steam platform.  This game could've just been released elsewhere.\n\nI really hope they do more of this franchise.  Something based off of Pirotess, for example would be awesome.  This game has excellent foundations for a full-blown game, but it just doesn't have enough \"meat\" to it to make me heartily recommend it.  It's a solid game, and I'd say $20 for this game is fair, but man I wish there was more to it and something that'll make it worth me replaying it.\n\nThat being said, I do hope this is like a precursor for something even bigger.  The Record of Lodoss War franchise has huge potential and if they make the right games off of it a new generation of gamers (along with us older gamers) can enjoy it for years to come.\n\nSo is this a recommended?  If you're looking for something to scratch your SOTN itch after you're done with Bloodstained, yes.  If you're a ROLW franchise fan, yes.

You progress through \"stages\" and only ever really go back to unlock hidden areas for optional equipment. A rather short game as well as I beat it under 7 hours and seemingly so has a friend of mine who recommended the game to me.\n\nWhere this game shines is the mechanics some new and some old. The game itself handles similar to Castlevania : Symphony of the Night. The game has a castlevania-like backdash, adds more directions with which you can angle your attacks, implements a straightforward magic system where you swap through spells/items, and gives you a bow which can angle up or down from a horizontal starting point. Arrows from you bow take mp and can bounce off of walls.\n\nThe most unique mechanic the game has is in the two spirits you aquire early on, a wind and a fire spirit. Switching spirits is mapped to it's own button which is a central mechanic to movement and managing enemy attacks. When you are hit with an attack of the same element you absorb the attack as MP rather than taking damage somewhat like the classic SHMUP Ikaruga. When you defeat an enemy or attack a boss with one spirit equipped the other one gains levels up to a maximum of level 3. These levels increase the damage you do when that spirit is equipped as well as at level 3 you will regenerate health points. If you are hit then you lose a level on the equipped spirit. This system encourages clever management of which spirit you are holding to if you take a hit and when you attack with the other spirit to recover spirit gauge. In addition to this mechanic the wind spirit also has the extra utility of allowing you to fly when it is equipped but you can only fly as high as you would be able to jump. \n\nI normally wouldn't say much about the plot of the game as that aspect isn't usually too important to my enjoyment of the game but this game takes place in the universe of a Japanese series of Fantasy Novels called \"Record of Lodoss War\". You don't need to be familiar with this series to understand the plot but it will help you recognize characters as they come up giving you a understanding of the history they share. If you aren't familiar the plot is straightforward enough to follow. Apparently this also is a prequel to the latest novel in the series which if you google the title of in the USA you get pages on this game instead so the game segues into a unrelated story which you probably won't be able to easily get access to.\n\nOverall the game pulls off what it sets out to do fairly well. It's a short yet quality experience which I recommend to fans of somewhat linear style metroidvania games.", "timestamp_created": 1617609046, "timestamp_updated": 1617609046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89745784": {"recommendationid": "89745784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171902473", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1617596209}, "language": "english", "review": "It\u00b4s a good metroidvania, 100% awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1617596236, "timestamp_updated": 1617596236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89741211": {"recommendationid": "89741211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930171439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 613, "last_played": 1617588041}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: SOTN etc etc, great game, hope to see more since they have an engine worked out, bit short\n\nCons: I tend to complain about soundtracks and I won't disappoint here: as with most of its elements, the game's OST aims to capture the grandiose splendor of the SOTN OST and it's frustrating how close it comes without ever getting there. \n\nThe composer manages to capture the big, roomy production of the original, but fails to make the tracks memorable or particularly compelling. This is mostly due to an avoidance or outright omission of melody: rarely does any instrument come out of the woodwork to declare itself, and when it does it meanders about before wandering back into the cacophony. This results in 90% of the OST sounding like undefined boss fight ambiance, even in areas that would benefit from something understated.

No \"striking, memorable and understandable\" blocked path like any other game of the genre, it's probably just another coloured door. Completing is the same but on every corner of the map.\nMoreover, the fact that you finish the game with 95% map completion really bothers me, I didn't even try too much backtracking, but maybe I'm just used to metroidvanias. Something to note is that breakable walls are a little different, which reduces the \"I'm gonna hit every single wall\", so that's at least good.\nBut sadly I'm not done with the levels, I'm briefly going to mention the final area because of its downright evil enemy positions. In their previous game, Touhou Luna Nights, annoyingly long screens were avoidable thanks to the freeze time effect, but in this game, you cannot even \"fly above them\" because of dragons taking the entire corridor while another shoots you from behind it. Remember the example I gave with going right then left then right? Yeah.\n\n[h1]Boss Fights[/h1]\nBosses are supposed to be a test of skills for the players, does he understand how to play, and does he have the right to continue?\nSome of the patterns involving switching elements do elevate that point, but some really don't, let me explain the latter.\nMany bosses in this game are fast, REALLY fast, I'm talking 0.2s long anticipation animations, with a pattern that couldn't be guessed. That means that the 3-4 first try you're going to have with a boss, you're going to tank a lot of new patterns you didn't know. And I hope you remembered every one of them, and their order too, because they mostly all respect a strict pattern. Having the bosses have only a single intended way to fight them just make them non-engaging, they become no more than chores.\nAnd to make that point even worse, the last fight before the final one is a Boss Rush... I hope you still have your mental notes on every bosses' patterns!\nThere are few bosses that aren't really like that, but these ones often have a really obvious and exploitable weak point, involving magic spells or not, making them even less interesting.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nBrief note on this: I don't know how you are supposed to play with the default button mapping, this was an issue on Luna Nights too, I don't know how you are physically able to tap/hold/spam simultaneously or differently two buttons with the same finger to jump/hover and attack. Anyway, it is rebindable so that's good, my main issue in this paragraph is the fact that during an attack animation, the \"down + jump\" input, the one to slide, makes you jump instead of slide (or it could do nothing too), which is annoying for precise battles.\n\n[h1]Credit where credit's due[/h1]\nArtistically speaking, the game is gorgeous, really good visuals and music. I can't really recall any melody, but the soundtrack does its job, and I remember some levels' theme slapping, so I'm good.\nWeapons all have different sprites, which is a good thing despite them being tossed when you find a better one.\nThe story might be good, sadly it's hardly understandable without knowing the original material.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nOverall, there isn't much to do. Replaying the game will probably be 95% the same.\nI finished the game in 5 hours, I could probably complete the remaining percentage of the map in thirty minutes or so, but I didn't. I don't mind short experiences, but I'm starting to get pissed when this experience is called by every review \"a great metroidvania\".\nIf you want a real game of this genre, please play Bloodstained or Hollow Knight.\n\ntl;dr good looks, questionable game, bad metroidvania", "timestamp_created": 1617467970, "timestamp_updated": 1617467970, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510421514511108398", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89632921": {"recommendationid": "89632921", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967294348", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "playtime_at_review": 2220, "last_played": 1700151959}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent but short, wish it has more replay value.

If you love those style of games there is a lot to like here and considering the budget price, I would recommend you just buy it. No need for any more info than that really. If you're on the fence I'll try to put into words why this game is good and worth the price but could have been great.\n\nA lot of people compare this game to Castlevania Symphony of the night (SOTN) but I think it's closer to Igas GBA and DS games like the Aria/Dawn games. The map is much smaller in scale than SOTN and the rooms themselves are smaller as well. SOTN really feels like a long journey through many different and varied environments while in this game the environments mostly look and feel the same. It has the standard castle interiors, underground tombs and caves and while they all look good, actually traversing them is mostly the same. The room complexity is also very simple which is why I compared it earlier to the GBA Igavanias. Those games were obviously hindered by the technical limits of their respective platforms. So, I'm sort of surprised that in this much newer game developed on modern platform is so simple in room layout. There are no large outdoor areas here and little in verticality in the rooms compared to SOTN.\nThe difficulty is also on par with those earlier mentioned games. Normal enemies are never much of a threat but the bosses get progressively harder with more and varied patterns to learn. It never really gets hard though.\n\nThere is surprisingly little to explore and the way forward is mostly obvious so the pathfinding aspect of these types of games is not here. There are secret paths and what not but they never really lead to new areas of secret bosses or anything like that. It's almost always just a dead-end small room with an item or upgrade in it. And speaking of items there's a lot of weapons in this game which combined with the small map means you find new weapons every couple of minutes. There were several times where I've just found a new weapon stronger than my last and just started to use it and then after a couple of screens, I found another even stronger weapon. I sort of wished the game gave me some time and space to actually use the new weapons I found.\n\nNow it might seem like I'm overly negative to a small indie-developed title but the market is saturated with Igavania and metroidvania style games so the bar is quite high here. But with that being said let's get on with what Record of Lodoss War does well.\n\nThe graphics are wonderful and animation is fluid especially on Deedlith. Lots of different animations for the different weapons and controls are tight and responsive. Controlling this game just feels great and this is an absolute requirement for this type of game I feel. You get movement type unlocks like you would expect and they are great. The double jump you get especially feels great, probably one of the nicest double jump mechanics done in this type of game. Movement speed feels perfect and you get nice evasive options like slide and dodge. Although I wished for an air dodge as well especially towards the end of the game.\n\nAs for other mechanics there is a polarity system in this game. Basically, think of games like Ikaruga where your enemies mostly attack in one of two polarities and you can absorb the same polarity. I absolutely love this system and it really saved the game for me as it made normal encounters more varied and boss fights more interesting. BTW another game that is also in this style with a polarity system is Outland. Go play it if you haven't, it\u2019s great.\n\nThe music is good with nice variety. Although the different tunes didn't hook me immediately like many of the SOTN tracks they started to grow on me after a couple of run through the areas.\n\nTechnically the game is solid; everything works as it should. Controller support was plug\u2019n\u2019play for xinput at least.\n\nSo, to sum up I\u2019ll still recommend this game if you are a fan of Iga\u2019s Castlevania games and other type of similar games. It does more rights than wrongs and it\u2019s just lacking in a couple of areas to be truly great. If you like Record of Lodoss War as well it helps you understand some of the things going on but the game is very light on story so I don\u2019t feel like this is a requirement. The game also sort of sets up for a sequel so I really hope that this game is successful enough for that to happen.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1617430731, "timestamp_updated": 1617430731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89613188": {"recommendationid": "89613188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025277563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 157, "last_played": 1617429325}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is hard to describe.

My biggest complaint with the combat is it feels a bit too easy to get stunlocked, you seemingly have no i-frames coming out of your stun animation so if the enemy's attack is still active, you're gonna get stunned again. Quite a few of my boss deaths were a direct result of this quirk, it really doesn't feel great. Looking beyond that, though, the game is an absolute joy to play.

A metroidvania based on Record of the Lodoss War (which I haven't actually seen but I've only ever heard good things). Like Luna Nights, the game has its own unique gameplay elements & gimmicks on top of the familiar metroidvania design.\n \nIn Wonder Labyrinth you play as Deedlit the elf & use a variety of weapons & magic, but it departs from the usual formula in the beginning by giving you 2 spirits: fire & wind. These spirits give you immunity to their respective element & the wind spirit also allows you limited flight. Later you acquire a bow & arrow & find you can ricochet arrows off metal surfaces & use them to activate various machines throughout the world. You use these tools to travel through the labyrinth, look for treasure & fight a variety of bosses.\nNow metroidvanias can have problems w/ obtuse design & messy pacing that relies on a lot of backtracking. But Wonder Labyrinth doesn't have this problem thanks to world design that provides plenty of ways to get to its various levels & the liberal placement of teleportation gates.\n\nMy only complaints are that there are these magic doors sealed by colored magic seals (red, green, yellow, etc.) that are unlocked by pressing a correspondingly colored switch, press the switch & all doors of that color are unlocked throughout the world. Now these locked doors aren't an issue themselves, rather there doesn't seem to be a way to see which ones you have unlocked.

The beautifully animated pixel art and brilliant soundtrack cannot make up for subpar gameplay which offer very little in terms of fun and engagement. \nExploration is very barebones, upgrades are too straightforward and combat feels either too easy or too messy with no middle ground. Even the most interesting mechanics, such as the ability to absorb elemental attacks for various benefits, end up being a detriment to the game: case in point, most enemy attacks are designed to cover lots of space (to encourage absorbing them rather than dodging them), but this leads to a cluttered screen where it's difficult to track your own character and impossible to read what the enemy's doing. Having beaten most bosses through sheer muscle memory due to very repetitive patterns (easy to memorize, hard to react to) I can't really speak highly of either the AI or the encounter design.\nIn short, for me the game couldn't follow the captivating beginning and the promise of a good metroidvania.

I forgot they existed until this game came out. It was a pleasant surprise when it did. I still remember most characters, but I have to admit I'm not an expert on the lore. That said, the story felt somewhat silly and not that deep, but it didn't take anything away from the experience. I just wanted to kill stuff and farm loot. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the looting system. Very few enemies actually have drops (only 2 to 5 per level). There are no miscellaneous loot to sell or to craft things. Major missed opportunity there. Instead, enemies straight up drop gold. You also can't sort your inventory. \n\nDeedlit moves very freely and gracefully and it feels good using most weapons in the game. The bows can be very strong, especially with the right element, since your regular weapons are limited to fire and wind. Spells are very underwhelming. They take unnecessary time to cast and are not that powerful 90% of the time. However it's possible to take advantage of the mp drain mechanic and spam spells like there's no tomorrow, in some situations. No familiars as well, however your fire and wind spirits do attack on their own every now and then for neglectable damage.\n\nThere are some minor puzzle elements, all of them using the bow. They are not very unique or hard. You don't get access to a lot of mobility abilities. Maybe because the rooms are self-contained and not that big, which would make such abilities not that valuable.\n\nIt should take most players 4 to 6 hours to 100% the game. It's not that long and not very hard. Enemy AI is underwhelming, too.\n\nAll the bad things aside, I still recommend this game because I'm a huge fan of the genre, but if you want a better, more complete metroidvania experience, then the game I recommend the most is Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. It is one of the best games of the genre since SOTN. It's more expensive than this, but it lasts for several more hours.

And no, it's not just another one of those half-assed \"metroidvania\" indie clones that get shat out every other day. This is the real deal. This is the good shit.\n\nInitially I was concerned it'd be a clone with no originality, but that isn't true. In this game there are two kinds of elementals that you switch between. Attacks of the same type won't hurt you, and will give you magic to perform spells with. Attacking an enemy of the opposing type will do more damage and is sometime the only way to damage an enemy. This creates a lot of interesting risk and reward scenarios, but the game doesn't make the most of them because it lacks difficulty. There isn't any new game + or optional super-boss, so be expected to blast through the game in under 5 hours.\n\nI'm tempted to prattle on about why this isn't be best metroidvania, but it wouldn't be fair to the developers. SoTN was a full-priced triple-A game; this by comparison is an indie title that I got for $10 (early access sale). It is absolutely worth paying full-price for, even if you've never heard of the anime.\n\nIf the developers ever read this, then I want to say to you:\n\nGreat job.

If you can picture the most obnoxious, obtuse, 100 hour overly long and wordy JRPG story where you just want to button mash through dialogue, this is the complete opposite of that. At the endgame the story picks up, but my sense was there is a lot more story to tell to develop the main and supporting characters, and that would have been welcomed. \n\nI honestly had zero idea what the hell was going with the story until probably stage 5. I was completely confused what was going on and who the NPCs were throughout EA. Regardless, this is a lovely, yet short game honoring SOTN with really fluid combat mechanics. The bosses were insanely well balanced, which is a rarity these days in metroidvanias. I could not believe how satisfying it was to 1) initially die because my default face-tank strategy didn't work for the boss 2) learn the boss patterns after 2-3 tries, 3) kill the boss after a handful of deaths spent perfecting patterns 4) that the devs don't force you to cycle through pre-combat dialogue again, straight to action. This is not a punishing die 100x and maybe you squeak by once you have muscle memory down. Not brutally punishing with platforming or platforming during boss battles, but rewarding in that you can't tank right through bosses. It's clear the devs approached combat with care and are sophisticated about the difficulty level. \n\nHidden/breakable areas are done really well, it rewards the player who attacks all the walls and is paying attention to the map for where there should be additional rooms. I 100%'d the map and finished in approximately 11 hours, and I only had to look up a guide for the jump secret room. I can't remember if I jumped 50x or down attacked numerous times to open it, but if there's a breakable hidden wall, as a rule of thumb, it should open on the first time you specifically attack that wall, or there should be some indication you're on the right track (crumbling, change the tile patterns to show damage). \n\nGating areas via color coded switches is done well, however, post EA content in stages 4-6, it's pretty formulaic fast travel and check the gate, and pick up a weapon that isn't as strong as what you currently are running. In this sense, the gating felt a bit linear post EA content, as there were typically 1-2 gates to go back and check.

It is nonetheless a real enjoyment to play and it recommended for all fans of metroidvanias. \n\nThe good:\n- The story. If, like me, you're not a fan of anime then nothing is going to make any sense... that is, until  you reach the final boss... at that point the story will hit like a pile of bricks.

However, as always, you'll get used to it and figure out how things work through trial and error as the game progresses. (hint: While you may only be able to grant fire and wind attributes, your spells have their own separate attributes)\n- the music.\n- Virtually no improvements over touhou luna nights and pharaoh rebirth besides the design of the save points.\n- stun locks used as a way of artificially making the game harder.", "timestamp_created": 1617096762, "timestamp_updated": 1617301520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89359604": {"recommendationid": "89359604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262452338", "num_games_owned": 1848, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1628170781}, "language": "english", "review": "This is yet another pixel art metroidvania from Krobon/Team Ladybug. This developer usually works out a deal with an IP holder and makes a short but bombastic metroidvania with great art and music. So far, they've made [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExVQ01fQwjk]Shin Megami Tensei: Synchronicity Prologue[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjUPcb_MIDw]KonoSuba: The Resurrection of Beldia[/url], [url=store.steampowered.com/app/851100]Touhou Luna Nights[/url] and now this. This game is very similar to Touhou Luna Nights in particular, just with a coat of Record of Lodoss War paint and a different gameplay gimmick ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/253750/Ikaruga/]Ikaruga[/url] like polarity switching instead of time stopping), even the UI and many animations are very similar. The progression is likewise largely gated by color coded doors/keys instead of relying on abilities.\n\nAnother obvious inspiration is [b]Castlevania: Symphony of the Night[/b]. Many of Deedlit's animations are directly patterned over Alucard, in particular her walk cycle and how she swings swords, and all the cloak stuff. And just like in Castlevania you get a large selection of weapons, such as longswords, greatswords, clubs, spears, daggers, boomerangs etc. And then your second weapon slot is the bow, resulting in a gameplay loop similar to [url=store.steampowered.com/app/428550]Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight[/url]. However unlike Momodora your bow shots cannot be charged, you can aim up/down instead and there's also a ricochet mechanic allowing for some simple puzzles. The third and last gear slot is for spells. They aren't terribly interesting and you'll probably end up spamming the very first spell for the whole game, as it has great tracking and a very good damage output to mana usage ratio.\n\nIf you've never played Ikaruga, the polarity thing is basically switching between two elements (blue/wind and orange/fire in this case) to guard against projectiles and target enemy weaknesses. Other games that used a similar mechanic are [url=store.steampowered.com/app/305050]Outland[/url] and [url=store.steampowered.com/app/220440]DmC: Devil May Cry[/url], off the top of my head. It adds decent variety, and spells and some bows can override it with other elements if you don't feel like switching all the time.\n\nNow for the bad stuff:\n- The game is very short. Only a little over 5 hours if you don't farm enemy drops, and there's no side content whatsoever, no optional quests or secret bosses.\n- Very little challenge. Enemies are very passive, 95% of the time you can kill them before they do anything at all. Bosses aren't that well designed either, their patterns are all over the place and they attack with little telegraphing, but you deal so much damage it doesn't really matter.\n- The story is largely nonsensical and just an excuse to give spotlight to as many licensed characters as possible. If you're not a hardcore fan of Record of Lodoss War it will make very little sense, as the game doesn't bother introducing anyone.\n\nBut even so, I still feel the game is worth playing. It's beautiful, fast paced and very polished.

Competent overall design mixed with the everything you-already-know, just in another setting. If you want something new and fresh, or you don't care about Lodoss lore, just ignore it and you wont miss it.\n\n[h1]the not-TL;DR[/h1]\nIt's competent, but it lacks anything that might serve well metroidvanias or that can help verily distinguish one from another. It's a good example of \"how to do what everyone already does or has done, with minimal innovation and good quality standard\". You won't miss the \"Got a new key/ability! Time for hours of backtracking opening all those new doors!\" that can feel so great (/sarcasm) since you can't judge whether what you might find may actually help you in a short term or if it'll be just a minor bonus or a not-even-neat weapon. Compulsive searching!!! Yay!!1 Goes specially nice with the lack of fast locomotion modes so present in other metroidvanias that actually have some sense on the size of their maps and include less roundabout ways, shortcuts and faster movement mechanics. Only the sparse teleportation rooms to serve you here.\n\nAlso, whose idea was to put a huge chunk of meat to serve as special gauge regeneration? Really? At that point we already know that beating people gets special gauge (and MP), but then putting us to repeatedly [b]beat the meat[/b]? Why not just make a different save statue that does both saving and restores everything? Oh, so two chunks of metal-chain-suspended meat can be inside the boss room in case you need to quickly beat the meat mid-fight.. now I get it. Maybe it was a reference I missed on the anime, manga, original novels, and/or other games?\n\nIn case you're wondering \"why diss the game so much if the review is positive?\", it's simple. I played Tohou Luna Nights and liked the design and competence of the devs. When I saw them again with another lore I like, I didn't even think. But I expected more of them. I expected them to learn and improve, not just move laterally. Now the map is bigger, a pain to travel through sometimes, which made back-tracking worse, and nothing else has really changed. Just another competent game. But that's what they promised. And I can't judge them based on a ratio between expectation/delivery, I need to judge based on the ratio between delivery/promise.\n\nWhat I can do is not look forward to another work from them.", "timestamp_created": 1617073732, "timestamp_updated": 1617073732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.375865668058395386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89348151": {"recommendationid": "89348151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142423546", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1617068950}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a solid 2d metroidvania.

I'll be going into spoiler territory to skip to the last paragraph if you (the reader) would not like to be spoiled.\n\nIn the 4th stage's boss room you can clip out of bounds, and during the memory world flashback in Deed's house reloading the game gives the player their currently equipped weapon, although it still does 5 damage. \n\nSemi-spoiler, getting high jump allows you to skip some of the sniping sections with the gears as you can hop over them.\n\nThe last complaint I really have is the xp grinding. This was nerfed from the previous release and getting to level 99 takes considerably longer, so for any completionists out there you'll be here a while.\n\nOverall Team Ladybug created another fantastic game with engaging gameplay, an atmosphere + soundtrack that draws the player in, and one to remember for the ages. 8/10.

Sadly, no achievements, hopefully the developers add those via patch (and also Steam Trading Cards please, Lodoss art is just too beautiful as to not have any cards).", "timestamp_created": 1617044760, "timestamp_updated": 1617044760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89329440": {"recommendationid": "89329440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370224691", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1687827000}, "language": "english", "review": "fun\n", "timestamp_created": 1617043832, "timestamp_updated": 1617043832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89328684": {"recommendationid": "89328684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356636945", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 362, "last_played": 1679599120}, "language": "english", "review": "Randomly stumbled across this.

The game is incredibly linear with only a scant few side passages that gives upgrades or weapons.\nSpeaking of those weapons and upgrades they are underwhelming to say the least, Weapons feels stale and uninteresting with nothing really unique about any of them. And the upgrades are all purely stat boost to either of your two elements or to max hp/mp. There are no accessories or armor to be found at all nor are there any side quests, There are no pets to gain nor are there any skills to gain or upgrade, while you do have a spell slot it feels tact on.\nFor a game that wants to be a Metroidvania game it does shockingly few things to qualify. Giving you only 2 item slots to fill, a weapon and a bow. \n\nThe story is also complete nonsense, unless you are already familiar with the setting and all the characters you will be hopelessly lost as they spout philosophical dribble at each other. Its bafflingly poorly made for anyone not already invested in the world. You are introduced to 15ish characters and you will learn nothing about any of them. Not even the main character is well fleshed out or even compelling, often shifting from one emotion to another seemingly at random.\n\nThe UI is a mess, being over designed to look fancy instead of practical. Its far to large while not conveying the information you actually need. With half of it going unused outside of boss fights, cluttering the screen needlessly. The inventory screen/map screen is also a mess, not keeping track of important information such as which colored doors you have unlocked. It shows your attack and defense but not how you can improve them. You have levels but what levels does is not clear.\n\nBut my biggest complaint by far are the bosses. While stunningly well animated and drawn they are terrible to fight against. They all lack any form of telegraphing, attacks often killing you outright because random debris hits you or an attack can be used in multiple ways giving you limited options to react, further compounded by the lack of telegraphing.\n\nVerdict: 3/10\nIf you like the interesting upgrades and item scavenging of Symphony of the Night then this isn't it.\nThis game really should just have been an action platformer instead, and dropped all pretenses of being a Metroidvania game as it doesn't commit to it and instead feels shallow and bland.", "timestamp_created": 1617031694, "timestamp_updated": 1617031694, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449975281953811646", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89316138": {"recommendationid": "89316138", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060657784", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 634, "last_played": 1641240008}, "language": "spanish", "review": "metroidvania de ley. me recuerda mucho al simphony de sega saturn", "timestamp_created": 1617028664, "timestamp_updated": 1617028664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89314101": {"recommendationid": "89314101", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987230171", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1599696111}, "language": "english", "review": "Scratches all those SOTN itches for a game with lush 2D environments, a variety of fun weapons and tight combat.

At its core it is what is considered a \"metroidvania\", and at that formula it succeeds. Exploring available areas (clearing the map) until you find appropriate skills to allow you to continue exploring gated areas is the basic metroidvania mechanic, and this game succeeds at that. Unfortunately, the game utilizes a mechanic from one particular game, Outland, that simply isn't quite functional and is rather annoying - elemental / color matching mechanics.\nEarly on Deedlit gains access to Sylph (wind, blue) and Salamander (fire, red). A variety of barriers and enemy projectiles (generally bullet hell projectiles) match the colors to a given element. Switching to the element before being struck by a matching color projectile allows you to ignore the damage completely. Unfortunately, this doesn't work out well, because it requires you to simply mash the element switch button constantly in order to damage enemies that guard against your matching element attacks, but can still hurt you if they touch you, despite you matching their element. It's nonsensical. Essentially, they block your attack if you match their element, but they can still hurt you if they touch you. Sorry, you're breaking your own elemental matching rules.\nBosses require you to memorize patterns that swap between the elements. There are unblockable attacks mixed in the attack routines that simply require you to avoid them. Again however most bosses utilize bullet hell projectiles that overlap and require you to constantly switch between the elements. Yawn.\nIn addition, there are puzzles that require you to calculate geometric angles for shooting arrows against reflective surfaces to cut a rope and open a door, typically granting access to an item. These considerably slow down the pace and grind the game to a halt. Even Bloodstained, that poor SotN copy, showed the full reflective angles for mirrors and the appropriate skill. Deedlit does not, requiring you to spend time figuring your angles. Sorry guys, this grinds the game to a halt and is rather annoying, as the majority of arrow puzzles are solved by floating to a particular height with Sylph and sending an arrow past the initial reflective surfaces. Couple that with clunky bow controls and you'll likely be annoyed rather quickly.\nProgression is silly - in 2.3 hours I was dealing 6 points of damage per strike to over 140 with the correct weapon and increased elemental damage, and still requiring 2-3 strikes per enemy to kill them. This is indicative of a short, poorly paced game with no real sense of progression. Within the short time I played I acquired several typical metroidvania progression-unlocking items (floating, sliding, double jumping, ranged attacks). Because of the rapid acquisition I didn't feel like I'd achieved any sort of actual progress. The bosses faced in the interim were rather boring - a dark elf who tosses daggers while ninja jumping around and casting either wind or fire spells, a water serpent that had an easily memorable pattern, and a pair of elementals (wind and fire). The elementals fight, I might add, didn't remove a given elemental once you dealt enough damage to kill it - the 'dead' elemental stuck around and spammed its elemental bullets and attacks but simply couldn't be hurt. It stuck around until the other elemental was killed. I get you want the game to be a challenge, but that's fucking cheap.\nOverall, the animation is great (and highly reminiscent of SotN - just look at Deedlit's run and cape animations) and the controls are decent and responsive - as long as you're not using a shitty Xbox 360 / One controller. I switched from a 360 controller to a buffalo SNES pad and was happier with the controls and response time.\nSorry guys, bullet hell mechanics are lazy and boring outside of the appropriate genre. Outland was terrible, and porting these mechanics into Deedlit don't do it any favors.\nNot worth $20.

Deedlit, a high elf, awakens in a familiar but strange location. With the game's length, any additional exposition borders on spoiling the game.\n\nThe RPG elements, leveling and equipment, are very stripped down to focus on the gameplay, which is very good and rewards skilled gameplay, but can be a little easy. The combat-centric metroidvania game focuses on melee, archery, spells and some movement abilities while occasionally throwing in a few archery puzzles and locked doors. There's not many items or equipment as similar titles, but there's enough variety and versatility in the Deedlit's repertoire that it never really feels like armor and other equipment items are \"missing\" from the game.\n\nIn addition to playing great, it just looks real nice and sounds good, to boot.

A small team of developers ended up creating one of the best \"metroidvanias\" to come out in recent years that I know of. \n\nLevel design is fantastic, with each area feeling very different from one another and being very intuitive in how you have to navigate them. There is one area in particular that might feel a bit rushed, but even then it's not badly designed. \n\nGameplay-wise, the game feels like a mix between Symphony of the Night and Ikaruga, with its own elements thrown in. Combat is fluid, you have access to magic, items, a dedicated button for a bow and weapons of different kinds such as axes, swords, daggers, spears and boomerangs. The elemental spirit mechanic is interesting, with certain attacks and obstacles being completely ineffective against Deedlit depending on which elemental spirit she's equipped with at the time (and you can switch between them with the press of one button) and healing her when they're at max level. \n\nThe music is really good, although the music for a certain area sounds a bit distorted. The sound effects are nice and fit the game, and the ones that are indicatory of certain gameplay elements being used are not annoying at all, feeling subtle most of the time. \n\nGraphically speaking, the game is very stylish, with some of the best pixel art I have seen in years. The animations are well detailed (Deedlit's running animation is reminiscent of Alucard's in Symphony of the Night, for example) and fluid, which helps the gameplay feel as good as it does.\n\nAs for the downsides. Having been released in batches due to early access, some areas are not as well designed as the others. As I said earlier, the music sounds a bit distorted in one or two areas. The game might be a bit too linear and/or short for some.\n\nIn conclusion: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth is a great experience.

The control scheme is the same, attack rather than jump is mapped to the confirm button, so it takes some getting used to and delivers a kind of \"floaty\" feel. The design choices I've run into so far are mostly quite good with a major exception. One hit from anything automatically takes you down an entire level, even if you're killing the local bosses well before they can finish a single loop of their attack pattern.

To be honest I probably wouldn't have bought it if I wasn't already a Lodoss fan. That's not to say that the game doesn't stand on its own, but you might enjoy it more if you are familiar with the source material.\n\nAs for the game itself it has a nice mixture of combat and puzzle solving. While combat against most enemies is pretty straight forward, sometimes it helps to take a specific approach to some foes. The various weapons give combat some variety, as different weapons will have different speeds, reaches, and damage values, making it useful to put some thought into which weapon you should use in a given area. Also the spirit system adds another level to combat and it is really necessary to master as the game progresses, at feat that fortunately isn't that hard. Paying attention to the elemental weaknesses of certain foes is also a must for the skilled player.\n\nBeyond the gameplay I have no complaints. The graphics are gorgeous and the music is haunting. The story, such as it is, fits into the Lodoss canon in way that makes sense as well as having some emotional impact (although as I said before, this may only apply if you are familiar with the Lodoss stories).\n\nIf I had one complaint about this game it is, as others have said, rather short. I was able to beat it in about 17.5 hours, and part of that was due to having to fight several bosses two or three times in order to beat, as well as spending some time grinding. A skilled player might be able to beat it in half that time.

While technically a Metroidvania, stage/map design is very light on exploration and there are only a handful of optional rooms to backtrack to and in general it feels like the game is more focused on the combat.\n\nImplementation of combat is solid, controls feel precise and there are a good amount of weapons, spells, enemies and bosses. Gameplay wise most of the environments are somewhat bland, but they feature nice pixel art and in terms of visuals in particular character and enemy art are often gorgeous. Sadly the sound design and music are completely forgettable, which is a shame as they could have added much more to the experience.\n\nIn addition to that there are two aspects where the game takes a blunder and those are balancing and the narrative. \n\nRather than having a well designed difficulty curve, the game starts off trivially easy and allows the players to cruise through multiple stages without requiring you to even take any advantage of items or spells. While the last two stages (or their bosses rather) ramp up the difficulty considerably - it feels like the whole experience doesn't really know which audience it wants to target.\n\nUltimately this might lead to a situation where many of the core fans of the genre will likely find the entire experience rather easy and be frustrated at a lack of hard mode of some form, while those who aren't experienced in these type of games may find the difficulty spike to be frustrating.\n\nWhen it comes to narrative, not only it is bare-bones at best but it also assumes that you are familiar with the world and characters of Record of Lodoss War. While those familiar with the setting have the benefit of knowing who the characters are and are able to fill in some aspects of the story same can't be said for those without the existing context - most of the narrative will be meaningless chatter where seemingly important names and characters are dropped left and right yet the game never establishes why you should care about any of this.\n\nThat being said, it took me roughly 5 hours to beat the game and explore the map.

The game tries its best to emulate Symphony of the Night, and while it can't quite reach it, there's a lot of effort put into making it a wonderful attempt that is usually quite fun to play, but it is soured somewhat by two things.\n\nFirst, the game at one point gives you a slide ability, which you can use with one of the elements to give you invincibility frames. it's even part of the little tutorial pop-up that shows up. so you'd probably expect to be able to use it during fights.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the game deciding you aren't allowed to duck during the attack animation, (walking and jumping is fine, you aren't locked in place) you can't really easily use it in a fight. I feel like that really makes fights a lot less fun for me when I'm actually trying to use it. A lot of the time, you'll hold down and press jump after attacking only to jump into an attack you wanted to slide under!\n\nGenerally, if you put a slide in your game I'm going to try to play it like Megaman and dodge under attacks. this game doesn't allow me to do that, and that feels bad.\n\nMy second issue is actually something a whole lot of games do, and while it works fine in a lot of games, and it's making enemies have their own hitbox that hurts you when you walk into them. I feel like you might have a funny look on your face when you read this, because this is something lots and lots of platformers do. Well, the thing is a whole lot of games do this, and they work fine in those games, but when a lot of what you're trying to do is dodge big bright projectile attacks that you will walk into the dark enemy sprites. I was okay with this in luna nights because most bosses fly, so you can't walk into them, but there was at least one boss who I walked into repeatedly because i was focusing on the big orange and blue bullets.\n\nAs far as the story, I'm not someone who has watched or read anything about record of lodoss war, and I can tell you right now the story is doing nothing for me whatsoever. The game keeps introducing bosses and npcs i'm supposed to know, they say something baffling or talk down to the character i'm playing as, and then either leave, stay, or fight me. \n\nLet me give you an example. A big dragon or sorcerer or something shows up. The main character shouts what is presumably their name. They tell the main character that they're wrong about something without specifying what it really is, telling them they're foolish without elaborating enough to give me any details, and not elaborating on what they think I should do instead. Then, after they're done pretending to be my boomer grandma, they fight, they die, and either say something as they escape, or explode. There's no other outcome.\n\nOne boss even had the audacity to ask me if i even knew \"what was at the end of the path I was walking\" and I was so disappointed when my character didn't say something like \"No, of course not, I don't know anything about where I am or what I am supposed to be doing because nobody will tell me.\t\"\n\nMaybe if someone is a big fan of ROLW they'll love this, but as someone who basically only knows what the game told me, I know nothing about these characters, care nothing for these characters, and only care that people are constantly talking down to the main character because I'm playing as them.\n\nOverall, this is a good game, but I would recommend Luna Nights instead, which is another game by the same developer. It's not too much more amazing, but I had no problems understanding the story despite knowing little about the characters, and you have a good ranged attack making dodging projectiles the focus instead of dodging projectiles and also enemy sprites.", "timestamp_created": 1616948412, "timestamp_updated": 1616948412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89260570": {"recommendationid": "89260570", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966612994", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1616969609}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Metroidvania I've played in a while.

Much like the last game Team Ladybug developed, Luna Nights, the game is developed with several \"gimmicks\" in mind. The first, and more important, being the elemental system with Deedlit able to change her alignment, and thus resistances as well as damage type, on the fly. Other elements can be accessed via magic or certain weapons that have specific built in elemental alignments that Deedlit cannot override. There are more differences between the two, such as a hover or a different slide, but both remain useful for a few reasons. The second gimmick is the bow that, as shown in the trailer, can be aimed, and is used for traversal by manipulating certain objects.\n\nThe game has most of its fundamentals done well. There are a few cheap enemies, but generally the game plays fair. Deedlit has the ability to attack at odd angles, and has a pretty fast attack even with the slowest speed weapons. You have multiple upgrades, spells and there are some decently unique weapons to interest you, more so on the bow side such as homing arrows, multi shot and the like. While the early game is pretty easy, later bosses can provide a decent challenge. While not a fundamental, it does bear mentioning that the animation on everything is very good.\n\nUnfortunately, while the enemies play fair, they gave a bit too much to Deedlit so it is far too easy for her to break the game. I did expect this, it is a Team Ladybug game, but it bears mentioning. The elemental system means that if you have the right magic or weapon for the job, you can absolutely devastate even the last boss. The two elements that Deedlit has access to are not exactly equal in terms of useful abilities. The wind hover is incredibly useful for traversal and combat both; while the fire ground slide is entirely combat related and it isn't as flexible. There are very few traversal abilities, and only the hover really stands out. There is not that much backtracking for a metroidvania. The bosses are somewhat disappointing; taken on their own they are each fine. The problem lies with the fact that many share movesets and some are repeated a bit too much and in a short time frame. The only show stopper boss would be the last boss. The game is also very short.\n\nTL;DR: Pretty good fundamentals, and takes advantage of what it does differently.

Not enough secrets, exploration, or backtracking. Feels quite linear.\n\nThe Long Version:\n    The comparisons to Symphony are valid. Deed's sprite seems to almost be a 1 for 1 rip from Alucard's (just with some obvious enough differences to differentiate the two) and a few of the melee weapon animations (the 2h swords in particular) are nearly identical to Soma's. There's enough gothic architecture here to give a 90's rave some envy. Magic, weapons, powerups... The whole shebang.\n\nThat being said...\n\n    Wonder Labyrinth really shines when its focusing on its core mechanic: Wind and Fire spirit swapping. A lot of the challenges made the game feel like a metroidvania implementation of Ikaruga's light/dark system. This is a huge compliment, I think. It's hard to give the concept enough praise.  It's fun, it adds a nice dynamic element to combat, and it makes you think a bit more than usual.\n\n    Unfortunately by the end of the game there are some pretty big problems. It becomes clear about halfway through that many of the enemies start to repeat themselves (at least, their fighting patterns and \"roles\") and the Fire/Wind system hits a ceiling near the end once you get into the swing of how to use it. The elemental weakness system can also be a bit confusing if you're not paying attention to it, or if you're missing an elemental spell. Even worse is the layout. Sometimes it gets *really* repetitious. Lots of zig zags to make the most of the game map which get a bit old.\n\n    The time I did spend exploring and fighting was great though. It was a lot of fun backtracking to other spots and wondering what was next.  Too often I found myself going the \"right\" way though. The game's linearity really becomes a weakness about halfway through. There's almost a false sense of hope when see an obstacle and think \"Oh I need a powerup for that!\" Then the boss drops that powerup and you find a weapon in what turns out to be a small side room. Bit of a let down.\n\n    In sum, while the game is short it has some bright moments and some great conceptual leverage going for it. The linearity hurts... *a lot*... but it seems more like a one-time affair anyways. Enjoy playing it and relish in what it offers!

I'd also say fans of the franchise would like it too but I wouldn't know (although it makes me interested enough to want to see/read it).", "timestamp_created": 1616869122, "timestamp_updated": 1616869122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534883737564086914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89200400": {"recommendationid": "89200400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047275961", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1629631181}, "language": "english", "review": "Wasted potential, because of quantity of little annoying things that you need to deal with.\nChanging elemental colors while being in middle od fight is so unnoticeable, map is unreadable, hate interface/inventory menagement.

This was the first time in the game I used a single potion to save my life cause I was so close to beating it and I didn't want to start over.\n\nThat's about where the good points end.\n\nThe bad points:\n- It's insanely short, my playtime of ~5 hours includes roughly 30-45 minutes of afk time where I forgot to turn off the game and I beat the full game in that time. I didn't go back after beating the game to find all the hidden rooms and the likes.\n\n- It's so easy you could probably beat this game with your eyes closed. None of the bosses really offer a challenge, spamming attack and occasionally dodging out of the way of an attack will win you a fight in no time. If you want to win faster you spam magic and just melt a boss.\n\n- The vast array of weapons you have are all incredibly bland, they have some fun flavor texts that make you think \"whoa this weapon sounds awesome! I wonder what it does!\" only to find out it's just another weapon you have probably already swung before with a different look and increased stats this time. \n\n- The powers you get are incredibly underused, I never felt like I needed specific power to beat a boss. The first boss in the game sets the stage a bit where you have to float with wind and dodge an attack which was quite fun. That's the last time you have to use that in a boss fight. Although there is 1 exception to this rule, see good points^.\n\n- The visual clarity in boss fights is [b]HORRIBLE[/b] with all the screen shake and effects going around and the fact you fight a lot of humanoid bosses so if you are hitting the boss with melee you get this effect over the boss so you can't see what the boss is doing.....at all.\n\nNow this next one is a personal issue of mine that not everyone might have.\nThere is a few boss fights where the background changes to this green \"tube\" that you are moving through and that effect is absolute garbage. It triggered my motion sickness like no tomorrow and it was just the worst effect ever for an action game boss fight.\n\nNow you might be wondering why I would still recommend this game? Despite so many negative points vs only a few good points. I still had fun playing the game and I bought it for 8 euro's(which was still too much for the playtime I got out of it but not for the fun I got out of it).\nI cannot recommend this game for full price ever, wait for a sale to around 5-8 and it's good enough to blow an evening or 2 on. \n\nIf you want a better game by this dev team buy their Touhou game, Touhou Luna Nights, it's cheaper, longer and has far more fun and engaging boss fights(I played this on game pass that's why it's not in my steam library)", "timestamp_created": 1616855482, "timestamp_updated": 1616855539, "voted_up":

The combat and movement is really fluid and fun, along with the elements system incorporating a better layered gameplay experience. This was certainly a game worth purchasing if you enjoy the genre. It's easily becoming one of my favorite games in the genre; It's fun, it's challenging, and combat and traversing the map feel satisfying\n\n[b]The good:[/b]\nI thought the overall controllability of the character felt great. An early tell for a game is about how good it feels to move around and it felt fluid when moving throughout the levels.\n\nThe music and sound engineering was satisfying and suited the game well. I have no complaints about it and enjoyed the music for each area.\n\n[u]Combat[/u]\n The combat and movement had me onboard. The variance in weapon strikes in combination with the wind form's glide allowed for good choices of attack angles and allowed for some variance in style for approaching enemy encounters overall. In addition to this, the magic system creates more variance in combat style for the player, which is always a good thing. After much exploration, you can discover powerups for your fire/wind forms as well as unlocking new elemental spells, which enriches the flavor of the enemy weakness strategy during combat\n\nAdditionally, the boss fights and combat in general felt satisfying and boss fights felt genuinely difficult in moments with so much stuff happening on the screen.\n\nElemental swapping: \nI felt this was a great mechanic for this game. implementing swapping to drain enemy moves or avoid resists enabled me to have to think on a lot on the fly.\n", "timestamp_created": 1616277375, "timestamp_updated": 1617171511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88777579": {"recommendationid": "88777579", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971188791", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1616259639}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a poor clone of sotn... there are better offers out there", "timestamp_created": 1616259703, "timestamp_updated": 1616259703, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.303164422512054443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88729789": {"recommendationid": "88729789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000143032", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1616717676}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

This is an excellent try at mimicking the magic of an older Castlevania, but it's not quite there. It looks and feels the same, but after completing level 4 thus finishing the pre-release version, it's just not as fun. The maps look too similar. The enemies are not as interesting and lack variety. There's a lot less weapons, magic, and items, with almost no hidden items inside walls (no turkey legs hidden in a wall). And the lore, eh, it's okay. It's about elves. It's not gothic, or dark, or scary. Still it's not bad, it's just not as good as its obvious target. \n\nOn a positive note though, it does bring something NEW to the table. The game has a very unique and fun, fire or water/air element system, where you can switch between the two giving you different actions and interactions. With fire selected, you attacks are ignited, and you can pass through walls of fire or fire attacks. Water/air is the same except it also allows you to hover. They both also have gauges that fill-up the more  you don't get hit, and once at level 3, will restore health. This all makes for a system where you are constantly switching to match you situation, and it plays out very well. \n\nAnd while that element system is a great idea and implemented perfectly, the lack of variety in enemies, stuff you use, and levels brings it down.", "timestamp_created": 1615938277, "timestamp_updated": 1615938277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88544769": {"recommendationid": "88544769", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023984550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1617038233}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun game, I love this IP but the game is quite good too.  the spirit mechanic reminds me a little of Ikaruga and the arrow puzzles are kind of neat.

I liked the atmosphere and IP. \n\nI absolutely loved the archery challenge. Probably the best part of the game and certainly the hardest. It took me a while to get S rank (an hour? maybe 30 minutes) but it was a really fun and interesting challenge. It seemed impossible at first but it's not, you just have to get good at it and you can in a reasonable amount of time. 10/10 minigame imo. \n\nIt's also really cool that you get the best bow in the game from it. \n\nI wish there were more things like that.\n\n[h1]Problems:[/h1]\n\nThere is no real replayability. It's very much a play through once and done type of experience. I think the game would have been better off with a more hardcore element of gameplay where you have to start again (without saves maybe? but that would be brutal) but with more variability such as skill builds or RNG items and RNG maps to create a replayable experience. \n\nIt'd be fine if the story length was at least 10-20 hours but I finished it in 4 hours played. It's really too short. They're adding two stages this month and I will play them but even then, that'll be an extra hour or two max I imagine. \n\n I would LOVE a reason to play the game again. There just isn't one. \n\nIt's also a bit too easy. They've definitely made an effort to make the game hard. You have to give them credit for that and I do. Especially the boss fights. They're fun to play for sure but since the attacks are all patterns, you can learn them (some are harder than others) and then once you've beaten the boss you never play it again and it's just kinda forgotten. Again, going back to the lack of replayability issue.\n\nIt's not like I never died. I died a fair amount being sloppy and dumb but it's still rather easy for a few reasons.\n\n* It's easy to get 'overgeared' and kill most creatures in a few hits before they get an attack off. I just brute forced most of the game due to the high damage. \n\n* Mobs take way too long to cast their spells. It'd be a lot better if there was almost no delay and your screen filled with elemental orbs. Some creatures cast spells that you can't avoid with your elements which is why I think they've chosen to not fill the screen. If however, all creatures did either fire or wind damage, then you could have as much action on the screen as you want because switching between elements is very seamless. The mechanic is somewhat wasted for that reason and the overall combat experience was more disappointing than the trailer made it out to be. This and the lack of replayability are my biggest complaints. \n\n* You can chug potions while stunned. It's expensive but since you don't really care about your money in this game. I only bought the sword at the beginning for 900 (huge upgrade) and another sword for the model to do the firestorm hack.\n\n* Magic is OP. I used the invisibility spell to cheese the last boss fight (currently it's the dark elf) but the damage is also quite high. At least invisibility shouldn't work on boss stages.

Because the game is so short, you come across new weapons and abilities very quickly. And you just feel overpowered early on. There are lots of save points, so maybe lowering the delay for enemies to start attacking you. Most of the time you can just walk up and mash through them before they get a chance to attack.\n- The level design is an actual labyrinth. Reminded me of the original Zelda, you have to constantly look at the map.\n- When you boot the game, you're greeted with an unintuitive white option screen.\n- Not much story wise. NPC drops some vague line about destiny or love and protagonist is like \"Wha?\".

I'm going to double down on the whole theme of SoTN vs Record of Lodoss War (RoLW), and give you an idea of how it stacks up against that feeling of nostalgia since I was a big fan of SoTN, too.\n\n[b] TL;DR [/b] : It's great, buy it. It's more complex than SoTN, but the feeling of exploration is there, with a bit of a puzzle element, and the combat is tight. Mechanics of the game are well-implemented, very creative, and everything feels like it'll give your brain a squeeze. Plus there's lots of weapons to use (and collect, for you hoarders), and challenging and varied enemies to fight against. If you don't like lots of things going on during combat, this -might- put you off, but it should really be a non-issue. However, one note: it is a short game; maybe 7-8 hours if you're very fast, but easily more if you play without any hurry. Then again, if you're really dedicated, you could finish SoTN in one day, too.\n\n[h1] Overview: [/h1]\nGameplay: 9/10\nBGM: 7/10\nAudio: 9/10\nUI: 7/10\nArt direction: 11/10 \n\nRoLW (SoTN comparison): \n(Note: This comparison may seem a bit negative, but when you compare anything to SoTN, very few things will excel it. See below for more nuanced views.)\n\n[b] + [/b] Lots of options and flexibility for engaging in combat, e.g. angle of attacks, range, slide, magic [i] (relatively simple, left and right weapons, spells, transformation, most of which are unnecessary to master except the now-well-known double-attack when jumping or landing) [/i]\n\n[b] +/- [/b] You NEED to keep those complexities in mind or you do no damage [i] (you could get by quite easily with standard damage. No such thing for RoLW.) [/i]\n\n[b] + [/b] But it does mean that it rewards skillful play [i] (SoTN is mostly \"basic\" maneuvering skill) [/i]\n\n[b] + [/b] Lots of weapons [i] (SoTN really has far more) [/i]\n\n[b] + [/b] A variety of move sets, and you can see the design change for most [i] (Might actually have fewer) [/i]\n\n[b] - [/b] Not many equipment types, limited to melee and ranged weapons [i] (SoTN has 2 weapons, head, chest, cape, and two rings.) [/i]\n\n[b] + [/b] Fluid, slick, and absolutely updated animations [i] (SoTN still looks very good, though dated; but can't really compare, because RoLW's is just so smooth) [/i]\n\n[b] + [/b] Map aesthetics are gorgeous [i] (SoTN, though with dated graphics, does feel like the foreground and background are better designed, and they tell a story.) [/i]\n\n[b] - [/b] Maps can be a bit tight, and not as much variety. There's also no discernible separation between the areas. [i] (SoTN has huge rooms with high and grand ceilings for some, cramped spaces for others; it's also got a somewhat spaced out layout, so you can tell which parts of the maps are what. Good Metroidvanias tend to do that as well; Vigil: The Longest Night and Hollow Knight are two that come to mind.) [/i]\n\n[b] + [/b] Huge enemy variety [i] (Just based on per-map basis; overall, SoTN has far more) [/i]\n\n[b] - [/b] Theme for the map and BGM doesn't gel as well as SoTN's [i] (Think of the Library! And the Royal Chapel! They're absolutely haunting.) [/i]\n\n[b] +/- [/b] BGM is good, but not entirely noteworthy\n\n[b] + [/b] Sound design is good, with satisfying swing, hit, fall and kill sounds. [i] (But does not have the variety that SoTN has; think of the death-cries of all the enemies ) [/i]\n\n[b] - [/b] Relatively short [i] (SoTN's reverse castle easily gives dozens of hours for completionists.) [/i]\n\n[b] +++ [/b] Is out on Steam (WHY IS SoTN STILL NOT ON STEAM, KONAMI? WHY????)\n\n[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]\n\nNaturally, this will be the largest part of the review, since I think it is what a game is primarily about.\nOne huge departure from SoTN in terms of gameplay is the complexity of combat itself. If you've just come from playing SoTN, it will immediately feel like there's a whole lot more going into the game. Here are some additions they've made:\n\n1.) Ability to swing at an angle\n2.) Access to a bow you can aim!\n3.) Easy-to-access magic\n4.) Elemental resistances/weaknesses being far more prominent\n\nDeedlit, unlike Alucard, has the ability to actually swing at extreme angles, whether jumping or standing still. This lends itself to far more flexibility, but it also makes moving a little more complex, since if you want to attack at a diagonal angle, you need to be careful of not accidentally moving into your enemy. \n\nThe other huge added complexity is with the \"elements\" system. If you switch to the wrong element, you can't do damage to the enemy. But if the enemy projectile is the same element as you are, you recover mana and don't get damage. Different elements also give you different abilities (i.e. hovering or invincible slide). In this way, RoLW is far more punishing than SoTN if you don't think about what you're using. \n\nThat being said, because of the way the element system works (and how you can gain mana from absorbing enemy attacks), you can use your bow and spells more often! Switching between spells is pretty easy, but it gets crowded eventually since it shares a menu with items.\n\nBut there is one complication: element \"levels\". I won't go into details, but if you get damaged, this level goes down, and your damage drops drastically, forcing you to be more careful. Your spells will thankfully do the same amount of damage regardless of that level, but it really becomes a struggle and can be quite discouraging to get damaged.\n\nThere is something that needs exceptional note here: The enemy variety. This is the one thing that matches SoTN so well, and depending on how many more stages there are, might even exceed it. It may be hard for Deedlit to compete with SoTN in terms of sheer enemy variety, but for the maps released, it's doing very well; you do meet the same enemies quite a few times over a few maps, but before you know it, you'll have something new to challenge you again. Very nice. Level design is great, too; challenging, a bit of a puzzle, and eventually as you get more tools, gives you options on how to approach your battles.\n\nCombat summary: So combat could be a bit of a neutral: If you enjoy something more cerebral than SoTN, then this is for you; if not, then you might suffer a little and not enjoy it as much. SoTN was great because there wasn't too much going on, and your equipment build and basic movement skills would be enough to carry you to the end of the game; Deedlit requires much, much more.\n\n[h1] BGM: [/h1]\nThe SoTN soundtrack might be my favorite of all games; and sadly, Deedlit is unable to dethrone the king. The BGM itself is very good, but lacks the thematic tie-in to the level that SoTN had which made it so impactful. It's very serviceable, but it won't be walking-into-the-library-with-baroque-harpsichord levels of goodness. Individually, they are all good; some are even memorable. But if you come from SoTN, you may not find that this game's soundtrack will scratch that itch. Personally, I find that this might be the weakest part of the game, but it's a very subjective thing, and perhaps it just needs time to grow on a person.\n\n[h1] Audio: [/h1]\nBut that leads straight into sound design. The sound for this game is pretty juicy. It has nice woosh when you swing, booming and snappy explosions when you kill stuff, and the little details of foot steps when you land, gusts of wind when you hover, all sound great. However, I can't help but feel it doesn't quite have the same variety of sounds as SoTN did when you killed things: bloody zombies gurgle and spit blood, medusa heads disappear in a puff, armours roar and fall to the ground with a few drawn-out explosions, marionettes giggled as they moved, and crystal maidens screamed as they shattered in pieces. It was a cacophany of screeching things in SoTN, and Deedlit doesn't quite live up to that. That being said, it's by no means mediocre, and it's still an excellent example of sounds that feel good.", "timestamp_created": 1615296102, "timestamp_updated": 1615772003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 113, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839336395263671875", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88087493": {"recommendationid": "88087493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006536237", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1618007508}, "language": "english", "review": "Without a doubt one of the most refreshing return to form Symphony of the Night experiences you could ever hope for.", "timestamp_created": 1615220765, "timestamp_updated": 1615220765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87993154": {"recommendationid": "87993154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136530890", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1617311152}, "language": "english", "review": "I cried of nostalgia and happiness.", "timestamp_created": 1615085834, "timestamp_updated": 1615085834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461334168910980225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87950471": {"recommendationid": "87950471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295702903", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1619500758}, "language": "english", "review": "wow", "timestamp_created": 1615032635, "timestamp_updated": 1615032635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435537338256835938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87938074": {"recommendationid": "87938074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046530988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 836, "last_played": 1625384708}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty close the SOTN, but I'd say a tad easier, linear and smaller.

For those are not familiar with the anime or it's characters, it's not necessary to know who they are to enjoy this game, although the source material is worth checking out.\nThe gameplay is very similar to that of Castlevania Symphony of the Night, especially with the combat, amazing music, and presentation. However, even if there are elements similar to Symphony, there are elements like bullet hell, switching between wind and fire to take down certain enemies, and only using your save areas/ potions bought via the dwarf merchant, as the only ways to fully recover health. With these conditions, it gives the player a challenging experience, but the difficulty wasn't that overwhelming for me.\nOver the course of this early access game, you'll come across different types of swords/ primary weapons as well as bows and spells for long range combat. You'll find yourself switching between your bow and primary weapon regularly and spells taking care of large amounts of enemies on screen. With the weapon system, it's easy to get used to the controls if you stick with it and it isn't complicated for new players. Also Deedlit gets a slide attack and a spiral arrow move like Cammy from Street Fighter later in the game.\nWhile I know this game is in early access, with what's been presented to me, I'm looking forward to future updates and am glad to have discovered this game. I admit, for me, there is nostalgia here. But beyond the source material, what is presented here is a promising work in progress. \n", "timestamp_created": 1614830328, "timestamp_updated": 1614830328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87650517": {"recommendationid": "87650517", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988433474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1622114137}, "language": "english", "review": "big boneyard", "timestamp_created": 1614577042, "timestamp_updated": 1614577042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87625428": {"recommendationid": "87625428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014293846", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1684868069}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No hay mucho que decir, te gusto castlevania symphony of the night?, eres fan del universo de Record of lodoss war, que haces que a\u00fan no lo tienes.\nUn bonito pixelart y  unas mec\u00e1nicas bien dise\u00f1adas nada innovadoras pero funcionan perfectamente, como \u00fanica pega quiz\u00e1s la dificultad quiz\u00e1s demasiado sencillo para algunos.\n", "timestamp_created": 1614538024, "timestamp_updated": 1614539365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87555087": {"recommendationid": "87555087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174281859", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 1244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1630485039}, "language": "english", "review": "More Symphony of the Night than Bloodstained is, metroidvania must-have", "timestamp_created": 1614446647, "timestamp_updated": 1614446647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385273963212966919", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87494579": {"recommendationid": "87494579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041770463", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1614282945}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't know this was a franchise [b] and that's a good thing.
