You take control of a little mouse, named Quill, as she navigates through environments that are reminiscent of human ones (mines, gardens, castles) but are cutely scaled down to mouse sized. Meanwhile, you use your controller to manipulate the environment to help her out. The gameplay is mostly simple environmental puzzles with some simple combat that can admittedly be annoying but is not anything too taxing or stressful. The game is short and fairly easy but it looks great with some nice environments and lighting, but where it really shines is Quill's animation. She's super expressive and it really adds a lot of charm to the game.

It has strong [I]Trine[/I] energy, but is not as compelling. Play [I]Moss[/I] for the amazing visual design, but keep your expectations low for just about everything else. This is the unfortunate situation of state-of-the-art in VR gaming.\n\nNote that this is just half of the game. You will need to buy [I]Moss: Book II[/I] to get a complete experience. Consider if that's worth the cost for you.\n\n[I]Moss[/I] tells its story as a fairy tale read out loud to a child from a book. This conceit is a bit charming but is elaborated ad nauseam. The cut scenes are way too long, and generally narration throughout the game mimics an adult \"doing the voices\" for a kid before bedtime, instead of having characters speak as themselves and having a distinct personality. This tedious format is made worse by an incoherent, plodding story, lackluster writing, and humdrum voice acting. Something about heroes and treasure and villains and saving the world. I honestly couldn't even summarize it to you. It's like a Pixar film we pretend didn't exist.\n\nHowever, the visual presentation makes these clich\u00e9s worthwhile. For one, the level design is very well tuned to both VR technology and the story's subject matter. It's designed as if you're looking into a doll house, and of course it kinda is one: a world for tiny animals. It's simply wonderful to peer into this miniature universe, to stand up and look above and behind walls and corners for secrets and details. Though the textures and lighting are very simple compared to AAA productions, the understated cartoonish qualty is immersive and suitable. I especially appreciate the excellent character and monster animations. Because the writing drains the characters of life, the animation must do the heavy lifting, and it does so well enough. The protagonist is adorable and the highlight of the game.\n\nSo how does it play? It starts slow and trivial, but does become more engaging later on, with a few moderately challenging puzzles and combat situations, especially in [I]Chapter II[/I]. It's all .. fine. Unfortunately, controls for the many 3D platforming situations won't orient quite as you think they should and so it's too easy to fall and die. Luckily for that, the price of death is low in [I]Moss[/I]. It's all quite casual.\n\nShould you buy it? First, consider that you will likely also buy [I]Moss: Book II[/I]. Both games provide a wonderful showcase for VR gaming.

The game is all done through seated VR play and you help guide your little mouse friend through the areas on a quest to defeat evil.  Some of the controls on the Vive weren't super clear at first and took a little experimenting to figure out, like pressing left on the right touch pad swings the sword or uses a switch and pressing right on right touch pad jumps.  Combat isn't too hard, though it's definitely more challenging later on in the game.  Combat generally takes place in \"combat arenas\" where the exits will be blocked by flames until you clear out the enemies or in rare instances, trigger whatever switch needs to be triggered.  The ability of the player to semi-control 1 enemy is an interesting mechanic and also leads to some nice puzzles.  The puzzles in the game aren't all that difficult to figure out and are largely environmental things like moving platforms around for your mouse friend.  There was one puzzle room near the end that I got stuck in briefly until I figured out that things just need to be done in a very specific order, otherwise there weren't any show stoppers that require looking up a guide at any point in the game.  There's lots of secret scrolls hidden throughout the levels for completionists to hunt around for, I haven't found all of them as of this review, though I'm likely to give at least one more try to see if I can find the rest.  The voice acting for the story narrator is good and fits the theme well.  The full game took me just under 4 hours to finish a run with what looked like maybe 75-80% of the hidden scrolls located.  It's definitely worth a look if you like adventure games with some action.

This is [i]brilliant![/i]\n\nMost VR games have YOU be the protagonist of the video game (which VR is almost tailor made for, of course), but in Moss, you are NOT the main protagonist, but merely an observer of the story unfolding before you. You are what's known as a \"Reader\", and you embody this ethereal creature that watches the story of the little mouse Quill unfold before your eyes. You control Quill with your controllers, and she can do the basic running and jumping, climbing walls, attacking and dodging that you're used to from most platforming games. But what Moss does in addition to this is that YOU can influence the scene and help Quill by physically interacting with the world around her, and aid in her quest, like moving platforms that would be too large for a small mouse to move, or imbue her sword with magic, or heal her if her health is low. You can also take control of certain enemies if they become too dangerous for Quill to handle, and lead them elsewhere so Quill can reposition or heal.\n\n[b]The story[/b] of Quill is a simple one, but it's very well told, and told in a very unique way, something I haven't really seen anywhere else before, which probably makes it stand out so much in my mind. Quill's uncle has been captured by the villains of the story and taken to a faraway castle, and it is up to Quill to go and save him with the aid of the \"reader\" and a few other colorful characters along the way. You will face many mechanical enemies that look like beetles, and go through various mouse-sized catacombs, mines, and villages on your way.\n\nThe only nitpick I have about the game would probably be the length of the game. It is not very long and can be completed in a handful of hours, even if you go full completionist and want to find all the secret collectibles. But again, it's mostly a nitpick, because if the only \"bad\" thing you can say about something is that you want [i]more[/i] of it, then is it really a bad thing?\n\nPerformance-wise there were a few areas where my machine started to stutter uncontrollably, but this was fixed by lowering the graphics quality from High to Medium.

I love platformers, but I personally could not enjoy Moss's overly child-friendly to story-telling. The narration style feels as if you're being treated like a child, and the game doesn't really provide anything else for you to learn about the world outside of that. This works well for keeping things simple, but it also raises the question of why was this a VR title when there's nothing to really make it feel like a VR experience outside of the viewing mode itself - I was hoping for more engaging things to do or interact with overall. The last (small) thing I found a bit annoying is your hands are far too large & shiny which was incredibly distracting when you're trying to appreciate the beautiful environments. Also, I'm not sure why, but the whole game was a bit uncannily blurry.

Yo era uno de los esc\u00e9pticos de que la VR b\u00e1sicamente solo se justificaba para primera persona... pero despu\u00e9s de jugar a Moss (y alg\u00fan otro), queda demostrado que es un error garrafal tener ese pensamiento.\n\nEl juego dura unas 5 horas m\u00e1ximo, por lo que pese a que no es muy largo, tampoco es una \"experiencia Vr\". Es decir, es un juego hecho y derecho. Hay que decir que el juego realmente se juega sentado (de hecho es el \u00fanico videojuego VR que he jugado sentado), fundamentalmente porque es la altura correcta para ver los escenarios \"correctamente\", si jugamos de pies veremos los escenarios desde un \u00e1ngulo \"inc\u00f3modo\" y tendr\u00edamos que jugar mirando hacia abajo. No obstante, el juego nos invitar\u00e1 a menudo a levantarnos e inspeccionar los escenarios y verlos desde otro \u00e1ngulo.\nEn el juego interpretamos a un lector de un libro, una especie de cuento de hadas cual \"Historia Interminable\", cuyos protagonistas son una ratona llamada Quill (aunque a m\u00ed me suena a nombre masculino XD) que encuentra un cristal m\u00e1gico mediante el cual \"ve\" a una especie de ente ancestral, el cual encarnamos nosotros y es desde el punto de vista que el jugador ver\u00e1 el juego.\nCon el Stick izquierdo controlaremos a Quill, con los botones derechos del mando de Rift S golpearemos con la espada y saltaremos para las plataformas, finalmente con los sensores de movimiento interactuaremos con Quill en diferentes situaciones de la aventura. Hay que decir que aunque el juego es impresionante de principio a fin, la interactuaci\u00f3n con Quill la esperaba mayor. Es decir, el juego realmente si quisiesen hacerle en plano sin controles de VR realmente ser\u00eda f\u00e1cil de portear, pues lo que son las caracter\u00edsticas de control de la realidad virtual tampoco es que se usen en exceso, eso s\u00ed, ser\u00eda much\u00edsimo menos impresionante el juego.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos como ocurre siempre con la VR, visto desde el visor, parece literalmente otro juego, da igual las fotos y videos que ve\u00e1is del juego... cuando os pon\u00e9is el visor no tiene nada que ver, una maravilla.\nMenci\u00f3n especial al trabajo INCRE\u00cdBLE de los animadores para la ratona Quill, porque es de las mejores animaciones que he visto en tiempo. Por ejemplo, dependiendo de hacia donde golpeemos, las animaciones cambian totalmente. Han puesto much\u00edsimo mimo en esto, y evidentemente no se han creado con captura de movimientos.\nLa banda sonora y el doblaje al ingl\u00e9s est\u00e1 muy bien, todo el doblaje lo hace la misma actriz poniendo voces caricaturizadas de los diferentes personajes (como si nos estuviesen leyendo un cuento)\n\nEn definitiva, si sois usuarios de VR, o ten\u00e9is pensado pasaros a esta tecnolog\u00eda en un futuro, este juego es IMPRESCINDIBLE. A ver si la 2\u00ba parte (llamada Book 2) sale pronto en PC, porque es de los mejores juegos que hay para la VR.\n", "timestamp_created": 1659042221, "timestamp_updated": 1659042221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636209487915039063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119617064": {"recommendationid": "119617064", "author": {"steamid": "76561199129977385", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1659034257}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally picked this up 4 years after release because I kept hearing how good it was.

Moss is a VR puzzle adventure platformer but unlike most of VR games it is played from a third person perspective - which turns out to be your own perspective.\n\nThe game starts with you reading a book introducing you a fairy tale like story, eventually taking you into the story itself. Moss is a fully narrated story that makes you part of it. You play as Quill, a cute little mouse, full of enthusiasm. She finds a shard that calls a human sized ghost-like masked creature, a guardian angel of sort. This being is also you. You watch over Quill as she goes on her journey to save her uncle and the kingdom from an evil fire-breathing serpent.\n\nMoss is a simple game that requires a bit of platforming. You control Quill and walk her through beautifully crafted environments that are joy to look at. The environments are single scenes and you have to walk from the place you appeared to the other end of the environment. Sometimes you can just freely walk through but mostly you have to solve an environmental puzzle to get to the other side. These get more and more complex as you progress and they require the intervention of you as the guardian. In the later stages of the game they can also span several 'scenes' and not just one.\n\nYou control Quill with joystick and buttons to jump and attack like in a traditional game. The guardian though has 'hands' - blue orbs. Those are where your motion controllers are so you can reach with them and physically move objects around, stall enemies, drag them around. You can also pet the mouse on the head, high-five her when she presents a hand or heal her when she takes damage by holding her for a while. You can even spook her if you wish to. It truly feels like you are a magical being doing magic.\n\nThere is some combat but it is fairly simple. At first you just hack at the enemies but later on you will find you that you can stall enemies, move them around (so they explode elsewhere), you can even shoot with the enemies you currently hold in your blue-orb hand. In some areas of the game there will be big fights requiring you to multitask a bit with both of your hands while still moving Quill around (stalling an enemy while controlling Quill and attacking the held enemy for example). This most probably is not necessary but adds more depth to the game and to me it felt natural.\n\nMoss is a game that is about immersion and they did an excellent job at that. The game proves that in order to be immersed in a game you don't need a first person view. The environments are rich and beautiful and I spent a lot of time just looking around and waiting for things to happen. I was so curious that I also spend some time walking around and peeking around every corner. This way I also found out that there are hidden items you can collect (scrolls) that are often somewhere where they are either hard to reach or they are hidden if you are just sitting in the middle of the scene.\n\nThe sound is also excellent. There is everything you'd expect and the sound is also 3d. The sound effects are well chosen and they seem to be real be it a turning of a heavy page from the story book at the beginning, Quill's squeaks or her steps. You will hear background noises perfectly matching the environments (or not because it will feel so natural). Stop and listen to the sounds. You will discover how well the sound was done.\n\nVerdict: Moss is a game that provides a unique experience that only VR can deliver. Moss is one of the most immersive games I played even when the game is played from a third perspective. The gameplay is on the simple side but it also means that the Moss is a great game to introduce people to VR and gaming in general. The only downside is that the game is rather short. You can finish the game in 3 hours and be little bit disappointed in how suddenly it ends. If you enjoyed this game and crave for more there is a sequel already out for Playstation VR and soon to be released for Quest.", "timestamp_created": 1652016919, "timestamp_updated": 1652016919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115152033": {"recommendationid": "115152033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099630729", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1652025233}, "language": "spanish", "review": "best vr game, so far", "timestamp_created": 1652014442, "timestamp_updated": 1652014442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115125746": {"recommendationid": "115125746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011293667", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1698433370}, "language": "english", "review": "It's billed as a \"you can do this sitting\".

Seriously, in my opinion, the one just can't be too old for a good fairy tale. Exactly the opposite. We all need one from time to time. And that's, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly what we've got here. A carefully crafted fairy tale made with a lot of love. Which is... kinda surprising. I mean, even though [b]Moss[/b] is [b]Polyarc, Inc.[/b]'s very first game, the guys are far from being amateurs. Exactly the opposite. [b]Polyarc[/b] is a small team that started with some ex-[b]BUNGiE[/b] employees. [b]Moss[/b] is a child of [b]Richard Lico[/b], who's known for [b]3D[/b] models he made for games like [b]HALO 3: ODST[/b], [b]HALO: Reach[/b] and [b]Destiny[/b] series. Talking about [b]Destiny[/b], by the way. A lot of [b]Destiny[/b] guys here. [b]Chris Alderson[/b], [b]Mike Jensen[/b], [b]Corinne Scrivens[/b], [b]James Yavorsky[/b], [b]Stephen Hodde[/b], [b]Tam Armstrong[/b], [b]Danny Bulla[/b], [b]Tam Armstrong[/b], [b]Brendan Walker[/b]... They're all here. Graphic designers, [b]3D[/b] artists, sound designers, programmers...\n\nDon't expect [b]Moss[/b] to be anything like [b]Destiny[/b], though. Or like any other [b]BUNGiE[/b] title out there. Like I said, [b]Moss[/b] is a fairy tale. Remember when [b]Ron Gilbert[/b] and [b]Shelley Day[/b] quit [b]LucasArts[/b] to start telling kids their own stories in games like [b]Putt-Putt[/b], [b]Pajama Sam[/b] and the others? That's pretty much what we have here. Some big guys quit [b]BUNGiE[/b] to tell us a fairy tale. While controlling a young mouse called [b]Quill[/b], we should face a lot of dangers in order to save our uncle. And the atmosphere-wise? It's brilliant. Imagine [b]Hanna-Barbera[/b]'s [b]Once Upon a Forest[/b] mixed with the prologue part from [b]Nintendo[/b]'s [b]The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past[/b] and a slight aftertaste of [b]Majora's Mask[/b]. That's pretty much how [b]Moss[/b] feels. Sure, there isn't much going on in this game, but the attention to details? It's absolutely fantastic. [b]Quill[/b] is an [i]incredibly[/i] cute character and thanks to how she's perfectly animated... No, seriously, she's so cute you'll want to hug her. Wait... you actually can! Thanks to how [b]Moss[/b] is a proper [b]VR[/b] title, you can actually pet [b]Quill[/b], give her high fives and so on. [i]Cuteness overload![/i]\n\nBut of course, it isn't just about [b]Quill[/b]. I don't know about you, but personally, I always had a very special place in my heart for stories about tiny creatures in the big world. Books, cartoons, video games... Everything \u2013 from [b]Astrid Lindgren[/b]'s [b]Nils Karlsson Pyssling[/b] to [b]Honey, I Shrunk the Kids[/b], [b]Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers[/b] and [b]Pikmin[/b]. I love it all. And [b]Moss[/b]? It captures that certain atmosphere perfectly. I didn't mention [b]Once Upon a Forest[/b] for nothing. [b]Moss[/b] is a game about unlikely little hero in a big world full of dangers. For me? It's more than enough to enjoy this game. But honestly, the good things don't end here.\n\nEvery level in this game is like a tiny little diorama that comes with a puzzle to solve and a secret or two. Reminds me a little bit of [b]Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker[/b]. I mean, even though gameplay-wise, [b]Moss[/b] is (way) closer to what we had in [b]CAPCOM[/b]'s [b]Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure[/b], every screen here looks like a handmade diorama you're free to explore. Doesn't sound that special and technically, it isn't (especially levels here are really, [i]really[/i] tiny), but as usual, [b]VR[/b] makes everything better. See, [b]VR[/b] here isn't only about juicy [b]3D[/b] with particles and stuff. In this game, you'll be able to look at diorama-like levels from different angles. And it's a very nice touch, since from time to time, you'll actually [i]need[/i] to change the angle, since some things here will be hidden behind the others.\n\nDon't expect [b]Moss[/b] to be too hard or complicated, though. Technically, it's even more simple than [b]Zack & Wiki[/b]. It's a very basic game that the entire family will be able to enjoy. It's pretty short too. Well, not [i]too[/i] short (four hours of gameplay is not really [i]that[/i] bad for [b]$29.99 VR[/b] title), but still, it's short and the latest update that added some sort of a hidden levels that you can access by finding secret entrances, doesn't really help much. My biggest complain, though, is the fact that... this game ends with the cliffhanger. Sure, [b]Polyarc[/b] are already working on the next chapter (you can easily find its trailer on [b]YouTube[/b]), but honestly, \u201cto be continued in the next game\u201d is not... what I like seeing in [b]$29.99[/b] game that doesn't even have \u201cEpisode I\u201d in its title. Doesn't look fair to me. Especially since there's no [b]100%[/b] guarantee that the sequel won't end up being a lifetime [b]PlayStation[/b] exclusive (I'm not trying to say that there's something wrong with the exclusives, but buying yet another helmet just to be able to learn about how things end is not... really a good idea). I can deal with the short game, but at least, give me a proper finale, will you?\n\nAnd still, [b]Moss[/b] is a beautiful game. And while it's far from being the most complicated [b]VR[/b] experience I ever had (the entire game is just that \u2013 a set of cute, yet basic puzzles, mixed with some [b]Zelda[/b]-like battles), it's sure one of the cutest ones. Probably [i]the[/i] cutest one. That certain feeling I had when I saw [b]Link[/b] waking up at stormy night, hearing [b]Princess Zelda[/b] calling for him, asking him to save her from evil [b]Agahnim[/b], who trapped her in the castle's dungeon? That certain feeling is totally here, in this game. [b]Moss[/b] is cute, [b]Moss[/b] is charming and all in all, [b]Moss[/b] is, like, a perfect fairy tale for the entire family.\n\n[b]P.S.[/b] A couple of technical details. [b]Steam[/b] version of the game supports three different headsets \u2013 [b]Oculus Rift[/b], [b]HTC Vive[/b] and [b]Valve Index[/b]. [i]But[/i] if, like yours truly, you have [b]HTC Vive[/b], you're out of luck. Don't get me wrong, though. The game will work totally fine and you'll still be able to enjoy it, [i]but[/i] it looks like controls here were made for something more gamepad-like. Which means that [b]Oculis Rift[/b] and [b]Valve Index[/b] with their sticks would probably feel way better. It's not like [b]Moss[/b] is unplayable with [b]HTC Vive[/b] controllers, but... you know how it is. Those feel a bit messy in this game and you'll have a little bit more problems than needed with some achievements. Like the one that requires you to do things without dying. Again, it's impossible to die in this game completely (you have infinite tries and therefore can die as many times as you want), so, messy controls won't affect your playthrough [i]that[/i] much, but as long as you have a choice \u2013 go for something with sticks.\n\nThis game is also fully integrated into [b]SteamVR[/b] environment and finishing it will award you with a cute little [b]Quill[/b] prop. Personally, I love such stuff. Always thought that it deserved more attention. I mean, come on, [b]Valve[/b]! [b]SteamVR[/b] desperately needs an update! With more props, better [b]UI[/b] and more showcases! One way or another, though, since I think I can call myself a fan, I was really glad to put [b]Quill[/b] statue on my virtual shelf. Thanks for giving this game a proper treatment on [b]PC[/b], [b]Polyarc[/b]!

You feel as though you actually helped her and are sharing in this cute little mouse's victory.\n\nOne other note, and many may already know this or assume it from the sequel that is coming out, but it is a bit of a cliffhanger at the end.

It has a wonderful storybook aesthetic, a delightful main character, and breathtaking visuals, like my god do some of the shots look good (I'm getting ahead of myself. Put a pin in that for me if you don't mind.) Moss takes advantage of the strengths vr has while minimizing its disadvantages. For example, vr makes some people sick because of the locomotion, so there is no locomotion, the main character Quill does the moving for you. The game is a 3D puzzle platformer, a genre in which the biggest problem is a lack of depth perception, but that problem is solved by being in vr. Could it have been a screen game? Sure, I bet it would still be great, but here's the biggest advantage that vr has that Moss uses to it's fullest: The sense of scale. (remember that pin? we're just gonna pull that out.) Good lord, are the visuals of this game friggin' breathtaking. You start out in a forest, then go into a village with cute little houses going up the trees, and it really feels like something these mouse people would build and live in. Then you're reminded of the size when there's just a deer getting some water right in front of you. It doesn't even notice Quill, just slurping up some bog water. and finally, there's the castle, good lord the castle. It's hard to describe, because you can tell humans are too small to live in it, but it still just towers over you. Honestly, if you're immersed in this world, -and you will be- seeing that castle up close in the final chapter is something that rivals the citadel in Half life Alyx in a way that's hard to describe. I could go on and on about the visual splendor this game has, but seriously, if you own a vr headset, get this game now and see what I'm talking about. you won't regret it.\n\nPs. I didn't get to the charm and character the game has, but just play and be sure to give Quill a lil' high five.

It's makes good use of VR in the sense that you're the camera looking around the environment. The game primarily plays with you sitting down (when you boot the game it tells you to play sitting down) you'll lean about looking through corners & everywhere else within the environment to see where you can go. The level design most certainly takes advantage of you being in VR as if this were a non-VR game it'd be borderline unplayble due to all the foreground objects blocking your character (though the game does highlight your character when you go behind foreground objects so that would certainly help). The graphics aren't impressive but the art-style is really to my liking, there were a few instances where I would just stop and look around the environment, I really felt like a small rodent. The story gets the job done, you play as a small mouse going to save her uncle, nothing amazing but it does its job. This game is called a platformer but there really isn't much platforming, the involved platforming comes near the end of the game and the jumping is too restrictive for my liking in a \"platformer\" (that being said the jumping does work given the context of the game and the levels are designed around it so it's not annoying. What is annoying however is the combat, I despise the combat in this game, it's too simple to be enjoyable as in there's no combo potential, no skill ceiling, no nothing. I groan whenever I get locked in a room and I have to fight a bunch of monsters to progress. The puzzles are fun though, they aren't super brain taxing but they also don't solve themselves you do need to check around the environments. Some may take issue with the short length of this game (I beat it in 3 hours even though it says I only have 2.5 on record) but I don't. I appreciate that this game is short because it was a nice fun relaxing experience that didn't overstay its welcome. I will say however that if Moss 2 were to ever get made I would want the developers to expand the game more I definitely think you could make a solid 8-10 hour game with the groundwork laid out here. If I were to state one thing I'd like to see in Moss 2 more than anything, get rid of the god awful combat and focus on the puzzles, that's when Moss is at its best imo.

I fell off a lot of ledges and missed a lot of jumps due to this. Aside from this, this is how third-person VR should be done!\n\nThere are some performance issues. You will need a good video card (I'm using a 1650 Super which is... Acceptable. 72 fps usually.) to run this reasonably, and in longer sessions the game can accrue some sort of problem that causes performance to tank (a quick reboot fixes this, but it makes it annoying to stream). I ran it originally from HDD, but found performance was a lot better from SSD (less stutters), despite the fact that the game is small enough to fit in my RAM...\n\nUnique gameplay, amazing visuals, good implementation, decent story - but short in length.

A tour de force, that would not be possible outside of VR.  \n\nYou control a little mouse named Quill, and yourself, the \"Reader\".  Each \"page\" of the book you are reading is a \"screen\" in the game.  Its like a little diorama and you have to get from one end to the other.  Sometimes this entails sword fighting, sometimes puzzle solving, sometimes running for you life.  Each scene is crafted down to the smallest detail and is gorgeous.  You will frequently interact with the scenery, moving platforms so they are close enough for quill to jump on and things of that nature.  The puzzles and fighting are all fun and challenging, without ever becoming tiresome.  \n\nThe bond between yourself and Quill is acknowledged, and is part of the story.  There is also a voice that narrates the events.  It all serves to draw you in deeper to the game.  There are times Quill will turn around awaiting a high five from you, you see \"your\" reflection in still pools of water, the game is great at making you feel \"there\".  I cannot stress how much the tiny little crafted environments help in this, looking around and running around with Quill is incredibly cool (a la Mario 64 back in its day).\n\nMy complaints with Moss are few and far between.  The only one being I wish there was more of it.  I clocked in at about 4 hours and felt like I took my time even in certain parts.  I estimate I got around 75%+ of the hidden scrolls in my 4 hours.  I feel like between now and the sequel, I will be going back and getting the ones I missed, Moss is so good, and is worth it.  \n\nSo many VR games try and push the envelope of what is possible and/or want you to have a massive space to be able to play in.  I wish more games were like Moss instead.  Taking traditional game concepts and putting them in VR space and adding gameplay and visuals that only VR would allow.  Another example of this, sadly Playstation exclusive, is Astro Bot Rescue Mission.  Games like this are some of my favorite VR experiences and I find them astonishing.

(Note: Requires VR; seated OK.)\n\nThe environments, world-building and story are very well done. Backgrounds, skyboxes and incidental animations really sell the sense of place and scale. There's a bit early on with a deer that drives home \"small mouse, scary world\" vulnerability in a way that would only really work in VR. There's a lot of worthy detail to savor beyond what's actually required to progress in the game.\n\nMovement controls and exploration are fine for the most part.  In a few places, combat turns into a pat-your-head-and-rub-your-tummy cluster-caress, as you try to control Quill with the thumb-stick and buttons on one controller while you wrangle a mob or shove a physics item with the other.\n\nThe explore-y and puzzle-y bits were what I really enjoyed about Moss. Any time I was under time pressure or dealing with non-trivial numbers of enemies, I enjoyed a lot less.\n\nThere was one particular bit I thought was a huge difficulty spike, when actually the problem was that the thing I was trying to do was far harder than what the game was actually asking me to do. (There's a room with four weak enemies with projectile attacks. I killed one, it respawned, and I concluded \"oh, they repawn infinitely; guess I have to do a jumping puzzle while dodging bullet spam\". In reality, each one respawns once. Kill each twice to thin them out, then do the jumpy bits at your leisure.) That's arguably my own fault for making a bad assumption, but on the other hand there are plenty of enemies in this game that do respawn forever...\n\nMoss is somewhat unusual in being a third-person VR game. This works surprisingly well (and the fourth-wall-breaking conceit they use to explain it away works smoothly enough that it isn't distracting). But there are some bit of the game where you -- you, the player, in the real world -- will need to achieve some of the more advanced yoga poses in order to see where you're going or spot some hidden object. This is sometimes used as a deliberate part of level design, where something is placed in a way that would be obvious to the character in the game but is hidden from the player unless they undergo a specific set of contortions. Not a deal-killer for me, but may be hard to swallow depending on your setup and how limber you're feeling that day.\n\nThere is some Metroidvania-style backtracking, where you'll find a barrier that's initially impassible, then acquire some plot coupon and return to place you've already visited to do something you previously couldn't. This isn't bad in and of itself, but the game doesn't really tutorialize it very well; I found myself briefly stuck until I realized it was that kind of game.\n\nI played through this in about 5 hours, playing at a leisurely pace, looking for collectibles and doing side quests. It's a bit short, but it's as long as it needs to be to do what it's trying to do. It feels finished, without overstaying its welcome or getting repetitive.\n\nIn summary: Not a flawless or life-changing game, but amusing enough to recommend without reservation. Some good novel uses of VR, and some stunning visual settings. If they do the sequel threatened by the cliffhanger ending in this one, I'll probably buy it day one.", "timestamp_created": 1631916352, "timestamp_updated": 1631916352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99254527": {"recommendationid": "99254527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086798993", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 349, "last_played": 1636151793}, "language": "english", "review": "Ran this on my HP Reverb G2 and it ran pretty good.

If you ever played Herobound on Gear VR you know what to expect gameplay-wise.\n\nThe game is GORGEOUS, the screenshots or Youtube videos doesn't make it justice. The VR gives you a presence in the world, you can look behind walls and other obstacles, move some of the objects, heal and give power to Quill and even control some of the enemies to use their capabilities against their peers. \nIt's 10000x times better than Lucky's Tales where VR was only a gimmick, here it really makes sense, sorry for pancake players. \n\nGameplay is similar to Legend of Zelda i.e. a mix of platforms, puzzles and combat. \nThe combat itself is very simple as you can basically jump, attack and dodge. You are able to take control of enemies to block them in place allowing Quill to hit them without danger. You can also use their cannon or make them explose to kill other enemies or help you solve some of the puzzles. \nThe puzzles are quite simple, it's often a mix of moving an object in the correct position, step on a pressure plate or hit a distant crystal to lower/raise a platform. You'll have to use the enemies at your advantage to trigger the pressure plates or hit a crystal while Quill stands on the platform.\nThe platforms sections aren't too difficult except in the last portion of the game where you need to quickly jump from platform to platform while a giant snake is throwing fireballs at yourself. I didn't really experience moments where I was jumping in the void because of a bad perspective.\n\nLength-wise I spent around 4h for a first walktrough and 2h30 for consequent replays. You can redo each stage to collect the dust or relics you missed. \n\nFor achievements hunters: there is an achievement where you need to complete the game from a new save without dying once. It looks feasible when you redo each chapter independently but the difficulty reside in doing it in one setting without having upgraded armor or weapon.

The game is short. Go in with that knowledge, and you will not be disappointed. For the price of two movie tickets and popcorn though you get a 4.5-5 hour experience that, unlike so many movies you'll watch, you won't soon forget. I'm a 40 year old dude and some of my favorite games involve very large guns and/or visits to blood-soaked hells, which is why when I say that there are some moments in this game that are \"so pretty I almost cried\", I hope you  take it seriously. Look, if you're so broke that $30 is a serious consideration, and you need entertainment that'll last you, pass on by. More likely, if you own a VR system $30 isn't much - and the experience here is worth it. The sense of scale, the attention to detail, all top notch. \n\nIf you have a Quest and - since there is no crossbuy - you are wondering which version to get, 100% get it on PC VR (if your PC is up to it). Its a sit-down game anyway so the mobility of the Quest get you little, and the advanced use of lighting and materials here means that its likely a much degraded experience on Quest. The only reason I'd pick it up on mobile is if you want to take it and share it with others. Note: while there are some collectibles you might want to go back for, its otherwise a very linear game.

I'm happy with this because it's like being in one of those old Mario games, only in real 3D, and because it's a gentle introduction to VR.

The environment which you see will clearly be a 3D one, in which you can lean around. I didn\u2019t try to actually move around, the game is supposed to be played standing (or seated, but for that you will need an arms length of clearance around your chair). You are viewing from an elevated vantage point the current set-piece / room, in which your mouse, Quill, will act. You control her movement with the left thumbstick. The buttons on the right controllers are for the jump and for the attack/interaction. However there are some elements with which only you can interact (like a water wheel, which you can stop by grabbing it). Eventually you will meet enemies, which you must fight through. Some puzzles require you to use the enemies. You can grab them, and herd them toward certain push-down platforms, where they will keep pushing it down till you move them away. Later, when you meet shooting enemies, sometimes you must take control of them and shoot specific actuators, to proceed on. This shooting is done with the right thumbstick, and was fairly imprecise for me. You might ask : But what happens if I kill such an enemy with Quill, will I fail that segment? Well, if an enemy is required to pass forward, they will keep respawning indefinitely. Which lead to some confusing situations for me, as there is another mechanism : fighting through several waves of respawning enemies. At first I thought that those enemies will respawn indefinitely, and I must progress through somehow among them. It took me some time to figure out that when a red force field blocks an exit, I must kill all the respawning enemies. Most of the time you can take your time to progress through the platforming, but towards the very end of the game there will be severe time limits, so you must progress continuously, with little room for error.\n\nThe version on Steam is actually the game of the year version, it will contain the DLC content too. This DLC content is meshed in with the playthrough. You can access it at three points, where some green sparkling is visible. Interacting with that green sparkling will open a green portal, which will take you to a central hub, from where 3 different explorable areas will be accessible, unlocked by the gate by which you entered from in the main world (I think). Once you complete such an area, you will have to leave through the green gate you always arrive through, and you will be continuing the main story line. As such, it is entirely possible to skip one or all of these DLC contents. If you unlock all three, at the end of the final area there will be a boss fight.\n\nAs for the platforming, the possible positions of interaction are marked with white color, similar to what is present in Tomb Raider (2013). It also means that if something is not marked as white, you will probably have no way to scale it, even if it seems entirely plausible. Quills jump distance is quite short, which can be a problem when you want to jump across moving elements. Also it is very hard to aim precisely with the charged up sword in the DLC. I think there are some unmarked spots, if you stand on them than her precision will increase greatly (sort of location triggered aim assistance). But since they are not highlighted, even if they exists, it is hard to use them.\n\nThe graphics of the game is nice. However your experience will be affected more pronounced by the actual type of VR headset you are using, than for a normal game played on different monitors. There isn\u2019t such a wild disparity between different monitors than between different headsets. In particular, mine had a pronounced optical distortion at the outer 50% of its field of view, a problem not present for monitors. Also I had to play with reduced resolution, as my GTX 1070 was clearly at the low end of the VR capable video cards. I was planning to buy a 3000 series card to replace it, but things didn\u2019t turned out in such a way.\n\nAll the narration will be done by a single person, Quill will merely issue some squeaking noises (but even those are done by the same voice actor). If you get stuck, often Quill will pantomime some hints, like pointing in a direction, or mimicking shooting if you are supposed to control a shooter to interact with some triggers. The game might have music, but I was completely oblivious of it.\n\nIt might appear as a casual/chill game, but some fights were very frustrating for me, like the boss fight at the end of the DLC, but I got problems with regular fights too. To add to my frustration, sometimes my left thumbstick seemed to be left stuck, making Quill to keep walking in the left direction. Since it was my first VR game, I\u2019m not sure whether the problem was with my controller, or in the game. It happened randomly, so it was not like my controller was always wrong. This is why I think it might have been a problem with the game. Also, the menu button wasn\u2019t mapped to any button on my controllers. I had to map it through Steam, and I added it to the left grip button. I think accessing the menu is entirely optional. The main reason for that would be to see your progress for some collectibles, and later to replay a specific chapter, probably to collect everything. There are two kind of collectibles : scrolls, which unlock a picture, and dust, which you gather by smashing barrels and similar objects. I gathered around 80% of the collectibles, but due to the annoying fights/triggers, I don\u2019t intend to replay the chapters to gather the rest. When I wanted to exit the game, I just selected exit for it from the Steam dashbord.\n\nYou will play through room size environments, and you are not required to move around. If there is an object with which you must interact, it will be within an arm lengths distance. The game can be played only with VR controllers, there are no options for gamepad. I think entering a room will autosave your progress. There certainly wasn\u2019t a manual save option, only an option to switch between different save slots (if several people would play the game, I guess). Also while in a set, there might be several internal checkpoints. Reaching these are not saved when you exit the game, however if you fail, you will restart from these internal checkpoints and not from the very beginning of the level. As for the length of the game, it took me a bit above 6 hours. It certainly didn\u2019t felt short for me. Some further time went with the mapping of the menu button, and after finishing the game, I replayed the first chapter for some collectibles, that I was not aware the first time that they were as such. The game reaches a closure, but the developers chose to twist the ending with a declaration for further progress through a sequel, making it seem unfinished. But without that turn of events, it would have ended properly.\n\nThe game run without crashes for me, but even with a reduced resolution it wasn\u2019t maintaining all the time a constant 90Hz.

It is surprising that having depth perception via VR doesn't really help you judge jumps when you are far from the fixed camera or at an odd angle. There are plenty of times that you will fail just because you can't accurately judge the direction you are facing.\n\nThere are some nice puzzles here but nothing super taxing. Some of the combat is extremely challenging, this is not a good game for young kids! Once you master the art of two different things at the same time with each hand then combat gets a bit easier.\n\nThe controls are a bit awkward, and I almost tried an XBox controller instead (apparently that doesnt work anyway?) With the amount of frustration this game gives I'd rather wear out a cheap XBox controller than my expensive Valve Index controllers.\n\nThe graphics are really amazing. I played the first half of the game with the graphics set on low and didn't realise because they look so good. \n\nWhat really carries this game is the cuteness factor of the environments and especially the main character. Some of the animations are really great, and there are a lot of subtle interactions you can explore with the characters.\n\nI enjoyed my time in the game, although it was a bit short, it only took me two sessions to finish it (I stopped because my feet were sore).

For starters, bang for your buck.  The game is short, sure, but full of content and lots of fun to explore.  The art style is gorgeous, and the worlds and characters created in it are wonderful.  I found myself stopping in every single level just to look around at stuff.  It feels like you are playing with a dollhouse or some sorta miniature landscape.  You often have to physically move around in the level to see where to send Quill, which gives you opportunities to see all the cool things you'd otherwise miss in a flatscreen game.  There's so much detail to each level, but it's not overwhelming or distracting.  But let me talk about the animation, because it's what really makes this game pop.  The animations put into Quills movement and body language give so much life to her that I would often feel worried for her safety, or remorseful if I caused her to \u201cdie\u201d.  Not only that, but she interacts with you in many ways.  You can sneak up behind her and startle her, you can give her a high five, you can pet her, and all the while it feels very immersive with the way she moves. 10/10 on world and character visuals for sure.\n\nThe mechanics are mostly good, very intuitive and a lot of fun.  I will say that while a lot of the gameplay is easy, jumping some gaps requires almost perfect timing as they are spaced in a way that doesn't provide much room for error.  The fighting mechanics are very easy and simple, but still lots of fun regardless.  I do feel like it gets a bit wooden after a short while, but I couldn't say what might fix that.  The puzzle mechanics are probably the best part.  They really found a good way to make VR work for puzzles.  You use your hands to interact with various objects, sometimes while simultaneously controlling Quill which can be tricky but fun.  And you really have to move your head around to see where she is at and where to send her.  They got really creative with using both VR and traditional controls to make for a very satisfying game.  8/10 for controls and mechanics.  \n \nThe narration/voice acting and story reminds me of getting bedtime stories read to you by a parent or older sibling.  I will admit it's a little cheesy, but it fits the childish fantasy world plenty fine.   It's not a huge part of the game, though, as most of the time spent is in silence as you figure out puzzles.  I would love to see them expand on this story, however, whether making a continuation or perhaps introducing more characters.  7/10.\n\nI can't finish up this review without touching on the music.  Jason Graves, the composer, did music for such games as Dead Space, Tomb Raider, And Until Dawn.  I know for the majority of people, music is something that just fills the silence.  But in Moss, they really did put a lot of work into the music.  It doesn't just sound good on its own, it does a good job of fitting the entire art style.  The music feels very magical and mysterious, similar to Jeremy Soule's Morrowind soundtrack, but also has some Russell Shaw's Fable vibes, too.  Excellent, 10/10.\n\nCONS:\nYou might experience some neck pain from having to look down with a heavy HMD on all the time.  I can't play this game for more than 2 hours before I gotta take a break.\n\nIt might have been my vive and its terrible touch pads, but the jump doesnt always register and got me killed a lot.", "timestamp_created": 1614452054, "timestamp_updated": 1614452054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87557690": {"recommendationid": "87557690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058369472", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1614345176}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, the premise and how interactive it can be.

Before playing this game, I was honestly skeptical of what VR could add to a third person platformer, or indeed third person games in general. Turns out the answer is: a surprising amount. The ability to literally stick your face into a level and look around makes figuring out the puzzles and finding collectibles a joy, and it really helps immerse you in the world of Moss. There's no character movement, as the game is presented as essentially a series of dioramas like the pages of its titular book, so that cuts out one of VR's biggest hitches without feeling like anything is missing.\n\nThe plot and setting of Moss are honestly fairly rote - a big scary badness awakens in a whimsical world of tiny folk, and you have to rescue someone from it. What makes the game special is the love poured into it, especially the protagonist Quill. Her movements and vocalisations are incredibly expressive, her animations are flawless, and the game allows you to interact with her directly - high fives, mussing up her fur, waving to each other. It really helps to sell you on the notion that this is a tiny little person you're helping out, not just a player model.\n\nThe controls are great, the setting is great, the audio is great, Polyarc really made something special in Moss. If I had to criticise, $40 CAD is quite a bit to be charging for a game that's about 3-4 hours long depending on how completionist you're being. It's not as bad as Rhombus of Ruin's launch price compared to its length, but that game's list price was also slashed in half when it came to Steam.\n\nLooking forward to Book 2, right Polyarc?

However - Moss was one of the first VR games I picked up while I'm waiting for a GPU upgrade for more graphically intense games. I picked up Moss in the [i]Wonder of VR[/i] collection with other fun puzzle games to tinker around in while I wait. From the first few minutes, however, I found that this game is much better than I anticipated.\n\n[b]One of the important talking points for VR is \"sense of scale\"[/b] - It's often in the context of grand landscapes and huge impressive monoliths that make you feel small. You may be looking at this game and thinking a 3D platformer where you control a mouse wouldn't be a game that really highlights this. However in Moss, I believe it's just as important and just as impressive. You're floating above incredibly intricate and detailed miniature environments that make you feel like you're watching actual little animals running around. It's remarkable, and most importantly, adorable. [b]Seriously, I can't get over how cute this game is.[/b]\n\n[b]I may be biased[/b] - I love miniature things in real life, such as model railroads or tabletop war games - This game is that same thing, but full of life and motion. I also loved [i]Redwall[/i] books as a kid, and this game really taps into that type of world.\n\n[b]The gameplay is a classic puzzle platformer[/b] - It's mildly challenging and never frustrating. Controls are simple and solid. The gameplay itself isn't particularly innovative, but it's polished and enjoyable.\n\n[b]Don't judge a book by its cover[/b] - If you're looking at the screenshots and think \"Meh, it just looks like an average 3D platformer\", just wait into you see that little mouse for the first time with your headset on. You get sucked into the world almost instantly.

You can either read the script here, or listen to it on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4djuUoNJn7E&ab_channel=ThisKory99\n\nIf you don't want to click links, search \"ThisKory99\" on YouTube and you'll find it.\n\nMoss is a Platform Puzzle game which has you controlling a little mouse named Quill, while simultaneously using your hands to interact with various objects within its beautifully crafted world. Nothing compares to a platformer in VR, especially one like Moss.\n\nThe way the story is told is something I would have never imagined. You are in a large cathedral hall with a book in front of you, and you are known to Quill as \"The Reader\". Upon opening the book, there are pieces of the story narrated to you, and then you enter the book itself to work directly with Quill and share the story with her. It's a beautiful way to tell a story, and in the middle of each chapter it takes you out of Quill's world and back into the cathedral to continue the storytelling from a different perspective. During this time, you notice that day suddenly turned to night, and it gives you a sense of actually becoming so immersed in a book, that you lost track of time, and completely immersed yourself in the story of the book to the point where you were no longer focused on your surrounding (those surroundings being the cathedral hall). This is something which happens to us when we are deep into the story of any book we read... we get lost in the visions of our imagination, and forget about the world in front of us. I can't begin to express how amazing this feels, and it's something I wish I could experience every time I read a book.\n\nWithout spoilers, the story is simple, and the primary objective is to make your way to a castle to find your uncle. Throughout your journey, you fight various enemies, complete challenging environmental puzzles, and gain a few new powers as your progress through the 4 hour story campaign. And Quill can\u2019t do this all on her own, so she needs you there to help her during her travels.\n\nQuill is the most charming character I\u2019ve ever seen in a game. I actually looked up the most charming video game characters on The Google, but I only saw fake articles, which all had false information, because Quill wasn't on any of the lists I found. Quill is definitely in my top 3 most charming video game characters, next to Prince Sidon from BOTW, and Dorian from Dragon Age: Inquisition. Quill has such a great personality, and she really shows a lot with her body language. You can see Quill express her fear, sadness, excitement, and joy. And when you complete more challenging puzzles and fights, she rewards you with a high five, and an adorable dance, which gets better and better as your progress through the story.\n \nThe environments are amazing, and I was always excited to see what was next. Each scene has its charm, and every one of them is beautifully crafted, with plenty of variation to keep you entranced throughout Quills journey. \n\nMoss shines not only in the beauty which each environment brings. But the ambient sounds are absolutely breath taking, and gave me chills when hearing owls, frogs, and crickets in the night, and every environment has its own unique sound... Not only are you already immersed in VR visually, but Moss does an absolutely amazing job with their audio design. Everything from the sound of Quill\u2019s sword hitting enemies, pots, and boxes, to the sounds of blades of grass shuffling around as Quill runs through them all brings you deeper into immersion with the world.\n\nThe soundtrack isn\u2019t on the same level as Ori & the Blind Forest, but it definitely has its moments. and I have to say, Morla Gorrondona, who narrated the entire story did an amazing job, and really sells the fantasy storybook feel.\n\nThe controls are simple, and if you\u2019ve played any 3D platform games before, then you\u2019ll be very familiar with the controls with Moss. On the Index Controls \u2013 and other controllers are very similar I\u2019m sure -, the left thumb stick is to control the direction of the little one. You use the A button on the right controller to jump, and B will swing your sword. Pressing B once will give a single swing, and pressing B 3 times quickly will have Quill perform a large sweeping attack, and this varries depending on which weapon you are using. If you attack once or twice, you have the opportunity to quickly dodge by pressing the A button quickly after attacking. Whichever direction your left thumb stick is facing at the time, will be the direction which little quill will make her dodge towards. The A button while not attacking will be used for jumping and pulling yourself up ledges or dropping from them. \n\nThis is where the controls get fun. With your triggers on either controller, you can interact with the environment more directly. You are able to heal Quill by pulling the trigger over her body and pulling away to lift her up. Enemies can be manipulated by holding the trigger over them, and there are other various interactions such as opening doors and assisting with puzzles. You can also light torches and break boxes for dust.\n\nSpeaking of dust, there are 2 types of collectibles in the game which earn you achievements. Sparkly dust can be collected by breaking boxes, pots, and other various objects either with Quill\u2019s sword, or you can do this yourself with your hands and the right trigger on the controller. The second collectible is mosaic fragments which create an image when you collect them all. Some of the mosaic fragments can be challenging to find, so make sure to look through each scene thoroughly, otherwise, this will give you an excuse to play through the story again to collect all of the pieces.\n\nSo, let's get into the heart of the gameplay. Puzzles. At first, the puzzles are simple, and Quill herself can overcome most puzzles on her own. But later on, you need to work together with Quill, both with puzzles and in combat. You may be asking yourself how you are not already working together with Quill when you are controlling her movement and attacks. Well, you have two hands - which look like blue orbs in the game - which are able to move through the world which Quill lives in, and you are able to manipulate enemies and work with her to complete puzzles, as mentioned earlier.\n\t\nThe way which this is introduced to you is perfect, and it starts slowly, with it gradually building up to intense combat sequences where you must defend Quill by manipulating enemies around her, while she is attacking her own set of enemies. Keep in mind, when I mention Quill and yourself, you are controlling both.\n\t\nIn one combat scenario I was using my left controller thumb stick to control Quill's direction, and using A and B on the right controller to jump, dodge, and attack, all while using both hands to reach out in front and to the sides of me to manipulate enemies using the trigger on both controllers, all to assist Quill while she (myself) attacks a single enemy without becoming bombarded by the others. \n\nOf course, you will never experience this kind of combat technique in any flat-screen Platformer, and what the developers of Moss did is absolutely incredible, mind blowing, and makes me want to cry all at the same time. I say it makes me want to cry (and I did, several times) because I have never experienced something so satisfying in gaming until now.

No game that costs 30$ should every have a person almost beat 100% of the game in 5 Hours who has never ever played or seen game play of it before.\n    [*] Combat gets repetitive and tedious very quickly. No fights ever really get hard they just get annoying in the frequency of them later in the game\n    [*] They build up the story and a lot of characters but never really flesh out anything. Every character and every event just is. There are no twists or turns or explanations of how a character received said role or what that role actually is. \n[/list]\n[h1] The Biggest Con [/h1]\nThe ending to the game was just bad. It felt sudden and harsh. Half of the story was complete and we never experienced a resolution. The ending was you beat the bad guy and now let me tell you about what you'll need to do in the next game. There is no tying back to old characters or anything like that. Most games end with a parade of some sorts and this one ended by just saying \"sorry its not over we'll see you in the next game!!!\" I paid 30$ for 4.2 Hours of story. It would be a crime to ask another 30$ for the next 4.2 hours of gameplay.\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\nThe game is beautiful and well optimized. The puzzles are great. The story is very basic and lacks depth. The price is a joke the game isn't worth more than 20$ and I could barely justify even spending that. Combat gets really stale.

And I'm glad I did. It's a bit heavy on the storytelling for my taste. I know some people love a good backstory told, but I prefer to \"discover\" the backstory. Anyway it was not so heavy it annoyed me, moving on.\n\nThis game is just smooth as butter. The protagonist is a cross between a kitten and your baby sister, assuming you have a baby sister and you get along really well with her. The puzzles are not too challenging (although I'm stuck on one as I write this, but I'm stupid). Same for the battles, nothing too complicated but just fun. The scenery is beautiful and the music and sound effects really set an atmosphere that supports the story.\n\nI think part the appeal of the game is that is just a bit more relaxing. You get to sit on your ass (occasionally you'll need to get up to see what's going on), the music is relaxing most of the time, and you just make a mouse run around, occasionally moving stuff with your hands. It's a welcome break from shooting zombies, dodging bullets and shooting down space ships.\n\nOne thing, I did run into a bug with the first lever you encounter in the game, that bug has apparently been in there since 2018 which is a bit shameful. I didn't run into any other bugs though, and there is a work around so it's not a deal breaker.\n\nThis bug: https://steamcommunity.com/app/846470/discussions/0/1696049513772438528/", "timestamp_created": 1609037536, "timestamp_updated": 1609037536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507658660411834717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83233575": {"recommendationid": "83233575", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994050442", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1609342037}, "language": "english", "review": "Get\nThis\nGame\nNow!", "timestamp_created": 1609015328, "timestamp_updated": 1609015328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83208857": {"recommendationid": "83208857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042113113", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1616898749}, "language": "english", "review": "One word...

You play as Quill (the mouse) as a third-person action puzzle platformer, and also as a first-person VR character where you have to interact with the world. This leads to some really fun puzzles where you have to do both at the same time. The combat as Quill is simplistic, just an attack and a dodge, but works well for the game. The story is good, it tries to fell like a fairy tale and achieves that quite well.\n\nVisually, I think the game looks quite good. I'm sure part of it is because you aren't close to the models and textures, but I thought the environments looked pretty regardless. I also really loved Quill, the model and animations are very well done.\n\nI only really had 2 problems with Moss.\nFirst, it's not very long. It's not really shorter than Budget Cuts or Vertigo (which I also beat in a similar amount of time), but I would have liked it to be longer, like 8-10 would be great.\nSecond, the ending wasn't too great. It basically just said the game is just the beginning of the story and there is going to be a sequel. It's not a big deal (the game was fine by itself) but I would have rather the game was a complete story, or just hint there could be more without being so blatant that this isn't the complete story by itself. Again, not a big deal, but it sorta bugs me.\n\nOverall, this is easily in my top 10 VR games.

Yes, the game is short but the devs did such a good job with the world that it deserves the credit it's getting. There's one big error with this game that can't go unnoticed and that's the controls, I struggled in parts to move Quill around but it's more of the Vive joysticks than the actual game. Also, a very nice touch with petting and giving high-fives with Quill after completing a puzzle, this is what VR is all about.\nTotal Score = 81/100.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nMoss is an adventure game viewed from the first-person perspective. The player is shown in the game as a masked face and orb. Unlike most games, Quill is aware of the player. The player controls Quill, navigating environments and battling enemies. The player also can manipulate the environment to navigate obstacles and solve puzzles. Quill communicates with the player through the use of body language for puzzle hints and emotional responses.\n\nThe player can change positions to have different perspectives of the world, leaning to see around buildings or standing up and getting an aerial view. There are collectable scrolls that only can be found by changing positions and exploring parts of the world that normally cannot be seen.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1\u25a1 8 / 10\nQuill is soooo cute!\n\nRECOMMENDED SPECS: \nOS: Windows 10 (64-bit)\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-4790 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X or better\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nGraphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 8GB / AMD RX Vega 56 8GB or better\nStorage: 12 GB available space", "timestamp_created": 1606647846, "timestamp_updated": 1606729815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637466609477996826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80966612": {"recommendationid": "80966612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066070395", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1606610037}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

Quill knows of your existence (you're a floating mask in the sky) and will often face you to cheer when the both of you accomplish a certain task, dance, ask for high fives or speak to you with sign language. Even though you control her directly these little moments are wonderful and make Quill feel like a real partner, you'll be happy to oblige and give her all of the high fives she wants. 90% of the gameplay is platforming with Quill and combat (it's simple, but it's satisfying!) and running about, but as The Reader, you'll be moving platforms for Quill to progress, taking control of enemies and later on you'll be charging up Quill's Sword so she can fire blue fireballs that explode.\n\nThe visuals and sound are whimsical, you're plunged right into a fantasy world that's soothing to take in and explore, it feels alive and filled with magic. The developer was not afraid to use bright colors to paint these landscapes, everything is just a sight to behold and not just in the immediate playspace, but also in the far distance. There's a lot of beautiful vistas that you'll want to just stand up and stare off into. While the visuals aren't the most high fidelity thing you've ever seen that astonished me the most were the animations, everything is so well animated and fluid, it's AAA quality. The sound compliments all this well with music that sounds appropriate for a fantasy title, it's great.\n\nStory isn't the most important thing in Moss, it's basic but it works well. It doesn't try to convolute things by making things overly pithy with tons of made-up words that fantasy tends to do; but you won't be playing Moss for the story anyway.\n\nAs a VR title, no it's not the most deep when it comes to gameplay and the VR interactions are the most basic of \"move this, pull that\" that you've seen in every early VR tech demo, but all of the components are put together so well it's quite impressive.

If I had to change something, I would do some tweaks to the platforming, as it did feel a bit slippery and imprecise. The combat in the other hand is fun and works seamlessly between the heroine and the reader. Some puzzles did leave me scratching my head for a while, but nothing felt too frustrating and after toying around with the mechanics I managed to find my solution. It felt like the secrets were easy to find, but after finishing the game, I found out that there still were a handful of them to be discovered.

As of review, I played through the story twice because of how much I enjoyed it, and I'm still playing to try to get the full run with no deaths achievement.  So far, Moss is my favorite VR game, for a number of reasons:\n- It\u2019s so gorgeous, the sights and sounds are a pure delight to take in.\n- There is no motion sickness because the perspective is always fixed and it's meant to be played sitting down.  \n- The concept of being a tree spirit helping Quill, an adorable mouse, is just so heart-warming and seeing your reflection is such a cool moment.  I did not anticipate I would become invested in the story.\n- The gameplay is really fun and has a lot of room for you to play the way you want to play.  You control a sword-wielding mouse and you, as a tree spirit, have god-like powers to assist in battle and solve puzzles.   I've seen comparisons to Legend of Zelda, and in terms of gameplay, that is very accurate.\nThere are some flaws that I have to mention:\n- The controls can be a real pain sometimes.  For the most part the controls are fine, but sometimes Quill won\u2019t do what you want her to do.  I\u2019m pretty sure that the joystick follows the orientation of your head, rather than your hand \u2013 as a result, sometimes it\u2019s hard to get Quill to do what you want her to do; like she might not know if you want to pull yourself up a ledge or move to the side and aiming with a Scorcher is comedically hard.  After playing a while, I got used to it, but when I watched my friend play for the first time, she gave up in less than 10 minutes because she was having trouble controlling Quill.\n- You have to restart the game to change the seating orientation, it\u2019s not a big deal, but the position that you open the game in is the position that you play the game in, so if you need to change the position, it requires a restart of the game.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game to anyone with a VR headset.  It is beautiful and engaging, the length is tight (it doesn't overstay its welcome), and keeps calling me back for more.  I can't wait for the sequel, I hope there are many more Moss games to come.\n\nReviewed on:\nValve Index\nRTX 2070 Super\nIntel i9-9900k\n64 GB RAM", "timestamp_created": 1594743193, "timestamp_updated": 1594743996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72655138": {"recommendationid": "72655138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087208543", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1594700302}, "language": "english", "review": "Moss is a magical experience, filled with emotion and beauty.", "timestamp_created": 1594700463, "timestamp_updated": 1594700463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72582766": {"recommendationid": "72582766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006537540", "num_games_owned": 1035, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1594486966}, "language": "english", "review": "Moss is a VR-only puzzle-platformer that\u2019ll charm your socks off. The story is framed around reading a book you\u2019re physically pulled into, following which you become connected with the timid but responsibility-bound mouse Quill and adventure awaits the both of you. Although in typical platforming fashion you are directly in control of Quill your presence is regarded by the cast as a sidekick!\n\nWhile this may be first title released under the Polyarc name it\u2019s obvious that these devs are talented industry veterans. Firstly, the audio direction is brilliantly immersive with layered and detailed environmental sound effects backed by a subtle and whimsical soundtrack, it makes the whole forest feel like it\u2019s teeming with life.\n\nThat veteran talent is also on display in the visual design, the dioramic environments have been put together with a careful thoughtfulness about how the scale will feel in 3D. It\u2019d usually be easy to forget you\u2019re watching over a tiny mouse, but looking up at the towering trees and wildlife puts the world in perspective. Textures are well detailed and there\u2019s no clear compromise to visual quality despite the performance requirements of VR. With such strong audio, graphics and characterisation you will find Moss\u2019s world absolutely engrossing.\n\nSo, full marks so far, what about the gameplay? Well, that\u2019s a little more of a mixed bag. Moss definitely shows that platforming makes a great fit for VR, gaps have a physicality making jump judgements trivial. Using motion controls to spin and adjust platforms makes you feel powerful in contrast to tiny Quill and moving your actual head to look around the environments in search of hidden collectables is immersive like nothing else.\n\nThe tough pill to swallow in all this is the short 3-4 hour runtime and lack of replayability. Once you know the puzzle solutions and plot points Moss doesn\u2019t hold the same magic anymore. I also reckon there may be more innovative VR platformers on the horizon as on reflection the gameplay is a little by the book.

Quill is controlled via the traditional gamepad inputs on your controllers, but as the reader you also have the power to manipulate certain objects in the world with your VR motion controllers. \n\nSince this game was developed for the PS4's Sixaxis controller, you're sadly left with glowing orbs instead of hands, and very rudimentary interactions with the game objects.\n\nWhile the story is beautifully conveyed through the wonderful visual artwork, some of the actual gameplay elements weren't quite as impressive. The platforming mechanics felt a bit stiff and unpolished, while the combat was too simplistic and barebones to be really engaging. Being able to hold and control some of Quill's foes with your \"hands\" while fighting them keeps it from getting too trivial though.\n\nLuckily the meat of the game is in the puzzles, and they were for the most part enjoyable to solve, but as mentioned, more complex motion controller interactions with the world objects could've given the puzzles some extra depth.\n\nOn the technical side, it's sad to see that the devs haven't bothered fixing the performance issues when using any other graphics option than \"LOW\", which therefore has been chosen as the default. Judging by several threads on forums and reddit, you will not be able to maintain full framerate regardless of your PC specs if you go above that.\n\nOverall a short (< 5 hours), visually great VR experience with very enjoyable puzzles, but mediocre platforming and combat.\n\n79%", "timestamp_created": 1588173466, "timestamp_updated": 1588255228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68229902": {"recommendationid": "68229902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071597541", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 164, "last_played": 1588627805}, "language": "english", "review": "This was one of my best purchases for VR! the graphics and the gameplay are just so nice, and its more like an interactive novel, than a game (so far), the riddles are not too hard and the fights can be challenging but doable.

It's like the Legend of Zelda (one of my all-time faves), except Link is an adorable female mouse named Quill. The player controls Quill's movements, but you play as the hero's companion--Not Navi, but useful like Midna, except you're about human-sized and look like the No-Face guy from Spirited Away. I loved everything about this game except the controls.\n\nPROBLEM:\nThe controls were too awful to be able to enjoy this game at first. The Vive controllers just don't have enough distinct button inputs for 3rd person VR games, and the trackpads are so difficult to use while blindfolded, especially if you have smaller hands. Quill's 2 main actions (attack and jump) are set as the left and right side of one trackpad button by default. These 2 distinctly different actions require frequent, unforgiving precision in order to progress through an adventure platformer, yet they are each mapped to one half of the same physical button, which has no tactile markings of any kind to indicate which action you are about to trigger before you do. It was entirely too easy to accidentally roll your thumb across the bottom edge of the pad when trying press one side or the other, which of course registers as the wrong action at least 50% of the time. You can see how this would be a problem when you're trying to perform a series of precise platform jumps across a bottomless chasm (miss one jump and you have to start over!) or when you are trying to attack multiple waves of enemies (3 hits kills you and have to start over!).\n\nSOLUTION:\nI would still recommend buying this game because you can adjust the game's controller bindings in your Vive settings so that it's actually playable. I mapped the \"attack/interact\" action to the right trigger and the \"jump\" action to the left trigger. That made them distinctly separate inputs that are easily pressed on purpose and not easily pressed on accident. I set the Reader's \"grab\" action as the side grip buttons, which is easy enough to squeeze quickly for a charge attack, although physically harder to hold down if you have smaller hands (but at least it's contextually appropriate for what it does in the game). The side grip might be easier to press accidentally if you're holding the controller tightly during a moment of tension, but it won't hurt anything if you do.\n\nTo Polyarc:\nI hope you still end up releasing Book 2, because this game was great. I recommend patching it with alternative control options (see above suggestion about the triggers, also options for Index Knuckles if you haven't already!) so that new players aren't discouraged from playing Book 1 and getting excited about the sequel themselves.\n\nTo Valve:\nPlease give players more options for controllers. The Vive controllers are gigantic, so if you have smaller hands (as most women do), you're constantly shifting the controller around trying to comfortably reach all the buttons, and the side grip buttons are a literal pain to use. Developers shouldn't be discouraged from creating unique and interesting games like Moss, which needs better input options. The Nintendo Switch has like a half dozen controller options for every type of game or any size of hand, and the entire system costs way less than a VR setup. If your customers are willing to shell out all the money for a headset, controllers, sensors, and a PC powerful enough to run VR games, please respect them enough to give them ways to purchase usable controllers that fit their dang hands!", "timestamp_created": 1586800617, "timestamp_updated": 1586801083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67194942": {"recommendationid": "67194942", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992684184", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1586979622}, "language": "english", "review": "Just buy it and play it, the mouse trip is going to be one of your best ever VR experiences..

Its all rather cliche story stuff about a conflict between nature and machines in a fantasy world nothing you haven't seen before.

The game doesn't have a title screen, nor does it completely tell you the button layout.  I was left to guess how to exit.

I finished it in 3 hours. (I got it in the Humble VR Bundle)\n\nNow despite that, those 3 hours were non-stop quality. Everything is immensely polished and the atmosphere and charm is top notch.\n\nThe writing is kinda cheesy at times but it fits the storybook tone. The gameplay feels like a really fresh take on 3D platforming. Instead of just watching the action from being next to it, you get to interact with things directly. Especially with Quill, your little mouse companion. The highlight though is absolutely the visuals and audio, sound design and music are wonderful and really sell the ambience of all the environments. Art direction is gorgeous. There's one area in particular if you manage to find these 3 secret portal things throughout the game, the last one has my favorite area in the game, visually. The animation tho wew lad. Quill has a ton of different little things she does during combat, and they change with each weapon (there's 3) All the NPC's and enemies are also really fluid and it's just overall super lifelike and charming.\n\nA shame it's so short, but what is here is wonderful and I hope the sequel has some more meat to it.

Fighting segments were sometimes easy, other times challenging, with the latter one being more to the end of the game (obviously). I also enjoyed the interactions between Quill and the Reader (aka you, the player)! The voice acting for Quill and the Narrator were really good too!\n\nBUT!: Here's a few problems I faced while playing.\nThe controls on my Valve Index Controllers were clunky and my controller apparently has a drift issue in this game only! (Admittedly, the only other game I could try at this time was Arizona Sunshine, which works great. And yes, I looked into the controller testing menu, which doesn't show errors either.)\nThe drifting of the left joystick got really frustrating, because it made some parts of the game harder than they needed to be. (Maybe it's just a bug idk)\n\nAlso, it took quite some time to get used to where Quill runs to when you tilt the joystick, as it's not bound to your \"First-Person\" camera view. For example: You tilt the joystick down -> Quill runs down but more to the right or left, depending on the level. This made some jumping segments, again, harder than they needed to be.\n\nOverall I still really enjoyed this game a lot and I'm excited to see where we'll see Quill next!", "timestamp_created": 1582023409, "timestamp_updated": 1582023409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63710048": {"recommendationid": "63710048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052707455", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1619764573}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful scenery and an adorable protagonist.

Gave it a go, since it was now in my library anyway... HOLY SHIZNIT - WHY THE F*** DID I NOT WANT TO PLAY THIS? The environments, animations, music are gorgeous. The 'working together' combat mechanics are a blast. The platforming/puzzles are -just- challenging enough to keep you engaged without driving you into frustration, (add the fact the mouse character will try and give you hints with 'charades' when you seem to be stuck in a level, <she gets head pats for that>). It's a seated game - but you'll find yourself crawling around quite a bit, especially in combat portions. Also, it is episodic, so my first run of the game was under 5 hours, (I did miss alot of the DLC Twilight Garden content,) and there is obviously more to the story. There is replayability as a result of all the hidden content. If $30 is a bit steep for that amount of gameplay for you, then definitely grab it during a sale or a Bundle!\n-cons (for honesty)\n>It's kind of short if you don't find all the hidden DLC content (which is supposed to make this an 8+ hour adventure).\n>It's seated, but you will find yourself having to move farther than arms reach.

The left touchpad is kind of emulating a joystick and the right touchpad is emulating four separate buttons... most of the time (although I had to figure that out myself as there was nothing explaining this in the game). This results in lots of frustrating deaths due to controller awkwardness as opposed to honest difficulty. Which leads me onto...\n2) This game for the most part of fairly laid back and puzzle focused. It sometimes drops you into little arena battles which can be difficult to master with the Vive controls, but you get used to it pretty quickly, but then at the end it suddenly flips into something which reminded me of the bad old days of Space Ace and Dragons Lair. You need to suddenly act really quickly and with almost no room for error or it's instant death. It's incredibly frustrating and feels quite at odds with the rest of the experience.

Right out of the gate, the act of multitasking by controlling Quill [i]while[/i] reaching across the virtual space to manipulate the environment is as immersive as it sounds, aided in no small part by the presentation - the appearance of each level is like a small diorama laid out with nooks and crannies for the player and for Moss to poke around in. Each level represents a discrete platforming or puzzle challenge (or some combination thereof), with breaks for combat in-between, the combat itself often feeling like a puzzle of timing and prioritization. But progress is impossible without Quill and the Reader working in tandem; the effect is that the player feels like a partner on this journey, and it's hard not to form some small attachment to Quill not just through plot but through play, too. (It's something of a joke how excited people get when you can high-five Quill, but dang it, if it's isn't just as awesome as it's built up to be.)\n\nThat said, the [i]real[/i] star of the show is the presentation in [i]Moss[/i], which takes the bones of a serviceable puzzle platformer and transcends it to something else. The whole game is presented as a classic fairy tale, read from a large tome in what appears to be cathedral-like library. The game itself is to scale, meaning that trees and ancient ruins loom over the player and Quill, granted some mystique and awe in their physical enormity. A deer passing by in the background feels like some ancient forest spirit. Clockwork insects feel larger and more menacing. Shields and armors littered about an ancient battleground poke up out of the mud, eerie reminders of how large the world is in contrast to the game's tiny protagonist. What is, in effect, a small adventure, feels truly [i]fantastic[/i] through its set dressing. And, of course, that's to completely ignore the impact of the music, or the adorable squeaks and chirps of Quill herself.\n\nThere are some minor drawbacks, though writing this, they feel like quibbles. The platforming can occasionally get frustrating, with the level laid out in such a way that it's difficulty to gauge jumps; having said that, since it was technically my face that was the camera, I'm not sure if that's inconsistent design or just an embarrassing case of user error. The game is also quite short, clocking in (including the Twilight Garden DLC) is around 4 to 5 hours, not including a bit of extra treasure hunting for the completionists out there. It also, and I'll remain vague here, ends on a bit of an open note, suggesting either future DLCs or a sequel.\n\nQuibbles aside though, [i]Moss[/i] is an excellent example of what you can do in VR. It's charming, fun, and shockingly engaging, right through to the end. I feel like it's a stepping stone, a bridge between contemporary design sensibilities and the more experimental end of VR, playing with what the medium can do when it moves away from first-person design.

Controls could be a little difficult to get used to when doing precision platforming but certainly manageable with a bit of practice.\n\nCombat also feels surprisingly good and the ability to interact as 'yourself' or as the main character Quill or both at the same time really stretches the interaction into something fascinating and opens lots of neat gameplay options. Pleasantly, the game doesn't feel 'waggly' where the VR elements are shoehorned in, feels like a VR game made by people who wanted to make a VR game rather than people who wanted to make a platformer and felt obligated to include VR elements. The interactions are generally pretty basic and I hope they are expanded upon in future games but none of it is out-of-place in the game.\n\nAs mentioned; combat is fluid and fun though, again, a little basic with my hopes that it gets expanded upon in later games. I think my one main issue was that the game would return to an external 'cutscene' between chapters to advance the story a bit more and I felt it was very jarring and unnecessary.

It rewards looking around (with your whole upper body) to find hidden scrolls scattered in each stage, sometimes out of your sight if you don't move. So keep looking around and help Quill collect them all. It's a plattformer with fights, puzzles and it just oozes charm.\n\nThe story, as far as I can tell, is neatly told, it's definitely a childrens book story, but don't let that fool you.

This is done in VR, you use your controller to select elements and drag it around (Since you're playing the reader of the story, you're basically breaking the 4th wall).\n\nThe mouse is cute and makes some cute little noises, even if he dies.\n\nYou don't need a big room to play this game, actually you're supposed to play it sitting on a chair, you don't need to move at all, but sometimes you need to lean forward to be able to reach some elements in the world, it's a top-down view game (which is not shown in the trailers), it you play it sitting on a chair it feels like playing a board game, so don't worry you probably won't get motion sick.\n\nIt works perfectly with the Valve Index, all displayed controls shows the Valve Index controller.\n\nFramerates are good, it's not the most beautiful or detailed game, but it's still very beautiful, it uses the Unreal Engine 4.\n\n\nGreat game, I finished it after playing it for 5 hours, the story is not completed, this is just the story of Book number 1, but I hope there will be a second book.", "timestamp_created": 1572725765, "timestamp_updated": 1572734393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56289117": {"recommendationid": "56289117", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970282042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 1322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1609180473}, "language": "english", "review": "Was hoping for Valve to finish their '3' VR Games or BL2 VR to be my first VR game.

So got Transpose (which is fun and amazing graphics), but haven't finished it yet. Then decided to buy Moss. I'm so glad I did! The graphics and immersion is out of this world. \n\nYou feel like you're in a actual diarama set within a real location that matches it. As you look around your play area the plant life, beach, logs, rocks, cliffs are really there.  One scene had a deer that seemed so real. I hate mice, but Quill is so darn cute you can't help but like her. She'll want you to give her high fives after beating a puzzle, try to get your attention at times,... \n\nLike said, you just don't move Quill around like it is a 3rd person view of yourself. You do controller Quill most of the the time, but there is still interaction and Quill 'realizing' you're there and interaction with you (the Reader). That make it feel like more than a game, but team work.  \n\nThe controls work for the most part, sometimes they just take getting use to, other times seems like a chore. But so far the best in VR have tried, except for maybe The Lab (valve). The developer does a pretty good job of leading you in the direction you need to go. But at times (like with lot of games) have to go check out a youtube video of some gameplay to figure out what to do. Also wish there was a way if you were quick enough to save Quill when she falls into water or off an edge, but there isn't.\n\nSo far, with my limited VR and using anything other than a keyboard/mouse, I LOVE this game.

The art-style, the level design, the characters- every part of the execution draws you into this wonderful world where you are the floating eldritch giant mask, and before you is your stalwart mousy companion who you must guide, protect and cheer to victory.\n\nIn essence, a good game, on the premise that you don't get tilted easily.", "timestamp_created": 1569937443, "timestamp_updated": 1569937443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55345391": {"recommendationid": "55345391", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983197016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 190, "last_played": 1569989115}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fantastic.

At this point in time, I\u2019ve only logged an hour into the game. What I can say so far is that the graphics and game mechanics are absolutely amazing. The story is compelling and you feel a real sense of being a partner in the game as opposed to just being the player. This is easily a game that I could see myself getting sucked into. The puzzles (which are more like obstacles being that there\u2019s usually only a single solution) were entertaining, but not in any way complex. However, I felt that this only enhanced the game play and did not detract from it in any way. The combat system lacks a little to be desired, at least from what I was able to see so far\u2026 like I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve only logged an hour at this point. \n\nSo, you may be wondering\u2026 Why are you writing a review for a game that you\u2019re barely just gotten into? Well, I have to say that the controls for this game are nothing short of infuriating. At times it\u2019s smooth and seamless\u2026 then you find yourself spending minutes attempting to guide the character over an obstacle that should take a mere second. While I admit that it may be my personal controllers that are part of the problem, this is definitely not an isolated issue. I dare to say that the controls were so bad that I had to step away from the game and am not sure if I will be returning or not. The lack of gamepad controller support, or at the very least, ability to adjust the keys to improve maneuverability renders the game next to impossible for me to get into. There are hidden collectables in the game that contribute to the overall completion of the game, which I believe is a nice touch, however I am forced to skip these highly attainable items because I can\u2019t control the character to make the simplest of maneuvers accomplish this task. \n\nI don\u2019t want to hate on this game because it has the potential to be one of best VR games that I\u2019ve played. I just can\u2019t get passed the terrible controls at this time.\n\nIf I ever decide to return to this game, I will write a follow-up to describe my experience. But at this point in time\u2026 I just have to walk away from this game. I have too many other good games in my library to fuss with this one. I am still recommending this game to players.. perhaps you'll have a different experience than I have.

The puzzles are definitely designed from the ground up to be \"physical\", not just recycled from non-VR mechanics. The logic of them is consistent, and elements are introduced and built upon as you move through the game. Personally, I liked the \"remember to look everywhere\" aspect as well, as it encourages the player to really look at the scenery, not just speed through.\n\nUnfortunately, I really do need games that I can sit in one place and not have too much demand for time-sensitive actions, and there is first a slow ramp up on the number of (autonomously) moving parts in the puzzles, then a very significant spike that I just wasn't able to manage. Based on YouTube Videos, the spike is pretty close to the end of the game, so I am wondering if this is an example of Dev Testing (people very familiar with the game being the primary testers due to time pressure, leading to an unintentional difficulty spike).\n\nI am 5'2\", and had to get up and take a step or two to reach certain game elements, because the play area exceeded what I could reach from a stationary position, and there is no way to scoot your avatar around except to physically walk. Given that the two modes listed are Seated and Standing, I found this disappointing. My VR area is not set up for this behavior.\n\nI am aware, however, that my situation is unusual, so unless you are under similar constraints, I say grab it and enjoy. :-)", "timestamp_created": 1562267098, "timestamp_updated": 1562267098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605381131172180176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53533466": {"recommendationid": "53533466", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971775968", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1668819764}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR, if you own a VR headset, [b]you MUST play this game.[/b]\n\nThis game would still be a fantastic experience even [i]without[/i] VR.

Well worth the sale price and I think this is a mandatory play for anyone with a VR headset.\n\nThe good:\nMoss is a great game that displays a high amount of polish and delivers a very enjoyable VR experience. The combination of the music, level design and setting, novel interactions with characters and set-pieces, and absolutely adorable little mouse companion make this into one of my mandatory VR plays.\n\nThe concept of a top-down/platformer RPG in VR works far better than I expected. The experience of being inside highly detailed miniature worlds is an effect only capable in VR, and is a novel experience that doesn't lose its magic throughout the game and provides an entirely new way to build and solve puzzles. The disconnection from the body of the VR player from the game world lets animators deliver smooth animations that lend to a feeling of polish not found in many FPS titles that need to map models and animations to the players real-world body. This allows the decades of advancement in modeling, texturing, and animation, found in normal flat-screen gaming, to apply to a VR world without any of the jankyness found in IK rigs or other compromises in many VR titles. This creates an environment that creates a powerful sense of immersion. My wife, who's not a gamer at all, was able to fall in love and play this game for a solid 6 hours straight in a day. Completely unthinkable in any other title.\n\nThe concept of the Brothers Grimm-esqe fantasy, of a little mouse running through a fantasy medieval world is an excellent choice for the physical scale of the world. Levels are beautiful to look at, interacting with Quill is adorable, solving puzzles is engaging, and the music sets the atmosphere. My only real gripe is that I wish it was longer.\n\nI hope this game sets a standard going forward, and we continue to see games in this genere progress, and its concepts brought over to eventual table-top games, RTS, and city-building games. \n\nThe bad:\n- Needs to be longer. There is a content update however, but the game is so much fun I don't want it to end.\n- Lacks some depth of gameplay. The levels are well designed, the combat is fun, and there's the chest of weapon and skill upgrades throughout the game that reminds me of earlier Zelda titles. I do wish however that there was more stuff to find, more easter-eggs, more gear, harder boss fights, side-quests, mini-games or secondary skills, and more NPCs to talk to. The game is the main story-arc and that's it.\n- Story is a bit shallow and predictable. It's bog standard fantasy, but feels too much like a derivative of a Brothers Grimm tale. \n- Needs a better on-boarding experience. No tips or tutorials, you just kinda have to figure out the controls for yourself, and the only controller tips that pop up at the beginning of the game are very low contrast and difficult to see.\n", "timestamp_created": 1562184247, "timestamp_updated": 1562184247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53342819": {"recommendationid": "53342819", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973826440", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1666924041}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is GREAT VR platformer and the story is a good one.

And at every turn, the interactions you have with Quill can really only be described as bonding. With every puzzle solved, sometimes harder than others, Quill will give you a thumbs up and music will strike up this pride of being just smart enough. Stuck on a puzzle? Quill will wave at you to get your attention and begin to point and mime out how to solve it- all while providing completely necessary little vocal sound effects. It's really cute. \nCombat feels just as satisfying. Dashing and sword play is just fun and hoard sequences are great and also reward you with that closer bonding connection sitting and by the end of it. And, with the new update, you get to interact with Quill with regards to combat that feels even more intimate. [spoiler] You can eventually unlock a sword that you can touch and use to fire ranged projectiles. At this point Quill is practically channeling your power, and that connection becomes literal. [/spoiler]\n\nIn total, this game is part experience, part puzzle platformer, part mini sword fighter, and it makes you love every second of it.

In it, players take control of a small mouse named Quill who, armed with a sword and a lot of heart, will find herself battling, jumping, and climbing her way through several landscapes to save her uncle Argus. Though unlike other third-person VR games, you aren't just left as an unnamed entity floating in the void; you are known as The Reader, and you will find yourself working in tandem with Quill to help her on her quest. There's a fairly deep story that encompasses the past, present, and future of Quill's race, and while the game doesn't end on a cliffhanger it does leave room for another installment.\n\nMuch like Theseus, this release places the camera in a stagnant spot that allows for optimal viewing of the current location. Players that might find themselves prone to motion sickness will be pleased to know that there is no camera movement whatsoever; unlike Along Together, which finds the camera panning with the movement of the characters. Although Moss is a seated experience, I found that a handful of locations required me to stand up to see where to move Quill and how to pass certain areas, so those that are completely chair-bound may not be able to participate in this adventure; at least not without a guide or some guesstimation.\n\nThe only real downside to Moss are the controls. After spending just a little over an hour in the game, I'm finding that my hands are aching and cramped due to the convoluted layout and semi-faulty mechanics. Everything works pretty well so long as you're taking your time, but moving fast is of the essence the closer you get to the end of the game. Trying to maneuver Quill in a speedy manner causes many control-related deaths, as she doesn't seem to want to grab on to a ledge unless she jumps at it perfectly straight-on. Additionally, she seems to want to stop running and start walking if you hit the dead zones between directional inputs. Evading attacks is nearly pointless as well, as you must push left and then right to perform the slow technique.\n\nWhat makes Moss so special isn't its graphics, which are decently life-like, or its amazing soundtrack, but the interaction between yourself and Quill. At the end of my playthrough, I found myself very attached to this little mouse, and I felt a real sense of sadness in my heart each time she died. A few times I found myself instinctively reaching out to try and catch her before she fell. This bond is started from the very beginning of the game, as Quill will even look at you as curiously as you look at her; we all do it, getting really close to certain models to try and inspect them as thoroughly as possible.\n\nIf you're looking for an extremely fun seated adventure, then Moss is definitely a worthwhile investment. The price isn't too steep, considering the campaign length is roughly 4-5 hours depending on how good or bad you are at platforming. There's also some replayability if you're interested in finding hidden collectibles. The real satisfaction in playing this game is the unique bond that you'll end up feeling with Quill by the end of it all; as you've high-fived, cheered, bickered, and otherwise interacted with each other for the entire event. Moss is another excellent example of how third-person games can, will, and do work in a VR environment.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]4.0/5.0[/b] - Excellent, highly worth playing.[/h1]\nThe VR Network [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33182845-The-VR-Network/]Curator[/url] | [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/thevrnetwork]Group[/url] Click for More", "timestamp_created": 1554535333, "timestamp_updated": 1554535931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717783331871032715", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49978067": {"recommendationid": "49978067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026668706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1554506049}, "language": "english", "review": "The game might be good if you can ever get it to work!

I can't remember any game I ever played before where after beating it I immediately started over again from the beginning. Two things I wish I had known from the start: (1) The game defaults to \"low\" quality, but there is a higher quality setting available from the menu (if your computer can handle it) that makes it a lot better. (2) The game tells you \"this is a seated VR experience\" and prompts you to sit at your desk and clear some space so you can reach out in front of you. Actually the best way to experience this game, if you have some space, is to start sitting or kneeling in the middle of your floor. That way the game will default by placing the scenes directly in front of you with the floor about floor level (it's like having a diorama or toy model laid out in front of you) and you can return to that position, but you can also stand up and get a better perspective, crawl around and look in every cranny, etc. That may sound ridiculous, but, really, it's the best way.", "timestamp_created": 1553224048, "timestamp_updated": 1553224048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49669045": {"recommendationid": "49669045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838083641", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1553036812}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

Think Lara Croft in mouse form. Took me about 4hrs to complete but I wasn't hurrying as I read the reviews saying it was short and I also haven't gone back to get all the extras. Not sure its worth it's full price but at the 30% discount price I felt it was just about value for money (If you see it at 50% off then definitely). So far none of the levels have been especially taxing and I'm hoping there are some proper challenges getting to all the pieces of parchment and not just because there's a few difficult jumps to make.\n\nLike many on Vive I found the controls sucked and was struggling to move Quill even in the first few simple stages. However looking at the control options there is touch move and single button jump. Enabling both of those made the whole thing playable ... right up to the last level where there are rushed platform jumps. How many times must I die because I can't get the stupid rat to run! I was swearing so loudly I woke my wife! I think in those stages any movements should be running, you're being chased after all!\n\nAlso getting a controlled enemy to fire has an unnecessary aim on it, you just need it to fire in the direction of the bug under control as that is much easier to direct. I'm still not sure if the direction of fire is relative to the bugs direction or absolute to my controller and I've finished the game, fortunately most of the time it doesn't matter as you just blast away till you hit the switch.\n\nMy last bug bare is mice can swim!\n\nOverall though I liked the game but like many others I found the default controls suck on Vive (they're better if you use 1 button jump but still not great). I think Moss would have been amazing as a point and click style adventure (e.g. Monkey Island) and far better suited to VR wands.

Let's boil it down to the basics, then start with the positives:\n\nMoss is a 3D platformer controlled from a side-on view. I used the Vive controller, and with this you steer the protagonist, a mouse called Quill, with the left trackpad, controlling jumps and swings of her sword with the right.\n\nThe positives:\n\nThe game is visually gorgeous. The presentation, where you lean into the game space like some small diorama unfolding below you, is very effective and quite unique, in my experience. It's worth getting just for its looks, in my opinion. The design of the levels hints of a larger world in the background (literally, in some  cases).\n\nQuill is full of personality, interacting with the player's avatar (occasionally holding out for a high-five)\n\nAs for the player's avatar, you don't see yourself much, just the hovering, glowing globes of your 'hands', but you look like the cousin of No-Face from Spirited Away, which has to be a plus point.\n\nOK, the downsides:\n\nIt's not super long. I played it for about 5 hours, and my playtime was probably extended because of:\n\nTHE CONTROLS.\n\nNow, this is as much an issue with the Vive's controllers as with the game. The touchpads can degrade in functionality, and this is a game that needs them at peak responsiveness. Jumps and attacks can fail to register, though the alternate mode which uses the whole touchpad to jump and the menu button to attack, ameliorates this somewhat.\n\nHowever, steering a character in 3D space using a touchpad with no real directional reference doesn't really work all that well, especially when trying to line up jumps.\n\nFor a controller that's so temperamental, jumps shouldn't need quite the pin-point accuracy demanded in this game. It's easy to miss a jump because your press missed, or you pressed early in the hope of getting it to register. You generally don't have to go far back to retry, but in a few cases you get put back at the beginning of a tense sequence. Frustration can build.\n\nEven though I've spent most of this review complaining about the controls, I still recommend Moss.", "timestamp_created": 1551196447, "timestamp_updated": 1551196447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49051321": {"recommendationid": "49051321", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993909913", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1548614649}, "language": "english", "review": "Great atmosphere and storytelling.

It might just be because I suck at platforming.\n\nThe animation is where this game shines, Quill is very expressive and I loved the creative use of sign language. The environments are also a ton of fun to be immersed in, I wish I could just stand up and wander through this world. Don't pull out a chair though, as sometimes the camera demands you crawl around or kneel to get a better angle.\n\nThe story... its a good story but the cutscenes being in book format really took me out of it. At first it was a minor annoyance but near the end when I was getting really immersed I wanted to scream in frustration every time the gripping narrative ripped me out of the moment and placed me back in the dang book-room. This is VR, embrace the show-don't-tell story telling. Let ME illuminate Quill's way, let ME put my hand on her shoulder. I don't need exposition telling me she feels close to me when I comfort her, the animation quality is so good it can speak for itself!\n\nI forgot, female main character. So if you want more representation in games... here ya go. : P\n\nFinally: Its a pretty short game. I sucked and ended up dying a TON and still beat it in 3 hours. I'm sure I'm an outlier, it probably takes more like 1-2 hours to beat. For $30s that does not seem... good especially if you're gonna pull the cliff hanger bit.\n\nPlay this if you: Like story telling in games, are intrigued by the world, prioritize animation/graphical quality, want a sort of Zelda style platformer in vr, want a nice game for your kid. (violence is pretty well censored, cartoony aesthetic works well for this)\n\nAvoid if you: Really hate platformers, really want a room scale game that lets you run around, or are playing this for exercise.

The visuals are very good, and it runs beautifully with no problems on my system. Ultimately though it is a platformer and being someone who has never liked platformers, as much as I have tried to like it after two sessions I am unlikelly to ever finish it.   I knew it was a platformer before I bought it, I wished it was not, but still wanted to give it a chance.  It is a short game apparently, but it lost me before I could find out.\n\nThe single narratator / story time style of voice acting works with the premise, but I see it as more a budgetary decision than a design choice as there are points where the experience would be improved if there were other voices for some characters. Over all sound and atmosphere are well done.\n\nI agree with others who find the control scheme somewhat lacking.   I suspect this is because I am a PC gamer and have never even had a console, or really used a controller.  This game feels like it should be used with a console type controller, the haptic discs on the vive wands feel a little akward for this kind of movement. The VR controllers really only come in to play when you must move (clumsily) specific elements of the scene. \n\nI wish to encourage and support VR as a format and think the devs have created a very polished and lovely little game.  I am not convinced this is the best use of VR, or if any 3rd person perspective game ever will be. I am interested what the devs can do on their next project.  If you think this is an amazing use of VR I do not think you have seen it in sims like DCS, IL2 or Elite, or first person mele like Gorn.

She proceeded to do the entire playthrough of \"the mouse game\" so this review is from her point of view.\n\nPROS\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe nuances\u201d - Quill interacts and looks at you. She is aware that you are there and that gives her a convincing sense of realism.\n\n\u2022 The puzzles in the game are not related to intellect but instead rely on becoming familiar with the environment and how the pieces of the environment interact with each other.\n\n\u2022 Loved that it was built around a storybook that you could read as you went. It\u2019s very reminiscent of the Never Ending Story.\n\n\u2022 It was just, and I quote, \"awesome cool.\"\n\nCONS\n\n\u2022 It would be nice if Quill was able to offer better hints to help with puzzles and battles; not enough to give things away but to be more interactive in finding solutions. Sometimes you feel completely responsible for Quill and it would be better to have more of a balanced partnership.\n\n\u2022 Emotionally you can feel \u201cleft out\u201d in the sense of either being solely responsible for Quill or feeling as if there isn\u2019t that much you can do during gameplay. For instance: if you interact with some of the monsters, the monster don\u2019t seem to be aware of your presence and yet in other situations you are the only one who can hold the monsters at bay. \n\n\u2022 Because of the realism of the game, Quill dying can cause emotional responses, especially for younger players. For example, my mom\u2019s game glitched and instead of Quill fighting the monsters, it looked like she was trying to hide against you (The Reader) for help.

It's very charming and production values are constantly high. Graphics are nice and pretty and the game ran perfectly on my GTX 1080. There isn't much depth to its mechanics, they're also very simple, but it's so short that it doesn't get old.

The story is cute, the basic plot seems borrowed from Never Ending Story: you are the reader of a magic book and you help the characters in it overcome their obstacles. This plot works better in a movie because the viewer is not putting itself in the shoes of the character who is reading the book, but in the videogame, the player is the reader and that just sounds weird. Maybe the game should have acknowledged me as the gamer already. The game starts with you looking at a book and flipping its pages and you'll go back to this scene several times during the game. The actual game is really cool though, it's a regular 3D platformer with \"static\" cameras (as static as it can be in VR) and you move from \"room to room\" (not literal rooms, but almost like pages in an illustrated book), solving puzzles and jumping on platforms. Then you get back to the book staring part for more story exposition, and that it's so boring compared to the rest of the game that I sigh in frustration every time it happens in the game.\n\nThere are some glaring interface problems here. I felt I was off center in the world and I wanted to reset my view for the game so I pressed the oculus menu and it glitched the hell out. So I thought maybe the game has the option. It does not have any VR settings at all. So I figured I'll just save, close and open the game.  I opened up the menu to save the game. There was the option there \"save\". You click on it and another menu pops up with some slots. If you click the one already filled you might think it will replace the old save but it asks if you want to load that. Well, no, I thought I was in the save menu. So I clicked on the empty one just in case, then it asks if I want to start a new game. What? why would you think that? You know what? the game probably autosaved anyway so I'll just quit the game. Where is the quit option? *sigh*. I'll just Alt+F4 out of it. \n\nOther than that clumsy interface the game works fine and it was great fun. Very adventurous, very cute, very fun. I like it.\n\nThis is one of the games that instigated my latest moment of realization about VR: 3D platformers existed in the wrong time and the wrong medium. And VR is being used to showcase the wrong kind of game; first person games in VR suffer from locomotion and nausea problems. It's as if all along we have been using peanut butter to lubricate door hinges and putting DW-40 in our sandwiches! I mean, look at this game. It suffers none of the problems those 3D platformers did from PS1 and nintendo 64 era. And they work out of the box, no nausea, no weird teleporting business going on here.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1543774039, "timestamp_updated": 1543774039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47250463": {"recommendationid": "47250463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012186724", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1550227866}, "language": "english", "review": "To be honest, I didn't anticipated too much for this game.

It was during a weighty encounter with a bunch of enemies that the controller would stop responding, or I'd be mid sword swing so I couldn't jump out of the way when enemies killed me. I died maybe a dozen times to pass this encounter and it almost cost me a new pair of Vive controllers to do so.

That is kind of a big issue for a game like this, where you're supposed to do fairly accurate jumps every now and then. Even jumps that don't require pin-point accuracy involve quite a bit of luck thanks to this.\n\nb) On top of that, Quill's \"character animations\" seem to take precedence over player input: She refused to start running in a \"timed jump\" section because she was currently waving at me. Yes, her animations are awesome and make her very likable, but that should not take precedence over gameplay.\n\nThe positives of the game include great voice-overs that give a nice \"fairy tale\" mood, great looking animations and very nice presentation overall that really sells the setting. The story so far seems servicable, but after a bit over an hour, I don't think I should consider that.\n\nSadly, the controls kill the enjoyment I otherwise have with the game.

It has some cleverly designed levels which call for smart interactions of the VR controllers. It is certainly a joy to play through. However, it is held back by a less than persuasive story, some minor bugs along the way, and a forgettable sound track.\n \nWe are introduced to the game while turning the pages of a book which tells a tale of woe in the land of Moss. While recounting the backstory we come across our protagonist, Quill. We are told that a bond between the player and Quill is created. The plot left a lot to be desired, along with the characters that had some questionable lines. But as far as I was concerned, that was all the justification I needed in order to enjoy the amazing experience of seeing a game come to life right in front of me! This was my first experience playing a 3rd person game in VR and I am so excited about the new prospects this point of view opens up for VR. Everything about this game in VR made it look and feel great. From a quaint village in the forest, to the ruins of grand hallways, the attention to detail when it came to the environment can be greatly appreciated. Lighting, suitable sound effects and beautifully rendered textures all lend to a wonderfully immersive experience. Running Quill through each level, solving puzzles and fighting enemies felt like she was an actual action figure that had come to life. \n\n\nWhile Moss could be titled as a platformer, and it does a good enough job, it isn\u2019t its strongest suit. Some areas which require jumping can be frustrating, as not being lined up exactly as you should leads to some your death. Miss a ledge ever so slightly and Quill will hurtle down with not so much as a falling animation. It\u2019s not that it is difficult to line up and time jumps in 3D, it\u2019s just that Quill doesn\u2019t feel as responsive and smooth as she should for a platformer. In some areas I managed to run off a ledge but jumped anyway and was surprised to see Quill respond, jumping as if she wasn\u2019t in free fall. Also, I found that after landing a jump and with my thumb still pressing forward, Quill would not continue moving and force to let go and press forward again. While they weren't game breaking issues, the finicky controls became much more apparent towards the end of the game, when it demanded well-timed and accurate platforming.  \n\n\nThis game instead shines with its interactive and rewarding puzzles. While Quill needs to get from A to B, you as the player may need to interact with the environment. Perhaps being required to pull a lever, or move a platform up. This involvement added another dimension to the game. The game builds on this by also adding other layers to puzzles such as manipulating enemies and making sure Quill is in the right place. Throw in some more enemies that are actively trying to kill you and it suddenly becomes challenging and a blast to play. The puzzles were never too vague, and I did feel satisfied when I overcame them. Being required to actively interact may have contributed to a deeper sense of achievement and self-satisfaction. I also appreciated the collectibles in the game. In each scene there are hidden scrolls which, once collected, add a piece to a mosaic. While some are in plain sight, others are more well-hidden and may require a second run through to find them all. Unlike other games, where collectibles progress is hidden in menus, you get to see the artwork after each chapter. The collectibles offer a fun treasure hunt and some incentive to play again.\n\n\nCombat in the game is a welcome addition. Moss isn\u2019t a hack and slash game by any means, so I wasn\u2019t expecting to smash the controller as I usually do, but the lack of different attack moves and combos was felt. It would have been impressive to have seen different weapon types, and armour upgrades. A lack of an in-game HUD showing your vitals was also missing, instead you are warned of Quills closeness to death by a heartbeat sound. There were no bosses except for the final one hopefully we can see more bosses and other improvements to combat in a sequel that may happen as they would a lot of character to the game.\n\n\n\nMoss is one of those few VR titles that feels like a full game and isn't in early access. It included a bit of everything from platforming, fighting, collectibles, puzzles, story, and player interaction. You definitely get your money\u2019s worth with this title. While some of these elements weren\u2019t exactly perfect, they were still decent enough that you could enjoy the game. Especially, when you can appreciate this fantastic immersive world in VR that has been superbly designed. Considering that the VR gaming market is still in its early stages, this game opens the realms of possibilities for so many other titles. Hopefully we can see more 3rd person perspective titles in VR. Personally, I can\u2019t wait till we see a \u2018Little Nightmares\u2019 or \u2018Inside\u2019, but a fighting game would equally be welcome.

I have to be honest, I didn't think this game was worth $29.99 USD (it took me about 3.5 hours to finish which is what I had read was about the average time to finish). I thought people were overreacting to what probably was a better version of Lucky's Tales or Alone Together. Those are good games, but they are not great games. This is a great game. If you look at the Steam store page video or the screen shots, you'll see the parts but not the whole. The whole is a wonderful, immersive storybook experience that only VR can bring to life.\n\nThe funny thing is that I really wasn't enraptured with this game during the first hour or so. I thought, well this is just like Alone Together. It's really nothing special. In truth, it is very similar to Alone Together. In both games you're pushing / pulling devices / solving puzzles to move your cartoony hero forward. But that's really where the similarity both begins and ends.\n\nMoss has a story to tell ... even more than that, an experience to feel. It starts out very simple. It's almost easy to be dismissive of it as just another unlikely hero tasked with saving the world. It actually reminded me of Frodo from Lord of the RIngs.

One day Quill finds a magical glass that summons a \"Reader\", a much larger being with the ability to control the world around Quill. You also play the Reader.\n\nGuiding Quill home, you meet Uncle Argus, an old mouse warrior, who is surprised and scared when she reveals you. He tells her that the magical glass that summoned you is very dangerous. Setting off into the night with nary a word, Uncle Argus only tells Quill that she can't leave the house until he returns.\n\nAs if she's going to listen to that ... .\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\nI was a little disappointed with Moss to begin with. The game started in a sort of church-like building, with a book on a stand waiting for me to read it. Using the controllers I reached out and turned the page, and the story began, with a voice actor introducing the background of the world. It was all a bit ho-hum.\n\nOnce the introduction was finished, though, I found myself floating in the beautiful, lush forest of the Clearing, watching Quill as she foraged about and uncovered her magical treasure. Then she looked up and saw me, and waited for me to do something, and I looked down and saw myself reflected in the gently flowing stream. It was at this point that I realised that this was the best-looking VR game I'd played. Screenshots don't do it justice.\n\nWhile the game is made up of a number of somewhat-disconnected screens, the world they create is wonderfully realised. So much detail has gone into each area, I still find myself simply wanting to look around and watch the world go by -- something which makes the lack of manual save points even more frustrating. Quill and the other mice in her community look simply amazing, with detailed models, beautiful textures, and realistic, but also fantastic animations. The game perfectly presents the feeling of watching a living, breathing world inhabited by tiny creatures.\n\nMusic, too, is wonderful, and sound effects are vibrant and suit the game perfectly. Voice work is limited to the book-reading sections between each major area change, and I have to say that the voice actor didn't do a great job. While the feeling of someone reading a children's book was well realised, I found the voices annoying enough that I wanted to skip through these sections quickly, for the most part.\n\nPerformance was fine on my GTX1070-based gaming laptop.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nMoss is essentially a 3D action platformer with some basic puzzles, most of which are related to moving or rotating special glowing platforms. You play both the protagonist, Quill, and the Reader, yourself, and I thought this dichotomy ruined the otherwise fantastic sense of immersion that the game provides. I would have been much happier with more to do as the Reader, indirectly signalling for Quill to proceed, rather than having direct control over her. I also think that would have removed some of the game's frustrations.\n\nThe game is fairly short. I've taken my time with it, mainly because of control issues, but I've seen others have completed it in a handful of hours. It's made up of a number of small set-piece style levels or screens, each of which typically has a platforming puzzle to solve, enemies to kill, or both. Puzzles tend to be mostly the same -- drag this or rotate that -- while also controlling Quill in typical third-person platformer fashion, and combat is fairly repetitive, though the use of the Reader's glowy hand powers to help is a nice touch. There's a reasonable sense of progression as your make your way through the game, but after the first couple of hours I found it a bit of a hard slog, fighting more with the game itself than Quill's enemies.\n\nBeyond some occasional technical weirdness, the game's limitations become evident after only a relatively short time. First, there are no manual saves; it's all checkpoint-based. If you want to go back and try to get a scroll or even just look at the pretty graphics a couple of screens before your current location, generally it's just bad luck. You can't! You can only restart each 'chapter' or resume from your previous position. Some of the puzzles aren't great, either. On one screen shortly after the first boss I found myself trying to jump onto a ledge that was right in front of me. Quill could jump on one right next to it fine because it had the 'magic' scratchy-looking texture, but not this one, even though it was the exact same height, distance, etc. It ruined the immersion a bit; there's no logical reason why she could only jump on the ledge the developers chose and not the one that I did.\n\nControls are wonky, too, and were the main reason I still haven't finished the game. I thought it was my hacked-together VR rig -- and I'm still convinced it's much harder than it should be because of this -- but seeing reviews from HTC Vive owners, I suspect there are actually problems with the core control scheme, too. Quill will sometimes move of her own accord, and camera angles, while changeable by looking around, do also tend to make jumps a bit hard to judge. I also found Quill's inertia and friction a bit off; why is the ground so slippery!?\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\nPros:\n+ Wonderful immersion and interaction with Quill\n+ Beautiful world and characters\n+ Steam VR Collectible\n\nCons:\n- Weird dual-control ideas\n- Long load times\n- Checkpoint saves\n- Some nonsensical restrictions\n- Expensive\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nLet me say straight up that Moss is the most impressive looking VR game I've played so far. It's worth checking out simply because of that.\n\nOkay, now that's out of the way, let me tell you why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.\n\nMoss is a perfect example of style over substance. It's short and its gameplay, while interesting because of the interface, is actually fairly simplistic, even bland in places. The game's premise is immersion: it draws you in right from the start, when Quill looks at you with wonder, and you glance down and see yourself -- a floating mask -- reflected in a stream. But then it takes that sense of immersion and shatters it. Why am I controlling Quill AND myself? I kept wondering. Here are my glowing hand-thingies, which I can move around to change Quill's world and allow her to progress, but why, then, do I also control her? For me the wonderful sense of immersion that the game produced was all but destroyed by this. Why is Quill prompting me for a high five after solving a puzzle when I both controlled the world and her to do it? The realisation that I was giving myself a high-five was too much.\n\nBut the game looks and feels SO darn good. The set pieces are phenomenal, like a sprawling fantasy doll's house come to life. Quill is amazing, too; her animations and reactions are so lifelike.\n\nSo I heartily recommend Moss as a VR experience. As a game, well, if you like 3D platformers and you don't mind fiddly controls and nonsensical platforming restrictions then it's probably worth a look from that point of view, too. Just bear in mind that it is very short for the price.\n\n[h1]Save for Later[/h1]\n\nNote: I played this game on an Android phone using VRidge / Riftcat, with emulated Vive tracked motion controls.\n\n[code]For more game reviews, visit [url=http://saveorquit.com/]Save or Quit[/url].[/code]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1533357003, "timestamp_updated": 1533357003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605328619480133057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43911597": {"recommendationid": "43911597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035083966", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1533311627}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the Best games I ever played in VR, the immersion, sense of scale, music and the character and level design make it a Must-Have in the Library.

This allows you more precise directional control, and you will need it! The Vive trackpads are simply abysmal at this. (Thankfully, Valve seem to realise this and are adding joysticks to the Knuckles controllers.) You can play the whole game and all required actions this way, using the right hand Vive controller for grabbing things as well as the jump and attack buttons (which work fine via the trackpad).\n\n2) After loading the game, go into the in-game Settings menu and change the graphics quality. It defaults to Low, even on a 1080ti, which is jaggy city. Worked great on High for me, but YMMV. Game engine ignores the supersampling setting in SteamVR so don't bother with that.\n\nNow the review:\n\nI usually ignore sit-down VR games as I feel they miss half the point of VR, but I gave this one a chance and it was definitely worth it. You are sat down, but you'll be reaching into the scene to manipulate objects and enemies, and you'll be leaning and bending around to find hidden secrets in the world or peer through windows, like looking into a doll's house where you control one of the characters. The diorama style graphics work really, really well in VR and it is quite an experience in places. Sometimes I had to stand up to get an eagle-eye view of the scene and see if anything was hidden high up. It's a traditional side-on 3D platformer in a way, but it really uses VR as well.\n\nA really charming game, not too challenging but not trivially easy either. I died in quite a few places, and occasionally wasn't sure what to do, but I always progressed after thinking about things for a few minutes, and never had to look up a solution. Total playtime was 5.4 hours, and most of that was my first playthrough; I then used chapter select to find the 5 or so collectibles I was missing, which maybe counted for 30-60 minutes of that time. (Far as I can tell, collectibles don't do anything except fill in some objects in the intermission area, so they're totally optional, but I like collecting hidden stuff, and only missed a few. The game tells you which chapters the missing things are in and lets you jump to a chapter.) Pretty good length for a VR game, and a decent price given VR remains a risky, niche market and this is a really charming, polished game, with great graphics and animations, a nice story, and well done gameplay.\n\nFor those unsure what kind of game it is, each area is a stationary scene that you sit in front of. You control a little mouse directly using directional input, with jump and attack buttons. You can also reach into the scene to move things around and manipulate objects and enemies. You have to solve platforming puzzles and sometimes some combat to get through each scene, at which point it fades out and the next scene fades in. (You can usually look left or right to see the adjacent scenes; the fading is just so you don't have to keep moving around in the real world, really.)\n\nIt's quite a traditional game in some ways, but uses VR really well at the same time. It's nice to see something really shine in VR that isn't just another wave shooter.\n\nIf there is a sequel, I'll buy it on release day for sure.

Scroll to the bottom to see if it is worth getting. \n\n[h1]Story [/h1]\nThe story follows a brave little mouse Quill. She finds an ancient \u201cglass relic\u201d while exploring the woods near her village. Quill takes her finding back home to ask her old uncle if he knows anything about it.  He tells Quill that magic powers have awoken and that she is in grave danger now. The rest you will learn throughout the game. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\t\nMoss is a seated VR experience. The game is presented as a storybook that is being read to you by a narrator. You are being addressed as [i]a reader[/i]. Although you are not the main character you are still a part of the story. In [b]Moss[/b] you play as yourself and you also have a direct control over Quill. \n\nThe game largely plays as a 3rd person action-platformer. Quill can jump, climb and fight enemies with a tiny sword. As [i]a reader[/i] your hands are being represented by glowing orbs. You help Quill to solve puzzles, clear paths by moving blocks and interacting with different mechanisms that are too large for Quill. You can also heal Quill if she gets injured.\n\nBoth of you form a solid team. Quill will always point you in the right direction if you don\u2019t know what to do. She even high fives you when you get the solution right! \n\n[b]Moss[/b] is a linear game split into multiple chapters that can be replayed at any time. Each chapter has a number of hidden collectibles (\u201crelic dust\u201d and \u201cforgotten fragments\u201d). These collectibles are purely optional but it provides a fun additional challenge and a reason to revisit the game. \n\n[h1]Visuals and Sound [/h1]\nThe game\u2019s magical world is very beautiful. Quill feels alive, her movements are very smooth. Since every scene is concentrated right in front of the player, Polyarc was able to achieve the level of polish that many current gen VR games are lacking. It really is like being inside a fairy tale. \nSound effects and music are great. The narration is also done very well. \n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\nThe game is well optimized and runs great. I did not experience any technical issues whatsoever. \n[i]For Oculus Rift users:[/i] Steam version uses Oculus SDK and should be identical to an Oculus Store version. There is a native Touch support. Steam VR does not need to be running.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n[b]Moss[/b] is a carefully crafted game with beautiful graphics and a heartwarming story. Both combat and puzzles offer a decent challenge but are never too difficult or frustrating. It is a very unique VR experience and a great game overall. This is an easy recommendation for me.\nThe sequel is already in the works. I hope it will be even bigger and better.

It should be a nice journey. \n\nHowever, It also brought me frustration. It is from the control issue, besides always slide automatically and Quill seems always wearing a pair of skates. \nI don't know it is on purpose, while I controlling the shooting enemy, I cannot control Quill to attack or so. And turn the enemy around feels... a bit tricky on control. \n\nI am still checking if it is my controller's issue that the attack and jump pad button from left and right become left and top. And often has the issue of responding...which makes me falling off multiple cliffs multiple times. \n\nAnd talks about the times that fall off cliffs, I am not sure i am too noob for this or it is meant to show the \"a little\" for jumping. 5/6 of my death is due to fall off the cliff and spend most of my time to jump on the cylindrical rock(and so on...). Sometimes...you just don't know why you cant jump from this side and only on one certain point which both of them are at same height... For that reason, I give up for the collection. \n\nAnyway.

Promising, but only a beginning.\n\nTo give the game it's due, it is a fantastic concept and it pushes boundaries of how we can think about VR games and what we can do with them. The first time I was truly in the world, seeing my reflection in the water, Quill looking up at me, feeling the world all around me I genuinely cried from the beauty and the wonder of all of it.\n\nHere's the bad: the controls drove me up the wall, the story is incomplete to the point of feeling incredibly frustrating and frankly the game is lacking a lot of polish. One example: in the middle of solving a puzzle Quill paused to ask for a high-five, however as this puzzle required timed jumping, the fact that she stopped meant we had to reset the puzzle and solve it again in order to actually complete the damn thing. \n\nAnother big problem is the way you control Quill means you're going to miss about half of the jumps you attempt, which normally results in either dying or an amount of rework that is almost as frustrating. This specific problem rips any sense of immersion to shreds, and I partly think the only reason you have this kind of direct control over Quill is because the devs didn't want to take the risk of having the player completely hands-off with her. I do think the game could have done amazingly if the gameplay was about plotting out a route for Quill and having her do her best to follow your directions. Combat could have been handled by a combination of painting targets for her to strike and controlling the battlefield directly through manipulating the environment and enemies. Instead I got to watch my precious girl jump to her death time and again because there's just no good way to control someone from a second person perspective.\n\nI really do think this is a promising beginning, I really love the way they creators are telling their story and I love my poor uncoordinated mouse-child with all my heart, but damn does she have a way to go before I start recommending this game the way I wish I could.", "timestamp_created": 1529067205, "timestamp_updated": 1529067205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42735571": {"recommendationid": "42735571", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974559349", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1575225378}, "language": "english", "review": "Played it on Oculus and its otherworldly.

I won't deny that I have some reservations, and it's hardly flawless, but overall I walked away from the game feeling mostly satisfied with the adventure.\n\nWhile you control an adorable mouse protagonist called Quill through level after level in a fantasy world, I wouldn't call Quill the player character. The 'hook' of Moss is that you, the player, are a seperate entity in the world, guiding Quill and helping her with simple controls by interacting with the world around her by grabbing, lifting, moving and generally just manipulating specific objects. Each new level is like a beautiful charming little diorama, with enemies, platforming and puzzles to overcome. \n\nThe player is, however, limited in what they can do. A few more details and options in how the player interacts with the world would have been welcome. It's understandable why they designed it the way they did, though, ensuring that it doesn't become too complex to develop. At one point I thought they introduced an interesting mechanic where the player had to light the way in complete darkness... but it's never actually realized and goes away almost as quickly as it's introduced.\n\nThe game is quite forgiving, having frequent checkpoints and allowing the player to heal Quill in just a few seconds. There might be one or two moments where you need to multitask, keeping Quill out of harms way while having to look the other way, but being difficult hardly seems like a goal of the game. It just wants to be an approachable fun adventure, and it mostly nails this.\n\nIt's a fun adventure that's definitely worth your time, but that said, I do have some gripes.\n\nThe biggest problem to me, and the one I'll focus on here, is the fact that parts of the story falls flat in my eyes. While Quill is adorable and very likable, other characters don't get a lot of time to be more than archetypes. I kind of struggle to think of why some of them even existed.\n\nThe good people at Polyarc Games have decided to tell the story in the way of you, the player, reading about Quill's adventure in a book. I like this approach on a practical level, allowing some scenes to have a better focus on important exposition without being too demanding for developers and animators, but I can't help but to feel it could have been better implemented to tell a more invovled story. \n\nThe whole adventure is narrated by a single voice actress. While the voice actress in question is clearly talented and even has some range, I personally dislike a narration of this type. That's very subjective, of course, so feel free to ignore me about this.\n\nI still really like the charming tiny fantasy world they've created here. It's not original a bit of the time, but it's implemented well with a slew of little details. I could really see a sequel take this to new heights, fleshing out the world and adding even more character (and actual characters) to this world of Moss.\n\nI once learned that while traditional media should generally go for \"Show, don't tell\", games should instead go for \"Do, don't show\". There's a segment late in the game that, due to the choice of telling the story through a storybook, falls kind of flat. It's supposed to be a important, resonating emotional moment between the player and Quill that allows her to grow as a character, but it feels weaker than it should be. Instead of *Doing* it through an in-game interaction such as cheering up a distraught little mouse with a friendly gesture, or *Showing* it through a series of emotional animations depicting her weakest moment and subsequent triumphant determination, we are instead practically treated to a still and narration *Telling* us \"I'm sad. But you're here. I'm all better now!\" in a very brief timespan... That whole sequence, both immediately before and after, could have been realized beautifully in gameplay without so much as a word spoken.\n\nAlso, as a last note, this game doesn't really end as it just awkwarldy... stops. It doesn't even end on a real cliffhanger, it's just... \"to be continued in part 2\". This frustrated me immensly. It would have been better standing on its own. They literally only needed to cut out 10 or so seconds of dialogue and it would ironically have made me *more* excited for a sequel.\n\nThe story was over!

Instead, by having the ending feel like it should drag on (but doesn't), it's like Quill's growth suddenly got stunted. It made me frustrated impressively fast.\n\nThat sounds worse than it actually is.

So let's start.\n\nFirstly, the concept of how the protagonist interacts with the player is simply BREATHTAKING, and I felt so involved and connected with Quill. Polyarc really went to the depths to make the player feel as if they are IN the game, and this is ESPECIALLY important when playing in VR. \n\nThe implementation of VR controls feels simply smooth, and you can interact with Quill, or the environment around you, (The puzzles are user interactive, boxes are breakable by simply gripping them, you can make flora move by touching them, and there are quite a few physics objects you can mess around with, so that is an A+, Polyarc, well done. I do feel that the controls could use a little more work, it feels a bit awkward with how you jump and attack, and also I've noticed Quill will sometimes move and stay locked in that direction for a bit until I touch the controls again, which can be a little inconvenient in places where you can fall into the water, thorns, or fall into the abyss, not a lot of the maps allow room for careless running.\n\nThe story was very enthralling, I could easily follow the tale and the narration was a nice effect. However, some questionable thoughts came into my mind as I listened through. Firstly, I come from a deaf family, so I am VERY familiar with sign language and it's culture. When Quill speaks to me, she uses sign language or gestures, but when the narration speaks, it makes it seem like she can speak verbally, so my thoughts are, if she speaks with gestures, squeaks, sign language, why does the narration imply differently? It might just be me, but from what I've noticed, I don't see the other characters using sign language, and on a different note, the narration doesn't imply that she speaks through sign language, it just states what she's saying, as if she is verbally speaking. I'd like some more clarification on this, but overall, it does not bother me at all. \n\nAlso, I'd like to provide some information to the developer here, being hard of hearing, it can be difficult for me to notice when Quill wants my attention, in the deaf community, when we want to get each other's attention, it's very visual based, I do see Quill waving when she needs my attention, however, the issue lies with when I'm not looking at Quill, I'd like some visual prompt to get my attention when Quill wants to speak to me when she is out of my percipheral view and I think this would be more accomodating with other deaf people who potentially play this game since they won't be able to hear like me. \n\nOnto the graphics. One word, beautiful. I'm not the most nitpicky when it comes to graphics, but I do pay attention to detail, antialiasing is great, and I can barely see any jagged lines, and this is very common in VR to see jagged edges, because the HMD is right up to your eyes, so Polyarc really has polished this for the port to PC, which, by the way, I have to THANK the developer for bringing this game to PC, when I heard it came out, I was so disappointed that it wasn't available for PC, and I didn't expect them to bring it to Steam at all, Polyarc, you have earned my respect! I really hope that you guys will continue to bring us more titles in the future, especially with book II. Back to the subject, I can't really get into details since the knowledge of my terminology regarding graphics is a bit limited, but I can say that i've been playing games for so long that I know when games are good looking, and Polyarc DEFINITELY has the right idea, please keep this up! \n\nAnother suggestion I'd like to bring to Polyarc, is to keep adding more interactions with the character, more interactions with the environment, and I'd love to be able to communicate more with Quill, or have her communicate with me more, and I'd love to see some more variations with her behavior. Also, I know it's common with VR games for them to be short, but I'd LOVE it if you can make the game length longer, more story, and perhaps more replayablility, perhaps finding treasures that make Quill stronger, or establishing a monitary system from collecting dust that allows you to purchase skills, or maybe even new game plus! I'd LOVE to see some more expansion into gameplay. \n\nThe VR industry is still on the climb to becoming more like modern non-VR games, and I believe Polyarc is one of those developers that will be a WONDERFUL example for other VR developers to follow. On my list, Polyarc has made number one in VR games. Great story, beautiful graphics, and original content. Recommended?

So with that being said here is my amateur review of Moss\u2026\n \nWOW WOW WOW!  I cannot say enough about this game. It is engaging, unique, captivating and charming all rolled up into an adventure that stands out like nothing else I have ever played in VR.  You are basically living in a story book, controlling the main protagonist \u2013 Quill.  Making him run, jump and fight enemies all to save his uncle from the evil that lurks in the shadows.\n\nThe gameplay is amazing but what is even more amazing is how this all is presented to you.  VR makes the environments come to life before your very eyes.  You look down upon the land of Moss while controlling Quill and interacting with the environment before you, helping your little friend move through her quest to fight the evil that has captured her uncle. \nEach time Quill would overcome a puzzle or best her enemies or both, you and her will move to the next scene.  With each new scene presented I found myself more and more amazed at how beautiful the environments are. This is truly a delight and a place that I did not want to leave. \n \nTo me, Moss is by far the best game I have ever played in VR.  I was continually drawn into the world of Moss as each new chapter unfolded before my eyes.  The puzzles while somewhat simple were to me-a joy to overcome.  I tend to get bored with frustration if things get too difficult.   However I really feel that they struck the perfect balance between simplicity and fun for the world before me.\n \nI do read others reviews about the controls being too difficult or not accurate enough, and I can tell you with complete honesty that in the beginning I had a bit of trouble controlling Quill with enough precision to complete a few scroll challenges in some tougher areas, or not to die by fighting enemies that I could have beaten with my eyes closed if I had a proper button and joystick gamepad setup.  However, by the time I was a few hours into my quest, I was running and jumping and slashing my foes with ease.  I could tell I was getting better at controlling Quill and interacting with my environment, and by the end of the game I had mastered the controls and they just felt great.\n  \nI think what intrigues me most about Moss, is the possibilities it has opened my mind to.  When I was young, my friends and I would sit around the table in my basement and play D&D for hours on end.  Slaying dragons and besting foes of all sorts while we leveled our character\u2019s and role-played till our hearts were content. At that moment we were living in the world that our DM had created for us.  Much like how I was living in the world that Polyarc had created.   After playing Moss and experiencing how the developers transformed the adventure genre into a living breathing world right before my eyes, my only hope is to be able to experience a full on multiplayer RPG in the Moss vein as well.  This would truly be something special. \n\nIn closing, after 10 hours of game play (yes it took me that long) I am now ready for my next adventure with Quill...

There are severe caveats to the game at this time, as described below, but on its merits i recommend at least bookmarking it to check back later.\n\n----\n\nTried this on a Windows Mixed Reality setup, intending to let my little nephew play it, but the controls are so bad that i can barely control it well, and there's no chance he would be able to.\n\nThe movement of the mouse is controlled with the touch pad, which means thumbing it to figure out where your thumb is in relation to it, then moving and hoping you got it right, then adjusting mid-movement to errors in intent translation, while movements happen at high speeds. This results in running/jumping off things that should be utterly trivial very often.\n\nAdditionally there is a lot of unexplained control interactions, like menus being done with clicks of the touchpad directions, with the left controller only allowing up/down and the right one allowing only left right, which would be fine, if the game bothered to explain it. Another one is hanging off a ledge and dropping off it. I honestly have to say i have done it by flailing on the touch pads, but no intentional input combination i tried seemed to allow me to do it at will.\n\nThen there's little design flaws in regards to guiding the player as to what they're supposed to do. One early section has a ledge the character is supposed to jump up to and shimmy along it, but: This mechanic is never hinted at or explained, the ledge is marked, but in a very subtle and non-obvious way, and it also looked kind of too high to reach for normal jumps. There's also invisible walls that forbid jumping onto places that would otherwise be perfectly easy to reach, and the only way they are marked as \"inaccessible\" is with a very thin layer of vegetation on top that should be no issue for the character.\n\nMost of these can probably be fixed, and if the WMR controls are made to be actually usable frustration-free for the intended audience: Children; then i would probably reverse my recommandation against, but as is, WMR users should only apply if they're seasoned gamers.", "timestamp_created": 1528641702, "timestamp_updated": 1528668488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458688050508499146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42628036": {"recommendationid": "42628036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005984148", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1691451727}, "language": "english", "review": "Utterly charming... beautifully presented and fun to play... essential VR purchase!", "timestamp_created": 1528635344, "timestamp_updated": 1528635344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42626775": {"recommendationid": "42626775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047550861", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 147, "last_played": 1611521683}, "language": "english", "review": "wow.ive played almost everything that is available in vr and very few experiances  blow me away.this isnt the usual vr game but has now set a standard that other developers should follow.the controls are unusual but work once you work at it.graphics are some of the best ive seen,buy it you wont be dissapointed.", "timestamp_created": 1528631632, "timestamp_updated": 1528631632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42625013": {"recommendationid": "42625013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015339281", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1528623375}, "language": "english", "review": "This title is a beautifully made VR platformer, where you guide little Quill to rescue his uncle.

This is normally only slightly annoying, but the further you get into the game, the more time this costs you, more and more, to the point of infuriation, which detracts from the game.  They also, at the end, start giving you blind failures, which, combined with the long respawn times (5-10 seconds from the point you fucked up to gaining control of your character again) just leads to abject murder of the game experience.\n\nAs this is a platformer at base, it lives and dies by its controls, and the floaty nature, combined with the above problem, and the fact you can just run off ledges, and a complete lack of movement assisting, was already digging the game's grave about have way in, and used a bulldozer to bury it at the end.\n\nI would love to recommend this on Quill alone, because the animation and semi awareness of the player is very endearing, but it cannot charge $30 for unrefined controls and a dearth of content.\n\nAlso, anyone that's asking for this to come to not-VR:  Keep doing it.  There's some naysayers about how such a request will never make non-VR happy, but there's nothing in this game that distinctly requires VR in such a way that removing it and making it snap-to action controls wouldn't be just as effective.  The game would map to an SNES controller without issue (you'd want the analog sticks, but still).\n\n\n====Original ===== \nThis early in, it's hard to gather that there's anything fundamentally special about it as a game.  It has, thus far, utilized VR very minimally (in the kind of way that people asking for this to exist without VR are justified), but there's nothing wrong with it.  It's not a selling point for VR, but it isn't really gimmicky, either.  I'd buy it if you have a VR, otherwise you're not going to be inclined to get into VR because of this.\n\nThe main character is adorable, but it's hard to appreciate it, sometimes, with how far away the view is by default.\n\nI also don't understand the design ethos behind fading to black to respawn the character, it's very jarring in VR (not in a shock sense, but it diminishes the experience), as well as loading between zones.  There should be optimization around loading to make it as seemless as possible, but it seems like it wasn't taken into consideration beyond how consoles/other games have it happen.\n\nThus far, I'd recommend it, but I actually wish the game was an escort quest.  The platforming controls are floaty because of touchpad instead of press-to-move (I have not liked this is any game I've had it in), and not extremely rewarding.  If the game was about guiding the protagonist and assisting them, instead of directly controlling them, I think the experience would be far and away better.", "timestamp_created": 1528462320, "timestamp_updated": 1528506915, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520823538303375244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42576564": {"recommendationid": "42576564", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970864200", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1603996537}, "language": "english", "review": "HTC Vive review.\nWow amaze balls!
