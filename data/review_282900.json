They're all commentary on the videogame industry as a whole - as if the world being called Gameindustri was not enough of a hint. Characters have names that are either overtly references, Arfoire the main antag being R4, a cart used for piracy and her Japanese name being a play on slang for piracy tech in the Japanese market as well, or sometimes a bit less direct like Rom and Ram, two demigod like beings that I still don't see the name puns for on anything but their starting gear which includes the Wi and Fi bangles. \nEvery character has relevance either to the overall story as you'd expect or in the abstract sense of being referential to major companies. Broccoli for instance, the charming little cat person who keeps saying \"Nyu\" is a reference name and all to the Broccoli company in Japan, a media company that deals in manga, games, and anime. \nThe layers -are- there for players who are willing to think critically and look past \"haha cute moe girls and pngs with jiggle physics,\" and that honestly makes it cater to so many people it's kind of wild.", "timestamp_created": 1700654600, "timestamp_updated": 1700654600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150657159": {"recommendationid": "150657159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198225639316", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 5004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4325, "playtime_at_review": 4655, "last_played": 1700714199}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not understand any of the lore, but I like the random robot guys and heavily contrasting dragons/dogoos together in the same room. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1700598050, "timestamp_updated": 1700598050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150461020": {"recommendationid": "150461020", "author": {"steamid": "76561199109599814", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 2478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 113, "playtime_at_review": 2478, "last_played": 1700436072}, "language": "english", "review": "I rate this 76 puddings out of 44 Neps", "timestamp_created": 1700436723, "timestamp_updated": 1700436771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150452714": {"recommendationid": "150452714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140348800", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1116, "playtime_at_review": 1192, "last_played": 1700449269}, "language": "english", "review": "Nostalgia trip from when I watched LostPause years ago.

Playing this reminded me of those good old days where you could have simple mechanics and a lighthearted / comedic story to push the narrative. Overall, it's a solid 9 / 10 in my book with some gripes. \n\nIf you just want a solid RPG with cute characters then definitely play it. It's easy to learn, and can be extremely punishing if you forget to save often. There is no auto save, and a lack of ability to gauge monster levels. The game has a crap load of content and things to do, a lot to collect, and you are always making progress in some form or another. The DLC grows it even farther if you're starving for more content, while also raising the level cap to 999 and providing additional characters to play as. Graphics could be a little better, and enemies could be reused a little less, but those are not something I'd complain about. I bought all the other mainline entries, and am looking forward to playing them. \n\nIt's impressive how large the cast of characters are, but it does cause the game to give less attention to the cast outside the leading group. It reminds me a bit of Persona 3 with the big variety of weapons, which are character locked. So you can't exactly swap them around. I do really like the way that depending on the version of a weapon you have, the hit box changes. I kind of wish it was executed better though. \n\nAs with any other RPG, you will default to using the version with the highest stats. But that may mean you're stuck with the small square hit box, versus the wider rectangles with no real choice over it. I'd think it'd be more interesting if the Great-swords Neptune can use were all large hit boxes. And the Katana looking swords were small hit boxes with a critical chance boost or something to make them stand out. Then it'd be preference for which type you wanted. Or maybe it's fine just the way it is, giving you a taste of variety without really being in depth. This game's strongest positives are in it's simplicity after all.\n\nI have a few minor complaints, that for the average person who plays a game once and drops it will likely mean nothing. But for those who like to do 100% completion as much as they can like myself, you are in for serious pain. The grind is soul breaking. I feel dead inside doing the same mindless dlc battle over and over and over trying to reach 100 million credits. Not to mention how many craft able items there are in the game (Most of which are useless by the time you get the rng drops to make them.) \n\n60 hours, multiple start to finish play throughs, And characters at level 200 with 11,881,301 / 100,000,000 credits. The worst offender has to be various upgrade chips and end game armor that relies on entering and exiting a dungeon upwards of 30 times to run to treasure spots. I'll only subtract the single point from this, as it really takes away from what was otherwise the most chill and enjoyable experience I've had in a long time. \n\nOn a final note, if you check the guides section there is an amazing community mod to improve the game's shaders and resolution.

It's ultimately just kind of a generic save-the-world adventure story and the actual substance is in the (comedic) character interactions more than anything else. I don't think I can claim to have loved the story, but I did find it charming in its own way. At least I don't regret reading through it. The English translation seems a bit liberal, but not to a degree that it'd completely ruin the entire thing either.\n\nThe combat is surprisingly good. There's kind of a good rhythm to the whole thing, where you first try to get a sneak attack in the overworld, then take turns in the battle to position yourself optimally, chip away at the enemy's shields and then deal heavy damage to them. During boss fights you would also look to optimise the mileage you get out of your powerful EX skills too. It's also fairly fast-paced, with the possibility to skip most of the animations, so you can really charge through your battles.\n\nAnd boy is it a good thing the combat feels as good as it does since this game leans very heavily on grinding to pad out the game. I don't think there's any way to get through the story without grinding. You just won't get the levels to clear all the level check bosses. I had trouble beating a couple of the bosses, both early in the game and late in the game, and when I searched for tips in case I missed something, most of the advice on the Internet was \"grind more\". So if there's a way to beat the game without grinding, it went unnoticed by me and seemingly the rest of the Internet too.\n\nThe grinding also extends to the achievements. About half of the achievements for this game require grinding, be it for character levels or money. The amount of grinding is pretty mental. Really has this \"low budget, must stretch out the game somehow\" thing written all over it.\n\nNot to say that there's no aspect for battle tactics and gameplay. For example, I lost to a boss, restarted the fight and then won the second bout. No grinding needed in the between the attempts. However, I'm not sure if the victory game down to skills or just luck. I feel like there's a limited amount of things you can do in regards to your tactics when the boss has the ability to insta-kill two members from your three-member party. It's quite possible that the boss just unleashed less of its wave of death area-of-effect attacks on my party on the latter attempt.\n\nThe rest of the game mechanics are kinda lame. The quests feel like they were added to check a checkbox, same as with the colosseum. And the share balancing act that you need to do in order to unlock the true ending or to unlock the little sisters is also not amazing, especially since it'll involve those quests and colosseum. Not massively time consuming thankfully, but still a bit of a mindless grind, doing the same things again and again to shift some percentages around.\n\nTechnically the game isn't the best. While I do like the art, despite the fact that the game reuses assets like it's going out of fashion, the graphics felt so bad and blurry at the beginning that I felt the need to install the Neptastic Mod on my Steam Deck. That did certainly help the game look nicer, although the FPS would not necessarily always be a stable 60 FPS. It also felt like the FPS would gradually get worse as I kept the game open as the Steam Deck was asleep. I think I went from around 40 FPS to 60 FPS in the same dungeon by just simply restarting the game. Deck users beware.\n\nBut in general, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 does run pretty well on a Steam Deck. Maybe not as well as you'd expect considering that this is originally a PlayStation Vita game, but well enough even with the modding. Combined with the fast-paced combat and heavy focus on grinding, it makes for a pretty decent portable time killer when you have a couple of minutes to do something. Not really sure if I'd ever want to actually sit in front of my gaming PC and play through this game. It just doesn't feel like that kind of a game (quite possibly due to its Vita roots), which is why I played it from start to finish on the Steam Deck. Fairly certain even that I beat most of the game while sitting on the toilet.\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a bit of a messy game with good core gameplay loop and enough charm to keep you around. For the couple of euro I paid for it, it did make for some good portable entertainment.

Its references are as on the nose as you can get and any ounce of subtlety is completely vacant in the world literally called \"Gameindustri\". If you've ever wanted to see video game consoles primarily of the 7th generation as cute anime girls you might just get something out of this.\n\nA hamstrung dub helps with its tone too and I can't see myself playing any other way- only like half of the game is dubbed but the performances range from surprisingly compelling to hilariously bad with lots of recognisable dub voice actors considering there is like 5 in the industry pre 2020.\n\nThe game is self-referential constantly breaking the 4th wall in a way that doesn't feel tiresome like it usually does and an apt amount of self-mockery makes you laugh alongside the game rather than at it. Combined with a plethora of references to anime, games and pop culture the game is basically farming the Steve Rogers \"I got that reference\" GIF until you laugh, which if you're as easily impressed as I am will be as soon as the Steins;Gate references start happening.\n\nThe gameplay is errrrr the most serviceable JRPG of all time and has the most abysmal and draining grinding of any game I've played for a very long time although we could really reach and say this is the developers performing some crazy feat of ludo-narrative harmony at making fun of how bad JRPG grinding is- alas, even I'm not that deluded and infatuated with the game to begin to claim that.\n\nIt definitely did something right for me to bother going out of my way to buy its DLCs and 100% the game but I can confidently say that wasn't the gameplay. The story and characters aren't great but they're endearing and Neptune is like a silly little creature you just wanna watch on her ADHD-fuelled rampage.\n\nXbox 360/10- weirdest Sci;Adv VN ever.",

If you're a fan of anime-style RPGs with a healthy dose of self-awareness and references to gaming culture, this game is sure to entertain you.\n\nThe story takes place in the fictional world of Gamindustri, where four goddesses representing popular gaming consoles rule over different regions. The concept of personifying consoles as goddesses is not only creative but also provides ample opportunities for clever gaming references and parodies. The dialogue is filled with witty banter and fourth-wall-breaking humor, often poking fun at gaming tropes and industry stereotypes. While the plot itself may not be groundbreaking, the game's comedic tone and self-referential nature make it a joy to experience.\n\nThe characters in Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 are a major highlight. Each goddess has her distinct personality and quirks, and their interactions are amusing and endearing. From Neptune's carefree and energetic nature to Noire's tsundere tendencies, the characters are brought to life with vibrant voice acting and colorful visuals. The game also features a wide range of supporting characters, each with their own unique traits and storylines, adding depth and variety to the overall narrative.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 offers a satisfying mix of turn-based combat and dungeon exploration. Battles are strategic, allowing for positioning and skill management, and the ability to chain attacks for devastating combos adds an extra layer of depth. The Lily Rank system, which strengthens bonds between characters, adds another tactical element to battles. While the combat mechanics may not be as complex as other RPGs, they are enjoyable and well-suited to the game's overall tone.\n\nThe visual presentation of Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is colorful and charming, with vibrant character designs and detailed environments. The game's soundtrack is catchy and complements the on-screen action effectively, enhancing the overall immersion.\n\nOne potential downside is that the game's pacing can feel slow at times, with lengthy dialogue sequences and backtracking through previously visited areas. However, the humorous and light-hearted tone often makes up for this, keeping the player engaged and entertained.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a remake of the original Hyperdimension Neptunia game, and it brings significant improvements and enhancements to the table. The updated graphics, additional story content, and improved gameplay mechanics make it the definitive version of the game.\n\nOverall, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 offers a fun and charming RPG experience with a unique concept and endearing characters. Its blend of humor, gaming references, and enjoyable gameplay makes it a solid choice for fans of the genre. If you're looking for a light-hearted and whimsical adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously, this game is well worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1686674766, "timestamp_updated": 1686674766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139978401": {"recommendationid": "139978401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004111009", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2587, "last_played": 1686627444}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth it for the characters, humor, and endless gaming references.

Since Rebirth 1 is the remake version of the PS3's one, some parts of the story were different from the PS3 and apparently some major plot were missing in Rebirth 1 which further causing some questions raised through out the gameplay. \n\nBut despite the messy-ness in story, gameplay wise is okay okay-ish, a somewhat quick turn based combat system, respawnable mobs that doesn't require you to constant re-enter dungeon for farming purposes, enemies are unique and some of them are pretty hilarious looking, BGMs are decent for looping, Nep nep and Compa voice take times to get used to if it's JP voice as they are both a little bit annoying. \n\nOverall, typical JRPG story with friendship power, cliche ending but still fun to look at cute girls.

While it is a turn based combat, the enemy never intentionally combine their abilities to kill you. If they do, usually it's because they lucked in getting debuff stick to you or they just have big damage numbers. Most of the progression requires you to find and defeat the same enemies that you can kill with one strike over and over again, just to get a material for an upgrade.\n\nThe sheer amount of asset reuse is horrendous (music, environment, enemies), but not a deal breaker for me. You got wolves with red color, with blue color, and then slightly bigger wolves. Then the same dungeons with exact same layout, but the entrance is in a different place. If each area has unique mechanics or if the enemy has unique characteristics, I wouldn't mind. But they don't.\n\nNeptunia is known to have lighthearted story, but the tone is weirdly inconsistent. Sometimes the game wants to go serious, but then undercut itself with 4th wall breaking jokes or quips. And no character got any character development. They are flat piece of 2D cardboard, and every conversation is just to move the plot along. If the character interacts, it's usually just for a joke. You'll never have characters talk about their own problems.\n\nWhich brings me to the last bastion of hope: fanservice, in which there are barely any. The first time you see boobs physics is cool, but it only happens three times in the story CG. You may find some characters to look hot in their alternate form, but you better enjoyed that 30 seconds ability animation over and over again!\n\nOverall, Rebirth 1 fell short in every aspect of the game. Pick one aspect you want and make it good, damn it!\n\nHaven't played Rebirth 2 and later games, so I might give it another chance later.", "timestamp_created": 1685629877, "timestamp_updated":

Neptunia Re;Birth1 takes players on a delightful and nostalgic journey through Gamindustri, blending quirky humor, charming characters, and classic JRPG elements into an enjoyable gaming experience. As a fan of the original Hyperdimension Neptunia, I was thrilled to dive back into this revamped version, and it did not disappoint.\n\nThe game's premise revolves around personified console goddesses, each representing a major gaming console, engaged in a lighthearted battle for supremacy. The witty dialogue and numerous gaming references had me chuckling throughout the entire adventure, as the game cleverly parodies various aspects of the gaming industry.\n\nVisually, the updated graphics of Re;Birth1 bring Gamindustri to life with vibrant colors and beautifully animated character designs. The character artwork is adorable, and the in-game environments are filled with intricate details, making exploration a treat. The addition of new character models and improved visuals enhances the overall immersion and creates a fresh experience even for those familiar with the original.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics strike a perfect balance between turn-based combat and strategic decision-making. Battles are engaging, with a wide range of skills and abilities at your disposal. The \"Exe Drive\" system adds a layer of excitement, allowing characters to unleash powerful special attacks, further intensifying the action. The user-friendly interface and accessible tutorials make it easy for newcomers to jump in and enjoy the game.\n\nOne of the highlights of Re;Birth1 is undoubtedly its memorable cast of characters. Each goddess possesses a unique personality, and their interactions and banter provide constant entertainment. The character development is commendable, as you witness their growth and bond throughout the game, forging meaningful connections with each of them.\n\nAdditionally, the inclusion of multiple endings and optional side quests provides ample replay value, allowing players to uncover hidden secrets and experience different storylines. It adds a layer of depth to the game, ensuring that you'll be spending countless hours in Gamindustri.\n\nWhile Re;Birth1 has its fair share of strengths, it's not without a few minor drawbacks. Some may find the repetitive dungeon layouts and occasional grinding a bit tedious, especially during extended play sessions.

Sometimes, I found myself wasting my time just grinding to unlock or found something that i need.\n\nAnother problem is the bug that freeze the enemies turn, I have to restart the game countless time just to get back redoing what i doing or just skipping the stories.

Every aspect of its design is meant to waste your time.  Gameplay and story both.\n\n  Gameplay-wise, it's a total slog, with no meaningful amount of strategy or planning required of the player.  The enemies are all totally basic, and every boss functions exactly the same.  They're all big, stupid HP walls that punch you really hard.  Since they're all the same, the strategy for all of them is also the same every time.  (That strategy being to get into triangle formation and punch them until they fall over.)  They aren't difficult, they just take forever to beat.  (Many of them also heal at the start of every turn they take, just in case you thought the game needed to take longer.)  Additionally, I'm willing to bet that at least 75% of this game's content is recycled, because all of the dungeons get reused, and so does every enemy or boss.  I'm not even exaggerating.\n\n  As for the story, arguably the most important aspect of an RPG, it's absolutely rancid.  Pretty much all the characters are relentlessly irritating, and the overabundance of all the worst anime tropes in existence will likely leave you writhing in agony if you have any love for storytelling or good taste.  The humor is a groan-fest, the characters are all one-note (They also never shut up, and talk for ages about mindless garbage), and the overall plot is about as bog-standard as it gets for an anime RPG.  The concept of the game's universe being based on the console wars is stupid, but at least it could have had some potential and charm if the story decided to do anything interesting or funny with it.  \"LOL THIS PLACE IS XBOX ISN'T THAT FUNNY\" is about as deep as it gets, and I just think that's kind of pathetic.\n\n  I have heard it said that \"Neptunia isn't anything to write home about,\" but that's wrong.

While the story isn't anything groundbreaking, it is cute and simple. Get some loveable characters, throw in some funny dialog with a dash of fan service and you've got a story that will keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Unfortunately this game fumbles with every other part that isn't the story. While the gameplay has some interesting ideas, overall it is very boring. Combine that with extreme spikes in difficulty, that will make you have to grind for gear and levels for LITERAL hours and you've got the perfect mix of unenjoyable gameplay.

This is my first time playing a Neptunia game and I've never played any other Neptunia game before. So, please bear this in mind as I go through this review. Anyway let us begin the review. \n\nLet's start off with the story. You follow the story of a girl named ,Neptune, who lost her memory. Neptune is the CPU of Planeptune (which to my undestanding she's basically the leader of Planeptune or some kind head of State), though Neptune doesn't know this due to her memory problem. The story follows her as she goes on a journey to recover her memory. The story has okay writing its sometimes a hit or a miss. The story is mainly text in a visual novel style. But, unlike many visual novels in the story scenes you don't choose anything you just read, listen and follow the text. Overall, the story is very interesting to play through and is what keeps me invested.\n\nThe gameplay itself is mostly exploring different dungeons, you fight different enemies in those dungeons. The player may choose to do Guild quests, that takes place in the dungeons. There are some  quests that require the player to defeat a certain specific enemy that can only be found in a specific dungeon. When a quest is completed the player gains credits (in-game main currency), which the credits can be spent at the shop to buy new weapons and other gear to enhance your characters in your party. Fighting in dungeons can also allow your party to gain XP points. This is pretty simple stuff and is kind of nice touch.\n\nHowever, the game has TONS of flaws. For starters the tutorial is useless, because the controls are based on PlayStation controls that haven't been translated into PC. So, not only the tutorial is useless, because it tells you how to play in PlayStation controls not PC. Also, this means that the controls like: camera movement, character selection, key shortcuts, character movement. etc. is complete garbage. So, you'd have to guess the controls I would recommend looking at the player made guides to help, because this is a must. \n\nAnother flaw is that the game is FULLY AWARE OF ITSELF!!! this means I can only play for 1 hour before I lose my sanity. What I mean by this is that the characters are 100% aware they're anime characters in a anime video game. Hell even the main protagonist (Neptune), is fully aware she's the main character. (edit) Even a minor character named Historie is also 100% fully aware she's part of a franchise, when she mentions that she's the first character to use 'emoticons' of the franchise. The game one time made a reference to Star Trek and the characters were fully aware they were making that reference. Look I sometimes enjoy references, especially if its done right. But, with the game fully aware it is making that said reference and hell even the main characters are fully aware of it too. All that is just way too much for myself and does sometimes feel like the story feel like it's dragging along. \n\nNevertheless despite all this though, this game does have a certain charm that does make me to give it an overall recommend. The characters for one are kind of attractive in a way and the story overall is kind of fun to follow. Even if it means that I'm playing 1 -2 hours every couple of weeks, I come back to it in the end. So, for those who wish to pick up this game, go for it. Be warned, though controls are absolute garbage and the game will deplete your sanity if you play it for too long in a day.\n", "timestamp_created": 1680944307, "timestamp_updated": 1681114252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136267849": {"recommendationid": "136267849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040144918", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5723, "last_played": 1680869816}, "language": "english", "review": "100% do it, worth the time and interest.\n95.4hrs on record, 86hrs to 100% achievements.\n\ni was extremely interested through the story whilst stuffing around with mechanics.\nmad respect for the grind and was a Solid vibe.\ncompelling story, Hilarity will ensue.\n<3", "timestamp_created": 1680870055, "timestamp_updated": 1680870055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136251354": {"recommendationid": "136251354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244752526", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3748, "last_played": 1698020269}, "language": "spanish", "review": "nep nep", "timestamp_created": 1680844490, "timestamp_updated": 1680844490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136109782": {"recommendationid": "136109782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388699218", "num_games_owned": 657, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3465, "last_played": 1680972983}, "language": "english", "review": "100%.....millionaire achievement....suffering....no dlc....pain.....nep", "timestamp_created": 1680638743, "timestamp_updated": 1680638743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135990561": {"recommendationid": "135990561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024962947", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 199, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1680480345}, "language": "english", "review": "The PC port is locked to 1080P max.

At first, I was so curious why it's one of the most popular anime mods in the L4D workshop (voicepacks, textures, UI, models and sounds) but then as I played for a while as the characters, I started to gain interest like saying to myself: \"I wonder how the real game looks like and this looks like a cool anime show\". So I bought the game and woah! It brought back my memories as a RPG player and a gamer as the characters literally represents the consoles and the genre is what I loved the most for many years. I love adventures! \n\nSpeaking of the game, I truly agree with most players that grinding here is too much especially the first 25 levels. But after a few levels, it's somewhat became manageable. It's just you need the proper equipment and level to advance on the next stages, dungeons and defeat the bosses. Not only that, you need to read a lot of guides and tips so you could enjoy it! I'm so glad that these are available, special thanks to the Nep-Nep community! \n\nThe only downside I see here are the character speeches during the cutscenes, there were some sentences that got cut off (I assume that the writer forgot to justify the text so that it could fit the text box) you can only hear the full sentence if you set the audio to English but if its in Japanese, you won't know what they are talking about. That's pretty much it, maybe in Rebirth 2 they have fixed these, so I would see it for myself. \n\nGameplay... well, I like how simple it is, a turn-based RPG game. I'd say its a pretty neat game for a casual like me. \n\nSo in conclusion, if you love anime and a game with cute, pretty and badass women. Then, Hyperdimension Neptunia is for you! I am proud to be a new fan of the Neptunia franchise, if it weren't for the L4D2 workshop I won't discover this classic gem. In contrast to other shows and RPG games, I believe the franchise is underrated, the game and the anime needs more love, guys! Let's bring Nep-Nep back to the spotlight!\n\nSummary of my review:\n\nGameplay: 9 / 10\nSoundtrack: 10 / 10\nVisuals: 8 / 10\nStory: 10 / 10 \n\nOverall: 92.5 / 100 (Excellent)\n\nGame difficulty: 7.5 (this is a RPG game that you must not underestimate. The simplicity doesn't mean its easy.)", "timestamp_created": 1667992727, "timestamp_updated": 1667992727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

The characters are cute, and the whole world is a parody -- the name of the world is \"Gamindustri\", so it's all about video games. There's even a character named \"Tekken\" who attacks with fisticuff combos like a character from Tekken.\n\nThe humor in this game is occasionally great. More often, though, it's a cutesy self-referential fourth-wall breaking that may appeal to a certain type of player but probably not others. Which may well describe the whole game; you need to like the cutesy anime VN aesthetic and have patience for very long dialogue cutscenes because you like the characters. The characters are at least very pretty in the cutscenes, animated breathing so it's not just a static image. Likewise, the turn-based battles actually look pretty decent.\n\nUnfortunately, it's all flash and no substance; in this case you're basically running many variations of the same few dungeons, fighting retreads and recolors of various enemies in mostly uninteresting turn-based combat interrupted by ridiculous sequences for your special moves like a FFVII summon. I mostly played this as a game to grind while watching Netflix, and indeed, grinding was required for me to beat the final boss.\n\nStill, in spite of all the negatives, there is an undeniable charm to the game. And maybe I'm biased because the ending credits made me smile and filled my heart with joy. But this is a game for anime nerds who like video games, probably by anime nerds who like video games, and while the gameplay isn't very good alternating between grindy turn-based combat and long dialogue scenes, there's charm here for people who like that sort of thing.\n\nIt's sort of like a cake made by your five-year-old: It's not good enough that I'd recommend it to most people, but it's charming and I like it anyway even though the quality may be dubious.

I could really go on and on about this, but suffice to say it took way too long to get my head around things like Plans, shares, processors, discs and Lily Ranks and after I went to the trouble, I didn't like them.\nThe very concept of crafting items to increase dungeon difficulty so that you can grind more is NOT my thing. \nOne or two huge difficulty spike boss battles that almost had me throwing in the towel.\nI played with a mouse and keyboard and holy hell, that was awkward at times.\nThe story and world are nonsensical, and if you're looking for emotional investment in characters, go play a Trails game.\n\nVerdict:\nIn the end, with the help of some good advice, Kei Jinguji and the Fairy Fencer DLC, I managed to overcome my anger, confusion and frustration with this game. And I'm looking forward to playing the sequels, cause in the end, the infectiously goofy characters won me over. But the world of Neptunia is certainly an acquired taste.", "timestamp_created": 1659851177, "timestamp_updated": 1660149003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120183106": {"recommendationid": "120183106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375083479", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 32354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30868, "last_played": 1683540085}, "language": "english", "review": "IF looks like Ezio Auditore with hidden blades, even the animation looks similar.

This can also come in handy when needing to adjust for elemental/magic/physical resistances or weaknesses throughout the game.\n\nThe game offers plenty of tutorial screens and also allows you to revisit stages you've completed which enables you to both EXP grind and Quest grind to gain more credits(currency) to more easily purchase some decent equipment upgrades by the beginning of Chapter 2\n\nAlthough the fairly basic level design and repetitiveness of returning to dungeons multiple times to complete side quests and grind could be a deal-breaker for some, I still feel the character designs and customizable  system help to compensate for this game's weaknesses.  \n\nOverall, this game has me wanting to continue on through the main story progression and the combat helps to keep me fairly entertained.\n\nThis", "timestamp_created": 1657879974, "timestamp_updated": 1657879974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118680033": {"recommendationid": "118680033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048404175", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2254, "last_played": 1657783687}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun and makes fun of the gaming industry, though some of the jokes are a bit dated.", "timestamp_created": 1657607832, "timestamp_updated": 1657607832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118494093": {"recommendationid": "118494093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194040497", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3173, "last_played": 1660974771}, "language": "english", "review": "NEPGYAA!!~", "timestamp_created": 1657347042, "timestamp_updated": 1657347042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118466945": {"recommendationid": "118466945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088599062", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 672, "last_played": 1666468396}, "language": "english", "review": "Nep-Nep is my new religion.

In order to stop the locking you must open task manager, go to the program, go to details, then set priority to realtime seems to work so far.\n\nChanging my review that fix didn't work at all still glitches on enemy turns and it does this everytime. This games impossible to finish and the glitch isn't just game crashes. You have to do a hard reset just to make it close.\n\nThis is ridiculous garbage a company selling something like this, how did this get so many entries when the very first game is unplayable.

Nada m\u00e1s llegar, aunque lleves al personaje con mejores stats, y con buffs, el jefe te revienta de una sola h\u03bfstia, incluso los que no deber\u00edan hacer eso. La \u00fanica soluci\u00f3n a esto es subir niveles y conseguir nuevas armas, cosa que se consigue al grindear.\nEncima la comunidad, por alg\u00fan motivo, ataca a los que dicen que solo te lo puedes pasar as\u00ed y dice que no hace falta grindear enemigos, que eso es estrategia de ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os y solamente con luchar en el coliseo y subir niveles puedes pasarte f\u00e1cilmente las zonas. A ver, campeones, eso es grindear. Supongo que no quieren verse como grinders, pero eso es grindear. En fin.\nAdem\u00e1s hay algunos ataques que me han parecido horribles, por ejemplo los que se hac\u00edan combinando a Neptunia con las otras diosas, que hacen mucho da\u00f1o a varios enemigos a cambio de energ\u00eda, pero haces tanto da\u00f1o y consumes tanta energ\u00eda que la idea es usarlo contra jefes, no contra enemigos normales. Pero cuando vas contra un jefe solo hay uno, y antes de ese te dan un ataque que hace m\u00e1s da\u00f1o y usa menos energ\u00eda... Entonces... \u00bfPara qu\u00e9 c\u03bf\u00f1o quiero un ataque m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil y que usa m\u00e1s energ\u00eda despu\u00e9s de tener el otro...?\n\nEn fin, que en general puede estar entretenido por la historia y los personajes, pero el gameplay me pareci\u00f3 aburrid\u00edsimo por el excesivo grindeo, y eso es lo que hace que no lo recomiende para nada.

Since overall it was a nice, enjoyable experience that was generally bogged down by various hiccups. \n\nPros:\n-Fun characters with a laid back, enjoyable story.\n-A nice variety of weapons that appear different in game/fights\n-An awesome variety of outfits and accessories to make the characters truly feel customizable\n-A nice variety of dungeons with an old school jrpg feel to them\n-The grind feels productive in a satisfying way\n-NG+ offered a nice way to unlock extra characters and 100% the game so I'm glad it was included\n-Both weapon and costume designs were varied and pretty rad.\n-The lily system was neat.\n-The memes and 4th wall breaking kept the game fun for me. Mages as a character in general was really cool. \n\nCons:\n-The grind is a pain if you don't know which bosses to go farm at which points when you hit a wall in leveling\n-The story can at times be cringe in the scripting (ie. the pudding being brought up as a core value for the protag constantly. It's just overused)\n-Some dungeon DLC's can be considered predatory as I would argue they were necessary for 100% achievements. The grind would have been unacceptable without some of the dlc dungeon content.

All of my VN's (40+ as of right now), and dozens of other East Asian games, were bought after I played this game nearly two years ago. And they have helped me in practicing those languages.\n\nWhat makes this game immediately stand out is its over-the-top upbeat style. From the colorful drawings to the high spirit music, the game gives off the vibe of an amusement park. The core of the game are the dialogues, which are as fantastic as the rest. You have Neptune make fourth-wall breaking comments like \"Why am I so glossy? Is it because I'm the main character?\", but also remarks like \"[Your name is] Noire? Seems like the name of someone with no friends.\" Every conversation made me laugh and i can't remember a moment I was bored.\n\nUnfortunately, the actual game part of this game is less interesting. It's a turn based strategy, where you can move anywhere within a radius per turn. The animations were very satisfying to watch. But the game quickly becomes very grindy. You have to grind to get a good chance of beating the first boss (or do a little trick with a free DLC). Soon afterwards however, there's the option to make enemies weaker via one of the Plans.\nThe game has a lot of these \"Plans\", which unlock all kinds of things such as dungeons, different item drops (from the same enemies), different enemies (in the same dungeons), etc. You need items to get Plans to get dungeons to get items for other Plans to get new dungeons and items and so on. It's very cumbersome, even for RPG standards. Near the end of the game you again have to grind quests to increase Faith percentages in order to unlock different endings. This does not get much quicker with weaker enemies, as it mostly involves going back and forth between dungeons etc.\n\nAll in all, the first playthrough was an unforgettable experience, and I was playing multiple hours a day. If the combat and quests weren't so tedious, I would actually replay this game and their sequels for their dialogues and different endings.

I've been playing these games since the original released on the PS3 when I was in high school. Let's get one thing clear, this is not the original game. This is a complete remake of the original to make it play more in line with the rest of series. I have also played through this game on the PS Vita. As a remake, it's actually a pretty good one. A lot of the fluff was removed, and some of the more frustrating elements of the original game were reworked to be less annoying. Sadly some of what made the original unique was trimmed away. Many references, jokes, and plot points have either been removed, reworked, rearranged, or rewritten. However Rebirth does retain much of the personality and charm of the original. \n\nNow we move to the PC port side of things. Sad to say the PC port is terrible. The game suffers from issues such as menu prompts being Xbox controller icons even when keyboard and mouse is set as the controller input. When using a wireless controller, if you boot the game up before turning the controller on, the game will not register the controller is on and will refuse to use it as the input device. The game also suffers from resolution and frame rate problems, however they don't happen to me as much as others, so I can't really speak on those issues. Luckily people have found fixes and you can find them easily in the Discussions page for this game. The game also has some awful dlc that should have been in the base game.\n\nI still recommend this game to any JRPG fans. especially if you like more light hearted adventures with some tongue and cheek jokes and references. This is a solid JRPG and is well worth it if you can handle the issues and grab this game and it's dlc on sale as the dlc adds some quality of life stuff to the game.", "timestamp_created": 1650971628, "timestamp_updated": 1650971628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114493158": {"recommendationid": "114493158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095197961", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1616, "last_played": 1598024419}, "language": "english", "review": "The dimensional merge is coming", "timestamp_created": 1650952376, "timestamp_updated": 1650952376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114252942": {"recommendationid": "114252942", "author": {"steamid": "76561199082013123", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2988, "last_played": 1676443929}, "language": "spanish", "review": "NEP NEP\nNo esperaba mucho de este juego pero aunque tenga una historia y personajes bastante simples es f\u00e1cil empezar a tomarle el gusto sin que te des cuenta", "timestamp_created": 1650588704, "timestamp_updated": 1676512827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114230512": {"recommendationid": "114230512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880921105", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2048, "last_played": 1655175424}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is fun and hilarious, and the gameplay is pretty solid.

During one of the video game wars you where knocked out of battle and lost your memory. Now with the aid of some new found friends, you journey to find out who you are. Well that is how the story starts anyhow. The game pretty much forgets about that and focuses on 3 other story-lines with the occasional mention of your amnesia. Well at least it is not your normal boring amnesia story!\n\n As far is the graphics go, you are in no way treated to anything new. You are looking at PS3 style 3D with an anime cell shade color scheme. Do not get me wrong, there is nothing bad with this. Just if you are one of those individuals who focus on visuals first then story, you possibly will not like this game (Not that the story is strong either).\n\nEach character is distinctively different and posses their own signature moves and personalities. The goddesses that you play ass have 3 different looks depending on what form they take. Then we have the monsters for this game. There is a good variety of creatures. The designers did an absolutely awesome job at creating some really creative creature types. There is one enemy who is a computer screen shot. Her avatar on the map is 2d with the front looking at her with text on the bottom and the back showing the back of the girl. Getting past the interesting monsters, you have a large set of standard creatures you would find in most other rpgs.\n\nOne thing I really did not like about this game was how separated the characters are. Each character has their specials and EX moves, however, only the CPUs have combo special attacks. To make matters worse, there is 1 group that gets a 3 person combo. So half the characters you end up with (all non CPUs) are left out of the fun. Not only that, 2 of them are the ones you get at the beginning of the game who are actually the main group! How sad is that...   \n\nLooking at the levels, the game takes a huge nose dive on this. The map is very simplistic, you just move your character to where there is a spot that has something on it and click. You are transported to a super short repetitive location. The layout is extremely generic with wide open spots everywhere. You can literally walk around all monsters without facing a single one if you wanted to (The jump in this game is almost completely useless). I would not suggest it as the combat difficulty level spikes all over the place and you will definitely need to level up.\n\nWhen you enter a fight, you have your typical RPG attacks. Your goddesses have the ability to transform and be much stronger. Once you get about a quarter through the game, you will notice that ALL story fights need to be done transformed or your are going to have a super difficult time. Getting back to the combat, you have 3 types of normal attacks each with a different intent. I went through the game only using 2 for the vast majority. After that you have your magic attacks, switch characters, use items, special attacks, and 2 types of team attacks.\n\nGetting into the music. It is lighthearted and repetitive. Honestly that is all there is to it..! \n\nThe game is partially voice acted. Most the scenes are text based with them mocking games, anime, and manga. The voices are good in both Japanese and English. However, what they say actually is the annoying part. So you might just want to stick with the Japanese because it at least sounds more realistic. \n\nIf you are after a decent RPG that does not take itself at all seriously and does not have a complicated set of mechanics, go for this game. Be advised that like any RPG similar Final Fantasy, there will be lots and lots of grinding to get levels, drops, or Lilly ranks.\n", "timestamp_created": 1649993129, "timestamp_updated": 1649993129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474999994039535522", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113825409": {"recommendationid": "113825409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208299437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 800, "last_played": 1649915574}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the original on the PS3 when it came out.

I'm 52 so.. very weird for someone my age to get something like this without feeling very perv-y and I'm not into cutesy kid stuff.  I've been playing RPGs since Ultima zero and even before that in the early 1970s and I'm a huge Turn-Based Strategy RPG fan.\n\nSo.. this game is similar (to me) as Final Fantasy X2 (with Yuna, Riku, and Paine) complete with costumes and apparel, most of which don't do much to the character's stats (a few do).  I got Plutia (and glad I did) as DLC and her CPU form is questionably S&M (unexpected)..  Wondering if I should have got Peashy.. or Histore?\n\nThe game is very tongue-in-cheek tween-esque innocent innuendo referencing, but there's no nudity or sexual content depending on how you measure it,  and probably kid-safe to play, though some costumes may require a double-take at some suggestive camera angles that you'd find perhaps in a fashion magazine of late...\n\nI probably could have beaten the game in under 30 hours but I grinded for a few days to unlock some content.  There's a TON of hidden content, and I completely missed the mini-CPU characters you can unlock which require you get your \"Shares\" above 50% (popularity based on mission-specific results).  I missed most of the costumes and never found a few ingredients (or reagents or components) for Plans to create certain items.  These were not easily apparent.  \n\nThe game is relatively easy, though Chapter 2 and 3 are probably the most difficult, especially learning the mechanics of it that's thrown at you with very light explanation.\n\nGame is seemingly based on some OVA that I never watched, and this is sort of a restart of that effort like a reboot of a series.  I can see why it's somewhat popular to some who are into that kind of thing, and the characters reference \"service\" as in \"fan service\" as I had been an animator in Japan in the '90s and fans of the comic would want panty-shots or risque terms that would honestly be unlikely of girls that age saying anything like that ever (having met a few in Friendship Clubs).  I think the Japanese guys wish their girls would be that way, but I've never seen it; they'll be shy and cute but not also at the same time \"suggestive\", such is this anime-style culture that's huge there, and the birth of comics that it's deep in their culture now.\n\nSo is the game good?  Here goes:\n\nGood:\nTurn-based RPG similar to Final Fantasy VII, X, or X2 (nice)\nGraphics are clean and interestingly well-rendered (even the DLC)  No expense was spared to match the anime.\nMusic is muted heavy metal with added bells for effect OR goofy cute music during intermissions.  There's only a handful of \"songs\" and everyone's EXE Drive super-attack move is the same song.  By hour 47 it starts to get old.  I wish each character had their own EXE Drive Finishing Move song, but overall well orchestrated.\nStoryline is about friendship and unity but a bit vague as to why\nGameplay is interesting and mechanics are fairly slowly fed to you, increasing complexity\nThere's some okay strategy here but not overly tactical\nThe EXE Drive Finishing moves and SP attacks are interesting to watch\nThere's some anticipation as to if the girls are going to take their comments (such as face-full-of-eggplants by IFFY to stuff in Neptunia's mouth.. ahem) any further or not (they don't).\n\"Dungeon\" areas are relatively small\nMini-boss fights are interesting and respawn as much as you like\nCostumes are well-rendered if you can get them, both in their normal or CPU forms\nWeapon types are interesting but fairly the same but are rendered nicely\nTons of unlockable content\n\nThe Bad:\nChapters 1-4 take 30 hours and Chapters 4-8 take about 8 hours\nTons of additional support characters are added after Chapter 6 when there's about 2 hours left in the game that I have no interest in.\nYou'll find you'll grind-for-cash and then be very overpowered after Chapter 4 just to buy a hair accessory\nYou'll never have enough cash to unlock everything you want to see or try out for everyone\nThe Support-Combo moves (2 characters attacking during the EXE-Drive Finishing) only works with Neptunia\nMusic and EXE-Drive Finishing moves can get tedious after a while\nStoryline is about friendship and unity but a bit vague as to why (yep, again)\nSide content and additional characters are unnecessary, only for extreme completists who want to spend 200+ hours unless you cheat and go online to read about strategies and tips to get the \"True Ending\" which is not obvious (again, you can probably beat this in under 30 hours like Epic Fantasy Battle V)\n\nI'm not sure if the \"Bad\" things are really that bad, especially the last one; some people are really really into that kinda stuff.  I'm not sure what percentage of fans are going to spend hundreds of hours with this until you're ahego-drooling during long long grinds to get that hairband that does nothing.  Maybe.\n\nThe game IS good and it keeps you entertained.  The Japanese version uses flan instead of the Americanized \"pudding\" and there are a few mis-translations here and there for cultural understandability.  It is not so cute-sy that it is stupid for babies.  It is not so \"hentai\" that it's too perverted (er.. such is the actual translation of that) but a bit.. \"cheeky\" without going anywhere there in tween innuendo.  Maybe I wanted it to go further?  Just .. a little..  bad-\"me\" to think that.\n\nFans of Final Fantasy rejoice.  If you loved X2, this is for you.\n\nRecommended.\n\nPS.  Does the American version of Noire remind anyone of Nellie from Little House on the Prairie?\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1646065950, "timestamp_updated": 1646065950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835939407348632813", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111209043": {"recommendationid": "111209043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103975554", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1452, "last_played": 1647044354}, "language": "english", "review": "Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a light hearted RPG , i recommend this game its a whole lot of fun and if you like RPGs and anime well this game has story too all in one. \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2D8HfAg0E&t=95s&ab_channel=YellowSuperNintendo\n\nA Solid Gameplay i like the game hope my review helps.\n", "timestamp_created": 1646015837, "timestamp_updated": 1646015837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568367063999176025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111030746": {"recommendationid": "111030746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124375286", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2097, "last_played": 1618618098}, "language": "english", "review": " \nit is the best neptunia for arfoire fans (after the rpg neptunia)", "timestamp_created": 1645840992, "timestamp_updated": 1645840992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110740210": {"recommendationid": "110740210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190947281", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1061, "last_played": 1691709997}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey guys, \n    Often i come on steam to play \"video games\", almost every day.

The loop of breaking monsters guards into doing massive damage just felt right to do, nothing too complex.I found myself repeating the same maps over and over just grinding every single character to lvl 99 for all the  level achievements and I wasn't bored because the combat was fun. \n\n+Combat wasn't the most braindead thing either. I think the biggest thing for the combat that people have to think about it the character positioning. You don't want your characters too near each other to get hit but you want them near each other to heal and all. It is also nice that we get to swap characters out and stuff like transforming our CPUs. The EXE drive was fun. Also a bonus is we can skip all animations by pressing l1 in this game so grinding wasn't annoying.\n\n+Anyone into grinding will really enjoy this game. Maybe not the most engaging in terms of combat it was so satisfying to not only see big numbers but see my characters level up. The gameplay loop is really enjoyable and addicting in this sense. Again it may not be for everyone but dam for those who enjoy the loop, welcome to the neptunia rabbit hole. There are so many more games to be played.\n\n+Stuff like the coliseum and dangerous enemies truly make the game more interesting and the loop more enjoyable. You can grind for the best gear of every character just for even bigger numbers and even then the coliseum can still whoop you if you aren't ready or you turned your brain off.\n\n+Funny story. It was nice to see the story of neptune from amnesiac to becoming the all-powerful goddess again. The adventure was honestly fun and charming and the story being too comedic didn't take away from the development of the cast along with it. The game for the uninitiated is a parody on gaming and by all means the story does deliver on this regard. It is especially fun to see the references all over the story.\n\n+The characters truly make neptunia what it is. They are all charming and funny and we all can have our favorites without hating the others. Also they are all girls. Noire is truly the goat character dam. In fact all the CPUs are very funny and charming in their own way. The banter between Vert and Blanc is really funny all the time as well. I like how each of the CPUs are unique in their characters. They are all tropes honestly but dam they are well-executed. In fact they play into their trope so well they even know they are tropes really. The other characters like IF and Compa too aren't the blandest of characters and overall the cast again is what makes the series.\n\n+Yes this game only has girl characters and yes there is a lot of fanservice. Not even 5 minutes into the game you are greeted with some questionable fanservice that makes you have to look around your surroundings to make sure you are truly alone. \n\n+It was nice to see classic video game characters in a parody sense. The mario and snake parodies kill me even if it's just small text that appear in the overworld. In fact not just the overworld, the entire game is filled with video game references and its really really fun to play I Spy and find them.\n\n+Very well voice-acted. It was fun to hear the dialogue and interactions between the characters. The execution of both dubs is great. Neptune's VA is great on both languages but Noire having the same voice as Makise Kurisu in Japanese doe. I found myself really playing out every dialogue just to hear them talk and its a bonus that you can open the text history and have them repeat some specific text boxes.\n\n+The soundtrack is filled with bops. I am a fan of all the tracks as they set up the mood pretty well. It is hard to take some parts seriously even if the soundtrack is in a serious tone since it is still a neptunia game but regardless a great soundtrack.\n\n+The plan system is truly unique and fun to tinker around with. Very rewarding and fun to find the different things you can make with it. Although these may seem tedious to those who are not the biggest fans of grinding, I found myself trying (and failing) to get every plan in the game unlocked.\n\n-Dungeons didn't feel so well-designed. A lot of the dungeon skins just felt the same honestly, just the same old cave or something of the sort.\n\n-Needed multiple playthroughs to get all the plans (common problem in HDN R;B) and frustrating all the time when you lack memory for the plans you want.\n\nThis game is definitely a rabbit hole that welcomes all degenerates.", "timestamp_created": 1638929546, "timestamp_updated": 1660481091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105332762": {"recommendationid": "105332762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063656654", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1468464912}, "language": "english", "review": "bobes :)", "timestamp_created": 1638760600, "timestamp_updated": 1638760600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577151477336883545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105144859": {"recommendationid": "105144859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020354307", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2582, "last_played": 1658444277}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy the characters and the story of anything else Neptunia, this is a definite yes.\nIf you don't, it's a probable no.\n\nMost of the core RPGs in the series feel very asset swapped and have similar dungeons, monsters and even combat to a point. Had I JUST played Cyberdimension Neptunia and Virtual Stars before this the balance would probably be tipped more towards a yes - as they all have very different combat styles. Coming off the back of just playing Superdimension Neptune VS SEGA Hard girls the balance is probably only just a YES because they are notable similar in so many areas. Music. Dungeon layout. Combat mechanics (though a few key things differ). Even progression to an extent. (Think 4 Goddesses in 4 areas of dungeons v 4 console generations).\n\nNothing is done poorly, but neither is any of it exceptional. I do give credit for the amount of outfit pieces you can get for every character, and thankfully the best stuff stat wise isn't a complete mismatch (even if it isn't quite perfect). It probably says more about my expectation of gaming that I almost would expect most of them to be pay walled.\n\nUltimately this is a YES. Buy this.\n\nThough I would definitely recommend either not playing two of the core RPGs back to back - and instead playing the other genres or instead, having a break between the games so you're not over familiar with a lot of what is in game.", "timestamp_created": 1638544146, "timestamp_updated": 1638544146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521094620227813721", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105110037": {"recommendationid": "105110037", "author": {"steamid": "76561199222608732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1342, "last_played": 1656052251}, "language": "english", "review": "I love sales :V", "timestamp_created": 1638495553, "timestamp_updated": 1638495553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105051152": {"recommendationid": "105051152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067444101", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1155, "last_played": 1604198785}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes!!", "timestamp_created": 1638422395, "timestamp_updated": 1638422395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105004862": {"recommendationid": "105004862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161017490", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 2705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2211, "last_played": 1638707681}, "language": "english", "review": "Somehow a lot more memorable than most JRPGs I've played.\n\nGreat dialogue and happe atmosphere.\n\nBig recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1638374739, "timestamp_updated": 1638374739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104937881": {"recommendationid": "104937881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334793503", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1600032738}, "language": "english", "review": "its fun", "timestamp_created": 1638334815, "timestamp_updated": 1638334815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104932445": {"recommendationid": "104932445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046936943", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 713, "last_played": 1677302439}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely loved this when I had it on PS Vita, and it looks even better on PC!

I readily admit that was the main reason I decided to get this game despite not really being that good at the RPG genre, but I got a lot more enjoyment out of this game beyond the anime and fanservice factor. Thrashing out against the enemies of this world turned out to be extremely satisfying, especially when doing so with characters that do not look like they belong in your average RPG party. I guess what made this so enjoyable despite difficulty spikes in some areas is the fact that it's far from your average RPG game; it's as if the devs knew that's what they were making in the process of creating it. The fourth wall was practically non-existent, half the adventurers turned out to be \"misadventurers\" who had no idea what they were getting into, the mostly consistent dungeon layouts made navigation pretty easy, especially when I have trouble keeping focus when playing games, the enemies were comically outlandish in appearance and even more so in their attacks, the plot was so absurd and it was pretty obvious you weren't meant to really make sense out of it in the first place (and I apologize if that sets off anyone who played the original ps3 rendition and found the plot progression in there more satisfying than this rendition), and the combat system was quite simple to get the hang of. The whole thing turned out to be quite a fun experience that I simply could not put down until I had cleared it for the first time. If you're looking for an RPG game that for the most part is nothing like what you would expect of an RPG game, this is certainly for you. I do of course have a few complaints about this: The controls feel very counter-intuitive when playing on a keyboard, but luckily I had a controller I could rig up to have something more comfortable. Despite my personal view that the character's lines and voices sounded much more entertaining when set to English, many of the visual novel-esque cutscenes did not play any lines while the language was set to English, but that's only a minor gripe with the parts that take place between the gameplay. Because I find myself being such a meticulous completionist, it pained me to come to terms with the fact that I couldn't unlock everything of interest on my first playthrough, but thankfully everything I unlocked in my first could be available when all the 'unlocking space' was reset when starting a new game cycle created from that completion. All in all, a great experience with a few bumps in the road, as I anticipated it would be.\n\n\n\n(And on a side note, while I shared my screen so some of my friends could watch me play it, we found that many of the interactions between characters in the cutscenes seemed to be very similar to our own interactions and mannerisms, which made us both laugh and cringe)", "timestamp_created": 1638239550, "timestamp_updated": 1638239550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555641055107116699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104648470": {"recommendationid": "104648470", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971193297", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1587, "last_played": 1461275942}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful!", "timestamp_created": 1638156914, "timestamp_updated": 1638156914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104556090": {"recommendationid": "104556090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113952006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 141, "last_played": 1638114043}, "language": "english", "review": "Nep Nep", "timestamp_created": 1638112237, "timestamp_updated": 1638112237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104535916": {"recommendationid": "104535916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325138557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 807, "last_played": 1642865527}, "language": "english", "review": "Do I need to say anything?\n\nyes of course, STOP BREAKING THE FORTH WALL DANGIT!\n\nanyway, the story is actually quite predictable but when you play all series its actually quire rich (yes i play the res then play the first one as last... a long story) And it has a very funny story or maybe i have a weird humor idk.\n\nthe gameplay is... an RPG.

The game is too easy, unless you purposely handicap yourself and don't level so much. The reused assets for some of the areas you explore are lame as hell, like you would unlock a new warehouse area for example, but the place looks EXACTLY like the warehouse level you've explored at the beginning of the game.\nOther than that, I've still found myself enjoying this game very much. The story isn't all that amazing, but it's the characters and their silly antics that do it for me. They feel so much alive it's kinda uncanny and their interactions with each other are done so well.

For the current price and on sale this is a recommend for people who just wanna play a simple RPG.", "timestamp_created": 1634474294, "timestamp_updated": 1634476103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101019125": {"recommendationid": "101019125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004565666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 283, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 695, "last_played": 1634174414}, "language": "english", "review": "Not revolutionary, but decent.

My only real criticisms of the combat are that it doesn't do a good job of indicating what level you're expected to be to fight given foes (especially since plans add strong minibosses to areas of otherwise-lower-level enemies), and fiddling with your character position to hit multiple enemies with a basic attack combo hurts the pacing.", "timestamp_created": 1634175026, "timestamp_updated": 1634175026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543859660625457764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100959809": {"recommendationid": "100959809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168567256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2539, "last_played": 1597271931}, "language": "english", "review": "chris-chan lore. shit game tho", "timestamp_created": 1634073841, "timestamp_updated": 1634860305, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.422788560390472412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100877292": {"recommendationid": "100877292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064186889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6382, "last_played": 1635717435}, "language": "english", "review": "good rpg that is fun to grind on and has a bit of fan service lol.

I paid full price for it and I would happily do it again because I really enjoy the games from Idea Factory and Compile Heart. The best way I can summarize this game is that it is an anti rpg game. What I mean is everything that people think of when it comes to high quality is thrown out of the window. \n\nFirst, the fourth wall breaking is very out of place in most rpg's but it feels right at home with the antics by Neptune (who from henceforth shall be called nep-nep) and company. As others have pointed out that it is basically meme material and I do not see a problem with that as long as the player knows what they are getting themselves into. Every cutscene I found myself laughing at not only the absurdity of some of the dialogue/situations but also the parodying of one of the most rage inducing enviroments which is the console wars.\n\nSecond, to the reviewers that complain about the use of alternate colors, tedious gameplay and the like, that is the point of the game. Again, it's a parody of rpg's which is even stated by nep-nep in 4th wall breaking dialogue. It is also a homage to the old 8-bit and 16-bit rpg's where they had to do a color change because of the lack of memory size in the cartridge. Personally, I find not only a nostalgia feeling, but I can not help but chuckle at the same things I always questioned of those games, to be brought up by the game itself.\n\nFinally, while I do not like the grind as much as I would other games, it's a necessary evil being that it is the norm for most of the retro games. At some point (the ng+ for me) it gets boring going through the game powered-up from the game before but it also allows more content to be viewed/played, items to be crafted and if it matters to you, achievements to be completed. \n\nThe price isn't bad at all for the standalone game, but if you are really on the fence about it I would wait for a bundle sale or humble bundle to pick it up. There will always be people who are not happy with a game (variety is the spice of life) but if you enjoy anime, roleplaying games, laughing at in-game antics and 4th wall breaking dialogue then I would humbly suggest trying this game.", "timestamp_created": 1633274743, "timestamp_updated": 1633274743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665252804756164551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100305030": {"recommendationid": "100305030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064572770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 6082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6082, "last_played": 1613342108}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, a bit repetitive in some parts and definitely better with all DLC because that reduces the amount of grinding you have to do.", "timestamp_created": 1633099360, "timestamp_updated": 1633099360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100278721": {"recommendationid": "100278721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037956996", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2089, "last_played": 1636246843}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphics are cute and the game is good.

Anime Network[/url] to view this review with pictures and alot of other reviews and anime content![/b]\n\n[b]Follow us for more reviews at:  \n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/vnislife]Visual novel, JRPG, Anime Steam Group[/url] [/b][/h1]\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nGame Industry, the world in this game has been for centuries ruled by four goddesses. Neptune, Noire, Vert, and Blanc. But since humankind can remember, the four goddesses have been entrenched in a long Console War, a war that took place to decide who will be the one to rule over the whole of Game Industry.\n\nDuring this longstanding battle, a new figure inserts herself in the matter and takes advantage of the situation for her own purposes, getting rid of Neptune who is the most dangerous threat to her. With a combined effort of this new enemy alongside the other three goddesses, Neptune is defeated and thrown down from the goddess palace sent crashing into a nearby forest.\n\nA young lady named Compo saw a shooting star-like object falling from the sky into the nearby park and decides to check it out. When she arrives she finds an unconscious girl at crash site.\nAfter bringing Neptune back to her apartment and nursing her we find out that Neptune has amnesia and is clueless as to what happened. This starts an adventure to find clues and recover Neptune's memory to know who she is and to understand the events that happened that day.\n\nTo undergo this mission, we explore dungeons, forests, caves, and other places and dimensions. We control the movements and actions of Neptune and her new friend Compa to fight an ever increasing amount of monsters that have started appearing in Celestia. \n\nEventually, they come across a culprit named Arfoire who seems to understand what is happening. Their travels take the girls to Lastation, Leanbos, and Lowee where they meet the goddesses under different circumstances and it appears as though they are all involved in the scheme of Arfoire, who also brought trouble to them. \nSlowly Neptune gathers more and more allies during her travels and new friends ready and willing to help her in this dire situation. A friendship, that is bound to rewrite the book of history in a new light.\n\n[b]World Presentation & Visuals:[/b]\nThe world is large floating island separated into 4 areas for each goddess. The diversity in the environments are varied between natural areas such as mountains, forests parks, to industrial buildings, old factories, and even ones that look dimensional. The environments match well to the specific city that they are in with the exception of Basilicoms. Each goddess has their own unique theme for their city.\n\nPlaneptune is the most advanced city of all with a very modern layout and presentation. \nLaststation is a industry-driven city, were large factories and smoke seems to be the standard.\nLeanbox is an atypic-looking city with a specific style of buildings and the look is very unique.\nLowee is a nordic style city, the buildings are round-shaped and modern-looking buildings adapted to cold weather and keeping one warm.\n\nThe character sprites are all drawn well with lots of diversity in their poses and facial expressions. The artwork really expresses each girls emotions perfectly and it really adds to the effect in comedic moments. Each girl only has one outfit for these scenes, but you can unlock new appearances from plans that you find from the second chapter onwards as well as various designs from purchasable DLCs.\n\nThe CG's are high quality with vivid details that are well highlighted which represent the specific area they are in appropriately.\nAdditionally, we have a feature that unlocks CG's and music in a Museum. This opens up by completing stories and unlocking new chapters.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThis is a Dungeon JRPG in which we can set up a team of three characters as the active team plus three additional that play the role of background support characters. While we battle different kinds of foes we can change characters by switching the main character from the frontline to the character in the background adapting to the combative needs, or preference if wanting to level up a specific character's Lili ranks.\n\nOnce we know that Neptune is actually a goddess she ends up transforming and we can use her full potential in battle likewise to the other three goddesses and two additional goddesses available in DLC's. \n\nThe battles are turn-based, either fighting a horde of small NPC's or a single boss monster that is much stronger and more difficult to defeat. There are different types of elements involved where goddesses, friends, and monsters each have their own element. Adapting your team to be strong against specific elements is a necessity or the given monsters will remain too strong.\n\nOn an additional note, upgrades can be bought and unlocked by plans that you collect through the game. Once a plan is obtained, you can purchase the item in the shop to upgrade characters. Need a stronger sword? Collect the materials to unlock the plan and buy it! \nThis feature is a really neat one with a good variety of options for each character. An added bonus is that you can gather materials for plans that change the appearance of a character. As you tend to get invested in the characters, this is a huge bonus where you can personalize them and well worth the effort.\n\n[b]Voices and Music:[/b]\nThe game is partially voiced, events are not all voiced sadly but the voiced ones are outstanding with top tier voice actresses. There are frequent comical and funny quotes which made me laugh and smile over and over again. I can not say enough positive remarks about the voice acting when it was present.\n\nDuring the fights the game is fully voiced. Attacks are named and voice quotes are added for a few of the special attacks from each character which I found to be very neat. This helps to further establish the personality types of the girls.\nThe game is accompanied by an amazing opening song and also enjoyable background music. I really did enjoy the opening and could see how many YouTube reviewers would want to include it somewhere in their video review as it fits this game perfectly.\n\n[b]Routes:[/b]\nWe don't have any choices in the game that would change the story, but we do have a choice between two different routes. I wouldn't call one route a bad route since both routes are good in their own right. But we have only one true ending. \n\nThe routes are decided by certain key points to attain and watch over. If we don't reach the necessary points requirements we won't be able to achieve the true route. Still, I really do recommend doing the playthrough twice for both routes because both endings are a must-watch.\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b]\nThe game provides different achievements of accomplishments, some of them require quite a few hours of gameplay since they are thought to be complete. The toughest of them being the millionaire achievement which is not easy to complete even with the additional DLC's.\n\n[b]Overall Impression and Thoughts:[/b]\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 is definitely a great JRPG that has super cute characters, amazing opening and ending songs, nicely voiced parts, and a good deal of humor mixed inside fun combat. There is a noticeable grind, but the story is engaging and helps motivate you to make it through the grind of monster hunting.\n\nI did enjoy it from start to end, and of course, once we fought our sweat off, why not finish the day with some delicious pudding?

steam sale back in 2018, I could say I have become a fan and cannot wait to play the other titles.  \n\nNeptunia Re;birth 1 is a very lighthearted, comedic, and cute turn based JRPG with a well written story that is told through a traditional visual novel style. You follow the adventures of Neptune, a CPU (in this universe, a goddess) of the nation of Planeptune and her friends she meets along the way. The game features and entirely female party where each character is based off a game, game console, or game company. Everything in this game is a reference or homage to the game industry (which is also the name of the world the game takes place in). \n\nThe game is a turn based JRPG but does not play like a traditional turn based JRPG. To elaborate, when you enter a battle there is a small ring which is where you can move party, and there is also a blue box on the ground that shows where and what your attacks will hit, this makes for very versatile turn-based combat. There is also a system called EXE Guage that builds up by the amount of hits your party deals on an enemy and how much an enemy\u2019s attack lands on you. Upon reaching 1 bar in the EXE gauge, you can unleash an ultimate attack that each has very eye-catching animations for going ham on an enemy. Through my journey unlike in most other JRPGs where after a certain point most items are useless, that is not the case here in Neptunia. Items will be your best friend throughout most of the game. I cannot recall a boss where I did not use a portion of sorts. The game is also NOT open world, everyplace you adventure to is a small dungeon with quite a lot of monsters and usually one or two strong monster which is an optional mini boss that you must slay for guild quests. Although the game only has dungeons each dungeon is fun to explore, item search, and fight the monsters that are unique to said dungeon. The one flaw that is a turn-off for many newcomers (like me) is the game has way too much grinding for each boss. I got through the huge level spike bosses by means which I cannot discuss in this review.  \n\nYou can pick the game up on Steam and Ps Vita (but I don\u2019t know why you would). There is also a remake coming soon for PS5 exclusively called Neptunia ReVerse which I would recommend picking up if you have your hands on a PS5. \n\n \n\nFor the ratings: \n\nStory/writing - 7 \n\nGraphics/performance - 7 (it isn't great for today's standards but for the time it was made, it is not bad at all. \n\nGameplay \u2013 8 \n\nOverall score \u2013 7.3", "timestamp_created": 1628090914, "timestamp_updated": 1628090914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96673314": {"recommendationid": "96673314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057947367", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9674, "last_played": 1657340160}, "language": "english", "review": "Nep", "timestamp_created": 1627710671, "timestamp_updated": 1627710671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498460888862609863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96650261": {"recommendationid": "96650261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285380833", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1626210395}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the starting of the \"point of no return\". \n\nPlease pray for my safety...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. . .", "timestamp_created": 1627673960, "timestamp_updated": 1627673960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560563385486602783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96540228": {"recommendationid": "96540228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315219863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1010, "last_played": 1690437910}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate this game", "timestamp_created": 1627508942, "timestamp_updated": 1627508942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96439106": {"recommendationid": "96439106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205711095", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 5349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1628126813}, "language": "english", "review": "this game has nep nep and anime girls to fill your empty heart", "timestamp_created": 1627359988, "timestamp_updated": 1627359988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96372000": {"recommendationid": "96372000", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986564872", "num_games_owned": 605, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 5065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5065, "last_played": 1627250247}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would nep again", "timestamp_created": 1627250276, "timestamp_updated": 1627250276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96295567": {"recommendationid": "96295567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198964260087", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1367, "last_played": 1636351406}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego buenas mecanicas y buenos personajes.

Also for anyone who wants to understand the story but doesn't want to listen to someone talk about there favourite character for half hour, (*Cough* Noire) i would highly recommend watching the anime, its nothing special, but it gets the point of the story across.\n\nAs far as the game play (turn base) it is fun but not easy, in other words more of a challenge for players who don't know what they are doing but you get used to it. I'm not much of a fan of turn base games but i love this one.\n\nHighly recommend for any anime fan, or even a random gamer, give the game a try it may surprise you.\n \nThanks for reading :)",

It's like a team of amicable goofball perverts got together and said, \"hey, let's make a game!\" There's a general feeling of \"being in on the joke\" while playing - they know you know, and you know they know you know. \"Chill, and enjoy our ridiculous, well-polished trash. Hang out with your dumb, fun anime friends. Repeat to yourself, 'it's just a show, I should really just relax'.\" It is beyond silly, and embraces it. The content that is here, gameplay wise, is also polished, and quite slick. There's just not a lot of it that's not copy-pasted.

If you have any interest in Neptunia you might as well start here, as the game is only 20 hours long (including the true ending) and this remake provides a very smooth experience, with only some minor grievances.\n\nA little bit of a history lesson, the first Hyperdimension Neptunia game was released on the PS3 in 2010 and it was arguably one of the worst JRPG's ever made, it still sits at only 45% on Metacritic, due to its very poor gameplay choices and performance. But it did have some very cool characters that we still love today. It wasn't until the third game (Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory) that the series was finally a success, and then Idea Factory decided to remake the whole trilogy on Victory's engine, and the Re;Birth games on Vita and PC are the result of that effort. The gameplay was vastly improved, but the games share a lot of assets as an unfortunate side effect of using Victory as a base. It's also worth noting that large parts of the story in Re;Birth 1 were rewritten to make the characters less antagonistic towards each other.\n\nJust like other Idea Factory games, it's a visual novel/dungeon crawler hybrid. The combat is turn-based, but you can move within a radius on your turn. You take position and either execute combo attacks, or use skills which range from simple heals and buffs to powerful attacks with epic anime cutscenes. Characters can transform into their \"goddess\" forms Sailor Moon/Power Rangers style, which boosts their stats and gives access to exclusive attacks. The mechanics are easy to learn and offer just enough depth. And all animations can be skipped so the combat is never a chore.\n\nThe problem with Re;Birth 1 specifically is that it has an inverse difficulty curve. One of the earliest bosses in the game ([spoiler]Black Heart[/spoiler]) is a massive difficulty spike and probably the toughest challenge across the whole trilogy, and unfortunately does require some grinding and strategic use of items. The first half of the game is overall a bit of a slog with spongy enemies and prolonged battles. But once you unlock EXE drives the difficulty completely evaporates and all you do is spam rush attacks to fill up your EXE gauge and then spam your strongest EXE drive. Later games in the series are better balanced, so don't let this discourage you.\n\nThe game also has only 3 party member slots unlike 4 in every other Neptunia game, which limits your combat options a bit. It's especially disappointing since there are so many playable characters, including many DLC ones. And speaking of DLC, don't turn on the Plutia and Peashy DLC on your first playthrough, these characters are from Victory/Re;Birth 3 and their HDD transformations are supposed to be big plot twists, which this DLC will completely spoil for you. It's fun to play as them in Re;Birth 1 but they don't have any story scenes, so you won't be really missing out.\n\nYou've probably heard of other remakes and re-releases of the first Neptunia game, so let's take a look at how this PC version stacks up against them. The Vita version is completely superseded by the Steam release, as the latter has way better graphics and more content. Re;Birth 1 Plus on the PS4 has some minor improvements which weren't backported to the PC release, mainly the 4th party member slot and a couple more guest characters. And then the recently released Neptunia ReVerse on the PS5 is again the same game, with slightly [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMbP42TNRNA]improved graphics[/url] (but way too much bloom) and a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fYbJbp3iIg]fishing mini-game[/url]. ReVerse is indeed the definitive edition with technically the most content and features, but it's $50 and PS5 exclusive, and I wouldn't say it's worth it for such minimal changes.", "timestamp_created": 1623606168, "timestamp_updated": 1665126229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739672958850860596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93429596": {"recommendationid": "93429596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343897859", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1613363260}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Puedo explicarlo.", "timestamp_created": 1623185534, "timestamp_updated": 1623185534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93175387": {"recommendationid": "93175387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151482230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1782, "last_played": 1622893871}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is trash, basically the only positive thing about it is the cute characters. Gameplay is bottom of the barrel, you're forced to grind and the only relevant strategy is to spam super attacks and spam rush attacks in order to build up your super meter. You end up having a decent amount of characters to use by the end but for some reason you get around half of them only in the last 1/4 of the story and they're all shit compared to characters you already as well as possibly underlevelled if you grinded so there's no reason to use them. In general the only characters worth using at all are your four transforming characters as well as Compa who serves as a dedicated healer. You can buy DLC characters as well who are apparently overpowered and just breeze through the game if you want which doesn't really sit well with me but whatever. \n\nYou'll be going through different dungeons which are all copy pasted version of previous dungeons and they all have incredibly boring level design so you won't be enjoying seeing them again. You'll also be fighting the same pallet swapped basic enemies and dungeon minibosses over and over again to gather materials and to grind exp. The way progression works is basically you go through the story until you get thrashed by a boss, then go back to a previous dungeon and grind until you can destroy it in 3-5 exe attacks. \n\nThere's also  the plans system. You use materials from minibosses and basic monsters to activate plans which then impact gameplay. You have plans for more or less everything including gameplay settings, items, costumes, equipment, changing the minibosses and items found in dungeons and even adding entirely optional dungeons. This is an absolute chore to get through, you'll want to have a browser window open with a spreadsheet or guide because there's no way to track which monsters drop the items you need for a plan and then you'll be going around killing the same shitty mobs over and over again hoping they drop what you need. You can probably go through the entire game without touching the plans system since grinding is the only thing that matters. You get enough good items and weapons without it and the system plans are the only ones that really make a difference since they can change the difficulty or give you cheaper exe attacks.\n\nIf you're going into this game hoping for a good story and interesting characters then look elsewhere.

I dont usually play JRPGs but this one is really fun to play and well done. It has a really really good plot, nice characters, a lot of customizable items, items as well, weapons and dungeons to explore and grind up to lvl 99 on all characters. Neptune is really fun and wholesome to read/listen to, so theres no way to get bored while playing it. +, the dlcs add stuff that will make you wanna play more and more, there are more than 1 ending and once you completed the game you can replay it with all your stuff and lvls, a detail that will help you to get the other endings faster.\n\nthe only \"bad\" thing, is the lack of animations and voice narrating, most of the times you\u00b4ll have to read, but its mostly because the game is kinda old, but it really doesnt affect the gameplay.\n\nIf you like anime and want to try a JRPG, this

basado en las parodias de la industria de los videojuegos, es una re-imaginaci\u00f3n como reinicio de la trilogia original de PS3 basandose en la jugabilidad JRPG de MK2 y Victory, originalmente este juego fue lanzado como exclusiva de la Playstation Vita junto con 2 ReBirths m\u00e1s y 4 Spin-Offs usando motor de Fellistela, la historia es algo sencilla pero efectiva.\n\nLo Bueno:\n- Buena M\u00fasica\n- Personajes muy carismaticos (al punto que digas, mi waifu 4 life)\n- Jugabilidad JRPG entretenido y son salteables las animaciones para ahorrar tiempo\n- Doblaje en Ingles muy memorable (rara vez que pasa en esta clase de juegos japos como Disgaea)\n-  Si eres del gran conocimiento estaras como oh entendi esto\n\nLo malo:\n- El port a PC esta mal optimizado, lo peor que te puede pasar es un softlock en combate siendo un bug rompe juegos que sigue presente \n- No hay traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol para algunos puede alejar los que no saben el idioma (aunque no creo que sea el unico en quejarme)\n- No hay configuraci\u00f3n grafica, algo fatal de los requisitos que pide\n- En algunas escenas en el doblaje al ingles no estan dobladas por razones desconocidas, muy por parte el director del estudio que eso se le llama flojera\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n: Es un juego bastante divertido, si es tu primera vez vas a estar en un buen reto que se requiere mucho muchisimo tiempo y dedicaci\u00f3n, los dlc son opcionales y el capitulo 2 del jefe esta p-censurado- con ganas, asi que ten una buen pudin (Flan) y adentrate en este mundo de Nepita y sus amigas. 8/10",

Unfortunately, the game misuses this to create characters that are very hollow and lack any kind of motivation - completely the opposite of what I like in JRPGs.\n\nThe gameplay is weak - only at the last chapter was there anything resembling a 'RPG' where you had some decent set of choices and options. Otherwise it is almost always a very algorithmic action game. As others have pointed out, it is also very heavily grindy, and it is also aware of it - it does give some options to make it a little easier to grind.\n\nThe story makes no sense. Further, the comedy didn't always hit - it fell flat many times.\n\nFor a JRPG the music is disappointing. I always have high expectations for music in this genre, and nothing stands out in rebirth 1.\n\nIn my opinion, this game doesn't deserve an 'overwhelming positive'.

gameplay.\nPros\n+Cute girls\n+Nice art \n+Fun dialogue, breaks the 4th wall many times, lighthearted and cute\n+Game has an integrated skip animation button to make fights faster\n+Japanese voices are included, and you can toggle them anytime\n+Good Music, albeit it gets reused quite a bit in dungeons...\n+Money is hard to come by until the endgame, and you end up using items a lot to heal, which is a rare sight in RPG's these days, which shower you with more than enough resources\n\nCons\n-Very basic gameplay, you go forward and attack enemies, defend, use items, not much strategy needed.\n-Bestiary is a joke, can't see enemy experience and credits drop.\n-A lot of reused assets, way too many recolored enemies, reused dungeons (as in the whole dungeon gets copy pasted and renamed), reused dungeon textures to make a \"new one\", this gives the game a very cheap feeling and an overall feel of \n the game having a budget of a mcdonalds menu.\n-Tutorials ingame are functional, but many things aren't explained, like how your characters have passive skills, along with Lily skills they can give to partners.\n-You get a lot of characters really late in the story, giving you not much chance to try them, since you probably don't have gear for them, and they come at predefined levels, you will be better off with your usual party.\n-Endgame is very grindy, from max level 99 to 999, you can expect a good bunch of hours just leveling, then getting items to unlock enemy add plans to challenge harder stuff.\n-Remake system is more of an annoyance than anything, you need to gather items to research plans that either give you gameplay bonuses or new items in the shop, this is just a time sink, usually the items required are simple to get but the sheer number of new items makes it very annoying to go get the required items.\n-A lot of DLC, most of it is very trashy and should have been added in updates\n-DLC characters are much more powerful than what you have in vanilla, they hit way too hard and make the game a joke\n-All shops are the same, same with cities, guilds, etc.\n-You don't explore the world, you have an overview of the whole world and press on icons.\n-The CPU diary on each city has like 4 entries each, which are very short too, don't expect extra lore or anything relevant here.\n-Some dungeon plans are in hidden treasures in random spots, which also have random loot, this is very annoying.\n-ALL of the bosses you will end up approaching the same way no matter your party composition, use Rush attacks, build EXE gauge, unleash EXE attacks, rinse and repeat.\nOverall I only recommend it for people who can ignore the really bad gameplay and reused assets, and want to see the story through, because the gameplay is just that bad.\n5/10, don't buy if you have good taste in RPG's...", "timestamp_created": 1615534030, "timestamp_updated": 1615534030, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0,

(If you've played this, I'm referring to the first encounter with Arfoire.) Then in the optional dungeons (I assume they're optional as they're only unlocked via a function called \"Plans\" and don't seem to be required for migrating the story) which I assume are for grinding up your level to deal with upcoming bosses, there's stupid things to deal with like having multiple variations of the enemy (namely the rabbits in the factory) that all have the exact same field model. Now, this by itself isn't an issue but there is an INSANE variation in their strength. One of them I can kill at my level in about 2 hits, some others will 2 hit *ME*, and for whatever reason you have no way of knowing you've encountered one until you're getting wiped out and the flee command is doing nothing but wasting turns... all this making the player lose valuable progress because several of these dungeons, including the one thats the worst offender of this don't have a place where you can save.

This is because you can easily unlock dungeons early on which are way too strong to beat. So at least save before you go in them.\n\nWhen you first meet Noire it can get quite difficult. My advice is to go to the shops and equip good gear early on. Then check your combo setting, get it set up and ready. That means doing a few battles and getting the EXE to level 1 at least.

after messing around a whole crapton, i finally have them at a comfortable setting. the gameplay is pretty nice and smooth, i've crashed 2 times so far but i don't really remember why, but besides that everything else is pretty smooth. you can switch between english and japanese voices which is awesome but the english side has less lines, sometimes you get the VN effect of only important lines being read. the voice acting is pretty cute and sometimes cool. the plans are a really cool mechanic but some of the things you make are already too weak compared to what you can buy in the market or what you already have by the time you get the materials to make them. the camera's a little weird but it's tolerable, and the story and plot is really good with consistent progression as far as i can see in chapter 4. and lastly, you get free stuff from some of the dlc's, and the other dlc's are worth checking out, so much cool stuff in there. the game is a little inconsistent in terms of grinding, you'll be fine at first but then all of a sudden you have to grind a bunch, and then you just have to do a little bit in the next chapter. and lastly, i'm still having trouble understanding guard damage. i don't know if it means that it does additional damage if they are guarding or if it does additional damage to the guard itself or what, but as of now i'll give the game 8.5/10 neps",

Because you spent almost all your time grinding and not having enough of what you need. They really don't lie when they say it's extremely customisable to your play style (like Factorio.) And (much like Factorio) you will happily sink many hours of your life away into it. And if even someone like me can finish it on normal difficulty, I imagine you will also be able to.\n\nDownsides:\n- No automation. Which really kind of sucks for those moments when you'll spent three hours grinding in dungeons only to get knocked out by the level boss. (Use your save files wisely, and save whenever possible.)\n- There aren't any trains.\n- The story is surprising, relaxed, unexpected, and actually really good. It's so good that the actual gameplay gets in the way of it.\n\nPlus-sides:\n- The story is surprising, relaxed, unexpected, and actually really good. It's so good that the actual gameplay gets in the way of it, BUT defeating bosses is satisfying.\n- Cute Outfits, and roughly one trillion different craftable accessories to go with them.

Leveling up isn't as hard as I first thought but there are just TOO MANY things to unlock. Almost all items are behind a lock wall and we need to collect items from dungeons to unlock them for them to show up in the shop. Plus same name, same design item can have multiple unlockable copies for some characters, and that makes the game require us to unlock the same stuff over and over again with different drop/requirement just to use that same item on another character. In short, this game is super grindy even when the drop rate is very high for the ingredients, there's just too many things to unlock.\n\nThe Battle is a hybrid between turn based rpg + action button smasher + Japanese style Tactic (SLG). Loading battle scene whenever there's an encounter. But the game has given the players an option to \"kill\" the monster like a normal action rpg (without exp and drops) to get rid of the monster on screen and avoid certain encounters. Which is a great way to save some resources when you're low and camping for levels and doesn't want to hunt certain types of monsters.\n\nBut if you are only into the story, and not being a completionist trying to get every achievements unlocked... you can actually finish the game both normal and true ending ignoring most of the unlockables. And actually, you can get all steam achievements without unlocking everything in game too... So it's really up to you how to enjoy the game play.\n\nThe story alone is worth the full price and those who loves to grind and unlock should get all the DLCs.", "timestamp_created": 1610538184, "timestamp_updated": 1610545128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569166660308837891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84527254": {"recommendationid": "84527254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195238539", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2016, "last_played": 1687158191}, "language": "english", "review": "its like persona but not at all actually and it has anime girls", "timestamp_created": 1610418404, "timestamp_updated": 1610418404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56632077693939209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84525820": {"recommendationid": "84525820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057867827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2708, "last_played": 1455765567}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game if you like jrpgs similar to DQ.

As a young teen, the speed at which one progressed through the game was alright, with thorough tutorials and many side quests to get lost in. However, as I have gotten older, I sense that the story progression is quite slow, especially in the beginning before you've gotten some extra characters (Compa, IF, Green Heart etc). If you are heavily into cheesy, anime stories, this slow progression might be right up your ally though!\nAs for the combat, it is a bit repetitive, and there are about 5 map layouts that are repeated throughout the game, with only a difference in what monsters pop up. However, I wouldn\u00b4t say I've ever been bored by the game. Graphics are great, typical for this studio, and the voice acting is superb as well. Cute conversations with loveable characters, [spoiler] especially if you buy the DLC with Plutia kappa [/spoiler] and if you grind hard enough you can buy them all swimsuits.\nAn important note to add is that losing progress is RIDICULOUSLY easy. I have had to start over twice and that is the only reason I have yet to complete the game, as I wouldn\u00b4t say the game has magnificent replayability.\nNow as I have gotten older, the game has a special place in my heart. I will never be able to not recommend this game, because I, in some weird way, grew up with these characters. If you are looking for a game that will make you smile, laugh, and just genuinely have a good time with, despite the lackluster game mechanics, then this game is definitely for you!! \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1609941446, "timestamp_updated": 1609941446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84061069": {"recommendationid": "84061069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076711294", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2708, "last_played": 1628080628}, "language": "english", "review": "A solid anime/waifu JRPG.

"review": "Considering i've played at least ~100 hours total of the series on steam and own a few of the titles on my vita i could probably write out an essay detailing each aspect that i liked but i'll just cut to the chase.\n\nIf you're a normal person with lots of irl commitments and limited free time you might have trouble enjoying this game unironically. \n\nIf you like basic comfy anime, have the time to waste on a JRPG and can look past superficial things like reused assets, you might be surprised by just how much enjoyment and content you can get from neptunia rebirth 1.\n\nI'll note this first off, the neptunia series even with the rebirth games isn't known for it's stellar gameplay so you'll have to be able to attach yourself to the characters (which are fairly anime trope-y as the series goes along with rebirth 1 being the least severe with this at least; haha noire no friends! haha vert booba! etc.), appreciate the references to different games/consoles (is that mario???) and read the dialogue of the equally quirky NPCS in the overworld to push through the grind and enjoy yourself (you can use DLC weapons i guess but you wont have fun that way either, face noire like a man!).  \n\nGame Mechanics wise, the only significant things you need to pay attention to are status effects and how much dmg is dealt to you overall positioning is braindead and you'll figure that out pretty quick. Movement within the small dungeons is basically walk around edges and hit them from behind so also pretty braindead there since they wont aggro you past a point. Also spam collect button/dont avoid enemies since you want to stock items up for plans. Don't go being lazy.\n\nIf you're worried about endgame content, at worst you can grind the colosseum (not that you'll really want to do that anyway since it's just about status effect abuse at that point). \n\nPersonally rebirth 1 is my favourite in the series just because it has more of a focus on a smaller cast of characters, because seeing noire become more friendly with nep nep is the cutest shit ever and journeying to see the different nations and their leaders is a cool experience that isn't really replicated later in the series as their personalities get mellowed out.\n\n10/10 I'll end it here Noire best girl, peace out.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1608995445, "timestamp_updated": 1608995445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612575352191925049", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83164592": {"recommendationid": "83164592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393975413", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 951, "last_played": 1619977002}, "language": "english", "review": "i think i caused whales to go extinct.", "timestamp_created": 1608950543, "timestamp_updated": 1608950543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83081520": {"recommendationid": "83081520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198234161144", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4042, "last_played": 1641829583}, "language": "spanish", "review": "nep nep", "timestamp_created": 1608861899, "timestamp_updated": 1608861899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83001930": {"recommendationid": "83001930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115366736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 3586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3586, "last_played": 1608769446}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1608769546, "timestamp_updated": 1608769546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82979573": {"recommendationid": "82979573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032218026", "num_games_owned": 1001, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 3492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3489, "last_played": 1698023101}, "language": "english", "review": "My introduction to Neptune and the beginning of a new addiction.

Not a bad game by any means but:\n\n- The characters are ok and pretty cute, but the plot seems to be pretty garbage (at least so far), ngl. The humour also falls flat imo (the gaming jokes/references in the dialogue feel forced to me, idk).\n- No overworld like a standard JRPG should have, just dungeons.\n- What's the point in a jump button if the jump is so miniscule/small? lmao\n- I feel there should be more animated scenes in places where there aren't. Missed opportunity.\n- The VN scenes feel like the most budget ones I've ever seen a \"big\" JRPG. Like seriously, even the DS Sonic games do a better job (despite there only being 1 JRPG on it). Like for real, the backgrounds of these scenes look like they belong in a 2D sidescroller or something. And the character animations don't have much to them here.\n\n^ (edited in) Ok so granted, I actually like Persona and those games are sorta like this, but you gotta understand, at least those games have social sims and stuff to do inbetween, y'know.\n\n- Resolution only goes up to 1366x768, and you have to deal with weird looking bars on the top and bottom if the game doesn't fit the screen in full. It's annoying, I gotta say. (full screen btw, I prefer it over windowed)\n\n\nYeah. There are things I find ok tho:\n\n- Again, the characters.\n- The OST. It's nothing incredible/mind blowing, and nowhere near the best I've heard in a JRPG, but it's alright.\n- Said dungeons from above have fluid controls, so no worries there. And they're also better designed than, dare I say it... Tales of dungeons imo, for a random comparison.\n\n\nMid:\n\n- Battle system. I DO like it; feels like Eternal Sonata's battle system (one of my favourite battle systems of all time) without the music mechanics and more simplified, but... That's the thing, it just doesn't feel as intense, just \"ok\". I will say though enemies definitely feel unbalanced at times. Like, I feel I'm currently at a decent level and some enemies would kick my ass at times (\"some\" meaning the other \"some\" enemies feel balanced, if that makes sense). Another thing I don't like about the battle system is, once you start a chain of normal attacks, you can't use an SP skill within that chain, and vice versa. Pretty annoying.\n\nI honestly feel like the combat in this game could easily get repetitive tho, so eh.\n\n\nSo tl;dr:\n\n- \"Ok\" and slightly cute characters (not the ones I'd wanna take home and hug all day, but hey).\n- Forced humour/references (imo).\n- Decent OST.\n- Lazily done VN scenes, as well as them being pretty oversaturated.\n- Really meh plot imo.\n- Pretty annoying resolution options, but still managable.\n- A jump button that serves no purpose.\n- Decent dungeons.\n- Fluid controls inside of said dungeons.\n- An \"ok\" battle system; nothing mindblowing. Again, check Eternal Sonata if you want a better version of this one. Again, feels like it could get repetitive fast.\n- Gameplay wise there's literally only dungeons you can sit through, which I gotta say, it could've been way more. Oh well.\n\nOverall, with the time I had with this game I'd have to give it a 5.5/10 at best. 6 if I'm being generous. I'll keep the game for now, but the chances are I'm gonna be refunding this, ngl.

I'd guess it's the characters because everything else besides the music is pretty average, average is fine, this game isn't meant to break any technical boundaries. The gameplay serves its purpose well enough. This game would most likely be better if they focused more on the slice of life aspect. Seriously, this series has so much potential. \n It's grindy but I was way overleveled by the time I beat the final boss (My fault). If you have a hard time use exe moves and rush attacks, if that doesn't work then level a little. It has a weird difficulty spike with a lonely heart, use exes if possible and grind a little.      \nI would definitely recommend a controller for this game, KB-M will work but it's not ideal at all, this game was made for vita and PS4 controls. A Xbox one, 360 or PS4 controls will work nicely. You may have problems with the resolution like not being able to put it to 1920x1080, this can be fixed in windows 10 by right clicking the game in steam library, properties, local files, browse local files, right click the exe file, right click, select properties, compatibility, Change high dpi settings, click the override high dpi setting box, make sure it says application, than click apply. This should fix the issue, if not there are plenty of guides on the topic. This seems to work with every other Neptunia game that has the same problem. If you use an xbox controller A and be can be reversed which is a real pain, you\u2019ll just have to tinker with it a bit, Mapping A to A and B to B worked the last time I did it.

However, there are some of bad/un-fun elements. The battle system tends to get boring, especially if you are like me and 100% the game (clione farming sucks), many times during my first run characters would leave the party with my gear attached (which sucked).

Using the right mouse button or 'K' key to jump, not the spacebar (that's used in 99.999999% of all PC games) is just the beginning. That's how messed up the keyboard and mouse controls in this game are.  \n\nSo much wasted potential. Unfortunately, this \"PC\" game is an unplayable hack job, not a PC port. It's a vita port by a developer that's never played a PC game. The basic fundamentals of character control were figured out ages ago with the likes of Quake, Doom, GTA 3... I don't understand how they could be so far off the mark. \n\nIt's like the developer has never ever played a PC game, EVER. Stupidly simple things like pressing space-bar to jump doesn't exist.

Hyperdimension Neptuinia Re;Birth1 is a remake of the original Hyperdimension Neptunia game, and IS the superior version by far. That being said, while there is a lot to enjoy in this game, it's very obvious corners were cut and game design was not the priority.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe game takes place in the fictional setting of Gamindustri, a land that parodies the current console wars, made up of Planeptune, Lastation, Leanbox, and Lowee. Each of these countries is led by a goddess who represents their country in combat. One of these goddesses is Neptune, our main character (and she won't let you forget that), who gets team attacked during one of these fights and is sent plummeting to the world below. When she wakes up, she has no memories of who she is or what she's done til now. So in order to regain her memories, Neptune sets off on a quest with her new friends Compa and IF.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThere's not a lot to say here. Battles are done in a turn-based style, albeit a bit more interactive than just choosing an attack from a menu. Exploration feels a bit bare bones at best. You can walk, jump, slap enemies with your weapon to initiate combat with an advantage, and pick up items along the way. There is no hub area in this game, instead it uses the tried and true world map we've all come to know.\n\nNow let's address the elephant in the room. Enemy variety is garbage. You'll be fighting the same enemies from level 1 to endgame, with maybe a palette swap here or there. The same can be said for the dungeons themselves. On more than one occasion you'll unlock a \"new\" dungeon to explore, only to find the map layout is exactly the same as an earlier dungeon just with different enemies in it. This may not have been as much of an issue if the game wasn't so grindy. You'll spend hours grinding on the same maps with the same enemies just to get your level to a point where you can beat that boss that just out of nowhere wiped the floor with you.\n\nSo far this review has been somewhat negative, but I do have some positives to say about it as well. The characters aren't the most complex or anything like that...but each of them can fit the title of \"Best Girl\" quite easily. The story is nothing we haven't seen before, but cute anime girls get to do cute anime things. And while the game itself reuses assets and requires a lot of grinding, I still had a good time hanging out with the characters.\n\nRATING:\n\nOverall, I'd give this game 3 stars out of 5. It's no masterpiece, but it's not trying to be one either. If you're a fan of RPG's I think you'll find some enjoyment to be had here. I don't think I'd recommend this at full price however, wait for a sale.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1596385753, "timestamp_updated": 1596385753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73633143": {"recommendationid": "73633143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067019938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 1744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1056, "last_played": 1596900532}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so grindy it hurts.", "timestamp_created": 1596332434, "timestamp_updated": 1596332434, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480164438486099243", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73480854": {"recommendationid": "73480854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277756341", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1448, "last_played": 1695090498}, "language": "english", "review": "The grind in this game hurts", "timestamp_created": 1596052608, "timestamp_updated": 1596052608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73438253": {"recommendationid": "73438253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371814173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5457, "last_played": 1639089413}, "language": "english", "review": "Reasons to get this game; Cute Waifus, Good Visuals, Great Music, Funny Dialogue\nReasons not to get this game; Can be Really Grindy, Forgetting to save can cost you hours.\nAll in all as long as you remember to save and you don't mind a bit of grinding i totally recommend this game, I loved playing this game and will definitely play it more as there is so much to do with the DLC included.", "timestamp_created": 1595977910, "timestamp_updated": 1595977910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73432263": {"recommendationid": "73432263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198446511843", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1518, "last_played": 1609355934}, "language": "english", "review": "dad she is 2000 years old please don't call the cops", "timestamp_created": 1595967440, "timestamp_updated": 1598473708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73408208": {"recommendationid": "73408208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273356301", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2103, "last_played": 1610323924}, "language": "english", "review": "Really love the characters.

I found myself in at lv 80 going into act 5. This game to me was in the same way that mining in Minecraft is for me the joy of finding diamonds after minging for a while. In this game, the diamonds (The joy) getting a stat upgrade. All the mining is filling up xdive (Used to do massive attacks.).\n\nOther than the really good side potion of the game is the main plot is both interestingly written as well funny. The best way the writer does this is through the consistent use of the 4'th wall.  I played the game with English dub's. A problem with this is that some parts are not dubbed. This makes the feel of those sections feel sluggish at times but I highly recommend still reading it through as if some of the jokes fall flat the character pick up for the slack. The interactions that the character has between each other in the story is well done. Each character having parts for them to be showcased and each character having their \"small\" quirk about them.\n\nThe only problem I had with the game is its terrible mapping for the keyboard, the vague way it explains mechanics as well as no indication on where to find mats in-game (this is where having the wiki open is useful and recommended.)\n\nOverall this game is really good I would recommend anybody interested at least to have a try and if it's on sale go for it I would say it's worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1595830683, "timestamp_updated": 1626901758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73294203": {"recommendationid": "73294203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255796191", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1599007543}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1595740929, "timestamp_updated": 1595740929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73246225": {"recommendationid": "73246225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123164628", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2212, "last_played": 1548394132}, "language": "english", "review": " heh Waifu go BRRRRR\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1595658774, "timestamp_updated": 1595658774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769246816635132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73174402": {"recommendationid": "73174402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198931662862", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1595531376}, "language": "english", "review": "Nepu Nepu?", "timestamp_created": 1595530999, "timestamp_updated": 1595530999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73157189": {"recommendationid": "73157189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022119408", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 3133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3133, "last_played": 1435343618}, "language": "english", "review": "They tried their best and put their heart into at least with one of these games, but even so that only let them create a mediocre game.\nThen they took the mechanics from that game and ended up repeating/reusing/regurgitating them a bazillion times in most of their games.

While this game is still a solid entry in the neptunia franchise, alot of things get retconned in the story or just outright didn't happen in later installments so if you are new to the series i'd suggest starting with Re;Birth2 or 3 and learning about the characters as you play.

[/b]\n\nSeriously though, I had lots of fun in this game. \nThe story is there, albeit quite lighthearted. The gist of it is that there's a console war going on, but each of them is an anime girl called CPU. These CPUs each rule over a zone in the map and have their own Shares, power from people who believe in them. Many characters are available, therefore many possible party compositions. The game itself at least on the first playthrough is not too grindy, only gets grindy towards the final boss. What do you REALLY have to grind for are the achievements, if you want them. The player has one map with different locations, there's also crafting recipes for new locations, even new characters (in new game+) items and battle modifiers (make a zone more difficult or easier, change a zone's dropped items). I liked the game's difficulty, it wasn't too easy but not too difficult either (and as I said before you can change these aspects for some of the zones with crafting recipes). \nNow I do have the Colosseum + Characters DLC because I got them from a bundle, but they are not mandatory for your gaming experience. The Colosseum is a place for grind/ balancing out Shares (each CPU has Shares as you will find out later, don't wanna spoil too much) and the characters just make the game easier to play through (there are 3 characters, they don't really get explained/ introduced in the story in this game, they get introduced in Re;Birth 2 and Re;Birth 3 as base game characters, not DLC). As for the other DLCs I don't think they're necessary, many of them are cosmetics/ consumable items, some of them are characters/quests/zones but it's your call. \nThe turn-based combat got repetitive pretty fast, but I didn't mind as I kept switching parties around on my first playthrough (it's cool that characters get experience even if they're not in your party). \n\nI enjoyed the art and the music, you can revisit those anytime you want in the Museum part of the game. Also, there's many pop culture references in this game which I didn't expect but were a welcomed surprise. I played the game voiced over in english, there's a japanese version too but I liked the english voices for the most part. \n\nI'll give this game a thumbs up, although it was a bit of a thorn in my side for the achievements (mainly because of the repetitive nature of the combat). The game has 2 endings, one normal ending and one \"true\" ending that needs a bit of work in the balancing Shares area.", "timestamp_created": 1593459712, "timestamp_updated": 1593460077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727090418338775635", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71607295": {"recommendationid": "71607295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107910577", "num_games_owned": 639, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 4495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4495, "last_played": 1577985585}, "language": "english", "review": "My mother kicked me out", "timestamp_created": 1593382367, "timestamp_updated": 1593382367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 107, "votes_funny": 125, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85464322566986084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71606585": {"recommendationid": "71606585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115487673", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1234, "last_played": 1595554110}, "language": "english", "review": "(+)good game for relaxing, the story is funny, the turn-based combat is entertaining, and the character is loveable!\n(-)grinding, repetitive dungeons.\n\na good game to start into [strike]nep-nep universe[/strike] neptunia franchise\n\njust don't bought this if you want a challenging RPG, buy sekiro instead", "timestamp_created": 1593381628, "timestamp_updated": 1593381628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71589960": {"recommendationid": "71589960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059398282", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2360, "last_played": 1595252196}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, it is taking place in Gameindustri about gaming things, it mocks itself.

With that aside, I knew what I was getting into, as anyone interested in this game by now.\n\nI remember vaguely playing the beginning when the original came out on PS3 and this remake's combat is less clunky and more intuitive (through research the battle system is revised to resemble the original 3rd entry which has a better flow). The combo system reminded me of a Tales game and had me feeling like this is what they would be like if they were turn based, so the combat felt interesting enough to want to see what it will feel like further into the game. (I'm mid Ch 2) Seems like it's made to get stale/grindy at parts and that there will be challenging battles in the future. \nSummed up: 3D arena, turn-based combat where attacks have ranges and go into combos. Has a magic and transformation system. \n\nI haven't gotten to do it yet but there is also some costume customization. Another fun thing I can relate to the Tales franchise which will make it an entertaining experience for those who like that feature (though it's more common in JRPGs these days I gather). \n\nEverything else overall seems pretty much standard JRPG fare for this day and age, considering it probably resembles systems (or combination of) from games I haven't gotten to over the years.", "timestamp_created": 1592632673, "timestamp_updated": 1592632673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71050823": {"recommendationid": "71050823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099458236", "num_games_owned": 1587, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 1008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1008, "last_played": 1592607789}, "language": "english", "review": "6.7/10\n\n+Combat is really fun with it's ARPG-like mechanics, although it's still turn-based.

Which is a shame since this also made the combat loose it's fun after a while.\n-The story is not great at all, and the only thing that kept me interested in the game was it's humor.

The customization is low early game because your money is better spent on healing items and accessories. And some of the dungeons reuse assets and reskin monsters and that isn't really a big deal with how many dungeons there are in the game, it's just something to point out. The combat is nice but I don't really see any benefit to using rush attacks whatsoever, power and break are better in every situation. There's a necessary grind within the first 10 hours of the game which is a bit fast. The game features a lot of references and is very self aware which is a good thing. There was a lot of plot exposition and Neptune chimes in like \"our players don't want to read walls of text anymore,\" which was a funny moment. \n\nIt breaks up the monotony with fourth wall breaks and references and doesn't take itself to seriously which is very welcome in this super serious genre.

I can't say this is for everyone but if you like JRPGs with cute anime girls then I highly recommend this one.", "timestamp_created": 1588637565, "timestamp_updated": 1588637565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68515129": {"recommendationid": "68515129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287373728", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 1923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1380, "last_played": 1681402647}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juego ql weno xd el gameplay es repetitivo pero eso da igual porque el punto fuerte del juego son sus personajes muy carismaticas y como ellas van dando forma a la historia con sus dialogos, con diagolos y situaciones absurdas con varias referencias a otros juegos y con varias bromas entremedio que te haran reir varias veces en todo el juego, tambien tiene un buen poco de fanservice  para los faperos que se toquetean con monas chinas :v", "timestamp_created": 1588538230, "timestamp_updated": 1612911187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68507021": {"recommendationid": "68507021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198810308125", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2500, "last_played": 1588913101}, "language": "english", "review": "the only things i dislike about the game are that you have to grind a lot and also it can be hard to find items that are used to craft other things unless you have a guide, but other than that i enjoyed the mechanics, characters and story, also you should have a controller if you plan on playing this game. its not a huge problem to play without a controller but it makes the experience better over all.", "timestamp_created": 1588527991, "timestamp_updated": 1588527991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68487338": {"recommendationid": "68487338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198854113912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 638, "last_played": 1592485301}, "language": "english", "review": "haha me go grindy grindy for nep", "timestamp_created": 1588503742, "timestamp_updated": 1588503742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68475347": {"recommendationid": "68475347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275710947", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2862, "last_played": 1588566810}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fun.

You know exactly what to expect: a technically functional Japanese-style roleplaying game that exists mostly to serve as a vehicle for otaku-pandering fanservice and comedy. The Hyperdimension Neptunia games are their flagship series, and therefore theoretically represent the best Idea Factory can do.\n\nTheir best isn't terribly impressive.\n\nThe thing about media that panders to otaku is that it's extremely alienating to people who fall outside of that subculture (which is fine: not everything needs to be for everyone) but it's also appealing to otaku who dislike being pandered to. I belong squarely in that latter category, I think. The Hyperdimension Neptunia games appear to be about nothing more than cute anime girls being cute, wearing revealing outfits, and making snarky jokes that more often than not are simple references to (now ancient) memes. It's all very superficial\u2014there's no real depth here.

Incluso en las mazmorras m\u00e1s avanzadas en las que te matan de un golpe si no vas preparado/a.\nMe encanta el combate que es un poco din\u00e1mico pero sigue siendo por turnos, y los combos son gloria bendita visualmente hablando. Los efectos de los ataques pero su bien cuidada transici\u00f3n de golpes es muy [i] rewardering [/i] ( [i] recompensante [/i] por decirlo de alguna forma), aunque hagas poco da\u00f1o.\nLa curva de dificultad es muy asequible pero si le a\u00f1ades los DLCs se hace incre\u00edblemente abrupta en las \u00faltimas mazmorras.

Pero lo que s\u00ed que puedo decir es que si eres de esa parte de la poblaci\u00f3n de chinofarmers, vas a encontrar goce en este juego al respecto.\nOtra cosa por lo que muy probablemente hayas llegado a este juego es que no hay ning\u00fan personaje animado masculino. Todos los personajes jugables son femeninos y, evidentemente, est\u00e1n bastante sexualizados. Pero tampoco da mucho para contentar al de abajo. No s\u00e9.

If you want post game aka passed level 99 then it will take you around 80 to 200 hours to complete everything depending on your play style. Graphics are anime inspired so the game isn't aimed at trying to achive high graphical fidelity. Also just a warning if you haven't played any game from If or Compile Hearts. They have a tendency to reuse content over and over again so if you don't like that then well. If you see an enemy it will probably be in the other games across If/Comp Hearts catelog.

"review": "This game is good because of how bad it is. The voice acting, character designs, music, and most of the gameplay are good. However, this game isn't beginner friendly and is hard as hell. They're are way to many scenarios where you are forced to grind levels in order to not get destroyed by the enemies in the overworld. They can go from doing 0 damage to instantly killing your entire team. To put it simply, it's unbalanced and broken af. I don't even want to talk about the bosses in this game because they show no mercy in battle. The story is hot garbage and extremely long. I'm talking about 60 hours and I still have 2 more chapters to go to beat this game. Also, this game can't decide whether or not they want you to use a unit or not. Characters like Neptune and Vert are always crucial when things get tough but are either absent or get nerfed because the story said so. They're are only like 5 viable characters in this game and that's purely because everyone else's damage output is pathetic. My last complaint are the graphics and world design. What in the hell happened, this game has moments when it looks like low res ps2 graphics. The hit detection when getting near enemies makes me question my existence and the overworld is generic. Can someone please explain why I played the 3rd game in the series and I ran into the same enemies and the map was exactly the same? There are like 10 enemies in the whole game, all they do is change the color and hp of the enemies and nothing else. Despite all of this I did enjoy this game. The artwork is very appealing and the video game references are done really well. Sometimes when Neptune levels up she will do the final fantasy victory theme and she constantly breaks the 4th wall. As much I complain about this game, I did enjoy it. I got this game around Christmas for like 3.99 and I think that was a good price. If you want this game just wait for it to go on sale again. I might do a guide for this game but I need to finish the 2nd game and all I can say rn is that it's not looking to good but, I'll save that for another day. Thank You for reading this.

THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.\n\nWhy ? Because you need to really, and I mean REALLY love a certain number of things to make it work.\n\nFarming. If you don't like farming for money and EXP, you'll get depressed at the massive amount of farm required to get everything. EXP/Credit grinding for the main story is not the worst if you follow a guide and ar not afraid to spend an hour or two at some key points to overcome some difficulty spikes, but if you're looking to 100%, grinding WILL be required in massive amounts.\n\nItem farming. You need drops. A lot of them. Even more so if you want to unlock everything under the sun, as you can easily miss a plan for a dungeon, or unlock it too late... which means you won't get the modifiers for that dungeon (you can only get them for a limited time, usually before the end of the earliest chapter you can unlock it on, which is kind of a dumb limitation). \nMissing additional unlocks for a dungeon means missing ennemies, meaning missing drops... which sometimes means you'll miss unlocking other dungeons and items until you loop back through a new game +. Also if you miss something early in the chain, you might be missing 10+ non-story dungeons and all the drops from those, limiting your possibilities on that playthrough even more.\n\nRandom japanese humor, quips & \"cancer\" anime tropes. This game is so full of them it overflows from all sides. A bit of fanservice is also present, but I've seen a lot worse... \nIt also requires a bit (but not too much) of console wars culture to fully enjoy since references abound. From Sega VS Nintendo to mid-2010.\nIn sum, if you dislike weeb and/or vidya culture, you're not gonna have a good time.\n\nThe game is REPETITIVE. Not only in farming but also in the general contents. The world map is a simple 2D plane where you select the locations you go to among those you unlocked. The dungeons are remapping of the exact same architecture... You've seen one cave? You've seen all of them. The plan might be a bit different with some paths/rooms available or locked when you get from one forest to the next, or you might find the exact same map, but you spawn at a different point... but it's still the same basic forest.\nThe number of terrains is pretty limited, like between 5~10 types...\n\nMusic is pretty redundant during gameplay. You'll get the same three dungeons music getting overused during the game, and they reset each time you have an encounted (which makes you hear the same first few seconds in loop between two fights when you farm... pretty aggravating).\nI usually like video game music but this was aggravating enough to make me shut down music volume to favor my own music.\n\nSound design will be annoying for a lot of people. The characters will NOT stop talking whenever you jump in maps and at each of their turns/attacks/getting damaged.\nTHE NEPS NEVER END.\nI like that but a lot of people won't.\n\n\nDespite all that ! I like this game.\nI like meming, the jokes despite their repetitive deliveries, the chaotic-stupid aligned main characted, the 4th wall being constantly broken, the farm, the ambiance and even the sounds.\n\nNep/10 would play the rest of the games... as soon as I'm done with all the farming on this one.", "timestamp_created": 1579811279, "timestamp_updated": 1579811279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62263296": {"recommendationid": "62263296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373256481", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1579809038}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute anime girls in battle armor.

So this review will reflect that. This franchise had always been on my radar and after playing this game I can finally say... I don't get it.\n\nThis game took me 42 hours to reach the true ending. Honestly, it felt like 80. I can't lie, it was a slog to pull through this one. \nIf you can't tell already and the big red thumbs down didn't tip you off, I don't like this game. Like at all. I think the gameplay is strangely unintuitive, the story is a hot mess, and the characters are less characters and more a loose collection of quirks and poor motivations. The combat system is pretty sick, but the game has quite a lot of grind so I got sick of that pretty fast, since you will probably be spending most of your in game time in a combat sequence. One thing that was unexpectedly something I disliked was the voice work, and I mean subs and dubs (Though the writing and written dialogue was fine). The music was good, but it's been a bit since I beat it and no tracks in particular stick out to me.\nBy far, however, my least favorite part of the game was the characters, or rather, how many of the characters were written, and the fact that I don't know who at least HALF OF MY PARTY EVEN IS! Like, they just show up during some battle and they stick around? But WHY!? The actual main characters were fine though. (If a bit bland.)\nThis sounds really bad when I say it, but of the 42 hours I played of this game, I'd say only about 8 or 9 were enjoyable for me.

Dialogues are great and fun, and the fourth wall does not exist at all.\n\nGameplay is simple yet enjoyable. Short dungeons with a party of 3 members in front and 3 in back - swap at any moment. There's a shit-ton of cool skills to use as well as EXE skills (even more powerful skills) with great animations.\n\nThe remake system is a way to change some aspects of the game (new items, more dungeons, more enemies, \u2026). Level cap is 99 unless you purchase DLCs.\n\nIn short : There's moe. There's the right amount of fanservice. There's pudding. There's good gameplay. There are great and witty dialogues.\nAnd most important : there's Nep !\n\nIf you feel intrigued by the game, just buy it.\nIt's cheap and definitely worth it for any JRPGs fan.",

"language": "english", "review": "I'll go into a proper review later, but to start off I'm going to throw a weird little personal fact into this that is probably the best endorsement I can give.\n\nI'm an old fat guy who bought this game to play while on walking on a treadmill, and probably 98% of my playtime is while doing so. Which means 148 hours, and approximately 425 miles later, this game is probably directly responsible for at least 25 pounds of real, permanent weight loss.\n\nSo yeah, this game is fun. \n\nBut it is also weird, and I mean really weird. Nep. It plays like a PlayStation/PS2 era JRPG, but with all of the non-dungeon walking and talking (so, overworld map and towns) removed, and with all of the storyline dialogue done in visual novel style (with 100% voice acting in Japanese, or ~30% voice acted - and regularly at a cringeworthy level - if set to English). And the premise is so over the top, fourth-wall shattering, trope mocking while still following, and unapologetically weeby that even me, Mr. \"100% every Gal*Gun game on Steam\", almost permanently put the controller down a couple of times on my first playthrough. \n\nBut the key word there is unapologetic. This game knows what it is and doesn't care. It's cheezy, goofy, illogical, and sickeningly hyper-cute, Nep, and yet somehow out of all of that comes a bizarre gem that is still rooted in the solid foundation of a well-made old school RPG, that only works because they committed so hard and consistently to the insanity. Nep-Nep. Though as a game it is highly repetitive and grindy, both on a small scale (dungeons essentially repeat with identical map segments used for multiple locations, monsters get reused so often they don't even bother palette swapping them a lot of the time) and on the grand scale (I think I did five complete playthroughs, the original and then four consecutive new game+, to find everything and defeat all of the top tier bonus dungeons).

If you can accept that then you'll cherish having this title in your game collection.\n\nThis game just oozes with personality, cuteness, and an insane amount of things to do. You can also choose between english voices or subtitled Japanese. Either way, the limited battle talk will grind your nerves to near suicide.\n\nThere's the basic storyline path with the full catalog of twists and turns that are obvious to everyone except the playable characters. Still fun to watch and participate in though as it does provide a well-rounded adventure.\n\nWhere it truly shines though is in the crafting of Plans. You have a limited amount of memory to create plans in, but I've yet to reach that cap. Plans do everything from introducing new items, weapons, clothing, and armor to the game as well as creating new dungeons to explore and ways to change the dungeons, such as changing what items drop, add or remove boss creatures (by turning the plan on or off), and even global game-wide plans that change difficulty from casual to normal to hardcore.\n\nGathering the components to make the plans though require a lot of dungeon exploring as you can only find certain items in certain dungeons, item rarity, and using previously crafted plans to change item drops and monster types in order to find the components you need, thus the grinding warning. If you're OCD and want to \"get them all\" this game will consume your life.\n\nPlayable characters are introduced regularly, but tend to drop in and out of your group due to the storyline, unless you buy DLC characters who are usable no matter what the storyline dictates. They're all cute, loveable in their own way, and come with unique abilites to flesh out and tailor your group to your own playstyle.\n\nHowever, unless you do buy some of the overpowered DLC characters you won't be able to progress at the speed you may want, or you will hit a brick wall of difficulty and end up being one-shotted by everything. You WILL have to grind levels, requiring you to advance your team just as much as advance the storyline through sessions of grinding for levels. But if you're working on plans it makes the grind much more endurable.\n\nEven with the caveats though I do highly recommend this game if you're into turn-based, story-rich, highly customizable game play. If you fit that description then this game, and its characters, will become a favorite of yours.", "timestamp_created": 1571128887, "timestamp_updated": 1571129762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561170220375061035", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55609872": {"recommendationid": "55609872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120046840", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1541, "last_played": 1578847132}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes me feel like having friends that I never had", "timestamp_created": 1571106279, "timestamp_updated": 1571106279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55602961": {"recommendationid": "55602961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148653502", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1596, "last_played": 1571066985}, "language": "english", "review": "SoTp tHe NeP NpE Nep NEp\n\nIs Nepu Nepu  FFS (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b", "timestamp_created": 1571068426, "timestamp_updated": 1571068426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55588198": {"recommendationid": "55588198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194550639", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2175, "last_played": 1588306479}, "language": "english", "review": "While yes the grinding in this game is tedious as all hell\nThe other aspects of this game are just amazing\n\nSome things I'd like to address though:\n1.

I was willing to turn my brain down and enjoy what looked like a mediocre role-playing game centered around cute-to-scantily-clad girls on an adventure to save the world.\n\nProblem was, I couldn't turn my brain down far enough.\n\nThis game has some of the most inane writing I've ever read. The dialogue, jokes, plot, and characters were so dull and clich\u00e9d I felt nothing but relief when the story sections were over and the game play resumed. As boring as the combat and exploration was, the story just made me mentally numb. Skipping parts helped, but then I was missing out of half of what makes the experience for a game like this; the story. \n\nThe voice acting, where it exists, was either merely okay or really bad. The actresses sounded like they came from reddit or fiver, and then not from the best those places have to offer. I recognized a couple of them from various anime I'd seen over the years, but this was nothing impressive. On the bright side the voices are missing in most cases, and reading the bad writing manages to be a little less worse than hearing the bad writing badly acted. Actually, I'm pretty sure the biggest fault with the voice acting were the lines these women were paid to read.\n\nThe music is better in this version than in the original version of the game. The sound effects were also pretty good, but neither were anything memorable.\n\nSimilarly, the visual upgrade is very noticeable, and vastly better. The game itself looks bright and colorful, which is a refreshing change from most game's more gray, brown, and green pallets. The models and artwork were serviceable, and I've seen a lot worse, but it's pretty obvious this was a budget level affair across the board. The artists in this aspect were head and shoulders above the writers and composers.\n\nGame play itself is pretty mediocre and [i]extremely grindy. [/i]I liked some of the aspects of the combat system, taking different positions on the field before selecting an action like attack or using items mixed things up a little from the norm. Further, different weapons resulted in different attack areas. An example right off is Neptune's sword; it may have a square or rectangular area of attack depending on the type of sword. It's an approach not often seen in games like this, along with an unusual take on the turn-based combat system that doesn't necessarily mean taking your turn and then politely waiting for the enemy to do the same. It isn't an active combat system, but it does a pretty neat impression of one.\n\nOther game play mechanics felt needlessly convoluted, such as the Shares System and Lily Ranks. Plenty of guides out there, but it all feels lumped on, contrived, and ultimately unnecessary. These and a few other aspects of both how the world unfolds, and even the combat itself tend to detract more than add to the experience.\n\nThe crafting system is awful. You have to get Plans from dungeons and enemies to unlock more dungeons and enemies, and items, and events, etc. These can even be missed unless specific conditions are met prior to advancing the story beyond certain points, forcing more than one play to experience certain enemies or areas of this game. It wouldn't be so bad in other genres, or if this game had even been enjoyable enough to warrant multiple replays, but it is a grinding, repetitive, tedious experience. This is exacerbated by the need to grind for items and levels, and revisiting the same very shallow dungeons over and over again.\n\nI am also not a fan of forced losing battles. Some bosses are meant to kill you. It can be thankfully quick, but it happened a lot, and is just an old lazy gimmick that needs to die from the genre.\n\nThis game was played with all settings maxed out using an Intel i7-8700k, 32gb DRAM, Samsung Evo SSD, 1080ti, running at 3440x1440. The aspect ratio is totally locked, making enlarging the game's resolution impossible. I tried running a mod to at least get it to match my monitor's vertical resolution, but wound up with a window that had the top and bottom of the screen cut off. It's weird and lazy, and not at all surprising given this game's overall lazy presentation.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]The 'Skip' button\n    [*]Bright and colorful\n    [*]Different take on turn based battles\n    [*]Controller friendly\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Awful story\n    [*]Annoying characters\n    [*]Shallow presentation\n    [*]Boring combat\n    [*]Bland dialogue\n    [*]Insufferable \u201cjokes\u201d\n    [*]Heavy grinding required\n    [*]Missable crafting unlocks force replay\n[/list]\n\n[b]Verdict: 03/10[/b]\n\nI wanted a JRPG fix, and what I wound up with was a lot of the worst the genre has to offer.", "timestamp_created": 1570644433, "timestamp_updated": 1570644460, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473456770181655884", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55525665": {"recommendationid": "55525665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968620530", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 540, "last_played": 1577970773}, "language": "english", "review": "my first game from the Neptunia series... well i like it.

Side quests are fetch as all heck, and the lifeless game design contrasts so sharply with the vibrant and quirky, sometimes charmingly annoying characters that I feel like these characters are trapped inside of a game that is not up to the standards that they themselves set. \n\nI beat this one, and I started the second, but I doubt I'll continue it even in the further off future, which is a shame, because the characters are great all throughout the series, and there are some real catchy tunes sprinkled throughout the OSTs too. \n\nWith such bad gameplay, it's hard to recommend a playthrough, honestly not worth the trouble. watch a cutscene movie or the anime instead if you're really interested... OR! Play Fairy Fencer F instead - same studio, great music, same quality -if not better- characters, and while the gameplay overall is only marginally improved, the combat is LEAGUES better.

I'm not fond of turn-based RPGs but this one was quite easy to get into, as well as having pretty fun dialogues. If you're into anime or memes in general you might enjoy this game.\n[b]Prologue[/b]\nThe game is set in Gamindustry and a console war has begun, featuring Nintendo's console goddess counterpart White Heart, Microsoft's counterpart, Green Heart, Sony's counterpart Black Heart and as last, the protagonist; Sega's console counterpart, Purple Heart. During the last battle they had the first three godesses decided to team up and to defeat Purple Heart, which loses her memory, Neptune, as is, will meet alongside Compa and IF and will begin a journey to discover who she is and what's going on.\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Funny dialogues (lots of 4th wall breaks there)\n[*]Loveable characters\n[*]Has many references to videogames (not as many as the original game for PS3) and anime in general\n[*]On the long way you'll end up having lots of cute party members\n[*]Compa\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Out of the 3 It's the most difficult one to finish as there are many roadblocks boss-wise\n[*]Without DLC characters it feels like an endless grindfest\n[*]The Dungeons are basically the same most of the time\n[*]Compa is an useless party member unfortunately\n[/list]\n\n[b]DLC Characters [/b]\nDLC characters, unless you don't want to spend endless hours in grinding, are highly suggested. The oracles are good for early game since they'll destroy basically anything but on the long run they will suffer as their equipment isn't as good as other party members in mid-late game, where basically everyone catches up. Iris Heart and Yellow Heart are good and in a way balanced, will still make the game challenging while making it much lighter to play compared to IF and Compa, especially in the first roadblock of the game. Baby IF and Baby Compa are IF and Compa's baby variants but much stronger, featuring different skills. Uzume is on between Yellow heart and Iris Heart and Baby IF and Compa's. For Histoire...

You'll probably either love it or hate it, and I'm certainly a fan.\n\nFirst off, the Neptunia Re;birth series is a trilogy of remakes of games that first appeared on the PS3 quite a while back. To be specific:\nHyperdimension Neptunia -> Re;birth 1\nHyperdimension Neptunia Mk2 -> Re;birth 2\nHyperdimension Neptunia Victory -> Re;birth 3\nBecause the remakes use most of the same gameplay elements between the three titles, much of what I have to say about this game applies across the whole Re;birth trilogy. Things like the battle system are almost completely identical, and from what I understand, closely resemble the engine used in the original Victory. Many assets are reused between the three games, so don't expect to see a lot of new content past the first game you play. The series has a habit of recycling assets overall. If this bothers you, you may want to consider playing only one entry in the series. If you're in it for the story though, each story is discrete.\n\nThe battle system is a curious fusion of game systems I've encountered before. It has a movement and positioning system akin to certain N64 RPGs (every turn you can move freely within a circular area around where you started the turn in), an initiative and timing system straight out of Final Fantasy X, and normal attacks become controllable strings of combos that may vaguely remind you of Xenogears. Balance isn't exactly the game's best suit, but at least the battles are fairly engaging as long as you don't wind up hitting too high above your weight.\n\nThere are several customization options in the game -- most characters have alternate outfits which can be equipped (most of them being retextures, though) and a wide variety of head accessories, functional equipment can be designed to make new items available in the shops, the combo system used for standard attacks can be thouroughly customized per character, and there's a system that allows you to create passive ability-granting items that your characters can equip. Among other systems.\n\nThe main reason you might want to get into the series might be because of the characters and/or the comedy. It's not a game to be taken seriously, and wholeheartedly embraces anime and game tropes. To that end, it doesn't disappoint.\n\nOverall, I reccomend buying one of the games on sale to see if you like it. You can start with either this game or MK2 -- note that this game is not canonical to the rest of the series. If you like what you have, and want to see more of the same but with different stories, get into the rest of the series.  Some new content is added with each new entry though a lot of it is simply recycled from older games. Each game in the series does make some minor improvements over the last one, though.", "timestamp_created": 1562119935, "timestamp_updated": 1562119935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53267916": {"recommendationid": "53267916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303299776", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2302, "last_played": 1562039196}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, easy to learn and the story is pretty fun to follow.", "timestamp_created": 1562115162, "timestamp_updated": 1562115162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53259972": {"recommendationid": "53259972", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991988029", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 863, "last_played": 1559873118}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, Love the story and cam't wait to get to the rest of the series", "timestamp_created": 1562111120, "timestamp_updated": 1562111120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53253707": {"recommendationid": "53253707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047683733", "num_games_owned": 993, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3086, "last_played": 1671143320}, "language": "english", "review": "nep nep npe nep nep", "timestamp_created": 1562108117, "timestamp_updated": 1562108117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53253636": {"recommendationid": "53253636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046620960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1590190889}, "language": "english", "review": "As an avid anime fan and cute things, this game delivers.

It's so situational. Rebirth 1 is great if you already like Neptunia, the humor is on point, but the story isn't... that good, and overall, the gameplay is the same as EVERY OTHER Mainline Rebirth title.\n\nThat said, you're probably here for some semblance of story. However this game isn't entirely canon. For some reason Rebirth 2 is a reboot of the series, which actually tells a nice little story. That canon goes onward through Rebirth 3 and Victory 2. This story... does not have any stakes on anything else in the series, and can be entirely skipped.\n\nIt's easily the most boring out of all three rebirth games, because despite the humor being there, it also falls flat at points, the villain is undermined to the point of irrelevancy and overall it just feels like only a Neptunia Fan will truly appreciate it. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm crazy. Either way, that's a review.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good, I give 7/10.\nOptimization is also pretty nice, especially compared to the sequel, I give 8/10\nThe story is pretty lame. 4/10.

start with the Neptunia series.\nThe battle system is fine. Fairly standard turn-based fights.\nNot too hard or complex, but some of the higher level (optional) fights still require some strategy.\nThe dungeons are pretty linear, and get reused often. Monsters are palette swaps in the later dungeons. This showcases the lower budget of this series, especially the earlier entries.\n\nThe real draw lies in the characters, and their interactions.\nStory and dialogue segments are done in a visual novel style. The art and character design here is top notch. Characters look and act vibrant, and I love them. The voice actors are excellent, some of them being pretty high profile in Japan.\nThere are quite a few characters to choose for your party, each with their own, unique, skills. Balance wise, the Goddesses kind of overpower the rest, which is probably the biggest flaw in the gameplay department.\nEvery character _can_ be used in battle. However, for the DLC dungeons, you're basically bound to the goddesses.\n\nIf you like cute characters, turn based battles and silly humor, you might like this. Be aware that some amount of grinding is needed, though.\nWould recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1561812131, "timestamp_updated": 1574805810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Well, while that has nothing to do with Neptunia, it is relevant to me.\n\nThe general moral is that people don't know what they truly want until they try it and fall in love.  RPGs were never my forte, outside of Paper Mario: TTYD and the occasional Pokemon, so to dip into this semi-obscure, complete nonsense was certainly a shock to the system.\n\nThis game is not for everyone. Chapter 2 in particular is a very high difficulty spike that without copious grinding or certain very powerful DLC characters, would drive some people to go for a refund. I wouldn't blame anyone for that.\n\nI continued out of a love for the writing. It has that charming character based humour that you don't see anymore. The comparison to TTYD isn't just for the overworld encounters (Though Crono Trigger and Earthbound did both first, but details. Going from [i]personal[/i] experience here.\n\nI'm glad I did. The game honestly gets far better after Chapter 2. You start to get into the real meat of the mechanics, you meet more party members and the difficulty curve surprisingly mellows out.\n\nThis isn't even getting into the Remake system, which allows you to change dungeons, create items to buy and even modify game mechanics to do things such as increase EXP or Credits after battle, enemy strength and killing enemies on the overworld with a simple attack rather than fighting them. It offers a lot of depth for a game that does sorely needs it.\n\nSpeaking of lacking depth, do shell out for the various DLC packs. I certainly wouldn't recommend [i]all[/i] of them, as some of them should have been features from the start and were in later games (Looking at you, AV Club.) or are just not worth the moolah ([b]Good lord the Oracles.[/b]) but certainly the first 3 Additional Content Packs (Which raise the level cap to 999, along with adding some lovely end-game dungeons and gear to make your party nigh-on invincible. Additionally, I can personally recommend Plutia, Peashy and Uzume as solid and semi-balanced additions to any party.\n\nIf you're not into that (Not everyone is, even during a sale.), then there's some nice free DLC. Some item packs to help you out and Neptune's second best weapon along with a fantastic grinding spot. The other DLC as I said, probably not worth it. Giant and Mini Island seem ehhh and Lily Rank does [b]not[/b] matter nearly enough in this game to warrant the purchase. Survival mode seems like a fun gimmick the Shares quests again don't really matter [b]too[/b] much, but if you quickly want to get maxinum Shares in a single nation, I guess at that point it's your time or your money.\n\nMan, I went way too long about nitpick-ey stuff. I guess at this point things such as the reused assets never really bothered me personally.\n\nI guess I say [b]yes, buy this game if you want to enter the wild ride that is Neptunia.[/b] It's silly, self-aware fun with a decently unique combat system and a very lovable cast.

Even though I just complain about a few things in the review I had a pretty good time with the game all in all despite it having a number of very apparent flaws. Issues that will seemingly continue in the Re;Birth series from what I can tell, unfortunately.  I did two playthroughs, 100% achievements. Played in Japanese; no opinion on the English writing. \nMost notably there's the very lazy level design with reuse of not just assets used but the entire stage design of some areas. Reused assets are something I can stomach and recolored enemies in particular are no stranger to someone who's played many RPGs, but reusing entire areas with little to no rearrangement of the assets, and numerous times over again at that, is pretty bad. They couldn't even do so much as mirror some reused levels so that I could at least walk left rather than right. Something needed to be done to keep things at least a little fresh across such stages. \nWhile I like the idea behind the battle system with being able to move and choosing the positioning from where you attack the enemy, a lot of battles will be pretty static with enemies simply walking straight to their target if out of attack range or otherwise simply turning toward them. You'll wrap to the enemies side/back for bonus damage, they'll turn in your direction to attack, and repeat until dead. It's still more fun than had they went with a simple pick your target system, but it could maybe have been more interesting still if the AI had more moves up their sleeve. \nAlthough I realize the goddesses are a focal point of the series it would have been nice to see some more thought for characters like IF, and I guess Compa too, who are main characters but have absolutely no additional armors/costumes, a lack of unique moves, and to me seemed to become less and less viable the further you get into the game. Obviously characters can't be perfectly balanced but I would hope for them to still be at a useable level. It was disappointing to see even the late-game side-characters get more attention than IF. And Compa too, I guess.  \nFinal complaint is fairly minor. The turn-based system's display of the turn order is misleading because the different weight of the actions both you and the enemies can take will throw things out of whack, changing the turn order after actions taken. If you're not aware of which actions take more or less \"time\" the display loses a lot of it's value and can throw off your plans. Having some sort of indication that actions would affect the turn order could be have been nice. It is something you can adapt to with relative ease though.", "timestamp_created": 1561005668, "timestamp_updated": 1605406669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

have some trouble from the starting game and upwards since i didn't know where most of the items were to make plans, they could at least have shown the enemies who drops certain items, gather points items and hidden treasure of what items is in each dungeon before you enter so you could easily navigate to find the items for certain plans instead of searching up on the internet or here for the Guides on steam.\n\nEach character has different personalities and each land has different cpus in the game and the development for them in game was good for each cpu with together.\n\nIf you are into

The entire story is told by combining semi-animated 2D character art, occasional voice-overs, and text boxes. The main cast of characters are written in a lite-hearted, charming, and endearing manner with each having a few distinct personality traits. Due to this, the character interactions and story beats are frequently entertaining and a bit funny at times. Despite this, there really isn\u2019t anything profoundly interesting about the story or characters, rather the focus is on portraying situations which are amusing and playful. This is greatly enhanced in the sections where voice-overs are included since the nuances in the voice performances help to get the humor across better.  The nonsensical storytelling and playful characters do a solid job of being pleasant for the entire visual novel section of the game, which composes roughly about ten hours of the total gameplay time.\n\nThe remaining fifteen hours of gameplay are made up of the turn-based RPG system. The complexity that this system offer is rather minimal during actual combat. Yet, there is still enough choice for it to be stimulating and require you to plan one or two moves ahead. In addition to this, there is a good amount of strategy that comes before you enter combat from having to selecting equipment, party layout, and special abilities.\n\nOne aspect of the game that stood out to me is the art. The small animation of each character in the visual novel portions really helps bring them to life. Plus, all of the character designs are delightful. The enemy design is also quite creative with floating 2D visual novel monsters, Tetris pieces, and a handful of other wacky game references.\n\nSadly, there are a fair bit of reused enemy assets in the main campaign, which definitely can seem lazy at times. I\u2019m not entirely sure why the developers chose to do this, as there are plenty of side bosses that are completely unique. Additionally, there are two sections that definitely felt like they required a bit of grinding or completing unnecessary side quest in order to advance, which can be annoying for players who just want to progress through the main story.\n\nOverall, I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed almost all twenty-five hours of Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1.

Really, a lot of the game devolves in just such a fashion as becoming a busy-list of repetitive tasks, like a 300+-hour word find, if such a thing existed. \n\nThe best way to enjoy the DLC for this game is to start with all of it that unlocks at certain points in the playthrough.  Otherwise, you have to play through the game again, for example, on New Game Plus.  One of the new DLC from April 2019, \"Shares Quests,\" allows you to avoid more playthroughs.  If you are a completionist, heaven help you:  Elegant Crown, an Accessory that can be used for Neptune's Plans for crafting other crowns, can only be obtained once per playthrough.\n\nIf you can tolerate not getting everything, the game is likely a lot more fun.  I stuck it out to learn the deeper gameplay of the upper reaches of the Colosseum.  Unfortunately, the power gear in the game, such as the six-piece Processor Units are a mixed experience when deciding between them.  Put on the Back of one set, seeing that it raises Defense, does not reflect consistently across the set, so that you might put on the Legs of the same set and have your Defense lowered back down.  Ultimately, I just picked sets for cosmetic aesthetic because of the complexity of the interaction between the pieces that mostly left characters somewhat similar stat-wise after switching gear.  The upside is that you get more out of Processor sets since you can generally change them per your whim rather than having to equip them out of necessity.\n\nThere are designer choices at which you will shake your head.  Chief among these is a Nepedia that arbitrarily only shows where monsters that you are hunting are found if you have the bits to make the monsters exist toggled On in your Plans.  While I humored this design at first, eventually it became too much of a time sink, and I found myself jumping to [b]Completed \"Dungeon Loot / Monster Drop\" list (Map included!) guide[/b] by Enfyny and trigger_segfault in the Community Guides here on Steam in order to do a Ctrl+F search rather than waste time toggling dozens of dungeons in a game that is about spending lots and lots of time trying to accomplish things.  There are more minor mysteries that I really can't say why they are the way they are, such as the head-scratching inclusion of partial Processor Sets like the Megapolis hat for Plutia that has no additional outfit pieces to complement it.\n\nThe battles are the solid meat for which you will want to play this game.  It's unfortunate that there are not many ways to boost your level by battling mid-game.  Perhaps the new DLC such as Giant Island and Mini Island help to cover this aspect before one is strong enough to take on the tougher DLC dungeons like Ario Plateau and Rebeat Resort.  The Giant and Mini Island dungeons, however, include only monsters without loot, so there really isn't much to keep one playing these dungeons specifically.\n\nThis is one of the reasons that I consider this game Minimum Viable Product:  the player is often left wanting more for one's time.  When it takes longer to listen to 27 level-up messages than it does to beat a Colosseum battle against Polytans when grinding, it feels like the designers didn\u2019t really determine what the long-term fun factor for this grinding should feel like.  Regarding these messages, you can spam through them quickly by tapping, and still, 27 taps is an awful lot to do when you\u2019re really wanting to build levels and not sit around waiting to hear how great it is that each character individually leveled up.\n\nWhile it's awesome to see the developers still releasing new DLC for this game that came out over four years ago, there are some bugs that should have been handled already, such as some dialogue text messages in-game extending off the end of the screen, especially since there is now an AV Club DLC, released September 2018, that would allow the developers to review every single in-game dialogue without having to play through the entire game to know which ones need correcting and to check fixes.  Probably the worst of the DLC bugs is one for the Survival Mode that prevents one's score from showing for this new mode in the Colosseum as anything other than 0Win as recently as May 24, 2019 (Survival Mode released April 15, 2019).\n\nOverall, I'm going to rate the experience of having played through the game and done everything as 7 out of 10 with 10 being a perfect game.  If I had had access to the Shares Quest and all DLC so that I would not have had to play through the game multiple times, I might have rated the game higher.  Slogging back through hours of dialogue again and again in order to access new DLC is not my idea of fun.  I enjoyed the variety of characters, and I wish that they had all been given equal treatment so that I would want to use them all more.  Some have tons of Accessories, for example, while others have just the clothes on their back.\n\nThe Minimum Viable Product vibe colored the entire experience for me from limited visual attacks for most characters (many just have 1 Exe and a handful of Skills) to only two types of Quests available at the Guilds (Hunt monsters and Find items dropped by those monsters).  I think that some of the DLC is the injection that has kept this game fun over the long haul for me, and what is sorely missing now that I've leveled everyone up and unlocked all Plans is that there is nothing to do end-game beyond a few tough Colosseum battles to keep me playing longer than the nearly 300 hours that I sunk into this title just to see what there was to see.  Oftentimes, I really didn't know whether it would be worth it to spend 60 million Credits on an ultimate Processor Set for a Goddess, and most times the answer was that I'd just sunk a lot of time into earning cosmetics that were not necessarily cooler than the ones to which I already had access.", "timestamp_created": 1559277279, "timestamp_updated": 1559284417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50964715": {"recommendationid": "50964715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124128663", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 10975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8962, "last_played": 1627581863}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely amazing way to get someone hooked on this series.

What?\nI no doubt got some eye rolls when people saw me playing this on Steam, but I won't lie, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a pretty great game. The combat system constantly evolves as your level up and you're always learning new attacks to switch around into your character's combos. There's a slight learning curve to jump over, but once you figure it out, everything just clicks and it's really satisfying.\nThe storyline is actually not bad but oh man does the voice acting hurt my ears. after the first hour of \"KAWAAAIIIII\", \"UUUUUUU\", and many other high pitch Japanese sounds I dove head first into the options to turn voice acting off. Once I did that everything was much more bearable, although still pretty shallow considering all of the fan service panty/titty conversations and situations that arise throughout the story.\nMy biggest complaint with this game is the dungeon layout. There's probably 8 concrete dungeon designs. Once you've seen them all, that's it folks. In a game that has 30 or 40 dugeons to romp through, you'll see THE EXACT SAME LAYOUT get used over and over and over Class of Heroes style. It ruins any sense of exploration and shoulders a large margin of the fun onto the battle system.\nSomething I read a lot from other reviewers is the massive difficulty spikes that crop up.

Nep-Nep definitely being my fav so far.\nThe Plan and Disc feature were hard for me to understand at first glance, but then I took it as a nice new tweak in this game genre.\n\nThere are some buts, though, those are the things that bugged me, not in a big matter, but still something to point it out.\nFirst, the repetitiveness.

I assume the fanservice did the job, and I compensate this with the humor and 4th wall breaks.\nThe bosses design is.. Very low-effort. In most times you'll end up fighting copies of your allies, or just the same bosses all over, especially in later parts of the game. Not going to mention how you're supposed to spend 10-15mins in one fight with them regening HP, leaving you with nothing else than plan/XP grinding.\nThe additional content.

Though halfway through that game, I was really disappointed that it was a complete train-wreck as I realized most of the functionality/ mechanics /upgrades were really unnecessary and pointless.\n\nThen I found out that Hyperdimension Neptunia which has almost the exact same combat system as fairy fencer, and it was made from the same developer. I was immediately intrigued. However when I came to the store page, it screams fan service and looked really obnoxious to me. I was kinda reluctant so I stashed it into my wishlist.\n\nHaving it being heavily discounted all the time, I finally decide to purchase and completed it after some time so here are my thoughts.\n\n[quote]\n[i][b]Tldr (in my own opinion);[/b][/i]\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+ Battle system\n+ Visual\n\n[b]Neutral:[/b]\n~ Story\n~ OST\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Genre? (not really my type)\n[/quote]\n\nThe story... was okay-ish. Nothing particularly stands out nor is there much to fault it.\n\nI started off with Jap voice but I really couldn't stand how all the characters are constantly yelling at almost every single dialogue, so I switched to English voice. It wasn't good either, most of the time the character expression was definitely lacking and awkward, but at least they're not constantly yelling all the time.\n\nThere are definitely fan services. Just play the game for for like 10mins and you'll see one.\n\nThe characters are... not really something to rate or judge as their development isn't really the point of this game. The characters are purposefully kept silly and typical for the slapstick to work. With the constant breaking of the fourth wall, I couldn't imagine it to work if the characters were to be taken seriously. That said, I'm still really not fond of the characters though. Let just say... this isn't my type of genre anyway.\n\nOST side, as long as I don't feel any ear sore throughout the playthrough, I would say it is decent. So yeah, it's decent.\n\nVisual is pretty good. Good amount of unique cutscene for each of the character's skills in combat as well. It's a really colorful game too, so it does kinda hurt my eyes a little when played much in one sitting.\n\nBattle system did not disappoint. Unlike fairy fencer, the functions and upgrades served its purpose and are useful. It's able to keep me intrigued throughout the playthrough too before it becomes boring.

On one hand, I adored the whole experience, and would definitely like to play more of the series. On the other, I just can't excuse the game's various flaws.\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth is a hybrid between a semi-turnbased RPG and a visual novel. The story is full of anime/video game references, fourth-wall breaks, cutesy interactions and... yeah that's mostly it. Not to say that the there aren't any serious parts, though. It starts off with your typical \"main character has amnesia\" trope, then it slowly unravels that there is a malevolent force taking over the lands of GamIndustri, and you have to get to the bottom of where it is coming from. The dialogue which covers this part consists of only about 10% of the story. \n\nThe other 90% is reserved for the aforementioned video game references, lewd jokes, cute talks about pudding, fourth-wall breaks, pretty much the writers fooling around. I love the fact that the game doesn't take itself seriously at all, and I personally adored the over-the-top nature of the dialogue. To add, most of the characters are fully voiced (JP dub), which shows a lot of effort dedicated to these shenanigans. \n\nHowever, it can get tiring after a while. Sometimes, the game has a serious problem with pacing, and the dialogues can get really drawn out. The main character breaking the 4th wall or the topic somehow transitioning to pudding was funny the first couple of times but then it gets thrown in your face way too much, almost to the point that you want to skip ahead. \n\nOn the gameplay side, I can't help but praise the unique combat which I haven't seen in any other game before this one. You basically make a party of 3 characters (with the option to add an extra to each one as a backup later on) and you position them so that you can lock on to one or more enemies at once. You then choose which attack you want to use to make a combo. I personally had a lot of fun with the system, especially since there are extra dungeons where you can experiment with more enemies, and find more cool items. \n\nOn the other hand, there is a lot of grinding involved. While the extra side quests, crafting (plan making) and characters kind of help against the monotony, you will be expected to kill the exact same enemies over and over. Once you level up, you will be expected to kill the same enemies, but this time higher-leveled. This leads me to one of the major gripes with the game - the lack of variety in the enemy design. Most of the mobs behave similarly, and even look the same throughout most of the dungeons. They don't even make an effort to change the colours, they just reuse the skins, and slap a new quirky name on them. In my opinion, this is beyond lazy, and only artificially lengthens the game.  \n\nWhat is more, once you have leveled enough, the game becomes very easy. It never fully takes advantage of the position-based combat since all you really need is your characters properly leveled and to have the most OP items crafted (or remade, added in, whatever). For the bosses, just craft (remake the game and add) the EXE Boost, spam as many Rush attacks, then use the super-power (EXE Drive) of a character 2-3 times. Can't beat a boss? No tactics needed, just grind and then come back. \n\nMind you, I still had a lot of fun with the game, and the combat system, along with the ReMake (crafting) parts made it really enjoyable. Just prepare a playlist or podcast, and make sure you are properly hydrated, because these parts can get hypnotising. \n\nIn a nutshell, I enjoyed my time in the game, and I would definitely like to give the other titles in the series a shot. However, the various flaws make the game inaccessible to those who aren't into anime or video game references. On the other hand, if you like that sort of stuff, then switch your mind off and take in it all in. You will have a blast!\n\nNep is love.

I played it start to finish and enjoyed it quite a bit. I previously played through Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk 2 on PS3 a few years ago and enjoyed that as well. This is a turn based JRPG with a great combat system. During battles you can chain together attacks to do massive damage. You can do attacks that do pure damage to enemies, attacks to break their guard or attacks to build up your EXE meter to do your character's ultimate attacks. Outside of combat, the character customization is great. You can change your weapons, armor, character outfits, accessories and can change their attacks they do during combos in battle. Battles are not randomly encountered you see enemies on the field run up to them and either swing at them to gain an advantage or the enemy gets the advantage if they bump into you first.  There's also weapons, items and other things you can buy from the stores at towns to upgrade your characters. A cool thing too is the crafting system in the game and the ability to make plans. Plans can create new items, weapons, armor for your characters, but also have other effects such as adding new enemies to areas, unlocking new areas to travel to and even strengthening and weakening enemies in areas. The story of the game is pretty good too.\n\nThis game's story is a massive parody of gaming and anime. So if you're someone who's into both of those things you will appreciate the many references and parodies to games and anime. However, if you're someone not into anime or games that much many of the parodies and references in this game may fly over your head. Throughout the game you'll fight enemies that resemble Ghosts from Pac Man, run into NPC's who look like Mario and Luigi, have characters make references to anime like Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex and Steins Gate etc. Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1's story is not a story that takes itself seriously. It's very over the top and silly. Some people will like this and some will not. If you're looking for an extremely serious story this isn't the game. The characters have silly conversations frequently and the game breaks the fourth wall often. However, if you want some good laughs and can appreciate a story that cheers you up then this game's story is quite enjoyable. The characters are very likable and memorable. In terms of music and graphics the game is decent.\n\nNeptunia Rebirth 1's graphics aren't going to really impress anyone. This is a budget JRPG and it definitely shows. Some dungeons have recycled assets and layouts and can look identical to each other. Furthermore, in terms of graphical fidelity it isn't that impressive and is unlikely to have heads turning. The attacks during combat are extremely cool and the areas do have a lot of creativity in their design however. Meanwhile, the soundtrack is pretty good. The game has some cool dungeon themes and the heavy metal boss themes are awesome. However, then there's a few dungeon themes or other songs in the game that are kind of meh and unmemorable. My biggest flaws with this game are some of the dungeons looking alike and also the anticlimactic final boss fight. The final boss fight was a bit of a let down, but fortunately the ending was really good. Overall, I suggest Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 to JRPG fans. It is a great underrated JRPG if you're in the mood for a silly story that will make you laugh and that makes fun of the game industry and anime industry. If you are someone who's not into anime at all though and doesn't like that type of stuff you may not enjoy this game as much. Meanwhile, the combat system is pretty great and has a lot of tactics to it. The graphics and music could use improvement, but are more than serviceable. Overall, definitely give this game a play if you're a JRPG fan.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\nGreat combat system.\nStory has pretty good writing and is funny. The game is a good parody of the gaming and anime industries and fans of both hobbies will appreciate the many references to games and anime. This game's cast of characters is very likable.\nReally good boss themes and some great dungeon themes in this game's soundtrack.\nFun crafting system that is rewarding and worthwhile.\nGameplay is decently challenging and you will have to use a lot of different tactics to win fights.\nLots of character customization, outfits and ways to customize your characters for combat.\nDespite not being a super amazing looking game graphically the area designs are creative and stand out. The character's attacks are also pretty awesome.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nGame is a lower budget JRPG and some corners are definitely cut. Dungeon designs are recycled and reused as are other assets. You'll go through a dungeon earlier in the game then get to a new one with the same layout and map design as a previous dungeon the only difference being tougher enemies/better items.\nAnticlimactic final boss fight.\nMight have to do some level grinding at certain parts of the game.\nGraphically game is not that impressive.\nSome of the dungeon themes and other songs on the soundtrack are kind of meh.", "timestamp_created": 1556331163, "timestamp_updated": 1556466627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50326923": {"recommendationid": "50326923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102655594", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2451, "last_played": 1615508086}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is easily in my top ten of my library just for the characters alone.

save all of game industry.\n\n\nlets start with the visuals,this game is an older title but still survive the test of time imo because of the anime theme visuals.\n\n\nthe story: they story can be some what weak at some points but is overall enjoyable with  lot of nice skites and some small jokes from nep nep but also some really cliches ones.\n\ncombat system:pretty decent,some what recycling basic rpg elements but adding a alot of new once:like the lily rank system(friends system).special attacks using exe matter that execute super flashy animation,or letting you use one more attack at every turn as long you have your exe matter field,and just special attack using sp.\n\nanother poing: party members does matter and you get encouraged to use some sort of tactics like buffing your self up,making sure your party have healer and that she is out of the way,so you are not just aimleslly mashing button all of the time.\n\n\nlets talk about the dungeons: various of dungeons with different scenery, monsters are some times recycled and used again on different dungeons, but for me it didn't took way from the game experience\nthe monsters can give you a decent fight while bosses can give you a bed time and send you to grind some more.\n\n\n\nbottom line: a decent game with main selling point of moe anime girls with decent story to back it up and decent battle system.\n\n7/10

It is an RPG, but it uses a unique gameplay style where you actually position your character in combat, allowing you to either avoid enemy damage or position yourself to hit multiple enemies. The game also uses a system that allows you to edit various parts of the game, such as adding dungeons to your map, weakening enemies or even adding more items to the shops using a limited resource. Small tip, do not be scared to use this resource, you get more than enough to get what you need and some of what you want, and it is well worth it to add dungeons. The game also has some very cute banter between the various characters, several times they will break the fourth wall, it might make you wonder if the fourth wall even exists at times. The only issue I personally have with the game is that unless you grind for cash to get better gear, you will hit difficulty spikes early on. One of the bosses I fought was only beat because I had dlc characters which had better gear than the rest of my under-leveled party. Besides this, the game is great and I highly recommend trying it out.", "timestamp_created": 1555881360, "timestamp_updated": 1555881360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

It's both anime and garbage. But it's garbage you might enjoy. For an RPG, it's okay, I guess, but it can get old real fast. The story is... a story, I suppose, and the music is about as anime as you can get. \n\nI would equate Neptunia to a bag of sugar. it's alright for the first few minutes, but after a while, you *will* get sick of it. I don't mean just this game, I mean the entire series.\n\nNeptunia is a game series that heavily relies on the player playing games solely for memes and anime references. The gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. The DLC is also bonkers, because there's so damn much of it, and it can get confusing what you have, what you don't have, and what each DLC does. For this reason, I really wish they'd just make a \"Re;birth1 Complete Edition\" instead of making it a mess to get everything. Now that I think about it, I'd rather they'd just make the DLC free updates. Most of it isn't even close to being worth the price for it. This is most notable with Hyperdevotion, which is a trashfire of a game already.\n\nBut why am I recommending it then? Because it goes on sale all the damn time, and if anyone wanted to get into Neptunia, then this is the game you play. I would recommend getting the Base game when it goes on sale (which is like... a few bucks, usually), and then play that.

For the cost of less than \u00a32 per game I thought it was probably worth giving them a shot and for that price they probably were. This said my problems with this game make for quite a list such that I can\u2019t really recommend it.\n\nTo begin with the story is fine, but nothing really mind blowing (though I\u2019m sure most of you aren\u2019t exactly expecting Shakespeare). The whole idea of the \u201cCPU war\u201d is made pretty much irrelevant very early on by the main character (Neptune) losing her memory and most of the other CPU characters not actually being very interested in continuing it. This kind of kills one of the story\u2019s main plot points and just makes it mostly about joining forces to beat the bad guy.\n\nWhen it comes to the characters the biggest problem for me was that Neptune is just really annoying. There\u2019s no real rhyme or reason to anything she says. A lot of her writing is just pointless filler with vain attempts at humour which I often found myself quickly skipping through for the other characters to get on with the story. I\u2019ve seen other people say that you get used to it, but she has remained annoying to me for the whole game and into the other games in the series as well. I also found Compa\u2019s voice quite irritable to the ear, which is a shame since the two characters are prominent throughout the whole game. The other characters all have their pros and cons and come down more to personal preference giving a decent variety with something to please most people, which is probably one of the bigger draws of the game.\n\nIn general I feel like the comedy element has been over sold by a lot of people. The comedy is on the level of any ordinary run of the mill anime. Very little actual wit or cleverness goes into the jokes, it\u2019s more just the characters getting mad or flustered with each other or references to other games or anime series. A lot of the jokes are reused and repeated, which I personally found to become a bit of a drag and lack a bit of creativity further into the game.\n\nWhen it comes to actual gameplay the game has some decent ideas that I feel could have been implemented much better, which left me a bit disappointed. The combat system is fairly interesting requiring a bit of thought as to what you\u2019re doing with the freedom of movement making the turn-based combat feel not too sluggish. The combo skills set-up also gives you some choice over how you want utilise each of your characters. A problem for me is that as more combat mechanics are introduced they often have the effect of replacing older mechanics instead of adding to them. By the end of the game it feels like you\u2019re mostly spamming \u201cRush\u201d attacks to build up your meter to use the big EXE skills.\n\nThere are also several moves and abilities that feel entirely pointless. An example of this is the EXE couple skills. The idea is that they\u2019re like the regular EXE skills, but you partner up two of the characters together to have a big combined attack, which sounds good in theory. The reality is that they require you to partner two specific characters, use up much more of your meter and simply don\u2019t do enough to make it worth it. They also require both characters to be in the same form (Human or CPU), which makes the abilities awkward to use as well as limiting your choice of character partner set-up.\n\nFor a lot of the game the whole party and partner set-up is also constantly interrupted by characters joining and leaving the group, which makes the whole thing a pain in general until towards the end of the game where all the characters are available. This means you feel regularly forced to change your set-up and assist abilities every time this happens instead of doing so by choice. It also interrupts any attempt to increase the Lily rank between two characters (the higher the rank the stronger the characters are together) for most of the game.\n\nSupport characters and a lot of the support skills in general are also pretty redundant. This is mostly due to the fact that there are items in the game that simply do the job better and can be used by any character. Some of the stronger items do require unlocking to be able to be purchased, but can also be found in reasonable quantities as random drops and even then the more basic items are still fairly strong and easily attainable. Numerous abilities that buff a stat of a single character are simply dwarfed by items that can buff multiple stats to all characters in an area.\n\nSticking on the point of items, there are far too many different crafting materials. Each dungeon has its own set of enemies and each enemy has its own specific item drops. This results in there being over 300 different crafting materials, which makes getting the desired material for a specific crafting plan a huge pain. I ended up having to use a wiki page to figure out where I had to go for each specific item. Grouping together two or three of a similar type of enemy to drop the same items would have made this much less of a chore and much easier to memorise what enemy you needed to kill to farm which item.\n\nThe crafted gear is then also of questionable use. This is mainly due to the fact that most of the plans for gear require at least one item that drops from a boss, which are much stronger than any other enemy in the dungeon. By the time you\u2019re strong enough to actually beat the boss the weapon you craft is often no longer desirable and quickly replaced or made redundant by gear easily purchased from the store or just found lying around.\n\nCrafting outfits and accessory items is also antagonised by the fact that you can\u2019t actually view the item until you\u2019ve crafted it and then also purchased it, which means you\u2019ll have to look up a guide if you want to try and find something that you actually like the look of without just doing it by trial and error. The even more annoying thing is that some of these items have bonus stats on whereas most of them don\u2019t, which means out of the mostly cosmetic items a select few are just better. It would have been much better if none of these items gave stats and were just for looks.\n\nBecause of these things a lot of the bonus dungeons you can unlock are also somewhat irrelevant as if you aren\u2019t looking to farm for new weapons and items there\u2019s no real reason to use them as the story can be completed without them. The idea of course is that they\u2019re optional, but it feels bad going out of your way to do some of the extra content to not really be rewarded very well for doing so.\n\nThere are a several other things I have issue with and could explain in more detail, but this review is already too long and I think you probably get the general point. There\u2019s a lot of content in the game that could have really added to the experience, but just isn\u2019t really very meaningful or could have easily been done better. I only really did most of it myself because I have quite a completionist mentality when it comes to playing games. Doing the extra content does at least alleviate some of the grind as it makes the game feel less monotonous with most of my game feeling fairly grind free even while getting the achievement to get each character to max level. I can see that people would say that the game can be quite grindy if they just stick to the main content though, which I suspect a lot of people will do.\n\nAs a JRPG, many games do it much better in terms of both story and gameplay and it really just comes down to how invested you are in the Neptunia universe and its characters. At a base level the game does enough to keep you interested, but its numerous faults make it not go much further than that.", "timestamp_created": 1555270628, "timestamp_updated": 1555270628, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694141805171966553", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50132432": {"recommendationid": "50132432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122930436", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 6158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2713, "last_played": 1671889136}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games.

The game starts quite shallow, simplistic and repetitive. And while there are still some problems regarding these up until the end - my initial confusion changed to genuine entertainment. Suddenly magic happened and as more characters joined the fray, they grew on me, the jokes became funnier and the combat system more interesting.\n\nThe story of neptunia is inspired by teh console war where various companies and consoles are represented as cute anime girls fighting for supremacy, but do not go expecting something very deep and epic like most of JRPGS. The game never takes itself very seriously, instead you will get to see various inhabitants of \"Gaminustry\" (familliar plumbers, or suspicious soldiers hiding in cardboard boxes), lots of fourth wall breaking, references and silly nods to otehr games,  pervy jokes, [spoiler] light yuri [/spoiler] and girls talking about the power of friendship and pudding!\n All presented in visual novel format, meaning, lots of fully voiced dialog boxes (at least on Japanese settings - you have an english option as well but I haven't checked!) that sometimes might drag with all the extra fluff, accompanied by some quite colorful and nicely designed character portraits with some light animation effects. As with most visual novels you can also skip the long dialog cutscenes with a press of a button.\nMusic is appropriately cheerful and moody when it needs to, though doesn't have great variety - however,  the pieces are serviceable enough, catchy, with the intro song being the highlight.\n\nGameplay is reminiscent mostly of older JRPGS with a turned based battle system but sprinkled with some modern touches like being able to run around the battlefield and position your character in a way that can deal damage to more enemies but also avoid getting your entire group hurt by the enemy. As more characetrs join your party and as you level up more skills and tactics can be unlocked , though it takes a while until you can see the full potential of the system.\nHowever the game doens't always escape from the more mundane basic tactics of spamming the attack buttons to empty the enemy's health bar and bosses dont' really offer much variety in terms of tactics . Neptunia follows one of the olders rules in the JRPG Book: Grinding and leveling up is all you need to progress.\n\nUnfortunately this is one flaw that somewhat hampers the enjoynment in a few parts of the game, as it requires you to grind a bit and it becomes more frustrating in some questionable and sudden difficulty spikes (one being very early in the game). The dungeons also dont' offer too much variety, being mostly straightfowrad affairs with some having quite a few recycled assets.\n\nThere is an interesting crafting system (that admitetdly soemtimes can feel tiresome, as you search for the ingredients)  but it offers a nice variety of new materials, additional dungeons, extra enemies or changes to the gameplay system, some of which I consider essential to ease the more frustrating parts of the game.\n\nThe game also packs a nice viety of extras, like  a gallery where you can admire the beatiful and sometimes raunchy artwork and offers a NewGame+ for those who need more Nep in their life.\n\nAs for the technical aspects of the game, don't expect anything too special in terms of options, and as you can see the graphics are fairtly basic although still nice looking. I didn't encounter any problem with the game and my gamepad worked fine. Smooth 60fps!\n\nAll in all, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a funny, lighthearted adventure, for those who want a more relaxed Jrpg, that doens't require a lot of thought or micromanagement, sometimes grindy and tedious, it might not be for everyone but for those who know what they are getting into for, it will be a fun romp and a nice introduction to the world of Neptunia.\n\nI give this game a (\uff3e\u03c9\uff3e) out of 10 Neps, Compa Desu!", "timestamp_created": 1553381388, "timestamp_updated": 1553381388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714594662189483643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49640900": {"recommendationid": "49640900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026915795", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 475, "last_played": 1591360498}, "language": "english", "review": "Help D: I'm losing my innocense", "timestamp_created": 1552965214, "timestamp_updated": 1552965214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49637848": {"recommendationid": "49637848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363590655", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1587729459}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: Nep Nep\n\nCons: Nope Nope", "timestamp_created": 1552945886, "timestamp_updated": 1552945886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.38226008415222168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49633941": {"recommendationid": "49633941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285500508", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 196, "playtime_forever": 9078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3676, "last_played": 1552972157}, "language": "english", "review": "It is my 3rd round to play but even can't get some dungeon out.\nA little troubles happened to the true ending.", "timestamp_created": 1552928677, "timestamp_updated": 1552928677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49632869": {"recommendationid": "49632869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038693963", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1962, "last_played": 1552710456}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this on a whim since it was on humble bundle, and shortly after bought the whole series.

The game is split into 2 parts: The gameplay part starts you off in a hub-world, where you select a dungeon to go to, and explore an area and defeat monsters for items and EXP in turn-based battles. The story part is delivered in a visual novel kind of way, with character portraits talking to each other. Dialogue includes a lot of fourth wall breaking, as well as many references to all sorts of videogames and anime. For those who are into geek/otaku culture, extra value is to be had here.\nAlso got the DLC for this, which will be accounted for in the review.\n\nPositives:\n+Plays a lot like a more old-school JRPG, with a few modern touches added to it.\n+Good pacing, letting you learn each new mechanic before introducing another.\n+Setting up your own combos for the different types of auto-attacks.\n+Combat flows quickly, with short animations on attacks, and the ability to skip spell/special attacks.\n+Plans are a nice way to unlock new stuff (gameplay features, dungeons, gear, outfits) and encourage exploring all the areas and hunting for monsters. There are also a lot of plans to be found.\n+Option for either English or Japanese voices. Just about every line of dialogue in the game is covered by voice acting, at least for the Japanese version. The voice acting is of pretty good quality, able to deliver the many utterly ridiculous and insane lines in a convincing manner.\n+Nice character art that is slightly animated during dialogue scenes.\n+Nice soundtrack. Catchy opening song.\n+DLC that is priced fairly.\n+Broccoli.\n\nNegatives:\n-Combat encounters are extremely simplistic. You've seen 1 boss, you've seen them all (tank'n'spank will do the job just fine). There aren't any real interesting mechanics introduced whatsoever.\n-There were a few sharp difficulty spikes along the way that suddenly forced me to grind up some levels. Nothing too bad, but felt like a few of the areas/bosses could've done with a bit more careful balancing.\n-The story is very basic and isn't anything you haven't seen before if you're familiar with JRPG tropes.\n-Dialogue tends to drag on. Lot of fluff dialogue. (+Cutscenes can be skipped through quickly.)\n-3D graphics are fairly underwhelming, even for 2014 standards. The character models look alright, but environments are basic and bland, with little interesting visuals. It gets the job done, though.\n\nCould recommend, especially if you're into a more old-school JRPG experience.

The remade PS4 version was dubbed \"Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 Plus\". In this they basically just ported the VITA title to PS4 with all previous DLC. Which is nice and all but the other thing is it came with bonus characters and as of today it never got a western release. However some of the content such as the \"Colosseum + Characters DLC\" did get released for the PC version but we are still missing a few characters that the Plus version had.\n\n5pb, Cave, and RED are all still missing from the game but I hope they will be included soon. Anyways that was my gripe but it isn't game breaking so I still recommend this game but I do hope that the content does get added to the Steam version eventually seeing how we already got a bit of the DLC.

The only thing you should pay attention to is that it's recommended to play Re;Birth1 before starting the third game, since Re;Birth3 is a spin-off of the first game.\n\nAs Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 always was extremely popular, I just had to play it as well at some point. I have to say, I didn\u2019t expect a lot since this game looks like your typical fan-service based anime game. Oh, little did I know. Never did I think I would enjoy such a game as much as I did.\n\nGameindustri is a world protected by four CPUs. CPUs are goddesses who protect their own planets, therefore there are a total of four plants: Planeptune, Lastation, Leanbox, and Lowee. The atmosphere is very tense, as all CPUs are fighting for world domination. Suddenly, random monsters get released by Arfoire. Neptune, who is one of the four CPUs, gets defeated and loses all of her memories. She wakes up in the lower realm and meets IF and Compa without knowing she is actually Purple Heart, the CPU of Planeptune. Gameindustri is in great danger. Will Neptune be able to regain her memories and more importantly, will she and her friends be able to save the world?\n\nThe story is very simple and light-hearted. It\u2019s nothing new, as many JRPG games have the same storyline. Basically, you just have a villain who wants to destroy the world and a hero who will try to save mankind, this game is no exception. The story is definitely not the focus of this game and that won't keep you playing the game, but the humor and the lovable characters make up for it.\n\nThe characters are very adorable and silly to a point it was funny. Every character is unique and completely different, though all of them are very cute. Neptune doesn\u2019t seem like the smartest girl and is basically an air-head. You really end up shaking your head while laughing and reading her comments. On the side note, you definitely won\u2019t be able to not love her. She never gives up and always tries her best. I would say she can be serious when it is required even if she acts very immature. Noire, on the other hand, is your typical tsundere. She is too shy to admit her real feelings, yet you can tell she really cares about her friends. I really enjoyed the interactions between the characters, for example, everyone teasing Blanc or Noire for\u2026 Specific reasons. Vert is a very lovable character as well, she is a very huge nerd and loves to game in her free time. But of course, it\u2019s a secret! She loves anything that\u2019s cute and small, and she especially loves to hug people, a lot!\n\nSome might say that the characters are a bit overly cute and I can definitely agree. They indeed act very cutely and some may be put off by it. However, it never bothered me while playing. I mean what kind of game is realistic? Definitely not a JRPG.\n\nFirst of all, the visuals and CGs are gorgeous. The characters do have plenty of different facial expressions and they\u2019re very lively. You can literally imagine how the girls would look like if they were 100% animated. Also, you can notice the art is really detailed. The dungeons are a bit empty though, they\u2019re very straight forward and only contain glimpses of what could be there. For example, if there is snow, it\u2019s just white. Not detailed at all, just white. The focus on graphics definitely lies in the artwork and CGs, but I wished they would have focused more on the dungeons because it\u2019s also the only place where you can walk around more or less freely.\n\nAlso, I have to mention some enemies may seem very weird to you, as they are not all monsters per se. Instead, there are very different visuals for each monster, also including posters for example\u2026 It felt very weird fighting against an enemy when they were designed as a thing literally, but it was definitely not a deal breaker.\n\nThis game has English and Japanese Voice Over. I played the game with English-Voice-Acting, so I\u2019ll be able to only critique the English one. I really enjoyed listening to the girls\u2019 talking as the voices really fit for each character, I would have imagined them exactly with the same voice given their personality. The Voice Acting really is top notch. Although English-Voice-Over often sounds a bit off in original Japanese games, it didn\u2019t feel this way for Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 at all. They all sound very natural and of course cute and lovable!\n\nSo in the end, would I recommend Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1? My answer would be: definitely! While this game does not contain an outstanding story, nor gameplay, I couldn\u2019t put my controller down. Just the dialogue of the main characters and their friendship alone were enough to keep me going. I don\u2019t think Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a game anyone would enjoy, if you are into a story-driven game or enjoy good a combat style, you should look elsewhere. But if you enjoy character development, a fluffy story and don\u2019t mind a typical JRPG you will absolutely adore this game. I can say I\u2019m glad my journey with Neptunia and her friends didn\u2019t end here since there are more games of this series which I will definitely play in the future.\n\n[code]\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28
