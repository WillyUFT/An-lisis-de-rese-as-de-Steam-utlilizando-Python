Endless hours of entertainment, played using a mouse.  Difficulty is however hard you want to make it for yourself.  Good game for kids.\n\nThe point of the game is to get the ball to the star by drawing objects, pathways, anchors, squares, other balls, dinosaurs, cars, whatever it takes to make it happen.  You're encouraged to be creative and you get bonus flags for doing each level in a certain way.  But ultimately it can be much, Much simpler than it has to be for many of the levels. \n\nControls are eh.  Mouse draws lines, places pins, erases mistakes, etc.  Sometimes the ball doesn't follow the line and, instead, floats above it.  Makes precision a problem.

This is the sort of game anyone could probably beat in 3-5 hours, but I gotta be honest here: I install it maybe once a year to get rid of some stress, play it for an hour or so, abruptly lose interest, and uninstall it again.  There's nothing to hold me there, not like it did a decade + ago.  So it's a good game for chilling out to and doodling around, and that's about it.  That's not to say it's a bad game.  There are probably hardcore Crayon Physics Deluxe fans out there drawing their heart out, and I can see kids getting into it.  It's just lacks any pull outside of basic game mechanics.

It was a bit of an indie darling back at that time. I mean, imagine this, late 2000s, everyone is getting memed by big publishers with brown ugly shooters, more brown than the first Quake, blur dispensed in your eyes. Then boom, indie scene is going big and one of those is a nice cute colorful game which had an unique mechanic that was simple to understand and was seldom seen before: whatever you draw becomes a physics object. It's like magic and it's certainly more magic than shooting bullets into people in your shooters. Possibilities are endless (they are limited but shhhh, we are getting hyped). Though the game did not get mainstream attention, I have even read an user review from those years ago that gave it low score on graphics or such points cus lel kids drawing. But at least it was sure to be a shining example of the scene. Scroll down Steam store page. See \"Awards\"? Aexactly. It's an [/img]. Epic.\n\nActually I have no idea what I am talking about, I am mostly imagining it up based on my anecdotial life experience, lel.\n\nBut what does it mean nowadays? Not much. I am really sure that there are now better apps on phones somewhere out there that do the same thing better and this one does have problems, so eh, we will see when I get more genre savvy.\n\nAs you can guess, Deluxe is not post-ironical title and means that game started as mobile app with even less levels, so you can draw all those things with stylus or fingers... to my knowledge? See, I am not even bothering checking. Why do you even read me nowadays?\n\nIt's rather old. There is no widescreen support. It asks you to have optional registration but to my knowledge it doesn't work anymore and you can still download levels from playground if you really want, not worth even trying.\nI guess we could nag developer for abandoning this aspect of a game and giggle at his blog not updating in like a dozen years, but then you take a look in at current time and boo, after years of silence we learn that dev is now working on Noita, that's pretty dope and uplifting. Can we get Phil Fish back while at it?\n\nUhhhhh, it's relaxing and cool and very sandboxy. Good times at beginning. But sandbox puzzles make me cry inside so I didn't hang around much. Judging by screenshots, I thought I would get to spend time just being creative with drawing but since all objects you draw become physics object and fall down, it was fairly pointless to draw details. Well, you can draw and erase on overworld map, calling you to have fun with colorful doodles spread all over the map. Guess what, if you try to, the game will mysteriously crash shortly after.\n\nOoooh, what else.  Game includes mostly Newton physics to it where you can draw solid objects, solid lines that all have mass and gravity and collision and then later on you learn how to draw pins and how to draw ropes between pins. You have to bring a ball over toward star and can only nudge it sometimes directly, to the left or to the right. So you will have to make some mechanism that will most likely be powered by a gravity force being applied somewhere. Or perhaps you will draw a slope under ball. Well, you can draw objects under a ball and it will reposition ball on top of them which seems to be glitchy but yet intentional for solutions, even though some extra star requirement, which are used to unlock the little silly ending level, clearly states not to draw objects under the ball? Uh, I dunno. Such confusion is part of why I didn't quite enjoy the second half of the game as much not to mention that it was kinda easy to stick to same old ideas that you develop and hard to come up with new ideas to solve the new puzzle. I even suspect that not every new level expects you to come up with new solution. As said, it's fairly freeform game with no obvious fail states or particular limits.\n\nSee, I am struggling to articulate why I didn't enjoy the second half. The first half was wonderful. Aside from \"do it with one line\" extra star requirement which calls it elegant but I call it dumb, it's pretty much always a spiral line that hooks up under ball too. And it also wants you to draw \"awesome solution\" to get it but there is no system to determinate it, just that you can put a flag on one of the recorded solutions as 'awesome' then boom, you get your 1/3 of extra star.\n\nOh and physics collission optimisation sometimes hiccups and you can see a ball roll over your waggly wiggly curve like there is a straight line somewhere.\n\nEr. Anyway. It was nice while it lasted for me. Beat almost all of levels, save for the last dozen, plus didn't bother with elegante solutions. I wish it had pressure plates or something more than just gravity, my little brain is too dumb for that. Albeit it's nice that game is freeform enough that you see unique solutions on YouTube based on person's style, cute. Overall, I will give this game a positive rating merely because it was important and kinda cute and maybe I am the dumb one.

However, I eventually ended up getting frustrated and stuck to the same solution almost every single time. (Which was making some kind of pulley system with string to launch the ball anywhere and prayed it hit the target.) Looking at other people's creations on YouTube, I would have preferred more tutorials for mechanics such as springs. I found that there was simply too much trial and error.\n\nI was annoyed when I finished the last island and realized I had to go back and unlock more stars to get to the final puzzles. In order to do so, you have to complete the levels in a specific way. This was actually exciting at first, because I had to think outside of the box, which this game doesn't force you to do often. But quickly, just like I completed the levels the first time around, I found a solution that worked and just applied everywhere. And then you have to peer-review your own levels and grade them as \"Awesome\" in order to move on which seemed kind of silly. Anyway, I did all that, and I get to the final island, aaaaand it's just a single level, where again, I applied the same method I had done in many previous levels. Not super exciting.\n\nI do like how it automatically saves your previous solutions and allows you to rewatch them. There is a level editor too which seems like it could be fun. \n\nAside from the gameplay itself my only comments are on the resolution and music, both of which aren't great. I know its an older game, but it does look a little muddy, especially on a high resolution screen. And the music itself isn't very good.

It is a classic of indie games, in the puzzle category. The work of 1 man, with very unique gameplay. It is simple but cute, complex while easy to grasp. My son loves it, and I never finished it because it is too hard. If you never played it, give it a try - although I find it a bit expansive for what it is. However, for some it may reach a 80% or even 90%, and objectively I reckon it is a classic. But personally I do not think it is fantastic or a masterpiece: just an important piece in the history of puzzles and indie games development.\n\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n  [tr]\n        [td][/td]\n        [td][/td]\n    [/tr]\n      [tr]\n        [td][b]VIDEO[/b]\n\n[i]graphics, performance, port, physics, arts, visuals...[/i]\n[/td]\n        [td][b]7/10[/b]\n\nIt is indie and extremely simple, and even not 16:9! So it should deserve a 5 or 6, however the style (made as if it was drawn by a 5 years old with color crayons) is adorable, and probably one of the first to try that. For that, for the cuteness and uniqueness, I give it a 7.\n\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td][b]AUDIO[/b]\n\n[i]music, sound effects, voice-over, audio balance, subtitles...[/i]\n[/td]\n        [td][b]6/10[/b]\n\nMusics are very sweet and dreamy, but a tad too repetitive maybe. It feels a bit like Minecraft, all this indie wave, where music ended up being a somewhat far-ish audio evocative support more than real original composition work...\n\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td][b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\n\n[i]controls, difficulty, level design, luck-strategy-skill balance...[/i]\n[/td]\n        [td][b]8/10[/b]\n\nThat's all the spice of this game: you can draw whatever you want, it stays and it exerts some physical impact on the objects. In other words: a 5 years old drawing takes life in front of your eyes! That's a very smart and lovely idea. You click, you draw, you try to resolve each puzzle.\n\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td][b]CONTENT[/b]\n\n[i]story, world, solo immersion, multiplayer depth, overall idea...[/i]\n[/td]\n        [td][b]6/10[/b]\n\nA puzzle game, so do not expect much: it is only puzzles with level selection (although with a lovely map).\n\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td][b]OTHER[/b]\n\n[i]length, replayability, price, community, economics, devs...[/i]\n[/td]\n        [td][b]5/10[/b]\n\nIt hurts me to put a 5, but this one will be for a very subjective reason: if it was for its length, I would put a 7, the game has many levels, it is impressively full of content, especially for a 200X game, and if you consider you can finish the levels normally and then once again with different objectives for a 100% clear. However, and that is the subjective reason, I think the game is very, very hard, for a not-so-smart person like me. I never finished the game when it came out on the web 10 years ago, neither now in its paid deluxe version... I think I am better at other puzzle games, like Hexcells or SpaceChem and such, but Physics based games like this one get me stuck. Which means I can not enjoy the game at 100%... too bad.

The art style is as though a young child was responsible for the artwork with background textures appearing as crinkled pieces of drawing paper. It is a solid concept with poor execution. There is just too much freedom in this game.\n\nThere are no limitations with how many items can be drawn per level (other than drawing so many the game forces a restart) so it is entirely possible to build a stack of abstract shapes to prop the ball up and direct it to the end goal, or to do the same in order to remove obstacles blocking the way. If the ball does fall off the screen (which is fairly often) it will instantly spawn back in its original spot without resetting the level, allowing the player to continue building a path as it does. This can also work against the player as the ball can repeatedly spawn and instantly fall off the map, forcing a level restart. [i]Crayon Physics Deluxe[/i] does not dictate what shapes can be drawn and this allows the player to create such shapes that can guide the ball to its goal without using the intended mechanics of the level, such as pulleys, buckets, rockets to propel the ball, etc., so rather than think about how each level's puzzle should be solved I found myself trying to break them. The ball also does not stick to the shapes and will tend to float several pixel above and away from the player's drawn line, causing all kinds of issues navigating slopes.\n\nAthough it is very relaxing, there is such little variety when it comes to [i]Crayon Physics Deluxe[/i]'s soundtrack that it soon becomes grating to listen to when faced with the task of collecting 120 stars in order to reach the final area. Some songs will also begin or finish abruptly as if half a second was cut from either end.\n\nAlthough [i]Crayon Physics Deluxe[/i] does keep the game interesting by introducing new mechanics fairly often it is just too simple and uninteresting, with clunky physics and completely intentional ways to cheat the system.

I was able to play it but I'm not creative enough to figure out unique ways to get the ball to the star so I end up drawing random polygons and poking the ball until it does what I want it to do. I feel as if you need to have creativity that's out of this world and spectacular problem solving skills in order for this game to reach it's full potential. Either that or I'm just stupid (I'm going to go with the latter on this one).\n\nWhatever the case may be, the shoe definitely does not fit in terms of pricing. If you are one of the 'puzzle gurus' on steam then you might like this title but I suggest buying it when it's on sale.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n\n\"[i]Crayon Physics Deluxe[/i]\" as mentioned throws your creative drawing skills into high gear and gives you the freedom to draw whatever you wish to get the ball from point \"A\" to point \"B\". Whether it be a dinosaur, a car, or even just a simple line. As long as it can guide the ball to the finish, you're golden. Gravity is your only real enemy as anything not touching the ground when a test is run will fall. There are also stars to collect that allows you to unlock other worlds and eventually finish the game. The game [i]obviously[/i] gets harder the further you progress and can actually get difficult at times but as long as you're able to keep the fall afloat and not stuck, you should be fine. The entire screen could honestly be a heaping mess of lines, curves, and indescribable doodles, and you could still win. There are bonuses I believe involving creativity, neatness and something else that could contribute to your score. But aside from that, anything can really happen.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\nNo matter how simple or elaborate you make it, it will come down to the fact that everything is created by crayon lines. There isn't much else to it besides the whole game looking like it takes place in a drawing book or on construction paper which adds novelty to the feeling of being a kid drawing in such a thing.\n\n[h1]Audio:[/h1]\n\nNot much to say here either. Casual happy music with little sound effects for the overall game. Nothing spectacular.\n\n[h1]Controls:[/h1]\n\nBesides being able to draw whatever you want, you are also fighting gravity. Anything drawn in the game, when tested will fall assuming it was drawn airborne beforehand. Aside from that, there isn't much else going on. Like stated in the title, \"[i]physics[/i]\" play a massive role in this game and it isn't as easy as drawing a line from \"A\" to \"B\". Things [i]will[/i] fall.\n\n[h1]Conclusion/TL;DR:[/h1]\n\n\"[i]Crayon Physics Deluxe[/i]\" is a physics based drawing game where you must get a ball from point \"A\" to point \"B\" by drawing literally anything you can imagine while also fighting the power of gravity. Although seemingly cute and trivial, it can be difficult at times. Game also may not work with all machines. Operating system and version might be the cause. Proceed with caution.

Get the little red ball to touch all the stars and you\u2019ll finish the level.  Crayon Physics Deluxe from Petri Purho is a simple game in premise, and you\u2019ll immediately understand how to play it from the first level.\n\nEach level  is a different drawing from a child\u2019s imagination.  Simply push the red ball into the star in whatever way you can manage.  Your main method of control is to draw objects into the world using your mouse.  While the game is quite fun early on, it quickly becomes devilishly difficult.\n\nYour drawings will start off simple enough: make a box to drop on the ball to knock if forward, draw a line to build a bridge across a gap.  However, soon you will need to aim the ball through small holes, or make it climb up an uneven surface with enough momentum to crest a peak and fall back down at just the right speed to fly into the star.  Trying to do some of these tasks is almost absurd, but finally figuring out a way (or accidentally swiping the star unexpectedly) is a moment full of joy.  The game has seven worlds and one bonus level once you collect 120 stars (out of 150 total), and there are a lot of interesting puzzles to solve.\n\nThe soundtrack is a small handful of relaxing lullabies, which mesh nicely with the visuals, and contrast strongly with the amount of mental anguish you will be going through. When objects hit each other, there is a satisfying \u201cthump\u201d and then the ball goes flying off the screen, crap dang it all that work wasted.\nThe visuals are entirely unique in gaming, and everything really does look like crayons drawn on paper. The different items like trees, boats, houses, and dinosaurs are cute and fun to discover.  The resolution only goes up to 1024x768, so it tends to look a little fuzzy on large HD screens.\n\nIn order to \u201cmaster\u201d each level, you need to find an elegant solution (only one item drawn) and an old-school solution (no pushing the ball, no extra pins drawn), and also specify one of your solutions as an Awesome solution.  Once you do that, you will get a bonus star for that level.  Annoyingly, you will have to manually select an awesome solution for each and every level in order to get that star.  This is a tedious process that keeps you out of the puzzles for far too long.\n\nThis game is quite a brain-burner, and it will either give you a few hours of fun or days of frustration; depending on your approach to it.

The pricipal mechanic (drawing objects that help a ball get from Point A to Point B) is novel at first, but quickly grows repetitive.\n\nYou'd think a game like this would reward creativity, but it's really just a victim of its own flexibility. Instead of coming up with clever or elegant solutions, you're heavily incentivized to draw crude, formless objects that fling or nudge the ball in the right direction until you eventually do something that achieves your goal. The game gets difficult at times, but you never feel like you're being forced to think much; it's just that moving the ball from one place to another is so unwieldy that it's hard to implement a real solution. In fact, I'm pretty sure that even the creator didn't have elgant solutions in mind for some of these puzzles. Every once in a while you'll do something neat that feels rewarding, but it's a very rare occurrence.\n\nWeirdly, the game actually feels like it's a little too long. You're introduced to a couple of new mechanics along the way, but by the end of the game all of the puzzles start to feel the same. There's actually really not much you can do with the engine, so it's not long before the game gets stale. In the end, it doesn't feel much like a physics sandbox at all.

The art style is fantastic and brings you right back to your childhood. The earlier puzzles are fun and simple to solve. The later puzzles, however, can be frustrating. I feel like the creators should have done more to introduce the player to what they can do in Crayon Physics. They should have introduced the player to more skills that they can use, combine, and manipulate as they progress through the game. Some levels can be solved just about any way you want but others seem like they have a very specific way of being solved. Others almost seem like they were not play tested. Without having more structured rules on what you can and can't do in Crayon Physics, many of the puzzles are solved with repeated solutions, drawing jumbles of random shapes, or just blind luck. I solved many puzzles just by drawing circles or squiggles beneath the ball until it reached the goal (or caused the game to crash). \n\nAnother low point was the music. With such a simple and colorful game, I would expect instrumental renditions of the Sesame Street theme to serve as the soundtrack. Instead, the soundtrack is made up of somber, ambient music that makes you feel sad and sleepy instead of youthful, energized, and inspired.\n\nCrayon Physics Deluxe was a great idea but the execution just falls short.

Quite a random game to review, but its actually pretty good.\nI'll point out that I had more hours on this on the version from Humble Bundle.\n\nThis title is actually one of the most relaxing games I've ever played.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nYou really need a free sandbox mindset for this game. The levels consist of you drawing around and making objects that will interact with the environment. You have to reach specific goals and can achieve them in an unlimited number of ways. There's a bunch of levels and goals in it so you can get a good amount of playtime out of it.\n\nI really don't have much else to say about this game, but its quite enjoyable if you're into a game that can really calm you down.\n\n[h1]Story, Visuals, & Music:[/h1]\nThis game doesn't have a story since its a drawing sandbox. The visuals really get the feel right. It looks adorable and feels like real drawings.\nThe music is extremely good. Its very calm and peaceful and is a contributing factor to why I find this game so relaxing.\n\n[h1]PC Version:[/h1]\nThis game will run fine on a toaster. The only flaw I found with it is there's no confirmation for creating a new game and erasing your previous. As long as you don't have butter fingers, you shouldn't run into this issue though.\n\nThere's also a level editor which is a plus for anyone that really finds themselves fascinated by this game, lol.\n\nAlso, I imagine this game plays much better on a tablet but I don't have one to try it.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nIts not a perfect game, but I did enjoy it plenty.\n\nWith that said, its incredibly overpriced. $20 for this game?

Draw a box in the sky, let it fall onto one side of the ball, and thanks to physics, the ball will be pushed in the opposite direction. Draw a bigger box and it'll be heavier. Or maybe attach a rectangle to a pivot point, and let it swing down to knock the ball like a golf club. And then watch as the ball runs up ramps that you've set up beforehand, or crosses your drawn bridge, or busts through obstacles to reach the goal. \n\nExcept the \"Physics\" in Crayon Physics don't always work the way you anticipate. And a lot of times, you are setting up weird contraptions in such a limited space that you feel like you are cheating your way to a real solution when it works just slightly differently than the 19 previous tries in the way you wanted. Like other physics-based puzzle games, there is oftentimes just frequent reconstruction of a valid approach because physics decided not to be kind.\n\nCrayon Physics is a fun game, but download the demo first to see how much you'll be fighting the physics engine.

You're goal is to guide a ball towards little stars placed around the play area. To get to the stars you draw various shapes that perform different jobs to move you towards your goal. You can make bridges, hammers, golf clubs, and even create chain devices to move pieces around. Even uniteligable squiggles can have purpose! It's rather fun, but extremely casual, not that there's anything wrong with that. I'd recommend this game for children or for use in an educational setting. If you're looking for a puzzler to kill time with there are many better alternatives on Steam; however, if you have a mobile device or tablet capable of playing this game I would highly recommend you play this game on such a platform. The drawing mechanics seem to be made for touch controls and that's where this casual game with an educational / emphasis on younger players really shines. I could easily see myself sitting down with a toddler and playing this with them on a tablet, and I really believe that's what this game was made for. At least in the beginning - later on the puzzles get pretty hard so if the game mechanics really draw you in you can find additional depth for this game. Unfortunately, I got bored of it after a little while and even though they threw in unique features such as rockets to move objects I didn't see the need to continue. I got the gist of what the author was trying to convey and enjoyed the game for what it was already without having to force myself through puzzles that I found uninteresting. Perhaps I just lacked the imagination to see a solution but towards the end I had no idea what to do. At the start, however, this game is a shining example of teaching the player to play as they play, with handy on-screen instructions and logical puzzles that utilize new mechanics that you've just learned.\n\nPros:\nFun, casual game\nUnique mechanics\nWorks great on a mobile platform\nTeaches the player while you play\nLevel Editor and free Downloadable Player Content adds endless 'fun' if you feel like digging through maps for good releases\n\nCons:\nUses up its gimmick rather quickly\nPerhaps I lack imagination, but some of the harder puzzles didn't give any hints on what to do - it was just a blank screen with a star floating somewhere for example\n\nThis is a nifty little game that's pretty gimmicky but does what it tries to do pretty well. I'd recommend it for a casual gamer or as an educational game, especially on a mobile platform. If you're looking for a serious puzzler I'd look elsewhere (especially on the computer) but if you enjoy the mechanics this game does offer depth if you continue with it.
