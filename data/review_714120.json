Here's why:\n\nFirstly, the narrative, while initially intriguing, quickly devolves into a series of dark and unsettling themes without much depth or nuance. The attempts at humor often fall flat, and the overall tone feels inconsistent, making it difficult to connect with the protagonist, Misfortune.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are simplistic to a fault. The choices you make seem to have minimal impact on the story, rendering the decision-making process more of a formality than a meaningful engagement. The lack of consequence for your actions diminishes any sense of agency, leaving the player feeling like a passive observer rather than an active participant.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are disappointingly easy, offering little challenge for players seeking a more engaging experience. The lack of variety and complexity in the gameplay makes Little Misfortune feel like a missed opportunity to provide a more stimulating and rewarding adventure.\n\nFurthermore, the game's relatively short duration leaves you wanting more, but not in a positive way. It feels like the narrative is cut short, leaving loose ends and unanswered questions. Instead of a satisfying conclusion, you're left with a sense of confusion and a lack of closure.\n\nWhile the art style and music contribute to the game's atmosphere, they can't compensate for the overall lackluster storytelling and gameplay. Little Misfortune falls short of delivering a truly memorable and enjoyable experience, making it a regrettable addition to your gaming library.

Needless to say, having completed every possible choice in the game and completed it 100%, I have to give it a negative review.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I knew the gameplay would be minimal, after all it IS a point and click game. But the story was lacking...something stronger. The beginning was really great and as the story progressed it was nice to have this mystery as to what was going to happen. But after maybe 1/3 of the game, it became not only predictable, but also quite dull. There was no plot twist, no change of pace, I even expected the villain to be even scarier. It was definitely a disappointment. Nevertheless, I would recommend playing at least one run of the game, since it has some nice moments and fun things to try. \n\nPS: Since it is a game that needs multiple runs for the achievements, it would be better to have a bit faster skipping dialogue option. It has a basic cutscene skip and a basic \"click to skip half a line\", but it takes a bit of time to redo some of the game scenes.", "timestamp_created": 1698596384, "timestamp_updated": 1698596384, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149130068": {"recommendationid": "149130068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249404896", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1641580687}, "language": "english", "review": "made me cry 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1698589223, "timestamp_updated": 1698589223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601811349391937256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149116791": {"recommendationid": "149116791", "author": {"steamid": "76561199110866462", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 414, "last_played": 1691080467}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2727\uff65\uff9f: *\u2727\uff65\uff9f fancy *:\uff65\uff9f\u2727*:\uff65\uff9f\u2727", "timestamp_created": 1698576021, "timestamp_updated": 1698576021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149114507": {"recommendationid": "149114507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009126016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 153, "last_played": 1698573198}, "language": "english", "review": "Well made and I'm glad I picked it up\n\nI'm a little lady, you know?", "timestamp_created": 1698573312, "timestamp_updated": 1698573312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149111748": {"recommendationid": "149111748", "author": {"steamid": "76561199383329049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1698855267}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it.

I listen to Music 4 Ever, an original tune from this game, years after having finished it for the first time. Unlike Fran Bow, this game is way more accessible, as it's purely narrative-focused, with no puzzles so to speak. The game has a unique allure, the vibrant graphics mixed with a macabre undertone make for a hunting vibe that persisted long after the final credits.\n\nThe reviewers don't get it in my opinion. This is a fascinating tale, one to remember, but not so simple to grasp the genius within. You see during the game, Misfortune can throw magic sparks that make the world a more loving space. If you manage to throw your positivity and childhood naivete on every possible instance, you do find Eternal Happiness. [spoiler] By your dying, you give happiness to your mother.

It tells the story of Misfortune Ramirez Hernandez, a young girl surrounded by tragedy, who embarks on an interactive adventure at the whims of a mysterious voice named Mr. Voice. This voice offers her eternal happiness in exchange for playing a game, a chance she gladly seizes.\n\nThe game's mechanics allow you to explore the world and interact with objects and characters while making decisions that impact the story's progression. The standout feature is Misfortune's ability to throw glitter, symbolizing her resilience and ability to find light in darkness.\n\nMisfortune's character is endearing, and her ability to use glitter as a metaphor for perseverance and appreciating the little things is charming.\n\nHowever, the game struggles with balancing its dark themes and juvenile humor. It delves into real-world horrors, including abuse and suicide, but sometimes these elements feel like they're included for shock value rather than contributing to the narrative. The tonal mismatch between these serious themes and humor can be jarring.\n\nDespite these challenges, the game's short runtime and focused narrative make choices feel meaningful, even if they don't drastically alter the plot. The love for Misfortune and the desire to outsmart Mr. Voice serve as compelling motivations.\n\nWhile some repetitive voice lines and odd dialogue choices exist, the game's moments of rebellion against Mr. Voice provide a sense of satisfaction and delight. Despite the darkness that envelops her, Misfortune's resilience and optimism shine through, making \"Little Misfortune\" a unique and engaging experience.\n\nIn the end, Little Misfortune is a rollercoaster ride through darkness and innocence, propelled by memorable characters and a heartfelt message of resilience. It's an imperfect but compelling experience that leaves players with a sense of both discomfort and wonder in the intricacies of life, the streuggles within them and the mystique of death.", "timestamp_created": 1693916760, "timestamp_updated": 1693916793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558823525905609131", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145700706": {"recommendationid": "145700706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128460411", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1693907498}, "language": "english", "review": "The silly little lady made me fucking cry\n\nDon't let anything bad happen to her, but do let her pet the kraken please", "timestamp_created": 1693908447, "timestamp_updated": 1693908614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632137775421142578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145687675": {"recommendationid": "145687675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041165175", "num_games_owned": 1752, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1693868588}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel conflicted about this title. The primary reason for this is that I adore the team's prior game, Fran Bow, and thus I went in wanting more of the same. However, while Little Misfortune doesn\u2019t stray from the art style and tone of the team's first commercial release it does cut out the point-and-click puzzle gameplay which for me is disappointing.\n\nYou can clearly see a greater emphasis on polished and improved artwork, at least from a technical perspective, within the game in contrast to their prior game. The title has a \u201chand drawn\u201d photoshop look that is charming and lovely. It\u2019s wonderful that the developers are improving their craft overtime. With that said, I think there was a decent amount of charm loss despite technical improvement. The world and environments are simply more stale. The areas you explore feel small, less creative, and less inspired. This likely is tied to the fact that the main character is locked to either walking left or right, completely locked in a 2D plane, which completely undermines any sense of exploration within the world.\n\nThe game feels self indulgence, giving the developer an excuse to paint, animate, and design all day, which is clearly what they love to do. However, it comes at the cost of them not putting their players first. It\u2019s like the gameplay developers just left and all that remained were the artists. There needs to be a balance between interesting gameplay elements and lovely artwork. Sadly, this one leans way too far in the artwork direction. It feels like this would just have been better as an animated short but I\u2019m not sure that would have been as profitable.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend Little Misfortune unfortunately. Without the comparison to their prior title, I might have found it okay, but the reality is I wanted more of what Killmonday Games initially created as it was stellar. However, I\u2019m hopeful that the studio will continue to produce great games. This one is cute, has wonderful art, but lacks soul and only contains the tiniest shred of interactivity required to pass as a game which killed it for me.", "timestamp_created": 1693880693, "timestamp_updated": 1693880693, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619047820568084717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145640927": {"recommendationid": "145640927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162918861", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1693820156}, "language": "english", "review": "Benjamin my beloved <3", "timestamp_created": 1693814072, "timestamp_updated": 1693814072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145634759": {"recommendationid": "145634759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800689793", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 334, "last_played": 1693801344}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute little dark story, it's so tragic...

While I do the voice acting of the narrator, MMisfortunes voice is so obnoxious, it gave me a headache.\n\nStory:\nYou play as a little girl called Misfortune who is, well, very unfortunate but trys to play the narrators game to get eternal happiness for her mother. The story itself is quite boring and it is pretty obvious who is actually the bad guy here. Overall fart, puke and gross humor is very overused and becomes very annoying after the first ten minutes. Also it is really tiring to play as Misfortune as she is just as obnoxious as her voice.\n\nGameplay:\nThere isn't really any game play.

The result is a comical point and click adventure that leaves you a bit torn between feeling concerned for her and curious at what exactly is going on since some of the events blur the lines between fantasy and reality.\n\nThere isn't actually much gameplay involved as you're just interacting with things and listening to dialogue for most of the game with occasional A or B choices that just leave room for 1 extra run through if you want to see the alternative events - though nothing that significantly changes the story - though there is a special ending if you achieve a certain goal.\n\nPoints for originality, but I get the feeling they could have just made an animated feature and gotten the same result.", "timestamp_created": 1690294979, "timestamp_updated": 1690294979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142765258": {"recommendationid": "142765258", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123798550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1690244070}, "language": "english", "review": "I would definitely recommend.

Fran Bow universe once again. Thank you for the game! I absolutely recommend it to whoever is reading it.\n\nHowever, there are things I didn\u2019t enjoy. I\u2019ll mark them as a spoiler to not ruin the gain experience.\n\n[spoiler]\nThe game is boring to replay, though the game implies many times that you would want to replay it. Here\u2019s what I mean:\n\n1. Not meeting the expectations:\nOne you go through the game for the first time, Mr. Voice implies several times that you could do a different choice. This gives an expectation that the game won\u2019t end on the first play-through. However, when you replay the game, you almost don\u2019t get anything new.\n\nThe best example is when you feed the fish to the bird. In the first run the voice said 2 times that I could feed the fish to the drunk bird. You expect that if you do it next time you will get a new part of the story, but all that happens is that the bird eats the fish.\n\nOr even a better one. That question from the voice\u00a0\u2014 \u201chave you heard this question again?\u201d The voice didn\u2019t react at all when he heard \u201cyes.\u201d You\u2019d expect some fourth wall breaking here or at least some confusion from the voice.\n\nHow cool would it be if your actions were more important for the game plot. Maybe with more endings, or just adding fun details to the ending. Like, you enter the hamster club, and then in the end they help you escape the house or something.\n\n2. Dialogs are too long. On the second play-through you already know every line of the dialogue. And skipping them is long. And then you skip-skip-skip and unintentionally start the dialogue again.\n\n3. The true ending is not satisfying. It\u2019s beautiful, and it would be fine if the second play-through was fun. But you repeat the same actions trying to find stuff you forgot to sprinkle, and get extra 20 seconds of the video. Like, I\u2019ve spent an hour to go through the game again and that\u2019s it?\n\n[/spoiler]\n\nIn the end, just want to repeat that the game is really great. I super enjoyed the first play-through.

The voice takes her around the town she lives as weird and spooky things happen throughout her adventure. It is up to the player to guide her on her journey to help her make the choices that lead to the best consequences for the little lady. Themes of depression, abuse, and death are abound but Misfortune keeps a happy attitude about it all, lightening the oppressive nature of the topics within.\n\nAll in all not a bad game but not one I can justify the full $20 asking price for. The game is mixture of too short, too mechanically simple, and lacks enough replay-ability for full price in my opinion. It took me seven hours to get all the achievements because I missed something my first playthrough, perfected my second, and tried for a negative ending on a third only to find there wasn't one. I got this game for about $7 in a sale and I'm fine with that number. Misfortune herself is a very interesting character and the story is good (not great) due to a lack of time and ability to really go in depth with anything. I may sound harsh towards this game but only because of the great potential it has that could have been expanded upon. Overall I suggest picking this up if you find it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1689294440, "timestamp_updated": 1689294440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142025162": {"recommendationid": "142025162", "author": {"steamid": "76561199358450985", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1690250733}, "language": "english", "review": "Yikes forever <3", "timestamp_created": 1689293652, "timestamp_updated": 1689293652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142008347": {"recommendationid": "142008347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261150915", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 395, "last_played": 1689222820}, "language": "english", "review": "An interesting story if you stick with it.

I found it a little too dark and distasteful. I usually appreciate dark humour, but this one is not very comedic and rather gratuitously tragic. For example *spoiler alert* early in the game Misfortune steps on doggy doo and throws up because of it, then a dog licks the puddle of sick *end of spoiler*. None of this moves the narrative forward or helps flesh out the character, it's just... potty humour I guess? But not a particularly sharp or clever one, just one that revels in bodily excretions.\n\nThe narrative is a bit inconsistent too, your choices in the game don't seem to matter too much. For example, *spoiler alert* there's a turning point early in the game where you have to choose wether you're going to tell George about losing his dog, but George was dead all along so it didn't really matter whether you decided to tell him or not *end of spoiler*.\n\nIf you're looking for a cutesy game that still appeals to grown up sensibilities I'd say this is not it. Any cuteness is undercut but deep, dark gratuitous tragedy. The artwork makes it seems like it's going to be just a bit mysterious, but in reality is much more gruesome.\n\nSome things I loved about this game are the character design and the artwork. They are really beautiful. Another great thing about the game is that it has voices!

Despite being a short game, it also feels like it plays too slowly. The shortness could be justified, if it had any real replayability value filled with new experiences..\nThe story is nothing worth mentioning, besides being really simple and I suppose they didn't focus on making one either, rather focusing on the dialogue, which is incredibly samey samey. There are some moments of juvenile innocence when she talks about things adults may be more knowledgeable about that stick but that's it. Perhaps it's because I've played multiple narrator games in the past and expect more now. It is definitely a game that appeals to people less familiar with \"what's out there\" more.\nI can't get rid of the feeling it's a case of \"making the game longer than 2h so it can't be refunded\", which frankly is an unfortunate aspect that has to be considered at times. 20 bucks is too much, especially knowing other narrator games, bigger, cheaper - and since this game tries itself at humour - funnier, that don't limit the speed at which you play. Do not that there are no challenges, puzzles and/or alike, everything is spoonfed, interaction icons popping up (you can only go left and right and not miss anything). Not saying that it had to have things like these, but if it's lacking demanding aspects, it should make up for it. I bought this game because I saw some dialogue/events in YouTube shorts - to think the ones I saw were the only \"good\" ones was pretty disappointing, also considering the other moments were basically the same, but a bit worse.\n\nIt sounds like I'm pretty harsh on the game, but I felt like elaborating on these aspects, since I'm already here writing a negative review.

That felt rather unnecessary.\n\nThe visuals are pretty, the voice acting is good, and there is some fun to be had, but don't expect too much from it and don't pay the whole $20 sticker price, get it on a sale or in a bundle.\n\nOverall I can't recommend the game due to the shortcomings.", "timestamp_created": 1685536972, "timestamp_updated": 1685536972, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498257845640182495", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139307572": {"recommendationid": "139307572", "author": {"steamid": "76561199443473082", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1685521764}, "language": "english", "review": "YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS FOR GOD SAKE IT HURTS ALOT!!!!!!\nsuch an innocent child, would love to play it again~", "timestamp_created": 1685522729, "timestamp_updated": 1685522729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139298321": {"recommendationid": "139298321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054068147", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1675324504}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this game far more than I expected.

Nothing was per say rushed or dragged out too long. You felt like you got just enough time on it!\n- Likeable characters. Missfortune is a cute, sassy child with a pure view of the world. She has some great one liners which made me chuckle and some more iconic ones like \"Yikes forever!\". Even Morgo is likeable just by his voice alone. \n- Unique artstyle and great music!\n- A nice touch with some minor minigames like \"Whack the fox\" and \"dance battle\"! Made the gameplay more fun (especially since most of it is just walking and interacting).\n- Achievements were also pretty easy to get, which is sometimes for games like these nice. \n\nThe less good:\n- Some game mechanics. I was playing with mouse and keyboard for example and I could only sprint when constanly clicking left click. Then I also was not able to sprint using my keyboard at all so it would've been better if I could do do that. Also maybe just holding the keybind so I wouldn't have to constanly click myself forward. \n- When doing my second run for achievements, it was a tad annoying to not be able to skip dialogue effectively or at some points not at all.

loves to read all the information that I can, I love that this game encourages you to look at/interact with everything there is the option to in order to collect all of the achievements, although I can't believe I only managed 16/35 on my first play through! at some point, I'll have to replay and attempt to finish off the list, but unfortunately I'm not especially hooked in to replay it immediately as I'm sure the storyline remains practically the same even if you make different choices. in conclusion, I paid ~\u00a35 for this in the spring sale and don't regret it in the slightest,

None of your choices matter, and replayability is forced for achievement hunting and nothing more.

You control the choices of a small character named Misfortune, who is blissfully unaware that she will be meeting her demise in the final chapter. Though the graphics are reminiscent of a children's picture book, the story-telling is anything but that. \n\nAs you progress through the game, you begin to realise that there are much darker themes at play, cloaked by the whimsy of childlike innocence. The game shines a light on real-world tragedies, including murder, suicide, death, drug abuse, and childhood trauma.\n\nDespite these heavy themes, \"Little Misfortune\" manages to maintain a whimsical and childlike atmosphere throughout. The other characters, along with Misfortune, are endearing and charming, with quirky personalities and humorous dialogue. \n\nSo, if you're looking for a game that offers a unique and thought-provoking experience, while still maintaining a childlike sense of wonder, \"Little Misfortune\" is definitely worth checking out.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1679454256, "timestamp_updated": 1679454256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559720456600189209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135131818": {"recommendationid": "135131818", "author": {"steamid": "76561199251017172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1211, "last_played": 1679444488}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1679444027, "timestamp_updated": 1679444027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135131650": {"recommendationid": "135131650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053957313", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1679443658}, "language": "english", "review": "FANCY!", "timestamp_created": 1679443797, "timestamp_updated": 1679443797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135128972": {"recommendationid": "135128972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023199807", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1679439155}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool artstyle and great voice acting!

She, as a main protagonist, seems to be a very cute child, however the way she speaks or interacts with everything exposes a lot of adult influence, which not always might be so polite and colourful as expected from a child. However this is a positive sort of a thing, which makes everything seem to be more real - where not everybody are perfect, where good and evil are mixed up together, while morality may be as well very symbolic, depending on who is the judge and what sort of a choices are being made.\n\nThis simple click point game, offers us not only a choices or a specific story-line - it's a fictional world filled up with many interactive points, additional mini games and very individual ways of changes to be made (connected to certain achievements, sic!) in dialogues or more visual things. It depends on us the players if during the game we want our character to remain as more innocent and positive one, or if we want to expose through it more adult-like perspective on certain events. The entire gameplay should be about 2h long, however if you are this type of a person that enjoys exploration or achievement mastering - then oh well, you might end up stuck withing this game for at least 8+ hours. \n\nIn my case - as a clumsy girl gamer - I had spend about 30h in it, re-doing some bits of this game, unveiling everything I possibly could and unlocking the main in my opinion achievement (eternal happiness) at the very, very end. I am absolutely delighted, entertained enough and even interested in more similar works made by the publishers of this title.\n\nIf you decide to spend any penny on Little Misfortune - feel fortunate to enter the realm, where not everything seems to be as it is.

It's filled with dark humour and topics, but also has some little silly things, such as the glitter throwing and Misfortune's fart jokes. It has an unique artstyle and it's very pretty to look at.\n\nDespite the fact that I had already watched a full playthrough of this game several times, it gripped me from my heartstrings and got me to shed a few tears.

Is this game... a joke? It certainly [i] has [/i] a lot of jokes, many of which are thoroughly unfunny, I know that much... but what I want to know is, how and why did KillMonday go from an awesomely creepy point and click adventure game full of incredible imagination and intrigue (Fran Bow) to... a walking simulator about a girly fart machine? Pardon my bluntness, but seriously, aside from the climax, that's basically all I see this game as. Okay, there aren't that many fart jokes, but most of the jokes are still on the [i] level [/i] of a fart joke. I mean, for crying out loud, there's a POOP joke! ...Also a pee joke now that I think about it, but that one was less graphic. I guess if that kind of humor is your jam, then this game is probably right up your alley. But for me, I found myself cringing most of the time. And the gameplay really didn't save it... I don't have anything against walking simulators, but the point of them is for you to take in the scenery and the story, right? It's a game that doesn't rely on gameplay, basically. Well, that should sum up why the gameplay doesn't save Little Misfortune, then. Because it IS basically a walking simulator--I don't care if it's tagged with Point & Click on the store page--interactivity beyond walking is [i] very [/i] minimal.\n\nNow, I will admit that the climax is quite cool, and started to make me finally feel genuinely invested. Thing is, the moment stuff finally starts getting interesting is the moment the game ends. Talk about a tease. Torture me with toilet humor for three hours, then give me thirty minutes of the imagination and intrigue I loved from Fran Bow, and then just... end?? Ugh. Could you be [i] any [/i] more frustrating!??\n\n...It's not an awful game... there's clearly effort put into it, and quality in certain regards... again, if you like grossout (and macabre) humor, you'll probably enjoy this game. I don't mind macabre humor by the way--I haven't mentioned that yet I guess... there's a decent amount of that in here too. I just didn't mention it because I don't feel much towards it one way or the other.

Truth be told, Little Misfortune is nowhere near as intricate, challenging, or complex as Fran Bow is, in the slightest. The graphics were cute and unsettling at times, the plot was worth following to reveal the truth, and the journey was generally enjoyable. However, the pace was extremely slow, the environments provided minimal interactions, and it felt pretty one dimensional. The choice-oriented approach kept things interesting, but even that aspect of the game could have been improved upon. [spoiler] Especially considering the only true way to influence the ending is to sprinkle your glitter in every possible place, rather than make fate-altering choices. [/spoiler] To me, it felt like a children's game with periodic crude adult humor/imagery. I'm hoping this was a time filler to keep fans satisfied while waiting for a Fran Bow sequel, otherwise the devs truly set their fans up for disappointment having us transition from the masterpiece Fran Bow to the \"just good\" Little Misfortune. [spoiler] One thing I did truly appreciate were the appearances of Fran Bow characters and the reveal that they are in the same universe. This gives me hope that Fran Bow may make a return.

Even the choices it has you make doesn't really alter much of the story at all. If you're looking for Fran bow or a similar feel, this is NOT it. (Apart from the few Fran bow Easter egg characters that appear near the end.) There are no puzzles, there is nothing to figure out, it is all move and click things to get more story details. If you don't care about achievements, it really is a just move forward and read kind of game. With a few easy mini games here and there. \n\nDont get me wrong, the story is really nicely written with some added humor in there. But I would be lying if I said it wasn't predictable. I feel a lot of the story was easy to pick up on and even the twist at the end wasn't much of a twist. (to me at least). Though I still enjoyed the story as it does intertwine with Fran bow and that universe. \n\nFor me I don't recommend this. It may be good for someone that enjoys a good story that you can make some choices in. If you're looking for something to play with puzzles, this is not it. \n\nWait for it to go on sale, regardless if its something up your ally or not- i wouldn't pay full price. \n", "timestamp_created": 1674093937, "timestamp_updated": 1674093937, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474308311939239502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131116612": {"recommendationid": "131116612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296638542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1674087281}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game took me 5 hours to beat and get all achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1674087393, "timestamp_updated": 1674159076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131112545": {"recommendationid": "131112545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121346525", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1673648641}, "language": "english", "review": "Just perfect \ud83d\udc4c", "timestamp_created": 1674081296, "timestamp_updated": 1674081296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131074450": {"recommendationid": "131074450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422850263", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1674016909}, "language": "english", "review": "Hilarious.

Because my feelings on this game are so mixed. (For reference, I've never played Fran Bow, so I was a newcomer to the characters and universe.)\n\nSome spoilers ahead.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n-Design-\n\nEveryone's already commented on the great design. In particular, Little Misfortune's character design reminds me vaguely of Madeline from the PBS channel mixed with Isabella from Phineas and Ferb, but dark, whimsical version.\n\nThe atmosphere is very cool. The versions of each setting are neat. It's got a wonderful confusing effect that also serves the plot.\n\n-Voice Acting-\n\nI adore the voice acting all around. For both main characters.\n\nIt's SO tough to choose a little girl voice that isn't horribly grating, and I feel like the voice actor nailed that space between too exaggerated and too boring. I even found myself enjoying the silly catchphrases because the voice is so darn cute. The sayings felt really true to Little Misfortune's character and situation. \n\nThe ratio of original dialogue to catchphrases is a bit off, as others have said, but overall I didn't mind the catchphrases and felt they added character.\n\n-Themes-\n\nI love the themes the game tackles. It felt like a really sympathetic, realistic portrayal of child ab*se and neglect and how an optimistic, thoughtful kid would react to that environment.\n\nI greatly enjoyed throwing glitter all over everything and keeping the magic alive for Little (I'm sorry, LADY) Misfortune as she made her brave journey. \n\n-SPECIFIC SCENES-\n\nI may have cried at the turning point in the plot. But that's partially because after hours of meh gameplay, the sudden emotionality really threw me for a loop.\n\nAlso a big fan of the knock, knock, knock sequence, though the suspense was short lived. It felt immersive.\n\nThe ghost children and the train platform were spooky and unnerving in a good way. The mask people made me nervous. The unresolved what-the-heck-happened-to-her-ghost-friend left me wanting more.\n\nI would've loved to see that higher stakes and narrative tension sprinkled throughout the game.\n\nTHE BAD\n\n-The Ick Factor-\n\nMultiple reviewers have already commented on the uncomfortable s*xualization of an 8-year-old character. I wholeheartedly agree. \n\nIt wasn't a problem for me when it was about the bleak world-building. That makes sense. \n\nIt became a problem when it was directed at Little Misfortune herself. She may be a fancy little lady at heart, but she's still not a REAL lady. Also, she's been through enough, dang it. Leave the poor girl alone.\n\nThe climbing-through-the-window farting scene and the carousel scene were especially egregious and made me want to quit the game. It was nasty and added nothing of value. \n\n-Some of the Adult Jokes-\n\nOccasionally the adult stuff was plain stupid, like the hamster strip club. Why? What does that really add? It was trying too hard for me.\n\nPeople have also called out the period scene and the crush on the fox. I'm more neutral on those, since they feel relevant to the story and themes.\n\nThe whole point is her mother got trapped into an abusive life she hated because she got pregnant as a teenager, right? And that's realistically a fate that could await a teenage Little Misfortune too? But still, the period dialogue was sloppy and jarring, which made it pointless because it didn't land.\n\nShe's also 8 and very emotionally young, nowhere close to 17 or whatever age her mom was. So it's a stretch if that's what that was supposed to be.\n\nEverything was so hit and miss. Mommy \"hugging\" strangers in the alley -- super sad, and also necessary to paint a grim picture of her world. Random swearing? Eh. Sometimes it worked for me, sometimes it didn't. \n\nI feel like overall, the dialogue could've benefited from some editing.\n\n-The Ending-\n\nThe ending -- if you can call it that -- made the game almost pointless for me. There was next to no payoff. And it also makes the pricetag not worth it for me.\n\nNo resolution with the main antagonist. No resolution with the mom, if you don't get the right ending. No resolution with the fox. (I am glad tree branch doggy was there, though.)\n\nI didn't even understand what happened, to the point I wondered if I was supposed to walk backwards through the fog or make a critical choice before the fog.\n\nI missed 2 glitter opportunities, so I didn't unlock the real ending. And without the real ending, the story randomly stops. I had to YouTube it to figure out if I messed up or if I was missing alternative endings.\n\nThe real ending is somewhat more satisfying, but it could've used more screentime. It felt very rushed. The mother crying scene is by far the best part, and then it fizzles into nothing.\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTS\n\nI don't know. If you really love narrative games with nice design, and you play this genre regularly, there are some great moments in here. Especially if you love strong characters with a great personality like Little Misfortune. She is truly the fanciest of little ladies and also way cooler and tougher than me.\n\nIf the themes speak to you, or you like morbid humor -- the pinata joke made me sad laugh -- then it's worth a play.\n\nI would only recommend grabbing it on sale, though, especially since there's no replay value.", "timestamp_created": 1673334533, "timestamp_updated": 1673334533, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130540947": {"recommendationid": "130540947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053494372", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1673317257}, "language": "english", "review": "Fancy", "timestamp_created": 1673317503, "timestamp_updated": 1673317503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130529701": {"recommendationid": "130529701", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997747431", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 166, "last_played": 1673301778}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game!

The farts were funny though.\n\nAs far as \"improvements\" I do wish there were options for your journey to end early, like a quick time dodge event while rocks are falling and such.

I liked this game, you immediately feel sorry for Misfortune, and the story is compelling enough to get you through the game, BUT I think it fell a little short in some parts, and it's not for everybody.\n\nI'm particularly disappointed by the ending, not because it was a bad one, but because it's only ONE. I played the game 3 times to get all the achievements and cinematics (you can get them all in 1 run if you follow a guide, also the game is short -like 2 hours- so it's not tedious), each time choosing different actions and responses but found out that doing things differently only shows you a slight variation in the events or dialogues that don't really matter in the end, so it's just an illusion of choice which is something I personally don't like (and I guess that's part of the theme of the game), but it's still entertaining to see what happens with each choice in the moment.\n\nOther than that, I really like the art and voice acting.

This game is dark which is exactly what i wanted. The narrative isn't completely mind blowing, but its nice & well crafted, it drives home the points & characters it creates.\n\nMy first play through took roughly three hours, i was really taking my time, trying to do the most i could. I did a second run to get achievements, took me roughly two hours. It kind of killed me. This game is story based, like, entirely story based. The replay value isn't very strong because of that. I do love the story & it pulls my heart strings, but i'd be lying if i wasn't bored during my second playthrough (there was roughly two weeks between these completions). In my second playthrough i also tried how much of a difference my decisions actually made: aside from key moments, the game had a tendency to circle around back to the narrative that needed to continue (you could say no, but you eventually needed to say yes to continue). This is not a problem for me though, since from a writer's point of view its very understandable. \n\nLittle Missfortune has little to no actual game play, its very much a point & click adventure where you make the most difference with your decisions. The atmosphere is nice, at some points i just felt like there weren't any stakes at play. When i was supposed to hurry & make a decision i was calmly clicking around because i knew i wasn't gonna get punished for it. In a way this game reminds me of a visual novel, something like Doki Doki Literature Club. \n\nThe art is absolutely fantastic. I feel like the visuals carry a lot of this game & make up for the parts that were lacking. \n\nIf you want a heartbreaking narrative of a little girl struggling to cope in her situation with beautiful artwork & a lot of dialogue, this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1672233471, "timestamp_updated": 1672233471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129483973": {"recommendationid": "129483973", "author": {"steamid": "76561199174963064", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 467, "last_played": 1690329245}, "language": "spanish", "review": "que lindo juegoo:3", "timestamp_created": 1672197901, "timestamp_updated": 1672197901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129447881": {"recommendationid": "129447881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120397021", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1671873760}, "language": "english", "review": "nice art style, dark humour, overall made me depressed but laughed about it. 10/10 buy it *:\uff65\uff9f\u2727", "timestamp_created": 1672164551, "timestamp_updated": 1672164551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129441306": {"recommendationid": "129441306", "author": {"steamid": "76561199204789168", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1640010524}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game, fancy!\n", "timestamp_created": 1672159077, "timestamp_updated": 1672159077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129423007": {"recommendationid": "129423007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343015742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1671997525}, "language": "spanish", "review": "con misfortune aprendes ser furro y echarle brillantina a todo lo que se mueve.\n\nEn eso, la narrativa es muy buena, buen juego para pasar el rato tomando un cafecito mientras te desembarcas en una aventura inolvidable por su final bastante enorme, juego de duracion de 2~3 horas pero con un ending que va a durar toda la pega, lo recomiendo.\n\n  _      _      _\n>(.)__ <(.)__ =(.)__\n (___/  (___/  (___/  cuek", "timestamp_created": 1672143710, "timestamp_updated": 1672143710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129388840": {"recommendationid": "129388840", "author": {"steamid": "76561199009424520", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1672104403}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved how spontaneous and random the story is.

However, if you're looking for proper puzzles, multiple endings, a satisfying resolution or a brilliant twist, you may want to pass it by.\n\nLittle Misfortune was fun to play.  Gameplay is very simple, and although it's nominally a point-and-click, it's far more like a visual novel in the sense that you're just prompting the story forward rather than solving puzzles.  This didn't bother me, but would be a deal-breaker for some players.  There are choices which affect the story lightly in the moment but have no impact on the conclusion.  The character of Misfortune is brilliant; she has far more personality than most protagonists.  She attracts us to her with her many idiosyncrasies, rather than just reeling in our pity with her circumstances.\n\nOn completing the game, though, I didn't really feel satisfied.  One of the twists is already revealed to us at the beginning of the game, and the second is obvious from very early on.  \"It was all magic\" never washes with me as a resolution, and it makes the whole journey seem rather purposeless.  The game is very short, as if some later chapters that gave more explanation and a proper conclusion were just cut to save costs.  I also thought that the inclusion of the Fran Bow world was rather lazy; it didn't make much sense, and in fact, required the player to have previously played Fran Bow in order to make any sense at all!\n\nIt's a recommend from me, but not without caveats.  I'm glad I played it.  However, it really depends what sort of gameplay you're looking for.  I would also recommend buying on sale; the play time is much too short to justify the price, and there is little replay value.\n\nI look forward to more from these developers, but my suggestion would be for them to move away from the Fran Bow world and make a completely standalone game - one which has a worthwhile twist and resolution.  If a story is sold to us as a mystery, we need these elements in order to be satisfied.", "timestamp_created": 1669407231, "timestamp_updated": 1669407361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

This one is brilliantly voiced, the graphics are on point, and it's one of the rare games where I laughed out loud at the omnipresent dark humor.

If you like humor, emotional moments, and decision making, I invite you to delve into this review! \n\nThe game is presented to us as a classic point & click, where we must guide the little protagonist, Little Misfortune, on her journey in search of \"eternal happiness\". She, in turn, is guided not only by the player himself, who takes a role from beyond the fourth wall, but also by a mysterious narrator who advances the plot with a series of simple missions but that usually have in common a very predominant moral in the game: your actions have consequences. \n\nThroughout the game, we will be presented with moments where the aforementioned moral will apply, and we will have to choose between two options. At first they may seem unimportant or simply funny decisions, but as the mysterious narrator informs us, each choice will have its own consequence; either beneficial for our protagonist and those involved, or of course detrimental. \n\nAs our protagonist's adventure progresses, we will encounter certain mysteries and uncertainties regarding the story and its characters, more specifically with the narrator, Misfortune and an enigmatic little fox that we will chase in search of solving a series of questions: Is he a friend or an enemy, what is he trying to communicate to us, and even more importantly, can we pet him?\n\nThe game's visuals are beautiful and detailed. Its hand-drawn art is charming, and one of the game's standout features is that it gives it a traditional, picture-book look. The soundtrack features varied musical tracks that help set the mood of each situation. From happy and lively melodies to tense and somewhat gloomy ones.\n\nIt should be noted that the title has voice lines for almost all dialogue (except for a couple of characters), and of really good quality; something you don't see every day in an indie game, and which is one hundred percent appreciated. In conclusion, its audiovisual section is very well worked and gives a glimpse of the effort of the developers in that aspect, which is key for this type of video game genre. \n\nThe gameplay on the other hand is not hard at all. It's the classic gameplay of any point & click game. We can move from left to right and select objects, entities and other things to interact with them. As we perform these actions, Misfortune will share her thoughts with us, and usually the narrator will have something to say about it. Since it has such a simple gameplay style, which isn't a bad thing, anyone can play it and enjoy it without any problem; a big plus.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything so I'll only say it's a quirky, entertaining and interesting game. The tonal shifts from humorous to emotional, from gloomy to happy and so on, can keep you playing for quite a while, either out of curiosity or just plain fun. It's a short story that makes us think twice with each choice, as the outcome is usually different and affects the following options that will be presented to us.\n\nTo close this review, I would like to share with you that personally, I am not a big fan of this genre (I don't hate it, but I don't love it either), but I really enjoy indie games; and, since several people recommended it to me, I decided to give it a try to see what it was like. Undoubtedly, it is a game that entertained me throughout its story. As I have already mentioned, its audiovisual section is very captivating, and its voice acting is the finishing touch. \n\nAll in all, a game that anyone can pick up and enjoy, especially recommended for fans of point & click adventures, bittersweet stories and fluctuating humor!\n", "timestamp_created": 1666962068, "timestamp_updated": 1666962068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66869276762008667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124507844": {"recommendationid": "124507844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198992406383", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1666928444}, "language": "spanish", "review": "horrible y me encanta", "timestamp_created": 1666939606, "timestamp_updated": 1666939606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124507295": {"recommendationid": "124507295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067712055", "num_games_owned": 1000, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1666938604}, "language": "english", "review": "i got got, it got me, i thought i wouldn't be got, but i did get got", "timestamp_created": 1666938712, "timestamp_updated": 1666938712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124482505": {"recommendationid": "124482505", "author": {"steamid": "76561199001741099", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1666896728}, "language": "english", "review": "Super detailed and cute graphics mixed with a morbid tale!

Algunos m\u00e1s pr\u00f3ximos y otros m\u00e1s cercanos al final del juego que van cambiando partes de nuestra historia.\n\nEste juego nos va a llevar por una serie de emociones y luchas contra nosotros mismos para poder completar todas las pruebas que nos vayamos encontrando. Todo esto nos lo presenta a traves de varios personajes que iran cogiendo personalidad y protagonismo a lo largo de la historia, hasta que descubras quien es quien en este entramado de personajes, emociones, interacciones y consecuencias\n\nArte:\nSe presenta como un juego muy cuidado, dibujado a mano con mucha expresividad en los dise\u00f1os y en los fondos. Llegando a generar una atm\u00f3sfera completa, como ya pudimos ver en otros juegos de la misma compa\u00f1\u00eda como Fran Bow\n\nBanda sonora:\nRealmente no se si he estado muy metido en la idea visual y en la historia pero no he percibido una verdadera banda sonora a lo largo del tiempo que tienes el control del personaje. Pero la banda sonora ha cobrado un protagonismo brutal en las cinem\u00e1ticas del juego\n\nHistoria:\nIntentar\u00e9 contaros lo que me he podido sentir de la historia sin haceros spoilers. He podido ver un crecimiento muy notable del personaje protagonista. \n\nEmpieza la historia teniendo conflictos con su familia y mostrando todo de una manera realmente cruda (incluso algunas veces con un tono de humor negro) que te hace sentir empatia con el personaje y sentir todo lo que ha sentido. \n\nComo ya he dicho hay acciones que conllevan repercusiones que iremos viendo a lo largo del juego.\n\nGameplay:\nNos presenta un juego b\u00e1sicamente de desplazamiento horizontal con eventos e interacciones. \nAl principio pens\u00e9 que vendr\u00eda mejor una interfaz de \u201cApuntar y clic\u201d para ir indagando en todos los secretos del juego pero mientras vas avanzando, puedes ver que han elegido bien ya que no necesitamos m\u00e1s. Encaja perfectamente.\n\nValor por dinero:\nQuiz\u00e1s sea lo \u00fanico que flaquea el juego. Ahora mismo est\u00e1 aproximadamente a 17 \u20ac lo que hace que est\u00e9 un poco caro para el tiempo de juego que le he dedicado (aproximadamente unas 5 horas). Aunque creo que aun me falta otra ruta de juego, por lo que puedo ver en los logros\n\nEsperaros a una oferta porque el juego realmente vale la pena.\n", "timestamp_created": 1666556346, "timestamp_updated": 1666556346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124289845": {"recommendationid": "124289845", "author": {"steamid": "76561199411210581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1687458777}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un videojuego que recomiendo si os gusta la fantas\u00eda siniestra\n", "timestamp_created": 1666551853, "timestamp_updated": 1666551853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124285432": {"recommendationid": "124285432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418493762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1666546034}, "language": "english", "review": "loved it", "timestamp_created": 1666546226, "timestamp_updated": 1666546226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51282048225402832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124243647": {"recommendationid": "124243647", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998848114", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 456, "last_played": 1656200559}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite short, and not all that interactive or tricky.

The artwork is beautiful and haunting, and the voice acting really fits the characters.  The game is a linear story, with point-and-click interaction, although there are some path-altering choices to make along the way, which give the game some replayability if you want to get all the achievements.\n\nThe problem I had with the game (trying not give spoilers) is all the sex and drug references, as well as all the swearing from the 8-year-old girl, Little Misfortune.  As I said earlier, if I had known about this to start with it would have put me off buying it.  The game would work just as well if they just left out the swearing.  She is a \u201clittle lady\u201d after all.    If you don\u2019t mind this/or even enjoy it, then the story is worth the time.

If you're not, you might struggle to get through it. There's a lot of TW topics in this game and it's unapologetic about it, including violence, substance abuse, and self-harm so do be conscientious of this when buying it if that's something that could upset you. The game itself is really good and I enjoyed the little adventure despite how sad it really was.\n\nThe game is short and far from sweet, and you're left wondering about this lil' lady and the tragedy that is her life.\n\nI wasn't a huge fan of some of the mechanics of the game, specifically having to skip through conversations - using space bar was a nightmare as it sometimes restarted the conversation and you'd have to spam the key to move on and JFC the amount of times I kept doing this was infuriating. A simple fix would be for me to slow down, but I feel like a skip-button would have been good here. The graphics are different but still very pretty. The narrator was excellent and actually made the whole game feel like you were having a book read to you. Overall the voice-overs were very pleasing and added to the feel of the entire game.\n\nOverall a good game and very entertaining. My favourite part was Benjamin describing the way he feels about Misfortune in his little diary. So weird, so amusing.\n\nIf you are an achievement hunter, I HIGHLY suggest you use a guide to avoid having to speed run the game a second time. Most games I wouldn't suggest to run the guide on your first play, but this game was quite annoying to get achievements for, specifically because you had to go through all of the dialogue etc. it was unexpectedly frustrating.\n\nI'd also suggest that if you're buying this game, you wait for there to be a sale.

Especially because of Fran Bow.\n\nThe graphics are good and the gameplay is fun and interesting. As some comments already mentioned tho, your choices don't really matter, even tho the games says they matter a lot. \nOnly choice that i recommend you to do is to take the fish with you. If you don't you miss out on 2 achievements. You don't get any achievement if you don't take the fish with you, so it's better if you take it with you.\nIt has some dark jokes, but they are quite dry and only make you chuckle at best.\nI wasn't able to feel sad or happy because of the characters. They felt too dry for me to sympathize with them, and the game ended too quickly as well for me to join in the feels.\n\nI don't regret buying it, even tho I mostly said bad things about the game so far.

The story that unfolds is not a happy one, but Misfortune's spirit and the overall quirkiness of the story (plus the fantastic graphics!!) sets a good balance to all the bad parts. More of an interactive story than a game; as you follow Little Misfortune, your engagement with the story has the air of talking back to your favorite Sesame Street character when you were four years old. The story is brief (2-3 hours it takes to finish). Still, the length seems fair since I feel like the style of gameplay would have started dragging if the story had gone on for too long. In my opinion, what makes everything work is the voice acting. I would have liked the game without it, but with it, Little Misfortune carved \"Happiness to everything!\" into my heart. Fancy!\n\nMy wife purchased Little Misfortune for herself, and I decided to play Killmonday Game's previous release Fran Bow first. Outside of both being set in the same universe, having some dark elements, and quirky graphics, they are two completely different games. I appreciate that I took the time to play Fran Bow first. While previous understanding of the universe both stories are set in is not necessary to enjoy Little Misfortune, I think knowing more details helped me better understand the story established during the brief 2-ish hour game. It also made me squee during the handful of cameos.\n\n[b]You might like Little Misfortune if:[/b] You like quirky dark modern fairytales.\n[b]You might not like Little Misfortune if:[/b] Stylized gore and dark fairytales are not your thing.\n[b]My favorite part:[/b] I now have new things to yell at speeders.\n[b]My least favorite part: /b] There is not a part 2 already.\n[b]Hours played as of review:[/b] 3\n[b]Completed?[/b] Yes\n[b]100%?[/b] Yes", "timestamp_created": 1663792762, "timestamp_updated": 1663940192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122593095": {"recommendationid": "122593095", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079514290", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1714, "last_played": 1663964485}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game. \n\nDespite all the glitter, this is a dark game, great history, slow but hypnotic and simply great. \n\nI can't tell you why, but it seems like it was made for me, everything I have to say is a spoiler, so I just want to say that I love how this game ends and how it builds up. \n\nBuy it, you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1663783580, "timestamp_updated": 1672806352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122590599": {"recommendationid": "122590599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058831359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1665917640}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely lovely.

I promise, you'll like it.]\n\n\nHonestly, an incredible little game. I can't wait to see more from them. I've also watched a whole playthrough of Fran Bow back in the days. I recommand them both, but Little Misfortune absolutely won my heart by its cuteness. \n\nThis enjoyable experience brings you : \n- A short involving story, one that you will want to re-do just to see the little \"consequences\" of your different actions. \n- A deeper (but not too deep nor hidden, let's keep things simple and enjoyable) story narrated from a child POV\n- A very neat art design with a main art style and an alternative one for the cutscenes and close-ups. It might not be for everyone but in my case, I loved it to bits. \n- A small bridge between Fran Bow and this game by placing a few references here and there (that won't stop you from understanding the game. Don't worry, those are just little eastereggs) that will definitely make Fran Bow's players smile\n- And more importantly : amazing voice actors and characters.\n\nI can't express enough how much I loved the character of Misfortune ; but firstly, let's talk about Mr.Voice. Mr.Voice's voice was just awesome. He was always on point and I actually loved to hear them both talk over everything. His personality was what you'd expect from him but it was efficient, and it got the job done. But Misfortune ? Misfortune was just perfect. The little laughs, the weirdness of an actual child, the tone, the personality, the way she'd say some words or the letter \"j\" sometimes. I don't know. It actually represented what a child is for me : a combination of raw honesty, innocence, selfishness and impulsivity. \n\nIn terms of negative points, I don't think there are any. \nThere are only two things I could discuss about : the character of Benji was a bit forgettable in my opinion eventhough it was an ok character but I think it might be because Mr.V and Misfortune were actually so well-written, that they kinda outshined the rest of the characters. This is probably on me. But still, I wanted more. And secondly, I was a tad disappointed by the last cinematic of the game and hoped for more than what was delivered. (Not the actual, actual last cinematic. More like the end of \"the game\" cinematic)\nBut apart from that.

It is an interactive fiction with small choices that might change a dialogue or minigame, but the story is otherwise entirely linear. Little Misfortune is similar to most interactive walking sims: trek around in a map, learn the lore through the character's commentary on certain items, play a couple of simplistic mini games, carry around items that are automatically used later down the line, all that stuff. The game mostly stands out for it's unique, hand-drawn, Burton-adjacent art style and the classic Killmonday themes of traumatised children who don't realise everything they have to say is horrifically morbid. \n\nOut of the two Killmonday games, I prefer Fran Bow for the overall darkness, scares, puzzles and visual creativity, however, Little Misfortune is clearly trying to take on a more charming and down to earth approach, and is successful in doing so! In this game you're supposed to feel a deep sympathy and love for Misfortune, a sweet 8 year old girl who sprinkles things with glitter and always has a smile despite the nuclear state of her family. The game didn't have any of the dark, gruesome metaphorical, surreal imagery that I was excepting after playing fran bow, but I still believe Little Misfortune was made with passion and hard work, which deserves my appreciation and respect for the creators.\n\nTLDR: This game is purely interactive fiction (no puzzles) and is much less horror-driven than Franbow but still a good standalone work of art and fiction!", "timestamp_created": 1661203419, "timestamp_updated": 1661203419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836463987827301025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121067680": {"recommendationid": "121067680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119370530", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1658939718}, "language": "english", "review": "schizo girl gets flipped off by a bird", "timestamp_created": 1661199110, "timestamp_updated": 1661199110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495495498180389404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121047541": {"recommendationid": "121047541", "author": {"steamid": "76561199106800007", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1671475833}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game\n", "timestamp_created": 1661169620, "timestamp_updated": 1661169620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121030155": {"recommendationid": "121030155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220018617", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1661133850}, "language": "english", "review": "Really wanted to like the game but the plot line, especially the ending is just very disappointing and deeply unsatisfying", "timestamp_created": 1661134223, "timestamp_updated": 1661134223, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528373241424560547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121019540": {"recommendationid": "121019540", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005719936", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1661185170}, "language": "english", "review": "bom.", "timestamp_created": 1661116971, "timestamp_updated": 1661116971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601998746395111084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120812139": {"recommendationid": "120812139", "author": {"steamid": "76561199272057911", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1682087542}, "language": "english", "review": "yadda yadda ...

Now, let\u2019s first go over the pros and cons of this game:\n\nPros:\nMusic in this game was nice and relaxing\nMisfortune is a cute character\nThe artstyle is great! \nThe voice acting is on point. I love the character voices.\n\nCons:\nThe choices\nThe ending\nThe overall story\nGameplay\n\nNow, I will speak on the story with spoilers below, but I will speak on gameplay first. If you ever played Fran Bow, which is in the same universe as Little Misfortune if I\u2019m not mistaken, then you know that the game had puzzles to it. You would have to find items and use them on characters to progress through the story and you could swap between the different realities to meet certain characters or gain certain items. In Little Misfortune, there was really not a lot of interactive sections like in Fran Bow. You could look around and examine items around you and listen to Misfortune\u2019s dialogue, but not many puzzles which can make gameplay feel repetitive and bland. I feel like this game would have been more fun had there been more puzzles and interesting choices to make which I\u2019ll touch on now.\n\nThe choices in this game do not matter. My biggest problem with this game is the illusion of choice. The game wants you to believe that your choices matter and that they will have a big impact on the story. In the beginning of the game they literally tell you that a choice you make is very very important but it isn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t change the story or affect your ending. There is only 1 thing that affects your ending but I\u2019ll speak on that in the spoilers section. However, I hate games that say you should be careful of your decisions but don\u2019t do anything with it. It just feels like a cheap aspect of the game to make it seem deeper than what it is.\n\nNow I\u2019ll discuss the story, but I will be sure to not spoil. The story is painfully predictable. I played with my sister and we easily guessed the story from the beginning. I will say that this game did a better job with understanding it\u2019s story than Fran Bow, but at the end I didn\u2019t feel satisfied. I felt like I spent 5 hours playing a game hoping to see what my choices led to only to be disappointed at the end with a predictable, cliche ending. Even looking over details of the story after the fact made me even more confused and ruined my experience. I really value a good story and a good experience and I feel like Misfortune missed the mark. \n\n\nNow I will speak on spoiler things such as the story from this point forward. DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON\u2019T WANT SPOILERS!\n\nThe story:\n\n[spoiler]Like I had guessed from the beginning of the game, Misfortune is dead the entire time. I was so disapointed because I feel like that is so cliche and overdone. Maybe if there was a twist on it I would have liked it more but nope. I hated this twist. Not only that, but I couldn\u2019t understand for the life of me why \u2018Mordo\u2019 the monster would continue playing a game with a girl who was already dead? And Benjamin is supposed to be a protector, BUT COULDN\u2019T EVEN PROTECT MISFORTUNE?! Also, there was no explanation of where Misfortune went at the end and I also had a problem with the \u2018true ending of this game.\u2019 There is no secret that Misfortune is being neglected by her parents. However, with the true ending, if you used your sparkles on every item you could (the only thing that matters mind you) then Misfortune\u2019s mother would receive \u2018Eternal Happiness\u2019 I just find the whole thing of receiving happiness after her own daughter passed to be such a terrible message. The body wasn\u2019t even moved off the road yet! I can sympathize with her mother being forced to marry an abusive man simply because she got pregnant, but she also greatly neglected her child and put her dangerous situations. I guess Misfortune\u2019s mom\u2019s only way to true happiness was to have her daughter get run over by her abusive husband. I guess she is free to live her life now. Sorry, rant over.[/spoiler]\n\nI really really wanted to love this game. I had seen the trailers and I was so excited to play. I waited for reviews to come out and saw that a lot of people liked it! But I was so disappointed. This game is surface-level at best. It looks nice from the outside but it doesn\u2019t have depth. I wouldn\u2019t replay this game if I hadn\u2019t gotten the true end the first time. I was bored looking at items and only listening to dialogue. I was so deeply disappointed by the ending and I feel like this game is a pass. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend this game unless you got it on a massive sale. If you don\u2019t care for good stories and branching paths then give it a go, but if you\u2019re like me and enjoy games like Heavy Rain or the Anthology Series where your choices actually matter and can lead to interesting story branches and endings, then skip this one. I mean no hate to the developers of this game but I feel like they could have used their great talents to make a truly developed game. \n\n Misfortune didn\u2019t give what it was supposed to have gave. \n\n4/10 Would not play again. \n", "timestamp_created": 1660439263, "timestamp_updated": 1660439263, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602464616298675537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120509358": {"recommendationid": "120509358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280395616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1654995124}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2728Yikes forever\u2728\n", "timestamp_created": 1660326918, "timestamp_updated": 1660326918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78799670934677124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120474437": {"recommendationid": "120474437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880468063", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1660270692}, "language": "spanish", "review": "S\u00f3lo un presente que se mira con inocencia, ilusi\u00f3n y mucha purpurina", "timestamp_created": 1660270964, "timestamp_updated": 1660270964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120426234": {"recommendationid": "120426234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869789048", "num_games_owned": 1711, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1660191031}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are the kind of person that spends 15 bucks on a movie ticket to cry for a sec, go for it.

The artwork, the sound, the whole atmosphere is exceptional. For me, at least, it has enough sarcasm to make it funny, even though it's a grim story.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and linear, but it works. After doing the first run, I've played it again, choosing all the alternative options (as far as I could remember). On the third run, I've checked some guides to get the remaining achievements. All in all, the whole three runs took me about 11 hours. Would I play it again? I think not. Did I get bored playing three times almost the same game? No, there are little things that you discover each run. There are games that I wouldn't want to play them again, most of them are too tedious, too much investment for too little extra, this one was entertaining. \n\nIt's not a perfect game by any means:\n- as far as I could observe, all the Q&A with Mr. Voice are useless, there is no change whatsoever in the story line;\n- the alternative actions do add to the fun, but most of them* don't change any future scenarios (*except for the fish and the dog), they don't really change the end game, there's no alternative ending based on any of the decisions you make.\nFrom one perspective, I guess it works for this fatidic story: no matter what you do, you can't change your fate, you can't change the end game. Still, I just find it odd to put our minds to work to decide on something that has no value, that's [i]unfortunate[/i].\n- Steam Cloud doesn't work on GNU/Linux.\n\nI've bought the whole Fancy Edition on sale, and I think it was worth all the money:\n- great visuals, great sound, nice story;\n- there is some replay value, just enough to push the game time around 10 hours (about three hours per run);\n- no 3rd party EULA where you accept to sell your soul to the devil, just because game companies want to gather and/or sell your data; game companies should be making and selling games, not gathering and/or selling users' data. The Steam EULA covers most problematic cases a company needs;\n- native support for GNU/Linux;\n- Steam Cloud (there is a bug with Steam Cloud saves on GNU/Linux, unfortunately, better run with Proton for playing on multiple machines).\n\nTo wrap it up, I think this is one of the nicest games I've ever played. With all its caveats, I still recommend it to everyone. There are lessons to be learned from any story, and this game story offers many subtle lessons.

However, some things fell pretty flat for me. The darker elements of the story are very on-the-nose (especially the main character's dialogue about her parents) I think it would have strongly benefited from more subtlety. The humour fell extremely flat for me (such as when the game interrupts the story to have the main child character fart for 10 seconds - just why?), and I really struggled with the pacing - it's verrryyy slow. Especially for a game meant to be replayed, there should really be more options to skip dialogue or just move faster in general. The child's voice acting is also *fine* but personally I found it pretty grating after not too long.\n\nAll that said, I didn't dislike this game as a whole, and I played it through twice. For $30 though, I don't know that I would recommend it, and I'm not sure why it has such a high price tag for pretty simple animation and gameplay, especially compared to other similar games.

I was not expecting this to be like a Fran Bow 2, but a little more gameplay would be nice.\nOne thing that was improved in Little Misfortune was the writing though, it was something that bugged me a bit in Fran Bow (seemed very simple/childish, or some translation issues) so I'm very happy they've improved on that.\nOverall this game was enjoyable, but I'll only recommend getting it on sale, because it is very short!", "timestamp_created": 1657952819, "timestamp_updated": 1657952819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118877724": {"recommendationid": "118877724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141531663", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1700737953}, "language": "english", "review": "good game good story but what made me laugh my a ss off was when she got HIGH", "timestamp_created": 1657929881, "timestamp_updated": 1657929881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118868422": {"recommendationid": "118868422", "author": {"steamid": "76561199215843808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1673386738}, "language": "english", "review": "shes just like Me fr", "timestamp_created": 1657914909, "timestamp_updated": 1657914909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118834277": {"recommendationid": "118834277", "author": {"steamid": "76561199045134892", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1658887968}, "language": "spanish", "review": "tiene una historia muy intrigante, es de mis juegos favoritos y entretiene bastante", "timestamp_created": 1657857954, "timestamp_updated": 1657857954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118832930": {"recommendationid": "118832930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198878226876", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 482, "last_played": 1617242401}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this because I watched a DazGames do a play through of it and I just fell in love with the concept.

Liked the art and atmosphere. Animated parts were funny and well-done. Story was interesting especially in retrospect. Mostly because of the ending. The other \"plot twist\" is pretty obvious relatively early in the game and foreshadowing for it kind of misses it mark. I liked the fox, even though he didn\u00b4t do much during most of the game. I guess the main villain was also ok. Didn\u00b4t mind the music. \n\nEverything else I pretty much hated. The main character voice-acting is just puzzling. I have no idea what they where going for, but it just doesn\u00b4t work. Dialogue clearly tries to be witty, but is mostly flat, boring and inconsequential. There also isn\u00b4t much to play. Basically you just walk forward and hit any action points while doing it. Only directions you can move are left and right, but mostly you just need to move in one direction. There isn\u00b4t really anything that requires much thinking and the game could basically play itself.\n\nTonally the game is all over the place. You get very serious adult themes like suicide, alcoholism, parental neglect, missing/dead children and next there are poop jokes and slapstick humor. I think the idea was to portray adult themes through innocent child\u00b4s perspective, but it just doesn\u00b4t work very well.\n\nCan\u00b4t really recommend this as a game.
