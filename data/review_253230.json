I unlock Bow Kid and remember that there's a file select so I go back in there and speedrun the game until I can get to the boss battle I so crave. Here's the thing about why this preface is important to the review: none of replaying it felt like a chore because \"uuugh, I've seen all this already, get on with it! where's the skip tutorial button? skip cutscene and get me to where I need to be\", I still found myself slowing down to appreciate the game and the characters within, even the character that I was SO excited to beat up was worth slowing down some just because even with that little bump, he's still such a fun character and worth every second I took to just enjoy. \nI'm also glad to say that beating the troublesome level the second time as Bow Kid went a lot smoother. I didn't need to do any grinding to make sure that I got the right bird to win and it was actually close this time, but it probably also helped that I went after an achievement the second time that was with the other bird that I imagine would lower the score greatly lol still convinced it's rigged in his favor\nThe only thing that changed from play through one and play through two was who I was playing as and I was still so excited to go through all the levels again, that's to say nothing of how fun it was the first time around. I'm planning to 100% both files too, only the best for those two. If redoing up until the bird boss battle went this smoothly, I can only imagine how much fun it will be to fully complete both games.", "timestamp_created": 1700720159, "timestamp_updated": 1700720159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151241896": {"recommendationid": "151241896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071205934", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2426, "last_played": 1573387687}, "language": "english", "review": "Platformer that gives me nostalgia for PS2 era, Also there's steam workshop for map and ability. \nDLC recommended : Nyakuza Metro & Seal the Deal for new map", "timestamp_created": 1700716004, "timestamp_updated": 1700716004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151237336": {"recommendationid": "151237336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171235553", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1139, "playtime_at_review": 1428, "last_played": 1700715249}, "language": "english", "review": "Hat kid does hat kid things in their hat kid world.

Funny, considering it's one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nA Hat in Time was one of the first games I bought on Steam, mainly because I had only really played the Switch version and I really wanted to try out the game's modding scene. Turns out, that was probably one of the best gaming decisions I have ever made.\n\nThe vanilla game was already amazing, I love games that focus heavily on characters and the fact nearly EVERYTHING is voice acted gives them so much life. Hat Kid also controls VERY well, the physics are somewhat floaty but you can do some absolutely insane platforming tricks, especially if you equip the no-bonk badge. You could probably spend hours just playing around in one of the game's major levels and figuring out new parkour tricks. Speaking of the levels, despite there being only a few main areas they never overstay their welcome and offer tons of exploration outside of the main objectives. The game just feels good to play, both aesthetically and mechanically.\n\nAnd then you open up the workshop.\n\nThis game was already a 10/10 from the start, but then they gave the community an easy way to make their own additions and it becomes a 20/10. The amount of insanely high-quality mods people have made for this game is absolutely mind-blowing, and has likely contributed the most to the amount of hours I've played A Hat in Time. The fact the modding tools are so easy to access also means it's much easier for new modders to join the scene, usually with cosmetic mods that allow the player to update their look. I definitely took the opportunity to make a few (okay, a LOT of) playable character mods, and while they are FAR from perfect it's still so cool to see them work in-game. I may not interact much with the bulk of the Hat in Time community, but you guys are awesome. You're the reason this game has endless content.\n\nThe amount of memories I have with this game are something I could never replace, whether from playing around in online party, creating playable characters that somehow eventually made me a moderator for a Youtuber, or just messing around with whatever new thing the modders created. Gears For Breakfast made a special game, one that has brought in so much creativity from developers and modders alike and one that I'll probably still be playing years from now.", "timestamp_created": 1698418578, "timestamp_updated": 1698418578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148971973": {"recommendationid": "148971973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198929227725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 151934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151934, "last_played": 1638050160}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the better games I played in my life", "timestamp_created": 1698408253, "timestamp_updated": 1698408253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148963904": {"recommendationid": "148963904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198976070241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1284, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1700463725}, "language": "english", "review": "Boop", "timestamp_created": 1698397153, "timestamp_updated": 1698397153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148958133": {"recommendationid": "148958133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198885175531", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1385, "last_played": 1698388104}, "language": "english", "review": "Child who wears funny hats gets pulled over by the mafia and looses time... whats better than that", "timestamp_created": 1698386483, "timestamp_updated": 1698386483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148938978": {"recommendationid": "148938978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198990823135", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1699715538}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing!

"review": "[h1] A Hat in Time: A Charming and Enjoyable Platformer [/h1]\n\nA Hat in Time, an indie 3D platformer initially funded through Kickstarter, made a successful debut on the Nintendo Switch. While the base game has been well-received on other platforms, the Switch version offers several reasons to dive into this charming title.\n\nFirstly, A Hat in Time is an excellent fit for the Switch, offering on-the-go gameplay. Its short, engaging levels cater to both quick sessions and longer playthroughs. The Joy-Con controllers work well with the gameplay, although the camera can be problematic, a common issue in 3D platformers.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch release includes the \"Seal the Deal\" DLC. This DLC introduces \"The Arctic Cruise,\" a new level set on a cruise ship run by seals and piloted by a walrus. While it adds to the game's content, some players might find it a bit short with only two acts before the final boss. Additionally, to access this level, you need to collect a substantial number of timepieces.\n\nThe DLC also brings \"Death Wish,\" a challenging mode with various demanding tasks. Completing these tasks earns Death Tokens, which are required to progress in \"The Arctic Cruise.\" While \"Death Wish\" is fun, some of the challenges are incredibly tough, leading to moments of frustration.\n\nOne issue with this DLC package is the integration of \"Death Wish\" with \"The Arctic Cruise.\" You can't continue in the cruise level without completing certain \"Death Wish\" challenges, which disrupts the game's flow. Given the difficulty of these challenges, some players might find this connection frustrating.\n\nA Hat in Time on the Switch does suffer from long loading times and significant framerate drops in certain sections, which can affect the gameplay experience. These issues may not be as pronounced on other platforms where the game has been released.\n\nIn summary, A Hat in Time remains a charming and enjoyable platformer. While the Nintendo Switch version adds value with the included DLC, some integration issues between the DLC and the base game, along with technical problems, slightly mar the experience. However, the game's delightful charm, engaging levels, and nostalgic 3D platforming make it a worthwhile addition to the Switch or Steamdeck library.", "timestamp_created": 1697617487, "timestamp_updated": 1697617487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557203352451324463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148425592": {"recommendationid": "148425592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314166566", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1697611405}, "language": "english", "review": "good mario clone", "timestamp_created": 1697615886, "timestamp_updated": 1697615886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148376049": {"recommendationid": "148376049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043918600", "num_games_owned": 946, "num_reviews": 218, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1697457848}, "language": "english", "review": "uunnnNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHH!!!!mCUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nbrarhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh BLARGGGGGGGGGGG UUUUUNNNNNHHHHHHHHHHH UNNNHHHH OH\nGODDDDDDDDDDDD NOT THE\nC-C-C-CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCUUUUUUUUUUUU\nUUUUUUUUUUU\nUUUUUUNNNNN\nNNNNNNNNNNNN\nNNNNNNNNNNNN\nNNNNYYYYYYYYY\nYYYYY!!!\nCUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY CUNNY\nME WANT CUNNY ME WANT CUNNY CUNNNY ME WANT ME WANT ME WANT LITTLE CUNNY ME\nCCCCUUUNNNN-NN-N-N-EEE HEHEHE HHEEIIIIYYYY BOBOBOBOBOBOBOBO UUUAAAGGHHH\nZOBOLA DE MATRE DE DOON DOON DEL LAHO BANO GO DANI OH LA GOUUUUAaaaaaaaaaAAAAHHhhhHHH\nAAAAAHHHHHHHH MALAOGOUGAAAAAAAAAAAA\nBWOOOOOOOOOOP\nughhhhhh... unnnnhhhh...\ngive me that sweet cu cu cu........................\n\nCUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nUGHHGHH GOOODODDDDDD SWEET CUNNY I WANT THAT... unnnhh...

"language": "english", "review": "My score for this one is 6.5/10. If I could give a middle thumb, then I would. \n\nI'm really torn on this game. I really liked it, and recommend it to others. Especially if you like more tech based platformers. Although, it does also have some flaws that really drag the game down for me. \n\nIt's a cute game that wears its inspirations on its sleeves. Sometimes this treads more on the grounds of copying something rather than simply referencing or adapting it. Most of this is perfectly fine though and add something to the game that feels familiar yet unique. The movement and moment to moment game play itself feel clean. I was constantly engaged with my inputs. Moving around being incredibly fun to do. Exploration and finding secrets reward good movement, this encourages you to develop better skills with movement. One issue I found with the game play itself was the camera. Sometimes it would jerk your focus in a certain direction when it really didn't need to. Other times it wouldn't do it at all when it really should have. Sometimes it was very finicky to work around. Getting zoomed in on in certain areas which really hurt my ability to tell where I was going or what I was doing. \n\nThe visual design is what I believe to be my favorite aspect of A Hat in Time. The designers really killed it here. Developing a world that was constantly interesting to look at and engage with. The way everything looked and felt really helped me to feel like my actions were meaningful in the world itself. Themes varied per world and per level, but always kept a nice humorous and cute nature to them. The game in this sense knows itself and what it wants to be. The characters all had designs to them that fit their area nicely. The only issue I had with them was the lack of characters. The game is very short and as such, doesn't feature all too many characters. Not a super big issue, I know. I just loved all the people I met, and wanted to meet even more\n\nI like the hats and badges, but don't really understand why some exist the way they do. There are a few hats in the game, but I only ended up using about two of them on the regular. I like the designs and alternate looks for these hats, but their functions are highly underutilized for a game called \"A Hat in Time\". Badges are a neat little addition to the game's mechanics. But there are a couple that really confuse me. The hook and beam shot specifically. The beam shot feels like something that would've made a really cool hat, but ended up as an optional badge instead. I feel like this is a huge loss of potential. The hook shot is one that I really take issue with. For an optional badge, you use it incredibly often. To the point where not having it on felt wrong. At that point it might as well just be a base mechanic instead of a badge. \n\nThe next few paragraphs enter into spoiler territory so check it out at your own discretion. They are about story and pacing.\n\n[spoiler] The pacing of the game is something I got confused by. In order to complete Acts 1 and 2, you need to use things that you unlock in Acts 3 and 4. Disrupting those stories and sending you forward to new ones. This threw off the flow of the game by a huge margin. I was really invested in Act 2's story when I was suddenly forced to go to Act 3 to get the necessary item for completing Act 2. This item of course was the hook badge. I then became invested in Act 3 and finished that before going back to Act 2, where I had lost most of my interest in the story. This happens again, albeit not as bad in Act 1. In this act you need a new hat from Act 4 in order to do a single level. Felt weird needing to come back to an act that I left behind hours ago just to finish it. The level itself is also super short anyways so it felt like my chain was being yanked a bit. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] The story itself is pretty eh. It's interesting at first with the Mustache Girl and Hat Kid taking on the Mafia. It sets up a pretty interesting plot that gets thrown out the minute Mustache Girl becomes your enemy. She doesn't come back until you get 25 hourglasses. This is more than half of what's available, but it feels pretty lackluster since you can hit that before even touching Act 4. I feel like getting 30 or even 35 hourglasses would've made more sense. Some sub stories were really interesting. Such as Act 2's bird movie maker battle and Act 3's soul contracts. Others were completely nonexistent and just really boring. Act 4's being the worst of the two mediocre ones. Act 4 itself is something I could live without. It was a slog to get through and is the only level that I genuinely felt was wasting my time. It abandons the usual level setup for a free roam approach which I found to be more annoying than interesting. Especially when I went back in to find the sub area entrances. It just took forever to finish and a lot of that was because you do so much walking and waiting in that Act. [/spoiler]\n\nAll in all. A Hat in Time is a good platformer. It's not without its issues though. I really feel like this game needed some more time in the oven. With a bit more time and love it could've been something a lot better. But as it is, it's fine. Community maps are really cool and are what I'll likely come back to the game to do. I don't see myself replaying the base game though. One last thing I want to mention is that the game balances its cute yet serious nature well. It does fall apart here and there though. There are times where it teeters a little too far in one direction. These events are small and don't ruin the game at all. They just made me feel weird when they showed up. Like I was listening to a self insert comment from one of the developers themselves, but not the good kind. Took me out of the game a bit. Again, not too bad, but it wasn't welcome when it happened. \n\nTry this one out if you like platformers. I will say though, do not try and do all of Act 4 in one go. The fun I was having quickly flew away after the first hourglass. \n\nTL/DR: Game good, has issues.

You will definitely feel the similarities as you play especially with the main progression exactly the same as Mario 64 in that you jump in to a decently sized free-roam are and have to collect a certain thing by doing a task such as reaching the top of a tree or something like sneaking around a haunted house. it's pretty much identical in that sense. For me I think that was an issue as when comparing it to other really good platformers I thought it was quite lacking even though it's a good game in it's own right which is why I have given it a positive review. \n    The graphics are very pretty and the game looks really nice especially some of the later levels, the music really fits the locations too I thought and it really does feel as though the sounds fit the location very nicely for most of the levels. There are upbeat and happy tunes as well as some more sinister sounding ones which really fit the vibe well. I will say that there was some flickering and screen tearing at certain parts but no other issues visually. The platforming, (the major part of the gameplay) was really good as well with some minor exceptions where I felt it to be slightly unresponsive with grabbing onto ledges and the wall running feature. There is a nice balance with most of the game being quite easy overall but there are a few areas which might take a couple of tries plus there are also loads of bonus challenges for you to complete which scale the difficulty up even more. Something that surprised me was how good the hat system was used in certain areas and I really enjoyed how they've made the hat system which a major part of the platforming where you have to constantly switch hats for different areas of a level. There is a story to the game which is nothing special of course and some of the dialogue is quite cringey at times. It's just a cute looking platformer/collectathon game with some cool mechanics that will definitely hit you with some nostalgia. \n    However, my experience was slightly diminished by me constantly comparing it to other games which isn't the games fault of course as personal biases can always affect ones perception of things so I feel I should mention that as I didn't feel that it brought anything new to it's genre that hadn't been done before and better I should add. \n", "timestamp_created": 1695394584, "timestamp_updated": 1695394584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny":

The music was incredible and the character designs fantastical, but there was one thing preventing me from playing.\n\nIt was a platformer.\n\nPlatformers have always made me feel inferior because of my lack of depth perception, so I tended to keep my distance. So, choosing to finally play this game, especially by myself, was a step out of my comfort zone. But I am so glad that I played it.\n\nStarting with the base game, I was pleasantly surprised to find the platforming to be easy to learn. Most of the mistakes made early on were due to my own learning curve of using the Xbox controller (accidentally pressing Y instead of X because they\u2019re flipped on other controllers). Each of the base four worlds (five if counting the final boss) had its own unique characters, quirks, music, parkour, puzzles, and boss fights. All of the worlds (except one but I\u2019ll talk about that one in a second) follow a similar world and level formula to Mario 64. Once you collect the item at the end of the level, you get sent back to the home base and are able to select another level.\n\nHowever\u2026there is one black sheep world\u2026Alpine Skyline. It is the largest world and is listed as a Free Roam. I collected one item and decided to not go back to it because of how long it took to get said item. Since the world was so large it took forever to get anywhere and the platforming had a large difficulty jump. (Thankfully the developers learned from this when it came to the DLC, but I\u2019ll get to that).\n\nI\u2019ll try to talk about the end without spoiling anything. It combines not only every skill you\u2019ve learned through the game but also the characters you\u2019ve met along the way. The game ties it all into a neat little bow and concludes it all in a very satisfying way.\n\nNow to the DLC. The very first thing I encountered when it came to the DLC was the online multiplayer. Seeing as how it\u2019s been out for a while I was excited to try it out, but oh my god the glitches. The game broke in so many different ways with two people, and it\u2019s unfortunate because not everyone can play together on a console or on the same computer.\n\nWhen it comes to the Seal the Deal portion of the DLC, I chose to save it for a later day. From what I could tell, it is a challenging world and mode added and I didn\u2019t really want to subject myself to that. The seals are cute though!\n\nThe jewel of all the DLC has to be the Nyakuza Metro. Oh my god it is amazing. It was another Free Roam, but I feel it was done right. The music was like the base game\u2019s but on steroids. No specific area was the wrong way to go and exploration was highly rewarded. It wasn\u2019t too big and every place was connected. This world had to be my favorite overall despite its challenges. (No it wasn\u2019t because of the Metro Cats i swear).\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re looking for a game that is friendly to those new to platforming, this one is definitely it. And if you\u2019re looking for a challenge, the DLC can match that as well.

The murder mystery segment was a little funny, but it was very difficult to feel a strong connection to the characters and the setting. Collecting time pieces isn't as satisfying as collecting stars in Super Mario Galaxy.\n\nI had a lot of fun with Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 years ago because the platforming mechanics and challenges were satisfying to overcome, and the space odyssey setting was visually dazzling and memorable, with a surprisingly number of deep and impactful themes about the circle of life and rebirth.\n\nPerhaps that led to me having higher expectations for what makes a good 3D platformer, as I feel that various other platformers such as Spyro Reignited and Blue Fire and even Super Mario 64/DS aren't as good as Super Mario Galaxy 1/2.", "timestamp_created": 1694273820, "timestamp_updated": 1694273820, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

It's like a colorful N64 game, but with voice acting and cutesy characters.\n\nEdit: I finished the game after 12 hours with 26 out of 40 time pieces. The game is pretty easy and kid-friendly to beat, with bosses that were too easy for me and no challenging minions. But the platforming for the optional treasures provided rewarding challenges if you're more experienced with platformers.\n\nThoughts on the level design:\n\nThe first level was hands-down the most fun to explore and the most polished, and it made it worth buying. (No, you don't fight mafia goons the whole game, as the early access videos led me to believe.)  Side note: I wished Mafia Town had some undersea sections, since I was excited when I discovered you could turn into a statue and use your extra weight to dive under water, but was let down when I found the mechanic wasn't used and there wasn't much anything to collect under the piers.\n\nI didn't care as much for the film studio aesthetic of the second level, or the Metal Gear Solid style stealth, but I had enough time pieces to skip playing it after the Owl Express (which I was my most hated level.) \n\nThe third level had some challenging optional platforming in the trees above the level for collectibles that nearly form a second half of the level that you can skip. You probably won't appreciate until you're a couple of hours in. The villain made even the duller task-making fun.\n\nThe fourth level had challenging platforming which I liked.\n\nThough the game started to feel rushed by the 4th level because they didn't bother to write in any story or characters.\n\nI didn't enjoy the final boss fight which was too easy for me, and as someone who played many platformers and collectathons over the years I wish there was at least another more challenging optional boss. I also felt cheated by how other characters you met in the game suddenly behaved differently. \n\nOverall, the platforming and exploration carried the game, and despite some rough patches,. I can recommend it. I'm glad they focused on quality and avoided forcing you to backtrack constantly or having to constantly collect as many non-essential items as in Donkey Kong 64.", "timestamp_created": 1693854449, "timestamp_updated": 1694129008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145668094": {"recommendationid": "145668094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198873622568", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "playtime_at_review": 574, "last_played": 1700242269}, "language": "english", "review": "i really like jumping and dashing", "timestamp_created": 1693851470, "timestamp_updated": 1693851470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145657551": {"recommendationid": "145657551", "author": {"steamid": "76561199454580458", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 938, "last_played": 1700326131}, "language": "english", "review": "peck", "timestamp_created": 1693839495, "timestamp_updated": 1693839495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145657088": {"recommendationid": "145657088", "author": {"steamid": "76561199172032483", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 365, "last_played": 1693839468}, "language": "english", "review": "ggggui", "timestamp_created": 1693838971, "timestamp_updated": 1693838971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145650472": {"recommendationid": "145650472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166118264", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1694110325}, "language": "english", "review": "Great platformer, a little rough around the edges.

I don't do many reviews, but I feel like it this time for whatever reason, so here goes.\n\nThis game is pretty much exactly what it says on the tin; a 'cute-as-heck 3D platformer'. The controls are good, the platforming feels good... but the most unique and special part of this otherwise rather generic platformer are the incredibly varied themes and scenarios the levels take place in.\n\nYou start off crashing down into Mafia Town, which is mainly inhabited by identical-looking, dumb talking, and overly aggressive mafia men. From there, you go from acting on the sets of a bird-run movie studio, to signing your soul away and doing errand work in a haunted forest, and more.\n\nThe various hats that you can stitch together in the game all have unique abilities, but these abilities are, honestly, mostly pretty basic and generic, feeling like they should've been a part of the base moveset. The Dweller's Mask gets some creative usage, however, and the Time Stop Hat is fun to mess around with.\n\nScattered throughout the game's levels are special 'Time Rifts', challenge stages with much more demanding platforming than the main levels. While being a bit of a pain to find just by the photo sometimes, they're a fun little slice of challenge in an otherwise rather easy game.\n\nAs good as it is, however, I do have one major gripe with this game; it's too [i]short[/i]. There's four 'chapters', consisting of multiple 'acts' each, and there are 40 total 'Time Pieces', the main collectible of the game. The content you get here with the base game, while quality, is unfortunately rather limited. Expect to spend about 12-14 hours on a non-rushed, fairly thorough first playthrough.\n\nBut, well, when my only real complaint is the length of the game... well, that's really speaking to the quality of the content on offer here. I'm planning to get Nyakuza Metro soon, as I've heard good things about it, and I haven't gotten too into the Steam Workshop content yet, so you could get a lot more out of this game with both of those.\n\nDo I recommend A Hat In Time overall? Yes, but be aware of the short length of the game before you make the purchase, and maybe consider waiting for a sale. If the length doesn't bother you, though, then there's really no reason NOT to get it. It's a fun, cute throwback 3D platformer that sets itself apart from the rest with its settings and characters.

It's a collectathon that brings me back to my childhood days of Banjo-Kazooie and Mario Sunshine. This game is funny, fun to play, and you just have to love the characters. Look at the overwhelming response in reviews of this game, just trust them and try this game out for yourself.\n\n[h1]The Good:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*][u]The hilarity![/u] This game thrives off of being funny. The first world, Mafia World, is what instantly sold me on this game. So many unexpected things happened that made me and my partner laugh, we found ourselves taking time through missions just to see the level and hear what the characters had to say. Even when there were dark moments or themes, it usually had humor to it. A talking noose that complimented your neck? It's silly!\n    [*][u]Unique levels and characters[/u]. Each level was different in theme and had plenty of characters to enjoy a storyline with. From a spooky forest, to mountaintops above the clouds, to a movie studio involving trains. I guarantee that there's at least one level that appeals to each and every person. As well as a favorite character. There's even an optional way to see the backstory of most characters. I now see the hype and why everyone loves The Conductor so much. (Though The Snatcher was definitely my favorite)\n    [*][u]Music and sound design was wonderful[/u]. Each soundtrack fit the mood or theme of the level and mission that was playing. Already, I find myself planning on using the soundtrack to play in the background while I do things around the house.\n    [*][u]Online content spans far and wide[/u]. I didn't get a chance to do multiplayer or many workshop / mod things, but I did a handful of creative levels that mocked old Mario games. It was impressive how well they were done, and I look forward to seeing more of what can be done by users for online content in the future.\n    [*][u]Customization[/u]. I love that, if you didn't like the way your character looked, you had plenty of options to change it. Different hat designs, clothes, clothing colors, weapons, and even stickers to collect that you can play around with. Not to mention that you could get mods to change your preferences even further, for full customization.\n    [*][u]Controls / Mechanics were simple[/u]. The controls were not complex, I'd go so far to say, they were fun to control, even if a little on the \"floaty\" side that some people might disagree with. Switching from hat to hat (abilities) was instant and easy to select, and the controls don't require frustrating button combos to memorize for basic gameplay.\n[/list]\n[h1]The Neutral / Bad:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*][u]Shorter than expected, should be lower in price[/u]. I'm sad that the base game was as short as it was, but I'd say the game would be better to get on sale. It was fun and I myself am happy with my purchase, but it's definitely priced a little too high for what it is. There is DLC, but it's priced so cheaply that those are well worth the price. Not to mention there is plenty of Workshop content that might very well be worth the price depending on who enjoys user-made content.\n    [*][u]Camera system needs a re-work[/u]. The camera had a nifty button to let you look up and around, but there is no way to look down. And whenever there's a wall, the camera doesn't clip through the wall and instead stays against the wall, while zooming in way too far. It's easily avoidable by just doing the best you can to avoid moving the cameras around walls, but some areas (like vents or holes in the ground) are very hard to navigate through from the hard-to-see areas.\n    [*][u]Janky respawn points[/u]. There are certain areas that require climbing up a large tower or open area, but there were other places to explore below the area that you might currently be in. Getting down there seems to confuse the game into thinking that you fell too far and it will give you \"pitfall damage\" and respawn you (like you fell into an abyss after missing a jump). This makes traversing some of the areas annoying. Either you are trying to get down to a lower area for a collectible and can't, or doing some platforming from above, fall, and don't respawn back near the top so you have to start over again. These didn't happen often, maybe three times in total during my playthrough, so it's not end-game worthy, but definitely a bit annoying to go through.\n[/list]\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n- This game and the DLC is well worth every penny, though maybe get it on sale. It was a delight to play, and I am sad that I didn't play it sooner. There is a huge cult following for this game, and I can see why. It's wonderful, funny, and fun.\n- If you are not into collectathons, this game might not be for you, but you might enjoy someone else playing it for the funny story and moments.\n- There are also many other things you can do / play with all the Workshop content that's been created, so there are tons of possibilities for everyone to enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1691443944, "timestamp_updated": 1691443944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143604590": {"recommendationid": "143604590", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037435302", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1691350685}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted it but my pc ass but i played on switch 10/10 game - Hat Kid", "timestamp_created": 1691432298, "timestamp_updated": 1691432298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143603842": {"recommendationid": "143603842", "author": {"steamid": "76561199016824831", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1700619527}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy divertido jaja historia, jugabilidad y demas, nostalgia en plataformas 3D", "timestamp_created": 1691431474, "timestamp_updated": 1691431474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143602637": {"recommendationid": "143602637", "author": {"steamid": "76561199496099639", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1697994766}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY COOL oops caps", "timestamp_created": 1691430143, "timestamp_updated": 1691430143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143599941": {"recommendationid": "143599941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880807152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 736, "last_played": 1691358980}, "language": "english", "review": "silly fun wholesome platformer", "timestamp_created": 1691427257, "timestamp_updated": 1691427257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143599717": {"recommendationid": "143599717", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005823741", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2613, "last_played": 1698164743}, "language": "english", "review": "made me relize i'm into yellow norwegian birds 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1691427033, "timestamp_updated": 1691427033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143598973": {"recommendationid": "143598973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061372382", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2268, "last_played": 1674089638}, "language": "english", "review": "yep.\nthats fun and cute!\n(and there is a lot of cool skin on the workshop!)", "timestamp_created": 1691426278, "timestamp_updated": 1691426278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143597089": {"recommendationid": "143597089", "author": {"steamid": "76561199352770219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1700440322}, "language": "english", "review": "why tf u looking at bad reviews?

The optional Snatcher challenges is where the games gets hard, very, very hard, tight times and fun diverse challenges, and they reward you with many, MANY cosmetics.", "timestamp_created": 1690995307, "timestamp_updated": 1690995457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678162753582000732", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143271552": {"recommendationid": "143271552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983919887", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 574, "last_played": 1690851984}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly super fun.

If you enable it, some of the contracts are easier (in comparison) and you get all side objective contracts so absolutely none of the content is blocked because the game got too hard. I don't really care for the idea of Death Wish.. but it's there if you care...\n\nIf a platforming segment is too hard for you and you find yourself suffering a bit in a fight or just one of the side stuff, Assist will heal you automatically when you stand still for 2 seconds. This is very nice. No judgement, enjoy the game how you want. Games these day make a habit of shaming the player for using an easy mode and this game doesn't judge you at all. It even lets you earn achievements. \n\nCharacters are extremely likable from NPCS to even the main villain of the game. The only sad thing I have discovered is most of the removed content sounds amazing and can be devastating to learn they removed it. This is a wonderful call back to old collectathon platformers in a wonderful heartwarming fashion. From the dev's desire to ensure the game is friendly to any and all skill levels there is literally no reason to not play this game.\n\nThe modding scene of this game is also insane and many people create absolutely wonderful mods and levels so be warned that it can take hours of your life if not days checking everything out. If you want to ensure you collect all the collectibles of the game the Radar Hat mod is fun. If you have the DLCS and love the Seals of Seal the Deal.. you can have a Seal on your head. It even prevents you from drowning if you like swimming. Though the game doesn't have a lot of moments where you would need to worry about water. But I love these seals and they are just doing their best. It also acts as a hat that speeds you up on land as well.\n\nWith so many options this game easily caters itself to everybody. It's adorable, upbeat, and friendly. Don't do all that well with platformers? This game will cater to that. I beat this game basically about a week and 3 days ago... and I am STILL playing it for mods. It hasn't stopped! I can't stop!!!", "timestamp_created": 1690857994, "timestamp_updated": 1690857994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143177982": {"recommendationid": "143177982", "author": {"steamid": "76561199466146343", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 396, "last_played": 1698878493}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1690853899, "timestamp_updated": 1690853899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143175194": {"recommendationid": "143175194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051139360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1805, "last_played": 1692054950}, "language": "english", "review": "Great platformer all around.

It was the first 3D-platforming game that I've played and I constantly had a smile on my face. The characters are endearing & funny and the different chapters are well thought out and are very creative. The OST is one of my favourites, and the game is a good balance between story, fights, and exploration.\nIf there's any downside to this game, it's that the base game is quite easy (although Seal The Deal definitely makes up for this). This isn't too much of a problem for me as I'm more invested in the characters.\nThe game runs surprisingly well! My PC runs like a potato and has hardly any free storage space yet it can run AHiT just fine. Changing the quality in the settings in order for your game to run better honestly doesn't really change anything for me in terms of enjoyment.\n\nSeal The Deal is a fun DLC, but I'd only really recommend it if you were bored by how easy the base game was and want a challenge. I wouldn't recommend buying it if you're not planning on doing Death Wish as Chapter 6 is the shortest of the 7 (excluding 5) and doesn't have much to offer. Death Wish is certainly not for the faint hearted and is extremely difficult, but that may be your cup of tea.\n\nNyakuza Metro has Chapter 7 which is, in my opinion, the best Chapter. It's free roam and has loads to offer, including lots of new badges, weapons, and story. Online Party is the cherry on top for this DLC.\n\nVanessa's Curse is a fun game mode, but I only recommend getting it if your PC can handle the lag.\n\nOverall, AHiT is an incredibly fun game with endearing characters & story as well as a banger soundtrack. I'd recommend the base game + Nyakuza Metro to anyone, but you may want to look into it further if you're thinking about getting Seal the Deal or Vanessa's Curse. Still, this game will always be one of my favourites. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1690206391, "timestamp_updated": 1690206391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142689006": {"recommendationid": "142689006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120740661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 4026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4026, "last_played": 1658968106}, "language": "english", "review": "A Hat in Time has quietly worked it's way up to being one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nIts got lovable settings, levels, characters, music, great controls and solid platforming. It can be played in whatever capacity you want. If you want to play casually and sight-see, great! If you want to rip every hair out of your head in frustration at the challenge mode, also great! If you want to goof off with a friend online and play user made levels just to see what people can cook up, also also great! Even after doing a majority of what's available I can still always find a reason to come back, goof off, and enjoy this game in some way or another.\n\nIf there is room to complain I will say a few things. The Steam version is THE definitive way to play. Console versions haven't been able to receive a lot of the new content like the new multiplayer mode or the recent winter/summer updates. The fact that the game is still seeing dev support at all is fantastic but the attention is not evenly split among platforms for whatever reason. It is something to look out for if you see this across other platforms and are making a decision among them. The other thing is that the game is a little too honest, so while it's an amazing game if you enjoy platforming, I can't say it would reel you in if that is not the kind of game you usually enjoy. If nothing else it's worth trying out, that much I can say.\n\nIf you are looking for a new fun game to dump time into and enjoy a good platformer I highly encourage grabbing this and all it's related DLC while it's on sale.

The fourth one is an insane challenge requiring you to finish multiple acts without jumping, to do this you're either going to have to cheat or learn techniques on-par with what speedrunners do.\n\n[*][b]Nyakuza Metro:[/b]\nNot bad, pretty fun actually, only thing that sucks is unlike other acts, when you're high up you can't just fall back down, doing so will hurt you and teleport you back up.\nTo go anywhere else from this point, you either have to collect a time piece or exit to the hub, even after you complete the DLC this is still an issue.\n\nYou also get \"Online Party\" with this, which allows you to play with other people online. Only problem is, without [u]Online Party Plus![/u] from the workshop, you won't see most of other peoples chosen cosmetics.\n\n[*][b]Vanessa's Curse:[/b]\nHonestly not worth your time, it's just a PVP mode where you try to collect all the crowns while avoiding infected players.\nNo achievements are tied to this, its only purpose is cosmetics and playing with strangers, both of which are already avalible through Nyakuza Metro.[/list]\n\n[h1]Bugs[/h1]\nIf you get all Deathwish stamps and have a mods with stamps or there's an event going on with stamps, you won't unlock the achievement.\nOnly

Everything about this game is so immensely charming to me, and I find myself appreciating even the littlest of details on a deep level. Everything from the visuals to the character designs to the world to the love thats just SHOVED INTO THIS GAME AUGHHJ IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY!!! That's not even mentioning that the VOICE ACTING IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! EVERY SINGLE VOICE FITS THE CHARACTERS AND THEY ARE ALL JUST SO FANTASTIC AND LIVELY IT MAKES EVERYTHING FEEL 10X BETTER !!!!\nThe replay value in this game I have found to be very good, and I would have like zero issues with playing through it all again for no reason other than I want to. its very replayable.\n\nTHIS ISNT EVEN MENTIONING THE WORKSHOP SUPPORT- WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME AND COOL! AHIT embraces the modding community with open arms and even hosts multiple modding events a year where theres a theme and stuff AND A LOT OF THEM EVEN HAVE THEIR OWN VOICE ACTING AND SUCH AND ITS JUST SO GOOOOD\n\nanyway i give this game a 10/10 please if you enjoy 3D platformers or literally just are even a lil intreseted in the game you should absouletly give it a shot i promise you its worth it <3", "timestamp_created": 1689003245, "timestamp_updated": 1689003245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141756247": {"recommendationid": "141756247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851541198", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "playtime_at_review": 1817, "last_played": 1699673815}, "language": "english", "review": "time in hat a", "timestamp_created": 1688993442, "timestamp_updated": 1688993442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141723584": {"recommendationid": "141723584", "author": {"steamid": "76561199421126309", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1692992167}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game with my whole heart.

The controls take a bit of getting used to but once you're used to them they're like second nature. gameplay is incredibly fun. and if you care about story, it's pretty good as well, i even caught myself invested in it a couple of times, though most of the fun is in the gameplay. \nnow, it's not a perfect game by any stretch of the meaning, the movement is smooth and engaging, but it does get a little frustrating in certain cases. most probably to the 3D camera's fault, granted it could just be a me issue since I'm not really an experienced 3D mario-esque player, but there are a lot of times when the camera angle gets in a very awkward position while you're platforming, making an otherwise smooth movement experience really frustrating. especially when you're trying to make an accurate jump but fail to judge the distance and end up missing your jump, oftentimes falling to your death (do note that i was playing this on a controller, i imagine it's vastly easier to control the camera with a mouse). those may be the only times when it's not entirely the player's fault for failing. apart from that the difficulty is satisfying. it's neither too easy, nor overbearingly hard. The game doesn't feel unfair when you mess up, and if you're an average gamer you likely won't have too big of a trouble beating levels, but there will be challenge, resulting in a fairly balanced difficulty to fun ratio. \noverall it's a solid 8/10 game, I've 100%-ed it because of how fun it is, including all the DLC's that matter (nyakuza).

The characters, level design, and creative concepts packed into this game really blew me away, very memorable in the same way as Phsyconauts. Nothing life changing here, but so many moments that felt wonderfully funny and entertaining. \n\nMovement in Hat in Time is great as well, forgiving but still very fun and satisfying to execute more complex combos and a decent amount of depth and nuance to the basic moves. Definitely scratched that itch and found myself trying to perform moves from this game when I hopped back into Super Mario Odyssey.\n\nThis game can also be very visually pretty with some really elaborate and fantastical level design. If this game suffers from anything it would be perhaps that it sometimes tries to do too much at once and can either be confusing or easy to forget a mechanic or story beat that was previously established. A few times I found myself going into levels and or cutscenes and not understanding what was really happening until the end of it. This issue however is a the best one to have and after a full play through I'm excited to jump back in and experience it all again.\n\nHat in Time is jam packed and filled to the brim and beyond with fantastic ideas and fun, it gets my easy recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1688600104, "timestamp_updated": 1688600104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510676145553588867", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141406891": {"recommendationid": "141406891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198840345937", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 671, "last_played": 1688598191}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a piece of art.

The lows are, some levels objectives are quite dull. There is little hand holding which some may say is a good thing but I found myself wandering aimlessly in many places. No mini map is quite annoying for large levels such as chapter 4. Character and platform collision feels very inexact, often leading to unfair deaths. The camera can also fight against the player as it collides into walls or gets far too cramped to the player character. Boss battles can feel cheap, often ending with do or die situations with little hints on what to do to proceed, often requiring a complete restart of the boss battle.\n\nI recommend it with caution.

To me, 3D platformers need 3 things above all else: a strong personality, satisfying/addictive movement, and a banger soundtrack. A Hat in Time excels in all of these areas. The writing is charming and adorable, but also sharp and sometimes delightfully off-beat. The game conveys its setting and tells its story with impeccable flair. Most impressive is the sheer variety of stuff to do; every level feels completely distinct and memorable, even within the same world, and the vast majority of the game's \"gimmicks\" feel as polished and fun as the main gameplay itself. In this aspect, A Hat in Time outdoes even distinguished big franchises like Mario.\n\nI don't have much criticism for the game, though I suppose my biggest one is that it's pretty short, even with the DLC. There are only 4 worlds in the base game, 2 more with the DLC for a total of 6. Also - and this is PC-specific - optimization and stability can suffer especially with mods. The game takes a very long time to start up, often needs to be force-closed, and I've run into problems with sound output as well as stuttering in-game. (These problems don't exist on console, but the mods are really half the fun, so you want to play on PC if you can.) Luckily, none of these problems affect the actual playing experience. But they do impact the overall sense of polish.\n\nOverall, this is one of the most delightful games you'll ever play. I can't get enough of it, and I hope we get more.\n\ntl;dr: PECK", "timestamp_created": 1688171947, "timestamp_updated": 1688171947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141010903": {"recommendationid": "141010903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154595939", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1027, "last_played": 1685213030}, "language": "english", "review": "Get up on the floor\nDancing all night long\nGet up on the floor\nDancing 'til the break of dawn\nGet up on the floor\nDancing 'til the break of dawn\nGet up on the floor\nDancing\n\nAll the time\nMy baby, you're on my mind\nAnd I don't know why\nYeah, but the feeling is fine\nCan't you see\nHoney you are for me, oh\nWe were meant to be\n\nDancing in the moonlight\nGazing at the stars so bright\nHolding you until the sunrise\nSleeping until the midnight\n\nGet up on the floor\nDancing all night long\nGet up on the floor\nDancing 'til the break of dawn\nGet up on the floor\nDancing 'til the break of dawn\nGet up on the floor\nDancing\n\nDancing is what to do\nDancing's when I think of you\nDancing's what clears my soul\nDancing's what makes me whole\n\nDancing is what to do\nDancing's when I think of you\nDancing's what clears my soul\nDancing's what makes me whole\n\nEvery time when I look in your eyes\nI smile with pride, happy that you're mine\nJoy in love, your love is true I know\nYou are the best thing that has happened to me\n\nGet up on the floor\nDancing all night long\nGet up on the floor\nDancing 'til the break of dawn\nGet up on the floor\nDancing 'til the break of dawn\nGet up on the floor\nDancing\n\nDancing is what to do\nDancing's when I think of you\nDancing's what clears my soul\nDancing's what makes me whole\n\nDancing is what to do\nDancing's when I think of you\nDancing's what clears my soul\nDancing's what makes me whole\n\nGet up on the floor\nDancing all night long\nGet up on the floor\nDancing 'til the break of dawn\nGet up on the floor\nDancing 'til the break of dawn\nGet up on the floor\nDancing (oh)\n\nGet up on the floor\nDancing all night long\nGet up on the floor\nDancing 'til the break of dawn\nGet up on the floor\nDancing 'til the break of dawn\nGet up on the floor\nDancing (oh)\n\nDancing is what to do\nDancing's when I think of you\nDancing's what clears my soul\nDancing's what makes me whole\n\nDancing is what to do\nDancing's when I think of you\nDancing's what clears my soul\n\nDancing's what makes me whole\nDancing is what to do\nDancing's when I think of you\nDancing's what clears my soul\n\nDancing's what makes me whole\nDancing is what to do\nDancing's when I think of you\nDancing's what clears my soul\nDancing's what makes me whole", "timestamp_created": 1688169813, "timestamp_updated": 1688169838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141006199": {"recommendationid": "141006199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198966961928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1616, "last_played": 1688755254}, "language": "english", "review": "yes.", "timestamp_created": 1688163980, "timestamp_updated": 1688163980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141005301": {"recommendationid": "141005301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278373125", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10778, "last_played": 1698604752}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No tengo mucho que decir, literalmente es uno de mis juegos favoritos ahora mismo y lo llevo jugando a\u00f1os.", "timestamp_created": 1688162937, "timestamp_updated": 1688162937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141005063": {"recommendationid": "141005063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058263573", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3208, "last_played": 1631466003}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego de plataformas adorable muy reminiscente de la \u00e9poca de la gamecube.

Spooky Legally Binding Forest, 4.Dangerous Mountains with even more dangerous accents, and 5. Bowser's Castle. There's several Time Pieces, which are kinda like Mario 64 stars that unlock new areas of the map. There's also time rifts which are hidden throughout the levels that give you a time piece and some lore if you look in the purple ones.  Lots of other collectibles which unlock different stuff in the game that changes up the experience or lets you dress up.\n\nYou'll traverse the world through the use of Hats, which are abilities you can switch between whenever you need them. Each one serves its own purpose. There's a lot of fun to be had in the game, and it feels nice whenever you unlock a new thing or progress in the game. The little stories each area tells is really entertaining and engaging.\n\nDefinitely get the DLC since Nyakuza Metro + Vanessa's Curse (aka Crime Lord Cat + Horror Hide and Seek) adds online mode where you can play along with friends and mess around with new ones! Not like buying one or both of the soundtracks and the Seal the Deal + Death Wish (aka Seal Titanic + Hard Mode Challenges) is any worse, just saying that one offers the biggest upgrade.\n\n Also there's a Steam Workshop that is bustling with amazing creations!

focused on a cutesy presentation than compelling gameplay.

For example, it really doesn't play anything like the Banjo games despite that being the most common comparison.  Again, not necessarily a bad thing depending on who you ask, but I don't think people remember Banjo very well if they think A Hat in Time is even remotely similar to it, aside from them both being collectathons.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't really recommend *against* it.

I appreciate how they tried to make each chapter feel unique, but the deviations in mechanics sometimes got in the way of the fun (chapter 2 in particular felt like a slog).\n\nAt first I was excited for the hat / powers mechanic but most of the hats aren't very interesting. The default hat points you to your objective, the brewing hat is basically just used to destroy crates, and for the ice hat you just press the button when you're standing on an ice pad to access a previously inaccessible area. They can be used in combat but there's not really a point since it's more efficient to just attack or evade enemies. That leaves just the sprint hat and the dweller's mask (and the late game time stop hat), which I do like, but there's not much variety in cool powers.\n\nThe game in general is very easy with most platforms and balloons being perfectly spaced out so you don't have to think about jumping or do any partial jumps. The paths you're supposed to take are laid out with green gems. The puzzles are very simple for the most part as well. I just got to chapter 4 (of 5) and the difficulty has finally started to step up a little. What's weird is the bosses seem to be pretty big difficulty spikes. I've only completed the first and third chapter's bosses but they were both significantly harder than any of the other platforming so far. I really enjoyed them, I just wish the rest of the game wasn't such a breeze. I thought the \"time rift\" side-missions would be like some optional, more difficult levels but they're just as easy and kind of repetitive in that a lot of them reuse the same platforms in the same ways.\n\nAn easy difficulty isn't necessarily a bad thing. Mario Odyssey was easy, but the difference is that game had really tight, satisfying controls that let you do some crazy shit. It had a low skill floor for accessibility and a high skill ceiling if you wanted to pull off fun stunts and speedrun the maps. The mechanics in A Hat in Time are simplistic: you have a double jump, a wall climb, a wall jump, and a slide that you can cancel out of mid-air. Also a crawl that you almost never need to use. There's not a lot of fun with traversal because it feels automatic. Obviously comparing a AAA game with a Kickstarter game isn't much of a fair comparison, but I'm trying to say that without the difficulty, I need something else to be satisfied by with the gameplay, otherwise I'm just going to be bored.\n\nThe camera is pretty awful, which is my biggest beef with A Hat in Time and the reason I ultimately stopped playing. It will zoom in way too close for no apparent reason, usually when you're next to walls, which is when I want it zoomed out so I can see the terrain around me. The camera pan is a single button press that only looks upward and only lasts a couple seconds. It would've been way better to have a toggle like the first person view of Mario 64 (or similar).

It came and went, but had certainly left an impact on many people. Finally, with a sale and an itch to play something in the genre, I secured a copy and played through it.\n\nFor one, the art style and music are both rather charming, but I feel neither left much of an impact on me. The kid, the protagonist, also didn't leave much of an impression though I did like the small moments she had in cutscenes.\n\nThe gameplay, for the most part, is good. The game is responsive enough and movement feels delightful. However, there is a small wall run you can do to try and reach higher platforms. I found the MC's feet were like magnets and, sometimes brushing up against a wall, would lock her in this option even if you didn't mean to. With that said, the gameplay loop is simple, but effective. Finding the McGuffin (time pieces) until you've done the checklist, then beat the boss of the level. Rinse and repeat. Nothing groundbreaking, but solid.\n\nThe worlds, I found, to be a mixed bag. On one hand, I found them to be quite nice and pleasant to traverse a bit. However, I found that they lacked much in terms of landmarks. Typically, a game would have some recognizable areas or landmarks which make traversal easier. However, I found the levels lacked this and became a bit hard to navigate, especially the third level. Again, with that said, they were small enough to not become too troublesome.\n\nIn terms of story, there really isn't much of one, and what is there I think you could do without. It was okay overall, but didn't think it added much...but with that said, I understand it to be a reason for the game to happen, so I don't mind in the end.\n\nThe game is short enough if going to 100%, about a little over 8 hours for me, which is pretty nice. However, I do think the game's price is a little steep for what it is. If you can find the game on a sale of some sort, absolutely pick it up and enjoy a little gem from a few years back. But, if not, I'd say to pick it up if you're really interested. I found the game to be good, but also think there's better out there for the price. With that said, if you still decide to pick it up, it's a game that, while not fully complex, still leaves a good enough impression on you.", "timestamp_created": 1684530422, "timestamp_updated": 1684530422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138545051": {"recommendationid": "138545051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041216837", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11737, "last_played": 1689186669}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD HAT KID CUTE GOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTEGOOD HAT KID CUTE", "timestamp_created": 1684500578, "timestamp_updated": 1684500578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138526576": {"recommendationid": "138526576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981692902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1228, "last_played": 1684810779}, "language": "english", "review": "A Hat in Time reminds me of my Sly Cooper days on PS2 and PS3 as it has that classic 3D Platformer feel to it.

Los temas y como hablan los personajes son muy malos, unos tipos mafiosos, sin personalidad alguna! no creo que sea apropiadod para ninos, la verdad. \n\nMe parecio tan malo que pedi mi dinero de vuelta pero por desgracia se me paso la fecha, y me arrepiento no haberlo probado anteriormente.

While on her journey, she passes over a planet, and a member of the planet's Mafia comes to collect a toll for the Mafia Town government. When Hat Kid refuses to pay, the Mafia man busts the spaceship door open, causing Hat Kid and all of her \"Time Pieces\", magical hourglasses that power her ship, to fall to the planet below. Hat Kid lands in Mafia Town and meets Mustache Girl, a local troublemaker who hates \"bad guys\". Mustache Girl agrees to look for the missing Time Pieces in exchange for Hat Kid's help fighting the Mafia, and the two defeat the Mafia Boss. When Mustache Girl realizes the Time Pieces can rewind time, she wants to use them to become a time-traveling superhero, but Hat Kid refuses, as she is aware that messing with time is dangerous. Angered by this refusal, Mustache Girl declares the two enemies and sets off to find the Time Pieces on her own.\n\nHat Kid ventures across the planet looking for Time Pieces, encountering and befriending many foes that included two rival bird directors DJ Grooves and the Conductor competing for a movie award in a movie studio called Dead Bird Studio and a group of mountain villagers called Nomads infected by a dangerous plague, ultimately befriending them all. Hat Kid also outwits a malevolent spirit called the Snatcher into becoming her best friend after he temporarily stole her soul, tricked her into doing his dirty work in Subcon Forest, and attempted to murder Hat Kid. The game's DLCs have Hat Kid searching for Time Pieces while working in an ocean liner called the Arctic Cruise owned by the Walrus Captain and under the employ of the Nyakuza crime boss called the Empress in an underground city called Nyakuza Metro, the latter ending with Hat Kid being forced to flee the city after a bounty was placed on her head. Mustache Girl exploits Hat Kid's absence to break into her ship and steals the collected Time Pieces, using them to turn the planet into a fiery inferno where her word is law. Hat Kid confronts her, but Mustache Girl uses the Time Pieces to open a time rift and make herself all-powerful.\n\nThe enemies Hat Kid has fought come to her aid in battle, some sacrificing themselves so that Hat Kid can use their dropped Heart Pons (the healing collectible) to power herself up. Hat Kid finally defeats Mustache Girl and uses the Time Pieces to reset the timeline, restoring the planet to normal and reviving all those who were lost. The player can then choose whether Hat Kid should hand over a Time Piece to Mustache Girl (so she can defeat the Mafia and free her town from their control as was her desire in the beginning of the game) or not. Though her former foes are sad to see her leave, Hat Kid restores the Time Pieces to her vault and resumes her voyage home.

Just remember that the tools the game offers for you are all intended ways to play.

Everything screams \"cute\" and \"adorable\".\n\nThe gameplay is very smooth, even though at first it's very hard to control Hat Kid, you get used to how jumping changes the direction you're facing, and start to make some pretty sick moves.\nThe game is heavilly inspired by Nintendo platformers, like Mario Galaxy. You'll find a lot of similarities, like the areas of the ship, that is it's version of the observatories, the Time Pieces that are the Power Stars and even the galaxies, that the game referes to chapters.\n\nThe story is very simple and easy to understand. It kinda sounds like something Nintendo would come up with! The characters are charismatic, unique and interesting, although simple, they fill their role in the plot and are very different from one another.\n\nEven though the game is very simple in terms of graphics and art stile, it's still kinda difficult to make it run smoothilly even with the graphics setings that you can change. I experienced a lot of FPS drops and slowness every time I enter a chapter. Notable situations are the Nyakuza Metro on it's entirety and the final act of Arctic Cruise.\n\nOverall, it's a very creative game, that's very nostalgic to some because of it's inspiration on games like Mario, and a very good start for those who never played a platform before. Very good for casual players, but for those who want a chalange, the mod scene of the game gives plenty of options to choose from.", "timestamp_created": 1681071013, "timestamp_updated": 1681071013,

De hecho, s\u00f3lo tiene el doble salto y un dash hacia adelante; intenta complementar esa limitaci\u00f3n con la mec\u00e1nica de los sombreros, que en realidad son otros movimientos b\u00e1sicos del g\u00e9nero que se podr\u00edan realizar igualmente con diferentes botones, pero que est\u00e1 implementado as\u00ed para que tengas que ponerte el sombrerito de turno y justificar esta mec\u00e1nica. As\u00ed lo \u00fanico que se obtiene es una sensaci\u00f3n de barrera entre el usuario y el juego, y p\u00e9rdida de dinamismo en la jugabilidad.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o de niveles es nefasto: no son divertidos ni invitan a la exploraci\u00f3n, y la recompensa por un \u00e1rea de plataformeo o un \"puzle\", es un \u00edtem para canjear dise\u00f1os de sombreros o cosm\u00e9ticos.\n\nNo termina de establecer un lenguaje propio, por lo que a veces no sabes qu\u00e9 es exactamente lo que tienes que hacer, quiz\u00e1s en parte porque trata de ser un suced\u00e1neo barato de Mario Galaxy hasta puntos alarmantes. El sistema de la nave central, entrar a los niveles como si fueran planetas, hasta la animaci\u00f3n de coger los relojes, los sonidos, algunas \u00e1reas de plataformeo... Sin embargo, no es m\u00e1s que eso, un cascar\u00f3n sin alma. La protagonista no trasmite ninguna empat\u00eda y la historia es absurda, no es que de este tipo de juegos se espere una novela, pero esto parece estar escrito en una ma\u00f1ana y con desgana.\n\nLa variedad de enemigos es escasa y con mec\u00e1nicas simples o directamente est\u00e1ticas. Los jefes finales, repetitivos y nada originales.\n\nAhora llegamos al punto fuerte, la c\u00e1mara; es una locura, es como si la hubieran dise\u00f1ado odi\u00e1ndote, quiere quitarte los deseos de jugar a este juego a toda costa. En sitios cerrados te hace un zoom y lo \u00fanico que ves es la cabeza del personaje, y en lugares abiertos con desniveles tratas de girarla y se bloquea verticalmente, en mitad de plataformeo se gira sola.\n\nEl juego es muy corto, y el contenido adicional (previo pago) no merece la pena, es ampliar la sensaci\u00f3n de desidia que produce jugarlo.\n\nMi g\u00e9nero favorito son los plataformas 2D y 3D: he completado Cuphead, The Messenger, Yooka Laylee, Monsterboy, Spyro... con todos los logros, es decir, que no escribo estas l\u00edneas porque piense que sea dif\u00edcil; es malo, profundamente malo, cr\u00e9eme cuando te digo que es de lo peor que he jugado en mi vida.\n\nNO lo compres salvo que quieras perder las ganas de vivir. Si te lo regala alguien replant\u00e9ate esa amistad, quiz\u00e1s no te quiera tanto. No pierdas un minuto jugando este juego cl\u00f3nico, sin esp\u00edritu y que intenta imitar a los grandes del g\u00e9nero.", "timestamp_created": 1680340287, "timestamp_updated": 1680340525,

Before I get to them however, I'd like to touch on things I love about this game.\n\nThe personality, the charm, and overall presentation of this game, is amazing. I absolutely adore how it looks, the platforming, level design, and controls, are absolutely amazing. Not only that but the bare bones story feels extremely refreshing. As much as I love games with story, this game doesn't try to do anything crazy, but overall I don't mind honestly. Overall, some of the achievements, while a bit dodgy and could do less without the multiplayer achievements, (honestly fuck this game for that.) overall some of the achievements were fun, but then we get to the last two.\n\nNow, the Death Wish shit at the end, I absolutely fucking despise every bit of it. All of the challenges feel EXTREMELY unfair and VERY tedious to do half the time. You're barely given any room to fuck up for some of them and it doesn't feel rewarding nor does it feel satisfying to finally get them, honestly it just felt painful to do some of these god forbidden challenges, and then I didn't feel satisfied finally getting them, I was glad that it was over. (Which isn't a good thing at all.) \n\nAnother thing I'd like to talk about is the Seal The Deal DLC. This DLC, is fucking embarrassing with how bad it is. I TRIED to like the Seal The Deal DLC, I really fucking did, but it's level design, it's challenge, it isn't rewarding NOR is it fun at all. It is probably one of the most horrible things I've ever played in a video game by far and it takes a lot for me to say that about a game that gives off such a good impression at the start, because I have genuine high hopes for whatever it has later on. \n\nWhile I have been mostly negative about this game, I have mostly been talking from a 100% perspective, and not a casual play perspective, I would say that this game is still worth a go.

A Hat in Time offers a joyful experience overflowing with well-written comedy and cute moments. The platforming is not particularly hard (the game is clearly designed around you not using the dive mechanic, and I didn't need the [spoiler]time stop hat[/spoiler] anywhere near as much as it thought I would) but it is very enjoyable nonetheless.

Chapter 2 is fantastic, and it really shows the potential the game had; unfortunately, the rest of the game ranges from just slightly above average to kinda bad (Chapter 4 lol).\n\nChapter 1 seemed to set up a bit of a story that I thought would be continued in the later chapters, but it doesn't get revisited until the end of the game. Every chapter in the game is like this actually; they all have their own storylines that don't come together until the very end. It's a bit disappointing, but a good story isn't required for a platformer: Super Mario Galaxy is similar and it's still a great game.\n\nAlso, the controls and camera aren't great. I don't really want to elaborate on this point but I'm sure other people have.\n\nThe steam workshop honestly might be the best part of the game. The levels people make can be really good, and there's lots of other mods that add fun things like Hat Kid swearing and playable Peter Griffin (hey lois im in hat in time). Overall, it adds a lot of replayability to the game.\n\nI don't usually give scores for games, but I need a conclusion for this review soooo...
