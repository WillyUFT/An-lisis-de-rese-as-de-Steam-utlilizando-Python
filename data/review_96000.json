The game is a totally relaxing experience and there's no better word to describe it, than cute. Unlike the previously mentioned title, It comes without a touching story however, that is so insignificant, that we get a clearer description about what happened from the game's store page, rather than from the super short intro.\n\nA meteor explodes near TIny Planet (yes, that's its name) which makes the puzzle pieces the planet consists of (?) to scatter. Our main objective is to find these pieces and put them back to where they belong - onto the planet... [strike]to make it whole again (no, it has nothing to do with [i]Dead Space[/i] :D)[/strike] and that's it.\n\nSo with a barely tangible plot, what we get is a journey with a wide variety of puzzles, hidden object search and various minigames throughout the 5 chapters the game has to offer. The jigsaw puzzle pieces are usually lazily hidden behind an object, however in order to progress and to be able to step forward to the next screen we usually have to solve one of the mentioned minigames. The counter in the upper left section of the screen not only shows us how many more we need to find, but also indicates the number of the occasional extra collectibles (like a set number of handles for example). We can - and we must - enter buildings as they also contain items we need. The items we can assemble from these pieces are the key to acess new areas.\nWhen we collected all the necessary items, we often have to push a conspicuously placed button, to set things in motion and be able to proceed.\nBetween chapters, we get back to the planet from the main menu screen, where we have to put the unlocked puzzle pieces back manually, so we can move and continue playing there.\nThe difficulty of the minigames is fair which doesn't break the relaxing nature of the game, although the one with the orbs in the rotating annuluses, where they have to be aligned by colour, may be (it is, even for adults) too difficult for children.\nThere are no bugs, but interaction with certain objects can be unresponsive and we may have to click multiple times on some of them.\nClicking on the little flies on the screen and collecting enough of them (new ones appear as time passes) will provide us a direction towards missing items if we get stuck, which would be a nice touch, but it sometimes points at already done tasks.\n\nPastel colours dominate the cute graphics, with unique, partially mechanical looking structures made of household items and hand-drawn - often not really matching - characters (there's a very realistic old man, then a rather stylized looking kid from a family portrait for example, who, with a slight exaggeration, could get casted to a horror movie), but since there's basically no story, there's nothing that links these people together or make them relevant, making them hardly more than just stage sets.\nUnfortunately the game runs in a 1024x768 resolution, but the worst thing is that due to the 4:3 aspect ratio, everything looks distorted on [strike]modern[/strike] all screens, which is strange considering in 2011, when the game was released, 16:9 displays were already pretty common.\nThe background tunes are lovely and they manage to represent the slight distinctiveness between the chapters (even though the xylophone seems to play a large role in all of them) rather than the graphic design, they are rather short however and thus loop a lot. \n\n[i]The Tiny Bang Story[/i] is a cute little puzzle/hidden object game, that lacks a bit of additional polish and without a plot that would make its world memorable or close to us. It's stil a good game however due to the quality of its minigames and its relaxing nature.\n\nPROS\n+ a large variety of puzzles and minigames\n+ colourful graphics\n+ fitting, relaxing music\n+ creative hint system\n\nCONS\n- no plot, characters are just decorations\n- the hints don't always point to the right direction\n- we may have to click on some objects multiple times\n\nRATING\n6/10\n\n[i]The Tiny Bang Story[/i] was free to claim on September 24, 2018 to celebrate the release of the developers' new game, [url=store.steampowered.com/app/351100/Niffelheim/]Niffelheim[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1699633181, "timestamp_updated": 1699724924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633851289749145508", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149876073": {"recommendationid": "149876073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373997621", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 589, "last_played": 1537850619}, "language": "english", "review": "\u53ea\u6709\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u6e38\u620f\u7684BGM\u5417\uff0c\u5e26\u611f\uff0c\u5f97\u52b2", "timestamp_created": 1699632752, "timestamp_updated": 1699632752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149847637": {"recommendationid": "149847637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010596290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2030, "last_played": 1588325410}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect little puzzle/adventure with a lovely steampunkish style. \nIts a short game, but it is worth the pennies, and you will enjoy\nthe mellow feel, the cute story line and the puzzle are pretty well done.", "timestamp_created": 1699588279, "timestamp_updated": 1699588279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148948551": {"recommendationid": "148948551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262978735", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1538081690}, "language": "english", "review": "I will leave a cat here, friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards.

As you explore each of the five distinct chapters, you'll encounter intricate puzzles, mini-games, and a number of hidden objects that need to be found and pieced together. These challenges are elegantly woven into the game's narrative, creating a seamless and immersive experience.\n\nOne of The Tiny Bang Story's outstanding features is its artistic presentation. The hand-drawn graphics are breathtaking and the attention to detail in every scene makes the game feel like a work of art in motion. The great soundtrack further enhances the experience, creating a tranquil atmosphere that is both soothing and contemplative.\n\nThe game's puzzles are diverse and well-designed, offering a range of difficulties that cater to players with varying skill levels. While some puzzles are straightforward and easy, others can be more complex and require careful observation and problem-solving. This balanced mix ensures that the game remains engaging without becoming overly frustrating.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the game's narrative is minimal, primarily conveyed through its visuals rather than through dialogue or text. This allows for a more universal gaming experience, as language barriers are less of an issue. On the other hand, if you're looking for a rich narrative-driven game, The Tiny Bang Story might feel somewhat lacking in that department.\n\nIn summary, The Tiny Bang Story is a delightful and captivating adventure that will appeal to fans of point-and-click puzzle games and hidden object challenges.

And I had to reach the point that I was done with anything else I was playing AND unwilling to start something new.  Then I thought that this one would have been the right game to play, where I wouldn't be tasked with a steep learning curve, nor fast paced game play, nor the need to plan, calculate, list anything, and it delivered all of these : )\n\nGame play wise it is really relaxing and linear, BGM and sound effects are nice and never intrusive, puzzles are nothing too much complicated, searching around for hidden objects is fun and it last exactly that much it has to last (before to become repetitive then annoying).  It should take in between 3 and 4 hours in total, or even less if trying to speed run it (not advised anyway) : )\n\nOn the negative side there is an issue with full screen mode, reported often by many users as I saw in the forum, because I got victim of it me too.  In my case game can run in full screen mode but after the first two areas and about two hours spent, it started to crash at next launch.  After searching enough and trying enough, my best option was to rename the game folder with save and start it over, in windowed mode.\n\nUnfortunately settings are baked into the save itself, and it is encoded.  If it were a simple settings.txt file where to manually remove full screen mode, it would have been much easier to fix this issue, anyway didn't take too much time to be back at the same point and carry on.  If any, for anyone going to play it, set full screen mode immediately then quit and try to launch it again.  If it succeed fine, otherwise delete the folder and start over in windowed mode.  Folder is ...\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Colibri Games\\The Tiny Bang Story for instance, otherwise try any other advanced solution suggested in the forum.\n\nAnd once game is complete, player can tackle again [i]most[/i] puzzles in a special room, but I guess that to play it over is much better (after a long while of course).

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1672629706, "timestamp_updated": 1672629706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445402264595031738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129812944": {"recommendationid": "129812944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334353678", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 264, "last_played": 1672282474}, "language": "english", "review": "Adorable puzzle game.

I ended up having to look at the walkthrough to find out I hadn't opened a window because the hint would not give me any indication of where the last ball was.\n4) No minigame skip.

In each  chapter you end up building or fixing something that will take you to a new location. No going back so you only have a limited number of scenes to work at a time.

There was no indication that I was moving towards a main menu, and my game was loaded in a very small resolution. I couldn't get it to stretch properly to full screen on any of my monitors. Not just with black bars on the side, it wasn't working properly.\n\nI had to delete the files here first: C:\\Users\\*YourUserName*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Colibri Games\\The Tiny Bang Story\\\n\nThat fixed the issue with not properly stretching to fullscreen. But I still had no mouse. Had to go to the .exe, run in compatability mode for windows 7, disable full screen optimization, run as administrator, then under change high DPI settings, at the bottom, change from application to system in the drop down for override high DPI scaling behavior. Overriding high DPI scaling behavior had to be redone every time I turned my computer on. What a pain just to get a game working. \n\nHowever, all of that being said, once I got the game up and running. It was quite enjoyable. It felt like part simple puzzle game and part hidden object game. The concept was very simple, but I definitely enjoyed it.\n\nOne puzzle just didn't make sense and I had to google it because it didn't seem to be working despite me knowing how to solve it. The solutions I found lined up with what I was doing, so I started the puzzle over again and it worked. But I spent five mins literally spinning with no luck. A few of the other puzzles I didn't particularly care for. But overall, it was quite fun. I had no idea what the tiny bang story was though lol.\n\nIt's only a few bucks, so if it's ever one sale, it's a no brainer to pick up.

No clear direction, poor hit detection, tedious gameplay and sections where the game menu is removed,  amount to a frustrating hour that may make you wish you were at work rather than at play.\n-----------------\n[b]What They Got Right[/b]\n-----------------\nTiny Bang is an [u]amalgamation of various Point & Click games[/u] that rather gel well together; Hidden Items, Matching Puzzle, Jigsaw. There's even a section where you play a mini first person shooter game (balloon section in stage 1). You wouldn't think that these things go together but Colibri Games made it work... sort of. \n----------------\n[b]What They Got Wrong[/b]\n----------------\nYou're not told how the game works, you're suppose to figure it out yourself. That's fine in a platformer game where you have the benefit of trial and error, but when you're a hidden items game and you have [u]no clear indication[/u] of what to do with items you collected, you're will get lost within the first 15 minutes. \n\nOther puzzle games have a clear logic to it - that is, if you do A, it results in B - this game somehow unsuccessfully communicate what the rules are and how it should be played. \n\n[u]This wouldn't be so bad if the control schemes were tight.[/u] As it is, trying to snap pieces into place requires some weird precision for a point a click game. If you don't put that piece exactly where it should be, it won't snap into place. This got annoying really often, really fast. \n\nThe game also requires a lot of [u]tedious actions[/u] such as, clicking on a wrench a then drag it to a nut to unscrew it, then you have to click on the wrench again to do the exact mundane thing another 3 times. Why can't the wrench just stay at the cursor while you unscrew the all the nuts? \n\nThe worst part comes after you complete a level, you get a \"bonus\" challenge. Where you have to fit an incomplete jigsaw pieces onto the picture. This part here; you can't save, you can't exit, you can't even bring up the game menu. You either finish it or ctrl+F4. Why would you do that? [u]Why remove the game menu[/u] especially at this part of the game?\n\nSo many baffling decisions. \n\nAnd extra bad point for just [u]terrible sound design.[/u] That music box chime to is on a loop for the entire game and it will drive you up the wall. The artwork, while looks good in an old-fashioned way, \n-------------\nFinal Words\n-------------\nI know there are some people who like this game. Hey you do you.

The gameplay of the decryption type is similar to most other puzzle games, basically it is to collect props to decrypt and pass the level.\n\nExcellent decryption games will substitute the game's storyline in the game.

And for normal items to find, some could be placed in the same way, even worse when there are similar items yet clicking on them not counted.\n\nThe second one is the mini-games where a few are straight no clues to solve at all - for instance the water pipe, do the cranks stop or lead the flow of water? There is no telling because there is no animation! Even the hint ? guide further confuses you more; or the sudoku-like but ended up nowhere like sudoku and you can just guess the last 2 numbers instead. In addition, boring arcade mini-games. \n\nThe third one is not having checkpoint, once you are ready to advance the game just moves you to the next level regardless of you having not completed collecting the big picture pieces, and there is no turning back but fresh new game. By that point you would end up not being able to finish the big picture, but it turned out you still gather them in full anyway, thus makes collecting the pieces pointless. \n\nOther than that, music turns dull quick, few imprecise control, glitch where clicking on humans after first time will now show you bubble hint unless you switch area and come back, and you cannot freely choose to replay any level but either start from scratch (which should be lengthy to reach the point you need) or just pick any of mini-games at the end.\n\nFinal score: 5/10 Mediocre.", "timestamp_created": 1618937190, "timestamp_updated": 1618937190, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537836432456970215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90623870": {"recommendationid": "90623870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035193791", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1663794112}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Busca piezas para poder avanzar y armar un puzzle.

Pero para no extenderme demasiado, vamos al punto:\n\nLo mejor del juego sin duda es el estilo art\u00edstico, los dibujos, excelentes y una banda sonora realmente muy buena y relajante. Tambi\u00e9n hay que rescatar que tiene cosas buenas y puzzles interesantes. De hecho ser\u00eda un excelente juego, de no ser por las contras que van a continuaci\u00f3n.\n\nEntonces, vamos con lo malo del juego. Por empezar, ni bien instalarlo, la sensaci\u00f3n es mala al tener el men\u00fa en ingl\u00e9s cuando la p\u00e1gina dice que cuenta con dos millones de idiomas. Y alguno me dir\u00e1 \"es solo el men\u00fa, el resto del juego no tiene textos\"; bueno, es verdad, pero ya que eran menos de diez palabras las podr\u00eda haber traducido, o poner iconos que reemplacen las palabras, si lo quer\u00eda hacer tan \"universal\". Pero esto es un detalle menor. Lo peor del juego es que jam\u00e1s explica nada. Claro, si a uno le gustan \u00e9ste tipo de juegos y es m\u00e1s o menos inteligente, no deber\u00eda tener problemas, PERO, el juego hace todo lo posible por complicarte la existencia y estresarte a m\u00e1s no poder. De hecho, no es un juego casual para quienes quieran pasar un buen rato, sino para aquellos que quieran torturarse. Hay algunos puzzles con una dificultad rid\u00edcula, o directamente, que se resuelven sin explicaci\u00f3n l\u00f3gica aparente, y ten\u00e9s que ir probando mil alternativas o mirar alguna soluci\u00f3n en YouTube, como hice yo con algunos que me complicaron bastante. Y algunos dir\u00e1n, \"bueno, al menos lo termino para desbloquear los logros\"... bueno, es que no tiene logros, y me dir\u00e1n \"entonces por la estad\u00edstica, para tener un juego m\u00e1s terminado en la biblioteca\", y es que al terminarlo, Steam tampoco lo detecta como un juego que haya sido completado. Por lo cual, salvo que realmente lo disfrutes (lo cual lo dudo bastante), es una p\u00e9rdida de tiempo.\n\nThe Tiny Bang Story tiene (o ten\u00eda) todo el potencial para realizarse toda una franquicia con \u00e9ste tipo de juegos, pero lamentablemente se qued\u00f3 en el tiempo, jam\u00e1s fue actualizado (olvidate de jugarlo en resoluci\u00f3n de 1080p, y ni hablar de widescreen) y se nota mucho.\n\nPor ah\u00ed est\u00e1 bueno para d\u00e1rselo a tus hijos o sobrinitos a modo de castigo, para ponerlos en penitencia, los \"amenaz\u00e1s\" con ponerles este juego si se vuelven a portar mal.

Enlarging it moved it to the upper left corner. Even Borderless Gaming didn't work. Eventually somehow this corrected itself, but it is telling. Just like the options menu that just has two volume sliders. Or how incredibly long it takes to get to the main menu. I started clicking everywhere. Turns out, it just takes like half a minute for no reason.\n\nThe game itself is just bad. No story. No proper HOPs. Objects require laser precision. Interactible objects aren't indicated. Movement between the first and second screen requires pressing a button, waiting for a door to open then clicking. And this game requires you to constantly move between screens. At some point you have to use a wrench to unscrew bolts. It unselects the wrench after each use for no reason.\n\nIf you need any more indication of the incompetence of the developer: Using the hint button requires you to find and click on at least a dozen fireflies moving around the screen. No, i'm not joking. I could go on about the vague numbers puzzle, the bad balloon mini-game, etc. And i've only played this for half an hour!

You will navigate this world very easily with the mouse and there is no limit to the amount of clicks you can use which is nifty if you are a novice at this type of game. \nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward. You are in a miniature fantasy world and need to collect and find certain objects to complete the given puzzles as you navigate to the next area with puzzle pieces being strewn across each area which you will need to collect to complete the final picture. \n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are beautifully done and resemble illustrations in a storybook. Colibri games really went all out to create this whimsical little world with realistic aspects such as tassels that move when you run your mouse across them and hatches that open and close as they would in reality.\nThe weather resembles a beautiful sunny day, you can almost feel the warmth of the sun on you as you move from area to area. \n\nSounds:\nThe music is soft and whimsical, though repetitive you won\u2019t get sick of it playing softly in the background. \nAs for the sounds they are cute and not overpowering. Each character has their own sound even though they don\u2019t actually have lines they are more like interjections or exclamations but each one suits their respective character, another well thought out mechanic by the developer\n\nReplayability:\nThe game might not offer much in terms of replayability, but as one has come to expect from these types of games, they can be replayed numerous times at your own leisure. That is what they were made for.\nCasual fun that does not always require a lot of effort. \n\nMGR Gaming\u2019s Conclusions:\nSpoilers Ahead:\nAn absolute must play for the point and click or hidden object fans. Although a relatively short game, you will enjoy every moment spent on it; searching for lost things, solving puzzles, and generally just enjoying this absolutely beautiful Tiny World. \n\nThis game suits you if you just want to relax your brain after a long day and looking for some casual fun. The puzzles are challenging to various degrees but none are too difficult.\n\nAt the end of the day, this genre of games is mostly for casual gamers that love this type of game, and then some gamers who enjoy casual time killers that doesn\u2019t require too much effort. This is what we have here in ample quality supply. \n\nScore 8\nBy: LGRza\nDate: 29 April 2011\n\nAdditional Info:\nPlatforms: PC: Mac: Linux\nGenre: Point & Click: Hidden Object\nCensor Rating: n/a\nAge Rating: A\nDeveloper: Colibri Games\nPublisher: Colibri Games\nRelease Date: 22 April 2011\n\nMGR Gaming Steam Curator:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32364038/\nMGR Gaming:\nhttps://www.mgrgaming.co.za\n", "timestamp_created": 1597996697, "timestamp_updated": 1597996697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526102364063262939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74502761": {"recommendationid": "74502761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067607298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 131, "last_played": 1597752636}, "language": "english", "review": "annoying", "timestamp_created": 1597752701, "timestamp_updated": 1597752701, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471817493438720703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74382405": {"recommendationid": "74382405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030784015", "num_games_owned": 8592, "num_reviews": 10534, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1597549259}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a simple and charming 2D hidden object puzzle game with a variety of other minigame/puzzles thrown in.\n\nUnfortunately despite being released in 2011, the game runs in fixed resolution and can't be changed, unacceptable for 2011 and unacceptable today.

Chill music, puzzles, finding objects, nicely drawn art and a solid difficulty level. \n\nTiny Bang Story is short, but it was easy to get hooked right away. Beautifully drawn art and the whole atmosphere is well done. There\u2019s no dialog at all, just relaxing music while you progress through the game.\n\nI initially thought this would be too easy but it does have some challenging puzzles and objects that are hidden very well. I would wonder HOW I missed several items when I swore I checked each screen thoroughly. Low and behold, I glanced over a well hidden piece. \n\nThe puzzles are generally good. A few of them could use some direction, just a single sentence to tell the player the goal. I saw several unique puzzles and appreciated the variety. However, there is a game breaking bug if you are not careful. It\u2019s with the compass and oven puzzle in Level 3. I was frustrated with being unable to complete the compass puzzle so I simply brute forced my way through the oven one. This works, but also takes away the ability to finish the compass puzzle so you are unable to finish the level. Several people in the game discussions had this issue, so glad I\u2019m not the only one.\n\nAnother bug I encountered more than once was not collecting all the puzzle pieces but still finishing the level. If this happens to you, it\u2019s ok and you\u2019ll still get the required number of puzzle pieces to put together the main world. \n\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nA little more polish would have gone a long way.

It\u2019s hard not to compare this game to those by Amanita Design, and to conclude that [I]TTBS[/I] could have been better.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that [I]TTBS[/I] is a horrible game. It\u2019s not, but it\u2019s mediocre at best and uninteresting at worst. [I]TTBS[/I] is a hidden object game, with the overall goal of collecting and reassembling all hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces to rebuild Tiny Planet. All the while, you\u2019d need to solve a variety of other puzzles, for which you\u2019d also need to find the hidden items. Thus, if you love hidden object games, you may find [I]TTBS[/I] more tolerable, if not appealing.\n\nYet, that is all there is to [I]TTBS[/I]. Throughout its 5 chapters, you find items, use the items to solve puzzles, reassemble the big jigsaw puzzle bit by bit, and move on to the next chapter. I was starting to get bored by the third chapter, after realizing that nothing amazing is ever going to happen. Aside from some swaying foliage, fluttering insects, and a few briefly-moving key objects, the world of Tiny Planet is pretty static. Even the residents you\u2019d help along the way seem unmoved (ha!) by the disaster that had struck their world.\n\nBut, what about the puzzles? Not surprisingly, it\u2019s the usual mixed bag of puzzles that involve swapping tiles, shifting marbles (I hate those), finding the correct number combinations, connecting pipes, completing arcade games, etc. I personally find it annoying when modern puzzle/adventure games do not incorporate puzzles organically, especially when they feature fantasy worlds like the one in [I]TTBS[/I]. Given the creative freedom that an imaginary world affords, it just seems lazy for the developers to simply shove all these puzzles in front of you as obstacles.\n\nAt one point during the game, I accidentally moved on to the next chapter without finding all hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces there. I thought I\u2019d need to replay that part of the game. Yet (thankfully and mercifully?), I didn\u2019t have to. The missing two pieces were given to me in the final jigsaw puzzle assembly. That led to think whether or not finding the jigsaw puzzle pieces is obligatory in each game chapter. If not, this makes the game more pointless and frustrating.\n\nStill, I did enjoy the beautiful artwork by Eduard Harutyunyan, and the soundtrack by Strategic Music. Their work complement each other well, making me wish that [I]TTBS[/I] has a little something more (e.g. a simple story) to make the overall package more cohesive and meaningful. If you enjoy hidden object games, you may enjoy [I]TTBS[/I]. Otherwise, I think you may have a better time playing the Amanita Design games.", "timestamp_created": 1588452865, "timestamp_updated": 1588452865, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621640980243682861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68437117": {"recommendationid": "68437117", "author": {"steamid": "76561199047643449", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1588433549}, "language": "english", "review": "A finding hidden puzzle game combined with many little games.

Especially the first one, these games are either too easy (and therefore, boring) for me or too frustrating (mostly because of all damn pixel hunting you're required to do there). But Tiny Bang was cute and I got it on a big sale, so I decided to give it a chance. Well, I got almost exactly what I wanted... but it was a bit too short for my taste.\n\nThe Tiny Bang Story is a well-designed \"hidden object\"/puzzle game with nice graphics and fairly easy puzzles. There are two types of challenges: 1) collect some objects all over the level to do something, for example, fix a circuit; 2) complete a small simple puzzle to unlock something necessary to complete the level. The game consists of five big \"levels\", each level have four big screens, you can move between screens, sometimes you need to unlock the passage by doing something. There are 20 puzzles in total, and you can replay each one after completing the game. I guess I'll just list pros and cons here.\n\n+: Cute, hand-drawn surreal design without glitches or objects that are out of place, nice animations. This game is actually very good for children with such design and decent puzzles which can be solved with the family.\n+: Nice soundtrack, the game is really relaxing.\n+: No pixel hunting. Everything is pretty much in plain sight, you only need to pay close attention to details, and collectable objects blend well with surrounding scenery.\n+: The overall level of difficulty is pretty low, the game is available for everyone, all puzzles are unique. You can even get a very obvious hint for every task by collecting blue flies and filling hint meter.\n\n-: The game is short. And I mean, really short for a game like this, if you count only the time I spent on the gameplay, without drinking tea or answering in chat, it was 2,5 hours. That was the biggest letdown for me, I thought that this game will have at least 8-10 more extensive levels.\n-: The puzzles are really simple, if you are looking for a decent level of difficulty. The only one puzzle which could be called \"complicated\" among the ones I found there was \"plumber\" puzzle, where you need to close a net of pipes with only five valves. Everything else is very simple and pretty much obvious for a seasoned puzzle player.\n- There are several moments where you don't really understand what to do next. You can understand, if you just try to click on the most obvious objects throughout the whole level, but still, this is a bit confusing. Also, the game has no proper ending - after completing the last part of the jigsaw puzzle in main menu you'll open a \"dining room\" where you can replay all puzzles one more time... and this is it. No final credits, no \"the end\", no indication that the game is cleared. This is confusing, too. And I didn't collect all puzzle pieces in the last level (somehow I still missed one) but everything was there in the menu. Erm... what's the point in collecting these, then?\n\nAll in all, this is a very nice game for relaxation, if you want to click on something without putting much strain on your eyes and mind. But I want more content here, otherwise it's even a bit overpriced for the full price. Someone can say that I am too greedy, but really, I want to see at least more story within this world if I'm buying this without the sale.\n\n-----\n\nIf you are interested in other games I'm playing, check my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36682541-Lonely-Dev-Reviews/]Curator page[/url].

Except it the puzzle pieces aren't necessary? The game seems to happily progress even if you don't find them all? All they seem to do is eat into the hints when you're looking for 24 balls to unlock the overly secure elevator.\n\nOh right, and there's no narrative, so its not a typical story per-say, its just a journey through a collection of surreal, picturesque landscapes revolving around a man. It doesn't really feel like there's a deeper meaning to it, which is fine - its a good way to spend a couple of hours clicking around.\n\nOne big drawback for me was that the game did not run in full-screen mode and the windowed mode could not be maximized or resized, so I ended up playing in a tiny window.

There was some silly crashing for me as well, but I found a solution on Steam forums, turns out at some point the game would crash if the sound is turned off. Should've been fixed by now, but it's not. Regarding the game breaking bug, looks like it might happen to anyone due to the way the game counts objects you need to find. It is possible to collect something, but the counter will not increase and you'll be effectively locked out of the progress further. No chapter replay or reset is provided, so the only way to dealing with such bug is replaying from the very beginning.\n\nAnd as for the art, [url=https://artsammich.blogspot.com/2011/05/good-artists-borrow-great-artists-steal.html]apparently[/url] the game artist is quite frivolous with using other artists' works as references, and basically steals parts of their pieces.\n\nOverall it feels like an attempt to cash in on Machinarium audience with somewhat dumbed down gameplay (hidden object instead of point-and-click adventure, although it still has mini-puzzles and mini-games).

The general quality is relatively low, I truely believe it's quite the diamond in the rough.\n\nThe Big Bang Story is a point-and-click puzzle game.  The majority of the game involves you scrupulously scouring each level - collecting various random items that are required to progress to the next area.  Other puzzles range from mathematical equation solving to logic based. They all provide a nice break from the simple concept of searching for camouflaged items.\n\nThe first thing you will notice when you play this game is the level artwork. Each stage is beautifully hand drawn.  You can't help but pick up on and admire the detail that has been put in to the visuals. There are no horrible ghouls or sinister entities or dark and eerie environments. It is all very light-hearted and family friendly. Add this to calming and pleasant soundtrack.\n\nThe Tiny Bang Story is rather short with there not being much in terms of replayability. Regardless of this, it is an interesting, fresh and relaxing ride for the duration.

In other words most of the gameplay is \"Where's Waldo?\" just instead of Waldo you collect things which are needed for puzzles.\n- Some puzzles are painful. Game does not explain what is needed to be done, there is a hint given for each puzzle of what to do (yes not a hint for solution, but a hint for what you're supposed to do) and sometimes it's not enough to understand what I need to do.\n- You need to collect 30 beetles to get a hint. 30, it takes quite long. If I am going for a hint anyway why 5 or atleast 10 can't be enough? 30 just takes a much longer time to collect and does not create any challenge of any sort.\n- Hyping progress which leads to pretty much nothing.\n- Ending.

What we get winds up being a bit of a mixture of all kinds of puzzle games that really aren't bad, but really aren't much of a challenge.\n\nThe execution of the hidden objects part of this game varies quite a lot between really easy and a bit cheesy. A barely visible outline of a puzzle piece is hidden like a speck in a busy background, feeling cheap and artificially difficult. Most of the rest of what you will find stands out enough that you won't miss them, but in some cases will want to remember where you'd seen them.\n\nThe logic puzzles were a lot more fair, and mostly quite easy as well. Some of them seemed more about testing the player's patience rather than their wits, others were trial and error. Some had no direction at all, and while I really enjoy this approach, leaving the player to figure out what to do, I can see how this might frustrate some. Fortunately there is a help stem in the game, and some users have posted guides in case you become confused about what to do next.\n\n\nMy monitor is large and has a slightly higher DPI, making this game appear really tiny on screen in widowed mode. In full screen the game was washed out, stretched horizontally, and fuzzy. Any option to adjust the resolution would have been appreciated.\n\nI liked the art style in this game, which reminded me of illustrated story books I read as a child.\n\nThe music was pretty relaxing, if a bit repetitive. I actually found it very fitting for this game's tone and relaxed pace. The sound effects were also good, if a bit generic.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Simple to get into\n    [*]Hand drawn art style\n    [*]Intuitive puzzles\n    [*]No hand holding\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Lacks challenge\n    [*]No resolution options\n    [*]Some puzzles are tedious\n[/list]\n\n[b]Verdict: 06/10[/b]\n\nAn easy to play game that feels made for kids and entry level hidden object game players.

Actual riddles, even tricky ones to solve. I played through the whole game and yes, there are some mini games, a few of which you might even use a minimum of brains on.

It's short but with nice graphics. If you like that, you can take your chance with this.

Even made me heavily engaged into resolving the puzzles & riddles. I consider this game as a short break from bigger titles, but with quite huge brain training potential. Here we go then:\n\nStoryline: 7/10\n\nYou're probably asking if there is any story in a puzzle game, but yes it is. Not a complicated one, but each level is tied to another and all are making one story. Quite nice story to be honest, that is stuck somewhere in the background, which makes solving the riddles have some point at all. I'll give it 7/10, because the story is logical and it is there, most of puzzle games don't have any story in the background at all.\n\nThe World: 8/10\n\nAnother section that is a suprise for puzzle game. However this title has such original and cozy world, that it is worth mentioning. It is even worth 8 points out of 10, because world presented here takes main idea from the \"The Little Prince\" story. You are playing on a very small planet (though bigger than in mentioned book) which has a lot of very pleasant places. So, suprisingly, a puzzle game gets higher grade for presented world, than many games that should have this thing made really better.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n\nVery nice graphics to look at, warm & cozy to be honest - makes you feel like you are at home, solving the real-world 1000 pieces puzzle. The graphics are also clear for your eyes, I mean, all elements that can be interacted with are easily spotted, though sometimes demanding. It's very well balanced and deserves 8/10 grade.\n\nSound & Music: 6.5/10\n\nSound effects are made perfectly, they don't exhaust you and perfectly pretend real life sounds. But music. Music... It's good - but only in the first hearing. Every replay of each song makes it worse and worse. I've spent like 3 hours in this game and I really don't want to hear its soundtrack again for the next year. Or decade. Or century...\n\nInterface: 10/10\n\nAs I've mentioned in the beginning, I would have never thought that I would have been so engaged by puzzle game. But the mechanics of this game, and riddles included there are so good that I've stopped playing any other games - I just wanted to solve all the things this Tiny Bang threw at me. Sure, some puzzles were really hard for me, e.g. [spoiler] some Leonardo Da Vinci math riddle and map of Earth with colours [/spoiler], and I must confess: I've used walkthrougs for these two, but every riddle is different from other and worth solving. So I think I'll give 10/10 for this section, as this game really shines for its genre basics.\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\nThat's it.

The entire story is that the world has literally fallen to pieces and you must put them back together. There are five sections of the game that you work through and all the while you must be on the lookout for puzzles pieces that are strewn across all of the different sections of the little world. At the end of each level, you use all of the puzzle pieces that you've collected in that area to continue to put the world back together in the form of a jigsaw puzzle. Other than that, there is very little else in the way of a storyline.\n\nIn total, there are twenty puzzles that are unique. There is also the ongoing jigsaw puzzle that I mentioned before to work on throughout the entire game. While a few of the puzzles can be a bit confusing, most of them are able to solved without too much difficulty. They are all generally relaxing to work through, with the exception of those few that are on the more difficult side.\n\nWhile you are continuously searching for puzzle pieces, you also must search for objects that will allow you to unlock the different puzzles. These objects are usually easy to spot, with a few that are a little on the tricky side. For those that are harder to find, you can use hints that you've earned by collecting little bugs that fly around the world. They saved me from total frustration more than once.\n\nThe art style is absolutely charming. I am not usually one for caring too much about the visual art in games but I found the style here to be quite endearing. It surely helps with the overall relaxing atmosphere of the game, along with the gentle music that plays in the background.\n\nThis is a must have for all who love hidden object games. I don't often play them anymore, but this brought back the memories I have of playing them when I was younger.

Once you can wrap your head around the logic of the game and fill in the gaps, you can move quickly through the levels with exception of 1 or 2 puzzles within each level that you may or may not understand and if you do, you may not know how to solve it or what the game wants exactly for you to solve the puzzle. \n\n[u]I've had to look up a walkthrough for every level of the game.[/u] Even when I knew the solution, it was never a \"Ohhhh I'm an idiot\" moment, it was more of a \"okay then...\" moment. It's not the most difficult point-and-click game out there, it just severely lacks references for you to understand what the game wants. Sometimes it is plain and simple, other times it's deceiving (compass puzzle, water pipes puzzle) and then there are puzzles that just feel like busy work. (fishing lure puzzle, image shitfing puzzles)\n\nIf the game added a little more context it would be more enjoyable and less confusing. It may take some of the difficulty away, but at least it wouldn't be as frustrating.\n\nAll that done though, the aesthetic of the game is pleasing and calm. It is definitely a game that's designed to be calm and relaxing. So although there is frustration, there's never a rush to beat the game. This is probably the best thing this game has done. It is rewarding to beat each section of the levels just again, it doesn't always feel fair. \n\nFor the price of $5, I wouldn't complain too much.

Estas en un peque\u00f1o planeta en el que vas a tener que solventar puzzles y buscar objetos para poder seguir avanzando por este. Son 5 partes del planeta a explorar.\n\nJugabilidad: Es una aventura hidden object. Estas en un planeta con puzzles a resolver y cientos de objetos que buscar.Una vez consigas todo, pasas a la siguiente pantalla, tras realizar un peque\u00f1o puzzle que existe entre pantallas, que b\u00e1sicamente es ir montando el planeta con las piezas que vas encontrando. Repites el proceso 5 veces, y terminas el juego. \n\nRespecto a la duraci\u00f3n, me ha llevado 3 horas. Hay un par de puzzles un poco liosos, pero por lo dem\u00e1s, no te quedar\u00e1s atascado. Aparte de que hay un asistente de ayuda en el caso de que hiciese falta.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos: Est\u00e1 todo hecho a mano con una posterior digitalizaci\u00f3n. El planeta es muy colorido, y tiene una atm\u00f3sfera entra\u00f1able. Para el tipo de juego que es, encajan bien.\n\nSonido: La banda sonora est\u00e1 bien. No son muchos temas, pero ambientan perfectamente el juego.\n\nEl juego no tiene voces ni subt\u00edtulos. Los \u00fanicos r\u00f3tulos que ver\u00e1s son los del men\u00fa. Si hablas con los pocos habitantes existentes, te indicar\u00e1n sus puzzles mediante vi\u00f1etas.\n\nNo he visto ning\u00fan bug y el juego tiene cromos, para quien pueda interesar.\n\nEn resumen, The Tiny Bang Story es una aventura Hidden Object, colorida, entra\u00f1able y sencilla, que te har\u00e1 pasar un tranquilo y buen rato.\n\nPROS\n+ La atm\u00f3sfera del juego est\u00e1 bien.

By the end of this game, it was getting tedious, samey. It wasn't just scouring the screens, but also how un-fun puzzle types (8-bit minigames) were recycled...Rather than every level having its own character, each level was built on the same template of puzzles.\nWithout extra things to interact with (scenery bells you can't ring), and puzzles that were frustratingly underclued (water puzzle in the last level), the charm started to wear off. I was glad when it ended and did not stick around for the bonuses.\nHolistically, the Amanita studios games are of better quality.

But I had to today. Just...my feelings are so strong I feel I have to.\n\nFrom an objective standpoint, it's a very good game. Well crafted, and you can tell a lot of love went into it. I feel a lot of people could enjoy this game. So take this as less of a 'negative review' and more an angry person's warning about what to be wary of.\n\n90% of this game is spent scouring the 3 screens at your disposal for 10 of something. You'll get a quest to find this many of this thing, take it back, then solve a puzzle or give it to a person. Do this enough and in the right order, you get to move on. No inventory management or item puzzles. While games don't need that to be fun, this one just feels like a really frustrating 'Spot the Difference' game with no second picture to cross-reference.\n\nThe single most frustrating part is how the things you need are always in the world, and you can see them as soon as you start the level. But you can't actually pick them up unless you have the quest that requires them. And did I mention that they're practically painted into the background sometimes? Because they are. Finding 20 marbles wouldn't be nearly as hard if they didn't put them on traffic lights to hide them. Also, each level has, like, 30 puzzle pieces in it, and finding all of them grants you access to the next level. Since these pieces are so crucial, it sure is great that they're invisible half the time! That, or they're super tiny, stashed away where you can't see them.\n\nAnother really infuriating part is how, on multiple occasions, the game will ask you to find a certain number of cogs. But there's these drains on the ground that look EXACTLY like the cogs you're looking for. So you spend a large chunk of time trying to get the game to register your click, only to discover you were supposed to pilfer the one from the telescope.\n\nA lot of puzzles come down to guesswork and just trying stuff hoping it will work. Some of them don't have a clear goal from the get-go, some of them seem designed to frustrate you, and a couple I couldn't figure out even when I had the hint box open.\n\nOh, yeah. There's a hint box. But it doesn't help when it will give you a wrong answer, then YOU have to reverse-engineer what they want you to do. Yeah, chances are, guys, that if I open the hint box, I'm already at my wit's end and really need a boost. You know. A HINT.\n\nIn levels 2 and 3, there are these painfully slow Atari style minigames that take like 5 years to complete and are mandatory. If you mess up once, you're dead and have to start from the beginning. They're not entertaining, and seem specially crafted to make me mad. There's also a puzzle during the first level, fresh out of the tutorial, that had no clear goal at all. Once I finally figured out what to do by happenstance, it was so easy. But getting there drove me up the wall.\n\nThe fullscreen function didn't work properly for me. I had to play the whole game in a tiny window. Again, spot the difference game with tiny differences and no reference picture. It's like the world's worst game of I SPY. The options menu is pitiful, just volume and semi-functional fullscreen. Don't even think about playing this game if you're colorblind. A puzzle in the 1st level requires color matching, as does the 2nd. And you'd never be able to find the puzzle pieces.\n\nI could go on and on about how one NPC asked me to get three apples but didn't give me a quest for it, meaning I couldn't collect them and had to click on a completely different part of the level to continue. Or how your main character is apparently a witch as they refuse to touch even the slightest bit of water to get a key. Or how one puzzle was literally just spinning a couple of compasses around until they line up (spoiler alert, they never do). Or how infuriating the jigsaw portions are, because 2/3 of the pieces you have are of the sky and all look the same. But I think I've overstayed my welcome as-is.\n\nIn conclusion, I hate this game.

The first is one of that same thing that plagues the Pixel Hunt sub-genre, in that you can't go two steps without wanting to tear out your hair for that [b]one last puzzle piece[/b]. The game hides puzzle pieces and collectibles well within the scenery, sometimes only a few pixels wide, demanding you comb through every scene with a fine-toothed comb, often when you've already cleared the screen, and it turns out your princess is in another castle.\n\nLuckily the music \"facilitates\" this, being relaxing and just long enough that it doesn't drive you crazy, but you'll get fed up with the game nonetheless.\n\nLittle Bang Story's hint feature alleviates the issue by pointing out the exact location of any remaining collectibles on-screen...with the caveat that it [b]only[/b] points out collectibles that are [u]on-screen[/u], [i]once[/i], and even then for every time you want to use the feature, you have to play a mind-numbing \"minigame\" involving the capture of little on-screen flies. You need to collect dozens of them as they slowly spawn, and you can spend upwards of a minute just getting a single hint. Then you might need to do it again and again until you find the last piece... That is, if you're on the correct screen to begin with. Since each stage has 4+ screens, and hints do not transfer between screens. The result is that you might spend upwards of 5 minutes collecting little bugs just to find a single missing collectible!\n\nAnd speaking of mind-numbing mini-games, LBS boasts having \"over 30 exciting brain teasers\", which roughly translates to having dozens on repetetive puzzles or click-the-balloon minigames that add little to the game, sometimes subtracting worth through sheer bad and/or utterly boring design(looking at you, boat-minigame!). Some of them are okay, but many  are also just \"put the picture back together\" type things, sort of like...\n\nJigsaw puzzles! They're littered through this game and come in many variants. From \"torn picture\" types, to sliding-block pictures, to strange transformative ones. By far the worst offender(unless you like them) is the single instance of a \"normal\" jigsaw puzzle. Throughout the game you pick up little puzzle pieces hidden in the environment, and at the end of a level you get to put the [i]next[/i] stage back together on the overworld. Putting it together wouldn't be so bad, except the game also animates the existing world, so it alters the edges, \"lying\" to you about which piece should fit where. Exacerbating this is that it's also one of those jigsaw puzzles that makes you put together the \"sky\", blurring blues and greys that seemingly go into the puzzle at random.\n\nSo if you think you can enjoy or work around and of the above issues, go right ahead.

When I first started playing, I was loving it - the first couple of levels were a joy to play, and the hint system (which requires an element of grind in order to get the hint) was a nice touch; frustrating enough to put me off reaching out for a hint, but simple enough to mean that when I really couldn't find that last piece of pipe, I had help at hand.  Sadly, the game went from an enjoyable brain-teaser challenge, to a painful chore and the need to fight the temptation to google answers.  This game came so close to being fantastic, but failed toward the finish.\n\n- Puzzle pieces to be collected on each level actually don't seem to have any effect, and it is astoundingly easy to irreversibly leave a level without intending to and without all puzzle pieces - despite the missing puzzle pieces, this seems to have no impact on the putting together of the jigsaw planet after the level!  Leaves you wondering why we are collecting the pieces in the first place.\n- Some of the later puzzles make no sense.  I understand that the puzzles should get more complex as the game progresses, but given the lack of any text (which is a really nice gameplay feature!) and no contextual clues (and some very bizarre hidden requirements) some puzzles end up being unpleasantly frustrating, and actually unsolvable based only on the clues to hand - in hindsight, they always make sense, but before knowing the answer there simply isn't enough information to rely on.  I don't mean like the 'Tetris piece' puzzle, which I found excrutiatingly difficult, but at least knew what to do and had to assume there was a correct layout of the pieces (which there was).  I mean like the 'compass alignment' puzzle, which freely allowed turning of the dial either clockwise our counter-clockwise, but which (for some unknown reason) required that you only turn it counter-clockwise.  If you set off attempting to achieve the seemingly simple solution, but happened to turn clockwise, you're doomed to half an hour of cursing at why the whole thing is lining up but not being counted as completed.  Bug, design fault, or intentional difficulty - I don't know, but - it's bad.  Also, the water pipes - I could understand the 'idea' behind the solution - using just 5 valves achieve a certain water course - but with no information on which direction the water is travelling, or whether the wheels would open or close the valve they were attached to, made what could have been an enjoyable head-scratcher into a disappointingly dull grind.\n- Some of the puzzle design felt like it had been given up on.  Earlier in the game, you would discover a puzzle which first required pieces to be collected (such as light bulbs, pieces of pipe, or dice)  and once these were put into the puzzle, you had to then solve the puzzle.  Later, you collect clock hands and numerals, and find that as soon as you add them to the clock face not only is that puzzle solved, but that whole level is done - and without a hint of anything resembling a departure (like an elevator, plane or boat) you leave the 'level' and the game is done.\n\nFrustrated & disappointed...", "timestamp_created": 1539366065, "timestamp_updated": 1539366065, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45228533": {"recommendationid": "45228533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198825010795", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1539331502}, "language": "english", "review": "Too hard for a kid, too meaningless for an adult!\n\n- In a hidden object game you want to join an adventure, a story.

Click pictures to collect stuff, find and solve puzzles. It looks good and sounds nice, but... that's where things end unfortunately.\nPlaying full-screen is a no-go, you're still stuck with a small drawing area surrounded by massive black borders. And also the mouse cursor goes jittery and the game regularly fails to respond to clicks.\nWindowed mode is not much better, as there's still some puzzles and minigames that don't respond very well.\nStory is... a lot more vague than it needs to be. You go to a few different worlds, visit a few people, jigsaw the world back together and then basically nothing happens. hum.\nAdd in an objective to collect said jigsaw pieces, which are mostly pretty well hidden, which you can just skip past.\nThere's also one of the more clumsy hint systems in the genre: click 30 flying bugs, then click the hint button to watch a bug slowly fly towards a point of interest. Accidentally click somewhere before the bug gets there and do that all over again.\nThose hint bugs will also go and point out the ultimately useless jigsaw pieces for good measure.\nTo top things off, the objectives per scene/stage/level also appear to be fairly random, again probably because the narrative to go wth the surreal images decides to not make sense.\n\nThis then hits a bottom line where something that looks like it should be interessting enough, just isn't.

Some puzzles need to be completed to receive a piece to complete another puzzle. The music is pleasnt, and even after time does not become irritating. The imagery is nicely drawn and a good deal of thought and effort has been put in to hiding the pieces.\nMost of the mini-game puzzles offer a casual challenge, while others are simply jigsaws.\nHowever the game is seriously marred by a number of ill-thought puzzles and design flaws. Firstly a number of puzzles are colour based, and given the pastel colour scheme this makes the gameplay inaccessible to colourblind users. There are no options to assist those with colour-deficient sight. This leads to an incredibly frustrating experiece. There is one \"puzzle\" where you play that colour memory game \"Simon\". Infuriatingly, a mistake made can leave you having to start all over again, and the number or successes needed to complete the puzzle is too much to even stand a chance of \"being lucky\". There isn't even an option to skip a puzzle if you fail it several times. Another colour puzzle gives you six pastel colours, and you have to sort and arrange squares of differing shades/saturation into order for the parent colour. Practically impossible for a colourblind user, even with a walkthrough to hand. (If you don't understand why this is difficult, set your display to back and white, and see how well you manage).\nA number of the puzzles offer no explanation as to what is required to complete them, and the in-game help system for these puzzles is also inadequate. One such puzzle is the fountain pipes.\nLastly, there are hidden jigsaw pieces to collect, which are challengingly hidden. However collecting these pieces serves no purpose. You can complete a level without warning, and not having collected all the pieces. There is no penalty for not collecting all the pieces, which sort of makes this game element pointless. With regards to completing a level without warning, you can't go back to replay, or finish collecting puzzle pieces.\nThe very last level is another element of confusion. With just two rooms, there appears to be nothing to collect, and you're presented with all the mini-game puzzles you've encountered so far, and it's not clear what you're required to do.  It seems this level is not a level, but simply there to offer you the chance to replay puzzles from the game. This is rather disapionting because it's dressed up as a level, which it isn't, and replaying the puzzles in this way serves no real purpose i.e. completing the puzzles in a faster time. You might as well replay the entire game. Other games simply offer this kind of replay function from the game menu once the game has been complete.\n\nThis game was made available for free in the Steam Store.", "timestamp_created": 1537999398, "timestamp_updated": 1538221294, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44956193": {"recommendationid": "44956193", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982163061", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1540264942}, "language": "english", "review": "Most of the puzzles are too easy, but even the hard ones aren't difficult because they make you think.

If on the last real exploratory area you have the sound muted for any reason (The musics pretty decent, though) and attempt to enter the final area the game will hard crash every time. i had two virtually complete goes at it including an uninstall before finding that solution.\n\nReplay value is limited, as it's really only the mini games from the final area that you can do again, without replaying the whole thing. It's doesn't vary so once solved it's kind of done. Despite that it's not a time spent I regret so I'd have to say. Yeah give it a try.

There are 5 small chapters. Each has 4 full size locations and a couple of small ones. Most of the time you need to seek objects on the map. Each level have 4 puzzles. They are different and simple, except 2-3.\n\nIn overall, the game is just awesome. I am not fun of Point & Click games, but this one is in my heart now.

The found objects serve to activate a number of quick and small puzzle games which in turn unlock other objects to find or forward to the next area. \n\nAs small as the world is presented, so rich in detail are the neatly drawn pictures. Its art style is in the like of a children's book with impossible constructions set in a fabled, munchkin sized environment. Correspondingly, the soundtrack offers rich, upbeat compositions that stand out but don't disrupt any intense eyeing or puzzling.\n\nIn light of the fact that this is a game appropriate for children, the puzzles are compact and reasonable, potentially too easy for more experienced puzzle people. The Tiny Bang Story draws on the immense pool of casual puzzles, incorporating sliding, pipe and jigsaw puzzles, among other classics of the genre.\n\nThe one thing that felt amiss was the often abrupt completion of an area without warning.

More than one good, and one that is really bad.\n\nThe first thing you realise when playing this game is that you need patience. You need patience to find different items to progress,  patience to find the puzzle pieces and also finishing minigames.\n\nFirst take the positive. The music is nice, the game is relaxing and it has nice graphics for a 2D game. However the game, no matter how pretty it is, can eventually turn boring, if you can't find the items you are looking for. That was the least of my problems in this game. They always ended up being found anyway.\n\nMy biggest problem was the minigames, and especially those with color. I am colorblind for bright green, and dark yellow, or something in between, so two of the puzzles in the game were almost impossible to finish without help from a friend. One game where I only saw 2 colors, there were actually 3 colors, and in another color puzzle I had put the yellows on the green, and the green on the yellows. You get the point.

The whole concept of the story is to gather puzzle pieces in order to retore your planet from the tiny bang, And that is pretty much it. The secenenry does tell a story, but it doesn't get in deppth. The only recurring character you see is the chubby guy as the game icon. Not much after.\n\n-There are 2 puzzles that is similar to the action genre. Don't get hit while you are travling. The only two problems I have with those puzzles is that it requires you to use the mouse to click on the buttons while the game advacning every frame. It took me a while to complete those puzzles because I reacted to fast or that I couldn't get comfortable with the controls. \n\n-The game is too short. It took me apporximatley 2 hours to finish the game. I wish it lasted longer. Once you beat the game, you have access to the puzzles you beat before. \n\nOther than those flaws, I enjoyed my experience. But if you were to buy this game, wait for a sale.

I think the key is that it is never so difficult that the gameplay comes to a stop, even while always feeling challenged. So, I would really enjoy getting more games like this one.

(Not finished yet.) \nVery nice artwork, very clean, crisp and colorful. The cratoonish style suits it well.\nIt is not really a Hidden Object game (only User-defined tags say it is... the dev's official tags say Adventure, Casual, Indie. Which it is.)\nYes, you have to find pieces for completing projects and puzzles, but none are really hidden. Some are just harder to spot than others, lol! Maybe borderline HOPA, with more P (puzzles) than HO (hidden objects). Some puzzles are quite easy, some are more difficult to figure out. Some can be quite frustrating to figure out what you need to do, since there is no in game guide or tutorial to help you along. However, this makes you think, and also prevents bad language localizations/bad translations. \nHints are easy to earn, by clicking the little mosquitos lying around until the hint bubble is filled. Some hints aren't as helpful as they could be though, and there is no penalty for using hint after hint. Kind of disappointed with that \"feature\", but it is a casual game, not a hardcore one. \n\nRuns beautifully on a toaster, even a very toasty toaster. Not hard on the CPU or GPU at all. No crashes or bugs found in over 5 hours of play so far, and I am not expecting to see any. \n\nGood time killer, that I found to be best played in short sessions (finish 1 puzzle or area, then take a break... for me, anyhow).The story is not clear, but for me, that was fine, as I enjoy imagining my own story as I play. The music was good, soothing, not overwhelming, nothing great, but nothing terrible. Good amount of things that made me chuckle or smile so far\n\nI still feel it is worth the full asking price, but getting it at discount would be good, if you can. The price/hour is quite reasonable at full price.\n\nJust my opinions on the game. Your Mileage May Vary. Widely. \n\nBut I am looking forward to seeing what this little Indie Studio comes up with next.", "timestamp_created": 1510769546, "timestamp_updated": 1510769546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588934123516082764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36519161": {"recommendationid": "36519161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027425281", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 616, "last_played": 1512149345}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not recommending this game because my mouse is ruined while solving stupid puzzles.

Collect the little blue bugs and eventually you'll earn enough that you can use a little red bug to find whatever's on the screen that you've missed (or confirm that there's nothing there to find). You can also use the hint system to get what are often necessary hints as to what to do in the mini-games. In fact, sometimes you're given full solutions - but be aware that sometimes these \"solutions\" are actually lies.\n\nCons:\n- Badly designed. It's quite possible to leave an area forever without collecting all of the area's puzzle pieces, and some areas somehow have too many. Granted, this didn't cause any problems later on (you'll always have enough puzzle pieces to build the World puzzle), but it still annoyed me.\n\n- I loathed several of the mini-games, in particular the two fake arcade games and the water wheel puzzle. Unlike some reviewers, I did feel that the game provided enough information to figure out what to do with the various puzzles, but sometimes those puzzles were just plain annoying. With the water wheel puzzle, I got too frustrated trying to figure out the pipe paths, and the arcade games had terrible controls and were a chore to get through.\n\n- It was a good thing that the World puzzle pieces stuck in place when they were in the correct spot, because the colors of several of them were off (mainly the all blue and white ones) and I'd never have figured out where they were supposed to go otherwise.\n\n- Full-screen mode is glitchy and not truly full-screen with my screen resolution (1920 x 1080) - there were black bars around the image and everything was a little stretched. Display settings were very basic, so there was no way to even try to fix these issues. I ended up playing in windowed mode.\n\n- I actually checked a walkthrough to make sure I'd really finished the game. The ending came very suddenly and looked like it might potentially be some kind of epilogue, but not so much. You could listen to any music track from the game and replay the mini-games and that was it. The mini-games didn't have good replay value, so it felt pretty pointless.\n\nOverall, this was a disappointment. The atmosphere is great and the puzzle difficulty level is usually pretty good, but it has some appalling design issues and I hated the first arcade mini-game so much that I almost rage-quit when I came across the second one.", "timestamp_created": 1503779518, "timestamp_updated": 1503780005, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49000665545463562", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34508213": {"recommendationid": "34508213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118550497", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1503761704}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is great in general: well-hidden objects, fun and all-around types of quiz (sometimes I found myself so close to smashing my mouse though).

I believe the artwork alone is well worth the regular retail price.  One comment for those beginning to play the game.  There are obvious shapes to collect that you will see right away, but you often need to complete the collection of an earlier shape before you can start to collect the others (complete the early quest first).

I got it in a bundle on sale so for the price I actually paid, it was worth it.  I highly doubt I'll replay the game.  I recommend it at the price I paid if you absolutely love these little games.  Full price, I'm not sure.\n\nIt has the hidden objects as well as mini puzzles and when you fiinish the game you can just play the little puzzles.  There are hints that you can use for some of the hidden objects that require you to fill it up to use it.  The puzzles had a hint about what you need to do to solve it, not a hint that was helpful in solving the puzzle if you got stuck just a hint on the mechanics.  To some that's a problem others a bonus.\n\nThe issues I had were with the hidden object portion of the game.  \n[olist]\n    [*]You had to find puzzle pieces throughout and it gave you a number of how many to find.  It worked perfectly for the first chapter.  On the second I got stuck because it said I found all my puzzle pieces but I couldn't go forward.  Using the hint it came up with a puzzle piece that I'm almost positive I'd already gotten and I couldn't see anymore.  But apparently it was there.  For the last two chapters each time it said I was missing pieces but I continued on without a problem.  Even checking with guides showed that I had all the ones they had.\n    [*]The other items you had to find were parts of little machines and puzzles you needed to do in order to progress.  You knew what they were because they were all over the place, but you couldn't collect them until you triiggered that little device.  So you end up running back and forth over the same three or four little areas collecting things over and over again.  That got a little old by the end.\n[/olist]\n\nOverall I'm pleased with this as it was bonus game for me.\n", "timestamp_created": 1498347745, "timestamp_updated": 1498347745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32736943": {"recommendationid": "32736943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218435121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1498585549}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice graphics\nshort and relaxing game", "timestamp_created": 1498326829, "timestamp_updated": 1498326829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32665565": {"recommendationid": "32665565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025267880", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1498193547}, "language": "english", "review": "Tiny Bang Story is a cute little mouse-only point-and-click puzzle game with mechanics similar to Machinarium and other type games. It's pretty short, but it's got a pretty good spread of puzzles. Nothing you probably haven't seem before: lots of jigsaw puzzles, sliding piece puzzle to make a picture, move-all-the-pieces-to-the-correct-spot-with-only-one-free-space, some old-school arcade games like fly-your-ship-down-a-maze-and-don't-run-into-walls, and your generic hunt-for-10-components hidden object puzzles. But even when you immediately know what to do (i.e. all the Tetris-looking blocks need to fit into a rectangular space with no holes), actually doing them can take quite a bit of effort.\n\nThis game also does a couple of interesting things, though although these are all positives, they also become rather tedious after a while: \n\n1) the hint system. You have a bar to fill up to get a hint (normal), but you have to collect little flying insects to fill up the bar (interesting). However, it takes a LOT of them, and if you're stuck on two different items you're trying to find, expect to do a lot of clicking.\n2) It's linear, but non-linear (if that makes sense). You definitely have a certain sequence to follow (e.g. find 10 of these things to unlock a puzzle, which gives you a key, which opens a door, which reveals another puzzle that needs 15 of this other thing to open, etc.) However, you can have multiple TYPES of things to search for at any given time, and for each of those TYPES, there are tons of actual ITEMS to find. However, since there is some linearity to it, you'll start to notice a ton of a given item but be unable to pick them up until you find the machine or door that requires all those items. This makes for a lot of \"Now, where did I see that thing earlier?\" hunting.\n\nIt's got cute art, and a neat (but simple) story of you trying to put back your tiny little world. Putting back the world is actually a puzzle in itself (a literal jigsaw puzzle), which is a nice little detail.\n\nSo, is this game groundbreaking? Hell no. Is it worth full price? Probably not.

The art style is lovely and unique (many p&c games look as if they use the same assets, not here) and the music is relaxing. There doesn't seem to be much of a story, and the puzzles are standard fare - find so many of this object, slider puzzles, color matching, etc. If you get stumped, you can collect flies that periodically show up on screen to fill up your hint bubble, though hints will only work if you're on the correct screen where the object you're looking for resides. Clicking the hint bubble on a screen where there are no objects yields nothing, and no tooltip or anything to let you know to move along.\n\nWhere the game started go to sour for me was the arcade-style minigames. They are very slow, moving frame by frame every second. In one you move a boat through water, avoiding whales and mines. It took a few tries to get the hang of, but it wasn't too bad. Not exactly what I had in mind when I bought the game, and it felt like it went on a bit longer than necessary, but I could look past it. The second arcade-style minigame, though... I find quite frustrating. You move a plane left to right as it's flying down, avoiding the bad black planes as well as obstacles in the form of trees. This minigame is much more difficult, and is where I stopped playing. If you don't move at the exact right moment, or choose the wrong path, you crash and have to start over. I'm only in the third chapter of the game, so I don't know how many more minigames of this style are waiting for me, and I don't much care to find out. I had to take a break out of frustration, and wonder if the frustration is even worth continuing to play.\n\nFor this reason, I would not recommend this game. It has a lot more going for it than the few annoying arcade minigames, but those stand out quite a bit if they're not your cup of tea (as is the case for me). It's such a shame as the art style is so nice.

Catch enough fireflies and the hint button in the upper right corner will fill up with blue, available to you in most areas of the game when you just need a small nudge to finish a challenge.\n\nOverall, I love \"The Tiny Bang Story\" and I recommend it for all puzzle lovers.", "timestamp_created": 1480019581, "timestamp_updated": 1480019581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503058075904846191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27252196": {"recommendationid": "27252196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014591768", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1480008938}, "language": "english", "review": "Very relaxing game.

On starting each chapter you're shown a beautifully hand-drawn environment that usually requires finding a number of objects. As you click on these objects they are collected and stored. Before long you'll realise to progress, and see another funny/peculiar screen, you have to dig around. The goal of each chapter is usually to find an ultimate component that sets some sort of mechanism in motion. Puzzles and games were perfectly-pitched being neither too easy nor too hard and the well-designed environments always made the experience a fun an enjoyable one.There is a very good hint system - where you fill up the question mark meter by clicking on the buzzing flies - but I still had to resort to a couple of visits to YouTube. However, these occurrences were few and didn't ruin immersion. \n\n[u]PRESENTATION & DESIGN[/u]\nTBS is not only a very well-presented production but an inventive one as well. The hand-drawn environments are like those beautiful picture books you stared at and found so intriguing when you were a child. Massive attention to detail has been made in the artwork department and the sound also suits the visual tone harmoniously. A delicate, melodic piece is heard as you play; subtle enough to be enjoyed but not intrusive enough to put you off. Sound effects are spot-on as well. The game consists of about five or six chapters that might take about an hour each to complete. At the end of each chapter you get to fill in daytime pieces of a globe that cleverly shows your progression. It's a good system as it divides the game into five or six parts and, like a book, allows you to take a break at convenient points. \n\n[u]CONCLUSION[/u]\nThere are text-heavy adventure games that require you to wade through mountains of dialogue and then there are breezier adventure games with the emphasis on actually playing a game! The Tiny Bang Story may not be for everyone as it will certainly make you stop to think and may even bring in mild frustration as you search maddeningly for that last elusive piece but, for me, I put it at one of my personal favourite adventure games.\n\n4/5\n\n\nFor the full review of this and other games please check out or follow my curator page at:\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26108770-Parsons%27-Garden/]Parsons' Garden[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1475278430, "timestamp_updated": 1475278619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25781330": {"recommendationid": "25781330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120686553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 350, "last_played": 1475240971}, "language": "english", "review": "I was not blown away by this game.

It's a nice little title, unpretentious and pleasantly relaxing, but only if you can get it to run.[/h1]\n\nLocating various recurring objects is required to access locked areas or repair machines. You can't collect these series until they're explicitly needed. Each chapter is reasonably sized so backtracking through scenes is simple enough. You can usually tell in advance when certain objects will be required eventually upon spotting their multiplicity.\n\nDelightfully detailed backgrounds with a lovely surreal Eastern European vibe can be favorably compared to some of Amanita Design's excellent games, more specifically [url=steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/recommended/40700]Machinarium[/url].\n\nAccessible UI keeps track of the items you've collected and how many more you need, with a reminder of where they'll be useful once you have a completed set. Acquire conventional puzzle pieces throughout each of the 5 chapters to put the world map back together. Most of them blend quite well with the environment.\n\nPuzzles range from a variety of simple jigsaws to fine variations on common logic puzzles. You will put a lot of things back together. There's nothing truly revolutionary here but everything is well presented and only a few puzzles are really difficult. Hints are available on demand but they sometimes directly reveal the answer or are not helpful at all.\n\nIt turns out to be a very relaxing and pleasant experience, except for arcade sequences that feel out of place and defiantly ruin the mood with their needlessly poor controls. Thankfully they are short and few.\n\n[h1]Beware some potentially serious technical hiccups.[/h1]\n\n[i]Warning: Under no circumstance should you attempt to play the game in full screen mode.[/i] I initially gave this game a negative score because it constantly presented a blank screen and subsequent exit to desktop, without any way to fix it despite clean reinstalls.\n\nThe game did run fine on my secondary work laptop, but I never attempted the full screen option for fear of locking myself out of a potentially good game. You too may be forced to play on a tiny window since the game runs in a very low resolution on today's HD monitors.", "timestamp_created": 1475121289, "timestamp_updated": 1475121289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25653932": {"recommendationid": "25653932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093220384", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1444582802}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice, if unspectacular point and click, hidden object game. Throughout five chapters, each made up of about four screens filled with things to interact with, you'll click on various people or mechanisms to initiate quests to find some hidden items they require. Once found and brought back, it will typically trigger a mini puzzle of some kind and give you another item upon completion that'll help you progress further. That's basically the long and short of it.\n\nThere is some kind of story about a meteor hitting \"Tiny Planet\" and scattering the world apart in the form of jigsaw pieces which are hidden all over the place, but it's largely inconsequential and serves only to back up a puzzle mechanic and explain how you access each chapter in turn (even though the jigsaw pieces aren't actually necessary to move on). There also seems to be a recurring character that appears in paintings and photographs showing him at different stages as he grows up, but the significance of this is never explained. Presumably we're retracing his steps in places that either he had an impact on, or which had an impact on him. It's hard to tell, and to be perfectly honest, even harder to care, since this is never expanded upon in any meaningful way or as any clear goal for the player.\n\nMost of the puzzles and hidden objects are pretty fun and fair deals, but occasionally there's the odd obscure one that will have you either losing all faith in humanity, or else looking up a guide. I'm also really not a fan of them messing with the scale of the hidden objects, like having large jigsaw pieces in one place, then other, much small ones in other places yet still at the same distance away from the camera perspective. More consistancy of scale with the objects would be appreciated.\n\nYou'll have a fun, if not somewhat forgettable, two or so hours with the game, and have the option to replay any puzzle when you reach the end... which is possibly the most anti-climactic end I've ever experienced in a game.

Each level ends with a little jigsaw puzzle on the main menue but since the outline is drawn in the background this is no brain teaser. Creative nonetheless.\nThe graphics are beautiful and cute, the music is just lovely, simple and does not distract from the gameplay. There is no narration, you have to figure the steps out by yourself - but that's not really hard.\n\nLittle annoyances:\n- You do have a hint button but I found that you're faster by not relying on it too much (or at all). It does what it wants or so it seemed. Most times it just didn't do anything so in the end it's just like there's no hint button; Which is no big deal.\n- Also there was one bug at the end where I couldn't collect the last few pieces of the jigsaw and the game thought I was done and closed the level but when I was at the main menue to put them together I had all the pieces... \n\nIt's not at all hard but it's nice, a brilliant puzzle game and very good for a little breather in between because of the wonderful athmosphere and relaxing music.

I love all of these features, then what went wrong?\n\nThe game basically doesn't contain any written or spoken text, and any hints it gives about objectives or solutions are extremely sparse and unhelpful. Thus a significant portion of my playtime was spent wandering around the same handful of screens, trying to figure out [i]what the game wants me to do[/i].\n\nOnce you [i]do[/i] figure it out, the rest of the time is spent either hunting minute objects that you've passed many times before, but only become collectable when the game decides to do so, or doing one of the quite difficult puzzles (without a skip function and barely a single hint! annoying!) or one of the timed minigames (which really don't fit to the otherwise quite laidback gameplay).\n\nTo acquire any kind of help from the game, you have to collect 30 little floating bugs for each use of the hint button, and even then it only showed a hint to me on puzzle screens, not when I spent ages looking for the last few tiny objects in the general game screens.\n\nDespite the art style being pleasant, the game seems to have quite a confusion on what visual theme it wants to pursue - the end result is a haphazard mix of fairytale, steampunk-ish and retro-futuristic elements.\n\nAnother noticeable thing for me was the lack of \"player character\". There's no body through which a player acts, feeling like I was some invisible disembodied force which still needed lifts and ladders to get to various places, resulting in the weird, empty feeling of both being there and not being there. It was probably one of the reasons why I didn't connect emotionally with the game at all - it felt like a soulless exercise of cookie-cutter charm.\n\nThrough my playtime the game felt more and more like a chore that I just wanted to be over and done with - then I remembered that games are supposed to be fun, and just dropped it altogether.

In reality, it's not.  Yes.  There are teeny tiny little objects to be found throughout the game.  But, that's not what a HOG is.  It's not really that important since other things swamp my rating.  But, it's something to be aware of.  The big thing that hurts the game is that nothing (absolutely nothing) is explained.  We're dumped into a setting with no idea what we're supposed to do, how to do it, or why.  The next biggest issues is somewhat related:  once we figure out what we're doing, we get into mini-puzzles.  But, once again, we're given no idea what to do with them.  Most of them can be figured out with the hint they give us.  But, some of them remain entirely opaque (I finished several by blindly flailing around with the mouse and never understood what I'd done to \"succeed\").  Next, as we move around the screen looking for those hidden objects or the secret areas they might be in, the cursor doesn't change to indicate any \"hot\" zones.  Basically, the game turns into a click-fest because we have to click on every single thing we see in case it's important.  And finally, the puzzles and objects aren't necessarily \"necessary\" to the game.  In the second area, I skipped a puzzle so I could come back to it later.  I ended up brute-forcing another puzzle which, I think, the puzzle I skipped was supposed to open.  The game happily let me do this and leave the area without ever finishing that puzzle.  In the third area, I finished the last puzzle before gathering the last hidden puzzle piece.  When I placed the object from that last puzzle where it belonged, the game happily moved me from the area and gave me all the puzzle pieces I needed for the world-puzzle.\n\nI got 4.0 hours of game-play out of this.

From the music to the charming little puzzles interspersed throughout, you'll find much more than a time waster on your hands. \n\nWith no conventional story to be had, the whole plot basically revolves around collecting the puzzle pieces that make up the world. You'll encounter an individual character in each area, and you'll see a broad narrative of a young boy's adventures as you go, but it's mainly background. Everything in this game is hidden in plain site, but a keen eye can spot the majority of the items often before you even need to pick them up. This is all bundled in an absolutely gorgeous art style that makes use of pastels to give an authentic painting look. Every puzzle has its own twist, and there was only one puzzle out of the dozens I encountered that seemed to not follow any discernable logic. Some of the puzzles you encounter are often more mini-games than anything, from a simon-says challenge to some challenges that look like they came straight from a Commodore 64. Variety isn't something I was expecting with this, but by god is there a lot.\n\nThe only hiccups in design is that once you leave an area, you can't return. Not that I found anyway. The early areas indicate the ending through obvious cues, but some of the last areas aren't as obvious, and it led to me leaving behind a few as yet unfound puzzle pieces (I think 3 in all). Curiously, I was still able to put the world back together without a single piece left out so it's not a big deal, but my OCD aches that I couldn't get the other pieces. That, and the hint system is nearly worthless, and kind of a pain in the butt to charge. You have to collect dozens of bugs for one use, and no matter if it's charged or not they still litter the screen. You won't need the hint system generally though, so it's all minor gripes, but a desire to turn off the bug hints was rather high for me.\n\nThere are few games that can put me at piece as easily as this one did, and it served as a wonderful sleepaid after work and the like.

The good things it has going for it are that the soundtrack is good, the hidden object gameplay is relaxing and satisfying, and the art is absolutely amazing. The art is very reminiscent of Amanita Design (e.g. Samarost, Machinarium).\n\nOne important thing to note about Tiny Bang Story that will make it or break it for you, though, is that the hidden object gameplay is periodically broken up by actual puzzles you have to solve or mini-arcade games where you have to navigate a pixel boat or airplane through some pixel trees and rocks, etc. These little puzzles and mini-games add more flavor and variety to the game, so on one hand they are welcome. On the other hand, the little atari-style mini games are not very fun, and they go on for what seems like an excessively long time, and if you make one mistake, you have to start the whole tedious thing over again. The puzzles are usually of the jigsaw or tangram variety, but there are some permutation or mathematical puzzles in there as well. At first these are very light and easy, but by the time you make it to the third or fourth area of the world, they suddenly become way more demanding and can be very cumbersome (I especially disliked the puzzle where you have to balance the luggage on the scales and the astrolabe puzzle is just objectively terribly designed). This is especially true if you are primarily interested in the hidden object gameplay. You may find yourself wanting to just look up the solution so you can get back to searching for hidden objects and avoid being obstructed by these.\n\nThe game also has a hint system, which you can activate by swatting a bunch of flies until you fill up a hint meter, but in my experience, there were 2 or 3 situations where I pressed the hint button and it either did not give any hint at all (literally did nothing) or it gave me an absolutely useless hint, essentially telling me what my objective is or some other such information I already know.\n\nOverall it seems like a pretty good game. I enjoyed the art and music, and I enjoyed how relaxing and warm it is. I personally felt the puzzles and mini-games got to be too cumbersome after a certain point, so I've lost my interest in finishing it, but it will be a very good game for the right kind of person.", "timestamp_created": 1434853685, "timestamp_updated": 1680077903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517663240432739258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16542074": {"recommendationid": "16542074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042757315", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 154, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1563795134}, "language": "english", "review": "Positives :\n1- Its very cute and charming\n2- The music is relaxing\n3- Puzzles can be interesting in a passtime way\n\nNegatives\n1- Too many hidden object goals, with some being utterly camouflaged and/or incredibly tiny. These are required.\n2- Jigsaw puzzles are long, annoying and frustating. On top of it, the music decided to stop so I quit.\n3- The hint system is dumb - you have to click flies over and over and over and over... why? just... why?\n4- Complete lack of story. \n5- Perfect for an iPad ; for the kids to have a clickfest and look for the things together while in the car. On PC though, it just doesn't work - besides theres much more fun things to play.\n\nPlay Machinarium instead.
