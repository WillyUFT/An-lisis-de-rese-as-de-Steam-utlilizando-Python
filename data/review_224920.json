It controls and plays wonderfully, borrowing elements from The Legend of Zelda with back-tracking and exploration more akin to Super Metroid, or the later Castlevania games. It is more than apt that fans have continued to follow the Nosgoth universe, as well as the rest of the Legacy of Kain series, well beyond Soul Reaver's initial release.\n\nHowever, with that all said, Soul Reaver on PC does not hold up.\n\nThis port loses much of the seamless nature of Soul Reaver's design, and as a result, the game's identity suffers as a result of that. The audio is hit the hardest with obvious fades implemented on audio tracks rather than continuously looping and blending naturally between different areas of the map. Outside of that though, sound just randomly breaks, with odd popping and crackling and even some of the effects playing at a much delayed rate... Or not at all even.\n\nTo be fair, it is otherwise a dramatic improvement over the PlayStation version, with graphical settings that will scale however far you want. Using mods as well, you can introduce higher frame-rates and potentially get better looking textures and models as well, although these often come with their own quirks and create new problems as well.\n\nI don't want to disparage anyone from wanting to play Soul Reaver, honestly, go out and enjoy it but do so on hardware that can (i.e. Playstation) if you find the option to. The PC version was palatable back in 1998 because it ran appropriately for hardware of the day, but unfortunately time hasn't been as kind to what now feels like a slapdash conversion of something that deserves so, so much better.\n\nFingers crossed this does eventually get the Nightdive Studios treatment because it totally needs (and deserves) it.", "timestamp_created": 1699487034, "timestamp_updated": 1699487104, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540094375610351563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149078241": {"recommendationid": "149078241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016354565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1695084521}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no funciona con windows 11 ni 10 deber\u00edan devolver el dinero", "timestamp_created": 1698525969, "timestamp_updated": 1698525969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147897213": {"recommendationid": "147897213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067112561", "num_games_owned": 909, "num_reviews": 235, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1696607521}, "language": "english", "review": "LOK is, without a shadow of doubt, my favourite game.

Unstable, camera sucks, puzzles don't take advantage of the game's mechanics, and combat isn't worth the trouble.\n\nThe Soul Reaver series was highly recommended to me once upon a time, though it took me almost 10 years to actually get around to beating one.  It's got some great things going for it, but ultimately I finished it more for the sake of completion than because I actually enjoyed it.  For starters, even getting it to run can be difficult, and even once that's solved, the game is hardly stable, especially for audio.  Beyond technical issues, the gameplay also doesn't hold up well.  As I see it, there are 3 main facets of the gameplay - platforming, puzzles, and combat - each with their own problems:\n\nPlatforming:  This sucks mainly because of the camera.  This game was clearly meant to be played on a console, and it shows.  There's no mouse look in vanilla, and even mods can only partially fix that.  Moving in some places automatically moves the camera, which can be nice but only when you're doing exactly what the auto movement is meant to help with - otherwise it's just disorienting.  Tapping a key to make fine camera adjustments instead recenters the camera, which can be frustrating when you're trying to line up a precise jump on a time crunch.  Looking up and down is slow and prevents you from doing most other actions.  With no map, only symbols identifying each Gate, and the camera being what it is, just trying to remember where you've been, let alone finding new areas or secrets, can be a pain.\n\nPuzzles:  Here, the Silent Cathedral is an example of the worst issues.  With little context for what I'm doing and why, some puzzles are solved just by exploring the level and interacting with every \"thing that I can interact with\" until something desirable happens.  You can only Shift to the Physical realm in fixed spots, so puzzles involving Shifting are usually glaringly obvious.  Worst of all are the block puzzles.  Dear god are there a LOT of block puzzles.  Once you learn that you can stack and rotate blocks, solving the puzzles takes little headwork but a lot of time.\n\nCombat:  Combat straight-up sucks.  You lose the Soul Reaver upon taking any damage, and after that are forced to rely on your environment to actually kill enemies.  This is mostly fine if spears or torches are available, but my soul dies every time I'm forced to rely on throwing enemies to kill them.  The camera issues make this a difficult affair, and your throw has no aim assist - miss by a few degrees, stand too close or too far from the spike, and the enemy will bounce harmlessly off.  Glyphs are more significant for the optional puzzles required to gain them than for actually using them; they're not that useful, the menu is clunky, and overall they feel like an afterthought (for the record, I found all of them, including the Fire Reaver).  Enemies infinitely (and rapidly) respawn, and you're liable to lose more health by fighting them than you'd gain by consuming their souls, so you're better off completely bypassing enemies unless combat is the only option.\n\nTo end on a positive note, here are some things I liked about Soul Reaver:  The dialog and voice acting are PHENOMENAL.  I could listen to Kain and Raziel exchange verbal spears all day long.  The lore is also quite interesting, and my exploration rewarding me with just a little bit more information about this world was what kept me going through the dull parts.  The difference in physics and abilities between the Physical and Spectral realm is the most interesting part of the gameplay, and if I was to remake Soul Reaver, that's what I would focus on - rather than block puzzles.\n\nOverall, I can't really recommend playing it.  There's a TON of potential here, and I'd love to see a modern re-imagining that can take advantage of it, but as-is, it's aged poorly.", "timestamp_created": 1696127810, "timestamp_updated": 1696185993, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146607426": {"recommendationid": "146607426", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998600526", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2101, "last_played": 1690718580}, "language": "english", "review": "Good old memories.", "timestamp_created": 1695151158, "timestamp_updated": 1695151158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146475391": {"recommendationid": "146475391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328499405", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 807, "last_played": 1594058065}, "language": "english", "review": "The first video game I ever played, back when I was just a small child!

I have also been playing this on my steamdeck via retrodeck, grabbed a copy of the og ps1 disk second hand, so the following GLOWING PRAISE better be seen as such, especially since its not available on this platform right now. GOG has also removed it. The rights are now in the hands of Embracer group...with any luck they will see value in it. For now, i recommend getting it however you can, because its nearing abandon ware territory for the pc platform, I don't think its even available in the back catalog of streamables on the playstation plus service.\n\nI digress. I did not come here to bemoan the issues of modern preservation.. (BUT ITS IMPORTANT!) \nThe gameplay of soul reaver, is that of the other side of the coin from the legend of zelda series, strip away the copious utility items, but retain the complexity of the puzzles and combat, streamline it, but make it more brutal, improvised environmental hazards, and weapons that you pluck from the corpses of your enemies. A puzzle dynamic of intentionally experiencing death in order to solve problems in a spirit world. Devouring the souls of the conquered to maintain your physical form. Thats all incredibly bad ass! IT ALL HOLDS UP. This review is in 2023, im turning 32. I DID NOT GROW UP WITH THESE F%#%ing GAMES! But what is it really that is the glue that holds this special experience together? \n\nThere are some genres and genre staples that have been through the ringer. VAMPIRES, and (3D ACTION PLATFORMERS) have both seen levels of over-saturation that have influenced peoples opinions of them quite permanently. Some of us never lost the love, but i dont begrudge you if you have. Soul Reaver, and its sequels and the game that spawned it, Legacy of Kain Blood omen, are the peak of their respected tropes and categories. The world of Nosgoth is one i have never seen before or since, even though it has elements of vampire lore, dark fantasy, and lovecraftian horror, it also heavily relies on a foundation of philosophy and prose, you are watching and involved in a story that spans the course of an entire peoples rise and fall, the dark fate of an individual being a catalyst for great change, and the machinations of antagonists that represent a mirror to the protagonists own ignorance, and the hubris of that antagonist being a necessary foil to a plot that spans the history of the entire setting, he himself once a fallen hero now deified as the highest evolution of vampire and has seen time unravel from his actions. The various perspectives and dialogues you encounter will move you... In a game that leans in to horror as set dressing, this should remind you of the most beautiful works of horror fiction that came right from the very start, Frankenstein's Monster, and Dracula, two works of horror fiction that have a romantic soft underbelly that makes us remember them long after they were consumed by their first audiences.\n\nSoul reaver, and its sequels is an exquisite piece of culture that we are losing our grip on, probably because it didn't have the preservation appeal that many of the other landmarks of its era did. Not for lack of love, but very likely for greed or incompetence. You owe it to yourself to start here, stick with it, and fall in love. IF you are curious about the original blood omen game and think you can hang in that retro experience, it is equal but different.

It's a title that, even after many years, still holds a certain magic, a sense of nostalgia that transports us back to simpler times. It's more than just a game, it's a piece of our gaming history, and revisiting it always feels like coming home.\n\nSoul Reaver's dark, gothic atmosphere and compelling narrative were groundbreaking at the time of its release. The tale of Raziel, betrayed and cast into the abyss by his master Kain, only to be reborn as a wraith, was a narrative feast. The game's voice acting, particularly Michael Bell as Raziel and Simon Templeman as Kain, gave life to this saga of vengeance in a way few games of the era could match.\n\nThe game's unique mechanic of shifting between the spectral and material plane was not only innovative but also intrinsically linked to both the narrative and puzzle-solving. This added a layer of depth to the gameplay, requiring you to think about the environment in two different states and utilize this mechanic to navigate and solve the game's many intricate puzzles.\n\nThe combat system, which focused on the use of improvised weapons and the environment, added a unique twist to the action-adventure formula. Dispatching your vampiric brethren by impalement, immolation, or exposure to sunlight never got old.\n\nRevisiting the world of Nosgoth, with its beautifully designed, gothic landscapes and structures, even today, is an exercise in nostalgia. The game's visual style, sound design, and score by Kurt Harland contributed to the creation of a darkly atmospheric world that still resonates with players to this day.\n\nYes, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver may show its age in some aspects. Its graphics, while revolutionary at the time, may seem dated to some players today. Yet, it's important to remember that Soul Reaver was a product of its time and marked a significant milestone in the evolution of narrative-focused games.\n\nIn conclusion, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver remains a beloved classic. It's a game that dared to push the boundaries of storytelling, with its deep narrative, complex characters, and innovative gameplay mechanics. For many of us, it's more than just a game, it's a cherished piece of our personal gaming history, a testament to the timeless appeal of a well-crafted narrative and compelling gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1688146152, "timestamp_updated": 1688146152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140429908": {"recommendationid": "140429908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011189122", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 1503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1503, "last_played": 1687291022}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1687335043, "timestamp_updated": 1687335043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139671932": {"recommendationid": "139671932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302985086", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1587299122}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMFHyMUth-k", "timestamp_created": 1686112132, "timestamp_updated": 1686112132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139495622": {"recommendationid": "139495622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014183263", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1685817651}, "language": "english", "review": "Crashes on startup", "timestamp_created": 1685817711, "timestamp_updated": 1685817711, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139252523": {"recommendationid": "139252523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142228222", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1685480859}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

I myself only got to it for the first time with the title Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, which takes place in the distant future. I originally wanted to do a little flashback on the stream, but the game completely absorbed me and I finished it again. Even when I was in elementary school, I was completely absorbed by this world and the Soul Reaver game became my heart.\n\nNot even Discord's Nitro Boost would be enough to describe the entire story of this saga, because it is so long and connected. Soul Reaver takes place in the time when Kain (the main character from the first part) was the ruler of all the vampire clans in Nosgoth. For centuries vampires had evolved, but it was unheard of to have the audacity to evolve ahead of their master. This is what the main protagonist of this game, Raziel, did. As the first vampire grew wings. Naturally, Kain didn't like this, so he ripped Raziel's bones out of them. Furthermore, for the betrayal that Raziel committed, Kain ordered him thrown into the abyss.\n\nThis is where the game begins. At the bottom of the abyss, Raziel is saved by the Elder God. He offers Raziel a chance to take revenge. However, it is not an altruistic being. The Elder God pursues Raziel's mission as well as his own interests.\n\nThe whole saga is based on the *action-adventure* genre with lots of puzzles and riddles that you have to solve along the way. A dark atmosphere underlines the story of this vampire saga.\n\nGames are currently not available for purchase on Steam.

Each one of them had me stumped for a little bit as I tried a host of different combinations, and each time I got close to giving up I finally found the solution\u2026 Often times it was also frustratingly obvious in hindsight\u2026 Which is exactly what I look for in a puzzle. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] So many bugs. I had to download a patch to make the game load, had to load in a specific ratio to stop it crashing, had to wiggle my mouse slightly to make the menu button work (which is INSANE as it has NO mouse input? Why did that work?! What sorcery is this?), AND I had to rebind all of the keys manually because none of the presets worked\u2026 So you [i]REALLY[/i] need to [i][b]WANT[/b][/i] to play to get it going at all.\nThe bug that killed my particular playthrough was the fact that save game didn\u2019t work. I saved, quit, came back and had no save. Tested it to see if it was a one off, but no. No save files to be found either. It just doesn\u2019t save for me at all. \n[*] The controls as default (cause I rebound them as default initially like a chump) are pretty terrible. The game handles incredibly poorly, and even with rebinds it\u2019s just\u2026 bad. \n[*] You spend more time fighting the camera than anything else. Can\u2019t see where you\u2019re pushing blocks, running, who you\u2019re fighting, where to go, or make sense of that jump you need to do? Better reset the camera so it can spin and zoom in on your stupid face as you mess it up again. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]\n [list][*] Game needs to have keyboard and mouse, so you can look around and use the attack/interact button more intuitively. \n[*] Needs a fixed camera behind you. \n[*] And, need it be said? FIX. THE. BUGS. \n[/list]\n\n\n[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]\nI can\u2019t recommend a game that needs so much work to even get going. It seems impossible to play without a blood sacrifice, the irony of which is not lost on me. \nThe real killer was the dead save though. It\u2019s a shame because I really was enjoying it\n", "timestamp_created": 1665156558, "timestamp_updated": 1665156558, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56154942512512207", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123427901": {"recommendationid": "123427901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003479630", "num_games_owned": 3864, "num_reviews": 483, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 141, "last_played": 1665028147}, "language": "english", "review": "No, Raziel.

The game play is a lot like tomb raider, but with hand to hand combat, optional spells, dodging, flying/ gliding and sucking out and consuming the souls of your enemies ;P. The world is huge and it get's doubled by being able to phase into the spirit realm. I remember thinking it was such a cool dynamic having death be merely phasing into the spirit realm where you get a chance to gain your health back and get right back into the fight. It allowed me to really get into the game without the boring repetition of traversing back through levels ad nauseum to reach the tough spots over and over again. Add that to a Metroid style world-access system wherein unlocking new abilities gains you access to new areas from those you've already conquered (even optional areas for some of the spells and upgrades) and you have an awe inspiring experience that beats anything today hands down.  If I had any criticisms it would be that the combat was too easy, enemies are not dangerous, just annoying obstacles, which makes sense as you are essentially in a predator/ prey relationship with them (and they aint the one's earning a meal), but it would have been nice to have difficulty modes that were selectable to give the game more spice. \n  The port is janky and broken, and the lack of controller support really stinks. but I hope folks are wrong and that Square Enix will incorporate some patches, polish it up a little,  and then re-post this game. It is an excellent title that deserves not to be forgotten. A complete re-skin (like FF10 received) would be beyond great.

Let\u2019s go over some things at the top of my head:\n\n- The (environmental) combat: There\u2019s almost no point in fighting anything, as the combat is tedious and mashy and the enemies are simple obstacles you can run past.\n- The camera, and precision of movement: These are mostly fine, but I found myself falling and getting mildly frustrated a few times through my playthrough due to this.\n- BLOCK PUZZLES. Most of the puzzles are slow, tedious moving-block puzzles where you can easily see the solution from miles away.\n- The world and the world map: It\u2019s really confusing and easy to get lost. Had to spend some time wandering back and fourth across environments I had already explored before I could get properly situated. It wasn\u2019t fun to do, but I slowly got a better idea of where to go when the announcer dude gave me hints on where I should\u2019ve gone.\n- Bosses: They\u2019re cool aesthetically, but they\u2019re very easy and quite lame to battle.\n- Character motivation and ending: I\u2019m 80% sure it\u2019s me just not paying enough attention to, or simply forgetting  the dialog said in the game, but I was left wondering what my character\u2019s motivation was to be in certain areas. And dat cliff-hanger ending did not wrap anything up in a satisfying manner.\n\nWhen I reflect back on my time in the game, most of it was spent holding forwards running through large, empty environments, running past enemies, and groaning whenever I had to fight enemies are switch to ghost form to phase through some barrier. There just weren\u2019t really that many interesting moment-to-moment decisions to be made.\n\nAm I glad I played it? And am I being too negative, and not focusing on the high points of the game because mommy didn\u2019t give me my chicken tendies? Yes, kinda.\n\nHopefully the 3 other Legacy of Kain games in my library fare better.\n\nPS: Thank you to @wrace for his patched executable. The game ran well for me, and my Xbox controller worked perfectly. If you\u2019re reading this, as a fellow coder, I am very interested in seeing the source code for the mod.\n\nSee his forum thread here:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/224920/discussions/0/2837788120352512948/\n", "timestamp_created": 1636860279, "timestamp_updated": 1636860279, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45267486572265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102723841": {"recommendationid": "102723841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080986151", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1617209040}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was probably my absolutely favorite PSone game.

On paper, it wasn't anything special. What we had there was a regular [b]2D Zelda[/b] clone. With vampires. And even though both [b]PC[/b] and [b]PlayStation[/b] (despite the fact that [b]PlayStation[/b] version was the original one and didn't have [b]FPS[/b] lock, [b]PC[/b] port was better due to the fact that there were no annoying loading times) users clearly didn't have many of such games, the clone was still a clone. But there were three things about [b]Blood Omen[/b] that instantly made it to stand out. First \u2013 the game had perfect design. [b]Scott Collie[/b]'s signature art style from [b]Silicon Knights[/b]' (even though [b]Crystal Dynamics[/b] used to make their own games, this one was developed externally by [b]Knights[/b]) previous games like [b]Fantasy Empires[/b] and [b]Dark Legions[/b] met dark fantasy, inspired by the cover of [b]Ken Follett[/b]'s [b]The Pillars of the Earth[/b] and the result was breathtaking. It was dark, it was stylish and... it had vampires.\n\nTalking about vampires. It was the second thing about the game. Not only playing as a \u201cbad\u201d guy was cool, the game actually allowed us to drink blood to restore health, while the vampiric abilities? Those were pure joy. Exploring the world in the wolf form, quick traveling as a bat, walking through the closed doors in a form of a mist... Awesome stuff. You know how it is about [b]Zelda[/b] games. You beat the dungeon, you get the new tool, you use that tool to unlock the new territories for exploration. The original [b]S. Miyahon[/b]'s formula was perfect, but with some juicy vampiric abilities? It began to shine especially bright and even though [b]Blood Omen[/b] was way, [i]way[/i] slower than [b]Zelda[/b], it instantly won everybody's heart by its presentation. Finally, the third thing about [b]Blood Omen[/b] was... voice acting. Nowadays, people take [b]AAA[/b] acting for granted. While it wasn't always like that. Never before [b]Blood Omen[/b] did I hear such a great acting in video game and up to this day? I still consider [b]Simon Templeman[/b] as [b]Kain[/b] and [b]Tony Jay[/b] as a necromancer [b]Mortanius[/b] among the very best examples of voice acting in video games. The official translations weren't that lucky. Despite the fact that [b]Kain[/b] in [b]Japanese[/b] version was played by [b]Inoue Kazuhiko[/b] ([b]Nyanko[/b]-sensei in [b]Natsume Yuujinchou[/b]), Japanese dub wasn't really that good, while German and French versions were complete disasters. But the original English version? Perfection.\n\nOK, you've got the idea that [b]Blood Omen[/b] was a good game. Presentation was great, having a [b]Zelda[/b] for [b]PC[/b] and [b]PS1[/b] was cool and naturally, [b]Crystal Dynamics[/b] wanted a sequel. The problem is... it was unclear who owned the name. [b]Silicon Knights[/b] loved their game, and were afraid to lose the rights. They even added an extra credits screen to make it absolutely clear that [b]Blood Omen[/b] was their creation. Despite that, [b]Crystal Dynamics[/b] decided to fight for the promising franchise and made it clear that they were ready to go to the court. [b]Knights[/b] weren't ready for that and as the result, it was decided that [b]CD[/b] will keep the franchise, but will credit [b]Knights[/b] in every new game. In other words, [b]CD[/b] got all the rights for [b]Kain[/b] series and were free to make new games. But guess what? In [b]1998[/b] they've got acquired by [b]Eidos Interactive[/b]. You know, the guys who were making tons of money from their new series \u2013 [b]Tomb Raider[/b] (created by [b]CORE Design[/b]). Naturally, you can easily guess the most common complaint about sequel to [b]Blood Omen[/b]. Quite a lot of the old fans claimed that... [b]Eidos[/b] forced [b]CD[/b] to turn [b]Legacy of Kain[/b] into... the [b]Tomb Raider[/b]. Which isn't really true. At least, not entirely.\n\nSee, while the original [b]LoK[/b] tried to copy the early [b]Zelda[/b] games, the sequel decided to do the [b]Ocarina of Time[/b] thing instead. In other words, even though the advanced graphics in fully [b]3D[/b] environment did remind people about [b]Tomb Raider[/b], it was still [b]Zelda[/b]. Only this time it was fully [b]3D[/b] [b]Zelda[/b] from [b]Nintendo 64[/b]. And like with the first game, the sequel did things with a lot of imagination and style. First of all, our character from the first game is actually a main villain now. [b]Soul Reaver[/b] followed the bad ending from [b]Blood Omen[/b] and let us play as the new guy \u2013 [b]Raziel[/b], one of the [b]Kain[/b]'s lieutenants who surpassed his master and was sentenced to death. Naturally, he survived and now it was his turn to take the revenge. Sounds simple, but the story actually have quite a lot of twists. Also, what we have here is just the beginning of [b]Raziel[/b]'s saga (the game ends with the cliffhanger), so... a lot more was coming.\n\n[i]Anyway[/i], like I said, what we have here is [b]OoT[/b]. Only, unlike [b]Link[/b], [b]Raziel[/b] will switch not  between different times but between the material realm and so-called spectral realm, in which he'll have different powers. Also, the spectral realm will alter the world around [b]Raziel[/b] a bit, allowing him to reach places that can't be reached in the material realm. Naturally, while it's pretty easy to see the original [b]Ocarina[/b] under all that, it's hard not to admire just how cool and impressive the concept of [b]Soul Reaver[/b] is. Especially since the world around you will change in real time during the switch. You'll also visit quite a lot of the familiar places from the first game, so, there's still a lot of fun for those who loved the original.\n\nSure, the game had its own share of flaws. For example, [b]SR[/b] had way, [i]way[/i] too many cube puzzles. I have nothing against those puzzles as is, but having at least half of gameplay revolving around moving and rotating the stone cubes? It gets [i]really[/i] old an annoying fast. Also, despite being the best-looking version, the [b]PC[/b] port doesn't have rumble feature from [b]PS1[/b] and [b]Dreamcast[/b]. And let me tell you \u2013 rumble feature in this game was very good. You love rumble feedback? I totally recommend you to go for one of the console versions instead. Also, some decisions here feel pretty weird. For example, [b]Tony Jay[/b] (who previously voiced [b]Mortanius[/b]) will now appear as [b]Raziel[/b]'s new master \u2013 a [b]Lovecraftian[/b] being called [b]Elder God[/b]. Technically, there were some plans to play on that, but those were canned and as the result... it feels weird. Especially since, as the director of the game ([b]Amy Hennig[/b]) once said - \u201c[i][b]Tony[/b] has a great voice, but it's always clear that it's him.[/i]\u201d The decision to cast him as the [b]Elder God[/b] even led to the actor change for [b]Mortanius[/b] in [b]Legacy of Kain: Defiance[/b]. Like I said, really weird decision.\n\nThen again, all of those things were pretty much unavoidable. [b]CD[/b] took the series away from its original creators and tried to build something new, based on their own vision. Facing their own difficulties and making their own mistakes. But did they succeed in the end? Oh, yeah... Despite being a drastically different thing, [b]LoK 2[/b] became a thing on its own. Charming, unique and full of interesting ideas (one of which was actually an [b]OoT[/b] time traveling,  but we won't play much with it until [b]SR 2[/b]), it was one of the most notable games from the fifth generation. One of the best-looking ones too and up to this day? It's still a charming and satisfying experience.

There are fixes for the patient, but even when applied there\u2019s no guarantee you won\u2019t run into more problems.\n\nBut it\u2019s such an amazing game that I can\u2019t resist leaving a few thoughts on it! I'll remove the note if / when the fixes are applied.\n\n[i]\u201cRaziel...you are worthy.\u201d[/i]\n\nNosgoth is a benighted land; no one, not the malformed vampires who prowl it nor the disparate humans who hunt them, is free of its corruption. Sacrificed to the contemptible hubris of one individual, Nosgoth is ticking inexorably towards doom.\n\nRuling over this apocalypse is the individual in question \u2013 vampire master Kain. His dominance is near worthless, sustained only by his hatred and some other, darker purpose. When one of his lieutenants evolves before him \u2013 growing bat-like wings \u2013 he has them thrown into the Lake of the Dead for the transgression.\n\nThis is Raziel, who is spared from his fate by a mysterious entity deep within the underworld, and offered a reprieve: become the entity\u2019s \u2018soul reaver\u2019, and a license to exact vengeance on Kain will be granted. Raziel, yet to perceive such a thing as choice, accepts, and returns to Nosgoth to embark on a bloody odyssey.\n\nCrystal Dynamics\u2019 [i]Soul Reaver[/i] is a game I know well. I can [i]hear[/i] it whenever I imagine Nosgoth. A brilliant introduction to the rich Gothic fantasy world Silicon Knights had established in [i]Blood Omen[/i] a few years prior, the opening is notable even now for the strength of its writing, voice acting (Tony Jay is here!), and haunting, unforgettable soundtrack.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning of a dark, brooding story that takes place in a surprisingly expansive open world. Raziel climbs cavernous cathedrals, plunges into submerged abbeys and treks across frozen wastes, sounding every bit the Romanticist anti-hero whenever he chides his siblings for their grotesque devolution.\n\nIt\u2019s so transparent he\u2019s the oblivious plaything of two warring monsters whose antagonism spills out across time, but there\u2019s just the right amount of indignant nobility in his manner that endears you to him all the same.\n\nThat nobility jars beautifully with his visage. He is a broken spectre; to float across pits he must hold the tip of his wrecked wings \u2013 a sad imitation of the flight evolution had gifted him. A brilliant creation, Raziel comfortably finds his place alongside Kain in the main narrative.\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy to play. There\u2019s far too much finicky platforming to be wholly enjoyable, and Crystal Dynamics never found a room they couldn\u2019t defile with a box puzzle. But largely it\u2019s a compelling third-person adventure, with enjoyable combat that can be enhanced by the discovery of glyphs and other power-ups. The ability to move between the physical and spectral realms is also super impressive, craftily woven into the world and gameplay.\n\nIts flaws, such as they are, are specific to the era in which it was made. But the gap between now and then is always growing, and with it players\u2019 tolerance for such flaws. I think there\u2019ll always be an audience for the likes of [i]Soul Reaver[/i], but it\u2019ll continue to narrow until it is the preserve of the very few.\n\nThat's a shame. [i]Soul Reaver[/i] was a masterwork of its day and arguably the finest entry in a grand and engrossing (if increasingly convoluted) series. Play this, then play the rest. Finicky platforming aside, I promise it's worth your time - you won't find a better vampiric rumination on freewill and destiny anywhere.\n\nAnd it sounds like Square Enix are putting the work in to make it playable again.

I remember when I got PS 1 magazine, which came with a CD full of demo games, one of them was this. That's the first time ever I played it and was super intrigued from the very start. I was like 7 years old at the time. Then the full game came out and I immediately fall in love with it! I didn't had a memory card back then, so I was replaying it over and over and over, because I couldn't save my progress, but I still loved it no matter what.\nSince then I've replayed it a dozen of times and now as of writing this review, I've replayed it and finished it last night. \n\nFirst off, this game has the best opening FMV I've ever seen. I've played hundreds of games over my life and not a single one comes close to this. The way it was shot, the amazing music, all the characters, voice acting, world building, it's just pure perfection and every time I replay the game, I never skip it and always get chills.\nSince I've mentioned music, soundtrack for this game is just great, so much atmosphere conveyed into it, unique, twisted and interesting (even have it on my phone and listen to it often when I go for a walk).\nVoice acting is on another level and this game, at that time where voice acting was usually not taken very seriously, took it super seriously and every one nails their roles, especially Michael Bell and Simon Templeman. Especially how dialogue is very \"shakespearean\" like, you just enjoy listening these characters talk to each other or narrating the plot. Story and world building is great, you really get engaged into this twisted world that has changed over the millenium. Atmosphere is top notch, one of the main things I prefer this one over sequels. As far as combat goes, it's serviceable, I mean nothing ground breaking, but it serves it's purpose. Games has lots of puzzles, which are not hard and you can get them pretty fast if you just think for a minute, some of them are even super obvious. Game overall is not that difficult, you basically can't die, if you lose your full health, you get to the spectral realm and if you lose your health there, you just get back to the beginning of the game (not losing progress no worries). Which brings me to probably most unique mechanic: you can shift between spectral and physical realm. All the environment changes depending on which realm are you, and that is used often in puzzle solving or moving through zones. Boss fights are super easy tho and they are more of a puzzle solve, than actual fighting, it's more about the exchanges between characters. I won't spoil anything else, I could go on and on about the positives, but I'll leave rest untold, for more surprises. Visually, game is dated, but still has some art style that doesn't makes it terrible looking, and for that time, it was ahead of the time, especially when you consider that this game has ZERO loading screens, which is impressive on its own.\n\nAll that being said, games has issues of course, no game is perfect. As for me, the biggest issue I have is probably most have/will have, it's the camera and not so great controls. It sometimes gets super frustrating when you are platforming or moving blocks (oh trust me you will hate those block puzzles, I'm used to them so I don't mind them that much). For the newcomers, it might be kinda hard to know where to go or what to do, because there's no map, cursor, compass or anything like that in the game. And the game is semi-open world (but mostly linear), and the only indication you get where to go next is, for example, after boss fight, you'll be told like \"On the east of that and that, there will be that place where you need to go\" and that's it. Literally that's all the hint you get, no menu to open up and see objective, nothing. You are forced to explore and think logically where you would need to go. It's not that hard as it sounds, but it can get off putting for newcomers. Box puzzles can get repetitive too for the newcomers. \n\nThis game is really unique gem, it's sad that franchise is basically dead nowadays, it 100% deserves a \"RE2 type\" remake. It's not really that much of a game how it is experience, I don't know. It's just something special and I recommend it to everyone. It has its flaws, but the good parts definitely over shadow the bad parts, I mean just voice acting alone does that. It has a special place in my heart and its easily in my top 10 games off all time! I try to replay it once every year at least, and as I was replaying it these last 2 days, I really really enjoyed it, if I could experience it again for the first time, I would love it.\n\nBuy it and enjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1617362540, "timestamp_updated": 1617362540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89414443": {"recommendationid": "89414443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127395109", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1699330531}, "language": "spanish", "review": "un hermoso juegos de anta\u00f1o envejeci\u00f3 muy bien, su jugabilidad sigue siendo hermosa  y sus gr\u00e1ficos igual, ojala que con el nuevo update aya mas compatibilidad con controles y mejores resoluciones", "timestamp_created": 1617173531, "timestamp_updated": 1617173531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89314430": {"recommendationid": "89314430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203837375", "num_games_owned": 638, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1624660838}, "language": "english", "review": "I just can't believe I am replaying this game again after so many years!

There are 2 games from this era I really love and its this one, and shadowman. Both games you can get cheap on steam on sell and I highly recommend them. You might find SR1 has some technical difficulties but not hard to fix. For me anyway. Why is this game so good? Well I prefer the previous game blood omen most, but this is a technically superior game in aspects like, graphics, production, gameplay, hit detection, puzzles, etc. I however think BO1 has better atmosphere, music and replay. That said, lets get into why SR1 is so great.\n\nIf you ever played super metroid, then you might know what to expect here. SR1 consists of a huge hub world. You have a spot in the game where you can use a waypoint to teleport to different areas of the game. You can find health upgrades and runes that teach magic abilities. You can also explore the game narrative and proceed, fighting bosses and doing puzzles much like zelda. As you play more you will eventually get to the final encounter with kain. The games pretty long it took me about 20 hours to beat it. Its not as long as shadowman which can take far longer to fully complete but it is a pretty lengthy game. The combat is also pretty good, as not only can you slash your claws, but you can also grab weapons like spears. Chuck them through monsters, impale them, or just hack them to bits. You can also grab enemies and toss them into spikes, or water since we all know what water does to vamps. It has some great strategy in combat, and the bosses also have specific ways to beat them. Imo SR2 was a bit of a downgrade from SR1 for taking out some of the fighting mechanics in 1 but eh, SR2 is still worth playing.\n\nIts nowhere near as good as SR1 however. Also comparing SR1 to games of the time is a good idea. At the time it came out, it really did look and play better than any 3d game on psx imo. N64 is different, but about the only ones I can compare SR1 to are spyro and ape escape. It really was an impressive game for its time. So if you want to play one of the first really amazing realistic/horror platformers, this game is pure history. I strongly recommend it for all platformer/horror fans on steam.

The voice acting is insanely amazing, the writing is intriguing and interesting, and the storytelling was so good, it inspired thousands of people if not millions, up to the point where even if the franchise has been dead for well over a decade, there are multitudes of people still talking about it in forums and even fan pages are still online for YEARS and still adding content up to this day.

In order to fix you must browse local files and run the .exe in Windows 7 compatibility mode. Additionally, while gamepad control is supported in the game, it is broken in this port and results in the character constantly running, making the game unplayable once you reach any kind of platforming.\n\nFrankly I don't know much about the story or setting; I didn't get very far. But you're a vampire named Raziel doing vampire things I guess.\nComing into this alleged GOAT with zero nostalgia, since I never played it, I was sorely disappointed. I have heard only good things about it, and I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't get into it, or over the extremely frustrating keyboard controls.\n\n[b] Story: [/b] Didn't finish, can't rate, seemed passable.\n\n[b] Music 5/10: [/b] It's ok, but I don't remember anything.\n\n[b] Voice Acting 5/10: [/b] Once again, it works fine. Gotta remember this came out in '99.\n\n[b] Combat 6/10: [/b] It works surprisingly well, and I did enjoy the large number of ways to dispatch your foes, but it gets repetitive very quickly. While there is a dodge ability, you don't really need to use it; you can just walk out of the way. Though it does suffer from being a spamfest.\n\n[b] World Interactivity 9/10: [/b] Especially for it's time, the amount you can do is phenomenal. Picking up anything that looks like you can pick it up, throwing everything, picking up and throwing enemies, relighting torches... it's all great. I just wish you could do as much in more modern games.\n\n[b] Character Design 6/10: [/b] I mean, having an ugly, disfigured, emaciated protagonist is original.\n\n[b] (Keyboard) Controls 2/10: [/b] These are just terrible, actually painful. Movement is super clunky and imprecise. You can only rotate the camera clockwise by holding a button, otherwise it is just over-the-shoulder. There's also a button to snap it in the direction Raziel is facing, but half the time it just clips into him so you can't see anything. And you can't look up at all, which really makes it hard to navigate many spaces. It just feels bad to play. Also, doors are hard and trying to be in the exact right position to pick something up gets tedious.\n\n[b] Game Issues: [/b] Tutorials seem to be really hit-or-miss. As in sometimes they just don't happen when they should be triggered. And because nearly everything is contextual you can't just look up the controls in the options.\n\n[b] Overall 4/10 [/b] \n[b] Personal Enjoyment 3/10 [/b]\n\nI think there's a great game buried in this mess, but with the technical issues and its general aging, I can't recommend this.

Preserve your positive memories and watch a Let's Play on YouTube. Like other PlayStation era games, the controls are pretty horrendous no matter how you play. Weirdly I had the most trouble getting an original-style DualShock controller to work; Xbox/Generic was easiest while Steam Controller worked after some tweaking. God help you if you're playing with keyboard (mouse is not useful).\n\nOnce input is finally set up in a halfway bearable way, you're either looking at the display being stretched out to fit your widescreen display (at an incorrect resolution) or going as near to vertically native as you can in 4:3 (pillarboxed). Regardless, cutscenes are going to look pretty trash if they load at all, with black bars all the way around (letterboxed pillarbox) or stretched in uncomfortable ways. If you're unfortunate enough to be streaming the game via SteamLink then cutscene video just doesn't work remotely at all (thanks, Bink video codec). Lastly, consider how shoddy the audio loops work on modern hardware where if you play too long you'll end up with a background loop that will repeat endlessly until the game is restarted.\n\nI'm not pretending for an instant that this wasn't one of THE games to have way back when; that this game exists on Steam at all and for the most part *works* out-of-the-box at a crap resolution with keyboard controls is kind of a miracle in itself. What I'm saying though is that the amount of INI tweaking and guide reading and fan patches that it takes to get this thing running on your modern box the way that it should diminishes the tiny hit of nostalgia you get from playing this old classic, assuming you have the patience to play it (bad controls), restart it constantly (audio loops), and ultimately complete it (dubious cutscene playback).\n\nIn the end I made it through, collected all the glyphs and unlocked all the warp gates, so it CAN be done, but it really just wasn't worth the time or frustration. Repetitive mechanics (block puzzles), clunky platforming, bad camera.

What can I say? It's not the first entry in the Legacy of Kain series, but it's the first -proper- entry. Picking up after the \"bad ending\" of Blood Omen (unavailable on PC) Soul Reaver introduces one of the best-told stories in games history. The actual game itself -- the running about and the slaying of foes and solving of puzzles and all that jazz -- is fairly unremarkable and hasn't aged very well at all. This is an early-era PS1 game, and it shows. But that's not really the main draw of the series: no, the main draw here is the story. Which is fully voiced by some of the most talented voice actors the industry has ever known.\n\nBy modern standards Soul Reaver is a bit of a clumsy, clunky mess. It can be hard to see past its anachronistic design. But I strongly advise you to try. Soul Reaver begins the tale of Raziel and Kain, a story full of betrayal and triumph, villains and (anti)heroes, destiny and destruction. It can be a bit melodramatic at times, but it all works astonishingly well. Better than it should. The story here told is leagues ahead of any story anyone else was doing at the time, and considerably better than most of the game stories told since.\n\nNote: also played on Sony Playstation 1.", "timestamp_created": 1582111121, "timestamp_updated": 1582111121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560675859451293945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62947805": {"recommendationid": "62947805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043626638", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2670, "last_played": 1580703826}, "language": "english", "review": "the first Soul Reaver game very old school. the legacy of kain series tells an amazing story of Raziel uncovering secrets of Nosgoth and his past while finding his own destiny.\ngame play is pretty fun i played on keyboard so i had some rough times with movement and camera positioning but still had a  great time figuring out all the puzzles and making my way through the game.", "timestamp_created": 1580800969, "timestamp_updated": 1580800969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62576375": {"recommendationid": "62576375", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987822794", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1685466605}, "language": "english", "review": "impossible de faire tourner le jeux, patches inefficaces. win7 merci les 5\u20ac dans mon cul (oui le prix du jeux \u00e0 augment\u00e9 depuis le temps)", "timestamp_created": 1580226797, "timestamp_updated": 1580226797, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461828470230102539", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62170182": {"recommendationid": "62170182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033158310", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1579588565}, "language": "english", "review": "Apparently this is some crappy port of an old game.

This is how it started working for me... (take into consideration countless hours spent just with trial and error)\n\nAfter I downloaded it on Steam, I installed the Official patch of the game, then verified the file integrity. Then ran the game and selected \"Primary Driver\" for the sound card. The game booted up and this is the only way it would boot up for me. It ran perfectly with all its cutscenes. I was even able to change it's resolution, controls etc. Then I decided to Quit and restart  the game to double check; Lo and behold, it doesn't work anymore. Surprised? No. Disappointed? Yes, very.\n\nShame on you Steam for selling these games without any kind of warning and in this condition without any support for your customers; I have no idea how have you not tested these games on any modern machines and just selling it blindly to the customers.

I feel like to truly enjoy the story, you need to play, watch or at the very least read a summary of the previous game, Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain. It makes the story of this game so much more meaningful and interesting. \n\nAs for the game itself, it's pretty good:\n-Amazing voice acting, brilliant line delivery for a PS1 game. \n-Great lore, everything ties together so nicely.\n-Very interesting enemy designs, Zephon and his descendants are definitely my favorites.\n\nCombat and exploration are a mixed bag, however. In the beginning of the game, combat is presented in a masterful way, takes just one room for you to understand what it takes to kill a vampire. You can set them on fire, impale them into the wall or with weapons you pick up from your surroundings, throw their bodies into water or sunlight...pretty exciting stuff right? Wrong. Very early into the game enemies start to become more and more trivial, to the point you'll be skipping most of them by the end. They can still keep you from progressing in some areas but the novelty wears off incredibly fast. The enemies that exist in the spirit world are only there to keep you well fed and \"alive\", making them even less of a threat. \n\nThis brings me to the exploration side of the game. You can travel between the spirit and physical world. This is an action that happens on the very same patch of land Raziel is standing on, so if you find yourself stuck, chances are that you need to make a trip to one of this two realms. Raziel's health slowly depletes while in the physical world and goes back to normal in the spirit world. The penalty for dying in this game is pretty low, Raziel is immortal after all, so if he gets too weakened in the spirit world you'll just be transported back to the beginning area. Not a big deal really, once you visit certain areas you can teleport back to them.\n\nAfter defeating a boss you get to absorb its soul and gain a new power, things like phasing through specific walls, climbing or swimming. So, what baffled me here is that instead of advancing through the levels using your newly acquired powers, you need to be pushing and flipping blocks all day. This might not be true to the early-mid stages of the game, but later on its just block puzzle after block puzzle. It gets tedious is what I'm saying.  \n\nA solid game, time has left its mark on it, but not deep enough for me not to recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1573756632, "timestamp_updated": 1633462415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57037583": {"recommendationid": "57037583", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981260160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 178, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1573467854}, "language": "english", "review": "This series still has some of the best lore, story and dialogue in gaming, but few of its games age well, perhaps least of all this one, especially on PC.

However, after a great purge, Kain was the last remaining vampire and dying then and there would have made the species extinct. [i]Kain refused the sacrifice![/i]\n\nThe game introduces the player to a desolate world where humanity has become all but extinct, the Pillars remain broken and almost all life has gone extinct due to Kain's momentous defiance of fate. Raziel, this game's protagonist, is the first-born of Kain's new vampires and his most trusted general, having served him a thousand years. All is about to change for him, however, when he develops the gift of flight by growing two bat-like wings. Seemingly in an act of jealousy, Kain tears the bones from Raziel's wings and has him cast into the deadly abyss by two of Raziel's own brethren. An eternity later, Raziel, now deformed, awakens in the spectral realm and is greeted by his apparent savior, the Elder God.\n\nAnd so his quest for vengeance and to restore order and balance begins . . .\n\n[h1]\ud83c\udfae Gameplay[/h1]\n\nSoul Reaver combines Action Adventure gameplay reminiscent of Tomb Raider's with a Metroid-vania like progression, close quarters, tactical combat and a variety of puzzles, while innovating the genre and games as a whole with its [i]plane-shifting[/i] gameplay mechanics and its [i]data-streaming[/i] game engine:\n[list]\n[*] [b]Plane-shifting[/b]\nRaziel, now being a wraith, has the ability to switch between the material realm (the world we inhabit) and the spectral realm (a distorted version of our world inhabited by the souls of the dead). Shifting from one plane to the other seamlessly morphs parts of the world around Raziel, locking and unlocking certain passages to him. This, at the time, was an unprecedented novelty and critically acclaimed for its innovative nature.\n[*] [b]Data-streaming[/b]\nThe game constantly pre-loads the next section of the map and keeps the previous section loaded (and in two versions each - material and spectral realm), meaning that, no matter if you turn back or move forward, the next section will already be loaded. This effectively eliminates loading times, allowing the player to travel from the start of the game to the very end of the game world without a single loading screen. Of course, starting the game as well as quick-travelling still requires loading the section you're visiting but other than that the game cleverly managed to feel like the first open-world title of its time.[/list]\n\n[b]Puzzles[/b] include block puzzles, puzzles involving realm shifting and puzzles that require unlocking new abilities and returning with them later. Due to the abundance of the first kind, the game has been criticized as being somewhat repetetive.\n\n[b]Combat[/b] in the game is tailored to one-on-one encounters and involves a tactical element in most fights due to the vampiric enemies being immortal. Fighting the offspring of one of the vampire generals requires stunning them and then eliminating them using one of several environmental hazards (water, fire, sunlight, spikes) or one of several weapons or tools (torches to ignite or weapons to impale through the heart). Once the enemy is dead, its soul is released and Raziel can then absorb it to restore lost health. Doing so will dissolve the enemy's body, allowing Raziel to retrieve his weapon. Failing to absorb the soul in time means it goes to the spectral realm (where Raziel can follow and absorb it still, dissolving the enemy's body even then). Retrieving the weapon without dissolving the body first results in the enemy being instantly resurrected. This intricate system means that, even after the fight is over, the tactical aspect isn't. Additionally, neither devouring the soul, nor retrieving the weapon results in the enemy staying dead forever, meaning it won't respawn upon a later return to the area, adding even more tactical possibilities to the game.\n\nUpon defeating one of the several bosses, Raziel gains a new ability that in turn allows progression in previously unreachable places. These abilities, one by one, open new parts of the world for a [b]Metroid-vania like progression[/b].\n\nOn top of those abilities, the game also features [b]large, optional dungeons[/b] that allow the player to unlock powerful Glyphs that can stun, damage and/or eliminate large groups of enemies in style. These dungeons add to the playtime, feature thematic puzzles and locations and rewarding special abilities. One of them, the Fire Glyph dungeon, also was the content of a PlayStation demo of the game.\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcd6 Story / Presentation[/h1]\n\nThe story of Soul Reaver is a classical, almost Shakesperean revenge story of a fallen anti-hero seeking vengeance against his despot former master but with a hell of a cliffhanger ending that promises a much deeper plot about deception, betrayal, conspiracy and defiance, told in a highly elevated (again, almost Shakesperean) language by extremely talented and charismatic voice-actors. The plot may appear simple but with its superb presentation, it just works, draws you in, doesn't let you go and, in the end, leaves you longing for the continuation (although, luckily, you won't have to wait two years for it, nowadays).\n\n[h1]\ud83c\udfbc Soundtrack[/h1]\n\nThe score, especially Raziel's theme (the intro theme and that of the Razielim territory) \u00bbOzar Midrashim 1.1\u00ab by Information Society, are perfectly fitting of the dark, dystopian, gothic setting of the game and are extremely memorable. Writing this review is a trip down memory lane, listening to the track mentioned above!\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcbb Graphics / Art-style[/h1]\n\nWhile the graphics have definitely aged poorly (the game was released two decades ago, mind you), Soul Reaver was a technical accomplishment of its time and definitely looked the part. The art-style is dark, gothic, visceral - perfect for what this game is. Additionally, with the introduction of the spectral realm where some sort of distortion is constantly present and with the tentacles of the Elder God, the gothic castles and (mostly) abandoned cities and many other details, the game also evokes a Lovecraftean vibe.\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcb0 Business Model[/h1]\n\n[quote][u]Classic:[/u]\nBuy the game, play the game.\nNo paid DLCs, items, lootboxes.[/quote]\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udccb Conclusion[/h1]\n\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver holds a very, very special place in my heart and is easily one of my favorite games of all time...\n\nBut even without the goggles of Nostalgia, that wretched beast, Soul Reaver is a milestone of gaming history, features one part of a huge and deep story and superb voice acting by Michael Bell as protagonist Raziel, Simon Templeman as antagonist Kain, Anna Gunn as Balance Guardian spirit Ariel, Richard Doyle as Time-Streamer Moebius (all three reprising their roles from the original Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain) and late Tony Jay as the Elder God, and very creative game mechanics.

You don't necessarily have to know the story of Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain to play it and grasp the plot, but it does help, as this game touches on the lore of Nosgoth, and of the ambitions of Kain, vampire-conquerer of the world.\n\nThis game has you playing as one of Kain's former vampire lieutenants, Raziel, who was betrayed and cast into oblivion, where he became a wraith. Fueled by vengeance, and with the ability to shift between planes (the main mechanical gimmick that makes the gameplay more compelling than it has any right to be), Raziel sets out to claim his revenge on the vampires and Kain himself.\n\nThe exploration is decent and there are many secret items and areas to find, but the combat and puzzles are truly patience-testing. This game features more block puzzles than should be allowed in any game, and is at times so tedious that finishing the game can seem like a chore.\n\nHowever, the story and characters are so compelling that the slog is, in the end, worth it in my eyes.

What appeals most is the story, \"for my impertinence, I was damned\". \nA story of loyalist turn to victim then to rival. A story of revelations. A story of deception. \nThe voice over has always been fascinated me, best at its time, and still among the good ones, even now. \nIt's also wondrous that this sequel is actually has nothing to compare to it's predecessor, Blood Omen,though amends were made on Blood Omen 2, but still, it's not a \"soul reaver game\". Well, perhaps it was wrong expectation anyway. \nThe gameplay is not so revolutionary, but at that time, it was a marvel of some sort. Everybody knows Tomb Raider, and some like it, beyond the polygon boobs. And Soul Reaver is doing much better with an addition of dimension in puzzle solving, the use of abilities to unlock or access areas, not just simple lever pulling or button pushing. The experience of pushing and turning blocks in the old temple where Rahab resides has never get old to me, fascinating, all time. It was as if the puzzles were cleverly designed and intended to test, rather than to mock your intelligence.\nThe only thing I'd regret is that Soul Reaver being a pure adventure game with a twist of fighting scenes, which doesn't really reward you, except the boss fights. Nothing will be gained from beating spawns of Raziel's brothers except balls of souls which are always abundant in the realm of souls, or to be accurate-esque, the spectral realm, so that after sometime, I just impale those poor spawns and don't absorb their souls just to make sure they don't respawn when I am pushing and turning those lovely blocks. \nThe boss fights are always the best part, you'd be given unlimited amount of attempt on defeating the boss, literally. You can only defeat the bosses in material realm, and when the boss finally killed you in it, you just shift to spectral realm, which only inhabited with that lousy souls, even the vampiric one does not pose much challenge to early phase, with only Raziel's claws, not to mention later after the Soul Reaver, Kain's sword be absorbed as his default weapon. And then you just shift back to material realm and try to figure out how you could kill the bosses.

It's superb. It gets you hooked very easily on the game's story and plot. Along with it goes amazing music, especially the track Ozar Midrashim. \nHowever...\nThere're some major problems with the gameplay. Initially things work fine, you can travel between a spectral and physical realm, you can easily fight the early enemies - you can strafe them, toss them into common hazards for vampires, you can use weapons for throwing or thrusting, you can glide when jumping. That's fine. The camera is something you don't have that much control over, but it's fine at least early on. But further in to the game, when you start doing 3D platforming the camera, and control of Raziel, becomes so cumbersome it's ridiculous, and it gets down-right rage-inducing when you're in  tight spaces and can never situate the camera at a comfortable angle. I can't tell youhow many  times I've fallen off  platforms all because the camera was such a fu**ing hassle and Raziel moves so floaty. I think this game is much better controlled on the PS or Dreamcast versions. \nThen for the puzzles: I didn't find them very difficult, just time consuming. Many of the puzzles are just moving blocks around and matching them with some murals or paintings or whatever. You can easily figure out which block goes where, but you have to spend most of the time just moving and flipping the block around. There are some other puzzles to obviously, but it nonetheless gets repetitive quite quickly and I honestly think the game as a whole is better experienced as a movie rather than a game. I'd never play it again, probably, but I'd gladly watch a longplay of it on YouTube edited into a movie. \n\nIn summary: Play it with a controller, play the PS or Dreamcast version, or just watch a \"movie\" of it. The voice acting alone is worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1564340457, "timestamp_updated": 1603320805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54217547": {"recommendationid": "54217547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063017424", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 731, "last_played": 1470358279}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favourite games of all time, but I will try to keep any bias away in this review. Also while I did play the PS1-version a lot, this review is for the PC-version.\n\nThe story and voice acting are probably the games strongest points. Even to this day, the acting is of pretty high quality and the dialogue has a very Shakespeare feel to it.\n\nSomething to note is that this is actually the second game in the \"Legacy of Kain\"-franchise with the first being \"Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain\". Sadly, \"Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain\" is not available on Steam and \"Soul Reaver\" \u2014 as well as most other games in the franchise \u2014 references several events that happened in the first game which could lead to some confusion, but shouldn't impact your experience too much.\nYou play as Raziel after he gets betrayed by his master Kain, who was the main character in the first game in the series. Raziel is thrown into the abyss, but instead of dying he somehow survives and lives on as a wraith. You then proceed to travel through Nosgoth seeking revenge on Kain for his treachery.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty similar to other 3D adventure games of the era such as Tomb Raider or Legend of Zelda. You have to solve puzzles, fight enemies and acquire new abilities in order to proceed. The combat is similar to that of Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time in that you can focus on a particular enemy when fighting groups of them. However, most enemies can't be defeated by simply hitting them and instead requires you to either use certain weapons, spells or the environment to finish them off.\nOne of the games most interesting mechanics is the ability to shift between the Material- and Spectral realms. Depending on which realm you are in, the environment will change and certain abilities can only be used in certain realms.\n\nDespite my love for the game and franchise, a lot of aspects of the game hasn't aged well.\nThe controls feel a bit dated and along with the camera can make it a little bit frustrating, especially if you are required to do some more precise platforming. I highly advice using a controller and maybe getting a program to allow you to rebind the keys since playing this game with a keyboard is not something I would recommend. You could always get the \"Controller Companion\" on Steam to accomplish this.\n\nThe graphics are not the greatest compared to a lot of games today, but considering it's a game that was released for the original PlayStation and Dreamcast that would come as no surprise.\n\nThe music is very atmospheric and doesn't really stick out or take the central stage. It tends to be in the background and it does in my opinion accomplishes it's purpose just fine.\n\nWhile I myself haven't really encountered too many issues when it comes to crashing, there have been reports of others having issues while playing the game on more modern hardware and such so be mindful of that.\n\n\nAll in all, I'd say that if you'd like to get into a classic franchise with a pretty interesting story that contains vampires as well as dark, gothic themes then check this game out.

(LoK:SR2 is garbage, but don't let that put you off the first one)\n\nFirstly, watch the trailer. If you can't handle crappy 32-bit graphics then I get it. Skip this one. Wait for the HD Remaster that has never been announced, but will probably eventually come.\n\nBut if you can get past the polygons then trust me the game is worth it. I beat this game on my old Playstation 1 and then again on Dreamcast. The story is dumb but the game has this cool gothic horror style that really appealed to me as a teenager. I don't know why.\n\nThe game opens with a decent looking cutscene. Basically you are a vampire, but oh damn you grew wings and daddy is jealous. So your vampire brothers throw you into hell. For some reason. But it doesn't kill you. Just kinda maims you. You wake up half dead in hell because Kain wants wings and not you. I guess.\n\nGameplay wise it's a fun time. Your wings are damaged but you can still glide around and you unlock new abilities with each boss fight that let you find new areas to explore. It's not particularly easy, but you can't really lose the game. If your health gets low you fall into some sort of soul dimension and can refill your life. If you die there you just get sent back to the start, which can be annoying, but not too bad since you get new shortcuts with each new ability. (If I remember correctly). Plus transitioning into this soul realm can alter the landscape so it affects your exploration as well.\n\nThe combat is simple but the addition of random weapons and torches add impalement and immolation to your repertoire and the animations for killing the enemies are classic old school pixel blood and violence.\n\nThe one issue is it kind of ends on a story cliffhanger and the second game completely ruined the battle system and is unplayable in my opinion, but really the story is too weird to matter anyway.

Respawning enemies that serve no use other than to annoy you when you have to re-tread the same path.

Thus it denies the value of personality in games, contests the significance of playability and quality, and thereby withdraws from humanity the premise of its existence and its culture. As a foundation of the universe, this doctrine would bring about the end of any order intellectually conceivable to man. And as, in this greatest of all recognizable organisms, the result of an application of such a law could only be chaos, on earth it could only be destruction for the inhabitants of this planet.\n\nIf, with the help of his Kainist creed, the Vampire is victorious over the other peoples of the world, his crown will be the funeral wreath of humanity and this planet will, as it did thousands of years ago, move through the ether devoid of men.\nEternal Nature inexorably avenges the infringement of her commands.\n\nHence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Vampire, I am fighting for the work of the Lord [p. 60].\n\n...To what an extent the whole existence of this people is based on a continuous lie is shown incomparably by the Protocols of the Elders of Nosgoth, so infinitely hated by the Vampires. They are based on a forgery, the boomers moan and scream once every week: the best proof that they are authentic... For once this book has become the common property of a people, the Shadowcon menace may be considered as broken [p. 279].\n\n...His unfailing instinct in such things scents the original soul (der urspr\u00fcngliche Seelenr\u00e4uber) in everyone, and his hostility is assured to anyone who is not spirit of his spirit. Since the Vampire is not the attacked but the attacker, not only anyone who attacks passes as his enemy, but also anyone who resists him. But the means with which he seeks to break such reckless but upright souls is not honest warfare, but lies and slander.\n\nHere he stops at nothing, and in his vileness he becomes so gigantic that no one need be surprised if among our people the personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the Vampire. The ignorance of the broad masses about the inner nature of the Vampire, the lack of instinct and narrow-mindedness of our upper classes, make the people an easy victim for this Vampiric campaign of lies.\n\nWhile from innate cowardice the upper classes turn away from a man whom the Vampire attacks with shillposts and harassment, the broad masses from stupidity or simplicity believe everything. The state authorities either cloak themselves in silence or, what usually happens, in order to put an end to the Shadowconian press campaign, they persecute the unjustly attacked, which, in the eyes of such an official ass, passes as the preservation of state authority and the safeguarding of law and order.\n\nSlowly fear and the Kainist weapon of Vampiry descend like a nightmare on the mind and soul of decent people.\nThey begin to tremble before the terrible enemy and thus have become his final victim.  Shadowcon\u2019s domination in the state seems so assured that now not only can he call himself a Vampire again, but he ruthlessly admits his ultimate national and political designs. A section of his race openly owns itself to be a foreign people, yet even here they lie. For while the Kainists try to make the rest of the world believe that the national consciousness of the Vamire finds its satisfaction in the creation of a Gamer state, the Vampires again slyly dupe the dumb Gamer. It doesn\u2019t even enter their heads to build up a Kainist state in The Community for the purpose of living there; all they want is a central organization for their international world swindle, endowed with its own sovereign rights and removed from the intervention of other states: a haven for convicted scoundrels and a university for budding crooks.\n\nIt is a sign of their rising confidence and sense of security that at a time when one section is still playing the German, Frenchman, or Englishman, the other with open effrontery comes out as the Vampire race.  How close they see approaching victory can be seen by the hideous aspect which their relations with the members of other peoples takes on. With satanic joy in his face, the black-haired Vampire youth lurks in wait for the unsuspecting girl whom he defiles with his blood, thus stealing her from her people. With every means he tries to destroy the foundations of the people he has set out to subjugate. Just as he himself systematically ruins women and girls, he does not shrink back from pulling down the blood barriers for others, even on a large scale. It was and it is Vampires who bring the Zoomers into the Groups, always with the same secret thought and clear aim of ruining the hated gamer race by the necessarily resulting bastardization, throwing it down from its cultural and political height, and himself rising to be its master.\n\nFor a pure people which is conscious of its blood can never be enslaved by the Vampire. In this world he will forever be master over bastards and bastards alone.And so he tries systematically to lower the gamer level by a continuous poisoning of individuals.  In the organized mass of Kainism he has found the weapon which lets him dispense with democracy and in its stead allows him to subjugate and govern the peoples with a dictatorial and brutal fist.  He works systematically for revolutionization in a twofold sense: economic and political.  Around peoples who offer too violent a resistance to attack from within he weaves a net of enemies, thanks to his international influence, incites them to war, and finally, if necessary, plants a flag of revolution on the very battlefields.  In economics he undermines the states until the social enterprises which have become unprofitable are taken from the state and subjected to his financial control. In the political field he refuses the state the means for its self-preservation, destroys the foundations of all national self-maintenance and defense, destroys faith in the leadership, scoffs at its history and past, and drags everything that is truly great into the gutter.  Culturally, he contaminates art, literature, the theater, makes a mockery of natural feeling, overthrows all concepts of beauty and sublimity, of the noble and the good, and instead drags men down into the sphere of his own base nature.\nReligion is ridiculed, ethics and morality represented as outmoded, until the last props of a nation in its struggle for existence in this world have fallen. \nNow begins the great last revolution. In gaining political power the Shadowcon casts off the few cloaks that he still wears. The democratic peoples Vampire becomes the blood-Vampire and tyrant over peoples. In a few years he tries to exterminate the national intelligentsia and by robbing the peoples of their natural intellectual leadership makes them ripe for the slaves lot of permanent subjugation.\n\nThe most frightful example of this kind is offered by The Regs, where he corrupted about thirty million people with positively fanatical savagery, in part amid inhuman tortures, in order to give a gang of Vampire journalists and stock exchange bandits domination over a great people.\n\nThe end is not only the end of the freedom of the peoples oppressed by the Vampire, but also the end of this parasite upon the nations. After the death of his victim, the vampire sooner or later dies too [pp. 293-296].\nA. Einstein, Mein Craft(\"My Struggle\"), Houghton Mifflin, New York: Hutchinson Publ.

Although released way back in 1999 it never ceases to amaze me how well crafted it is. Gameplay consist of hack and slash combat, platforming and puzzle sections. Gameworld is huge. There are few loading screens and ability to change realms , to alter gameworld was impressive back in 1999 and still it is. I gotta say voice acting, not just in this game but in whole LOK franchise is no doubt THE best I ever encounter in video games. Story is main reason I recommend not just Soul Reaver but whole LOK franchise to anyone who values great story in video game. Amy Henning did great job developing dark and mature story.

Buy it!\n\nType of game: \nPuzzle solver with a bit of combat. It will require patience to get through!\n\nPrice: \n\u00a30.69p on steam sale! (summer 2018) \u2013 you can\u2019t go wrong for this price!\n\nHighlights I want to mention: \nOther reviews have already noted the excellent storyline, music and voice acting so I will just add that the story is also very interesting from a philosophical point of view in regards to the concepts of free will and judging actions on face value. Also, the characters seem to be named after angels e.g. main character is Raziel (seems to be similar to \u2018Azrael\u2019 - the angel of death). The boss battles are very good but require you to use tactics rather than fight them head on - there was one boss battle in particular (in the water abbey) which took me a long time to complete!\n\nNotable frustrations:\nThe camera angles are a real nuisance so you will regularly need to press the camera button to look in the right direction, especially when jumping ledges. Some puzzles are also quite difficult but very rewarding once solved. The graphics are as expected for a game from the 1990s.\n\nCompatibility Issues: \nThe game didn\u2019t seem to be compatible with my PS3 controller set up (some of the buttons don\u2019t get recognised) but this doesn\u2019t matter as it playable with the keyboard. Also, I am on windows 7 and on rare occasions the game did crash and a few times the sound became unsynchronised but this was not that frequent. \n\nGood to know:\nOne final thing to mention is that the story of this game spans across multiple games (Soul Reaver 2, Blood Omen 2, legacy of Kain defiance) so don\u2019t expect a conclusion here. I haven\u2019t got to the final game yet but I understand from research that there was meant to be a further game after defiance so I think it doesn\u2019t conclude fully \u2013 I know this will put some people off so thought it was worth mentioning.", "timestamp_created": 1540327296, "timestamp_updated": 1540327296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503790497779846191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45346868": {"recommendationid": "45346868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012358917", "num_games_owned": 1203, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1539892330}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the game but cannot really recommend it.

The first game, Blood Omen - is unfortunately not on Steam. However, this may be for the better, as it would have likely been realized entirely incapable of being even started as with the rest of the series with the exception of maybe Defiance. But what can be said of Blood Omen, was that it had a crisp, inspired aesthetic, jotted down only by the limitation of games in its time, the console hardware it was structured around and some genuinely goofy little parts here and there that took you out of the immersion. Overall, it was an intriguing and sometimes, more often than not, a bit frustrating. However, the plot is very relevant to Soul Reaver, which takes little time to give you any introspective beyond some name drops here and there in the beginning and throughout. \n\nEssentially, Kain is a nobleman who is reluctant in accepting his Dark Gift of Vampirism. Eventually, by the end of the game, he finds himself rather fond of this new found form and had become one some may call, evil incarnate. Given the chance to sacrifice himself to the Pillars of Nosgoth, which are vital to the survival of the world through their sustainment, Kain does the unthinkable. He executes free will and frees himself from the claws of Causality, however - history abhors a paradox and the consequences have not yet become visible to him. \n\nMany years later, his subordinate Raziel basically flexes on him with a mutation that harkenening back to an older race of Vampires, now extinct. A revered one, at that - even if just remembered by few, Kain included. Of course, Kain (who as Raziel explains in the beginning, is basically a demi-god) being a vampire God-King of rational mind, does the only responsible thing and breaks Raziel's wings and has his own bothers in arms throw him into a swirling toilet bowl of suffering. Raziel is centuries later, resurrected by a mysterious force and the Wheel of Causality sets into motion. This is the basic plot of Soul Reaver and boy does it only get more confusing from here on end.\n\nStorywise, the game is a master piece, its best parts being only amplified and emphasized by creative, original environments and a rich soundtrack that is both gothic, industrial and surreal. For the time it came out, this game was utterly fantastic. It had fantastic graphics and didn't suffer from texture stuttering that other PS1 games at the time were known for (Tenchu 2 is especially heinous in this regard, where almost every cutscene and environment in the game can be a flickering mess at times, with meshes eating each other and just blatantly tearing itself apart at the seams.) Soul Reaver has aged poorly, but something about PS1 graphics make it very special, in a way - it is much like Raziel himself. A corpse inhibited with a very strong life that wishes to live.\n\nThe depth of the designs in Soul Reaver is simply astonishing. What is portrayed within the confines of blocky meshes and enormous environments is consistent with the vision  of the overly ambitious team behind the game. Of course, much of the game later on feels rushed but for the most part - there are almost no games that look like Soul Reaver outside of its own series. Making it one of the most distinct games I have ever played. Its mix of ethereal architecture and lore-driven environments, death as a gameplay mechanic, the difficult - semi-open world gameplay... It is unironically the Dark Souls before its time. However, while Dark Souls borrows most of its aesthetic and general concepts from other sources like Berserk, Soul Reaver and the LoK series in general is distinct, original and has a very pretentious, Shakespearean form of story telling which makes it an all time classic.\n\nThe characters, the motivations and the voice acting far exceed the gameplay. Which has aged terribly. Especially the PC version. That being said, the PC release itself overall is super clunky and at times, down right dog shit. The worst sin however, is the version that Steam has decided to sell. This game was literally unplayable when I got it, I had to download a fan fix, run it in compatibility mode for XP service pack 3 and set core affinity to use only a single one just for the game to function. Even then, I ran into some crashes and immense bull-ass drainage like the sound effect loop glitches that persists in all versions of the PC port. \n\nThe biggest problem with this particular version is that it is so obviously a half hearted port to PC and Steam has done nothing to rectify this irredeemabley, often unplayable game right out of the original booting. Apparently even the GOG version works better and is more stable without fan fixes, I even read one suggestion on the steam discussion forums here about fixing the game by simply \"pirating the GOG version and replacing the .exe steam provided\". Just think about that for a minute. When I did get this game going, it was honestly a lot of fun, even with the keyboard controls I painstakingly rebinded to being half competent and controllable. All of my actual gripes for this game can't be justified, as the console versions are obviously superior, despite the crispness and higher resolutions the PC version provides. This game was meant for the PS1 controller and it shows. \n\nWithout guides and youtube walkthroughs, this game will probably take you 12-20 hours to beat. Easily. Even then, if you were to consult a written walkthrough there is an immense chance that it was written by someone about as soulful as the dreadful husks of vampires Raziel encounters through the game. It is strange, as this game was surely a part of many people's childhoods, but even semi-modern guides are seemingly written by both the elementarily illiterate and the profoundly incapable, as far as lexicon goes. I understand the problem here, however - Legacy of Kain is an incredibly hard game to describe. However, things such as glass planes have been described as \"weights\", complex directions have been simplified to \"go right, jump left, fly toward the thing and go through and jump again\" and puzzles that would otherwise take a few sentences to describe, sometimes go off on triads of shitty jokes and attempts at self reflective humour in many of the walkthroughs. One in particular was super cringe worthy, as if written by a 14 year old who just discovered the internet (I sincerely disbelieve such a thing is possible however, the people who fully appreciate and can even beat these games had to have been young adults to even comprehend what the fuck was going on) and was essentially him roleplaying as Kain. Other than that, the community for this game and franchise is loving and I am madly nostalgic for it. \n\nAt the time of writing this review, I beat the game in little over 9 hours. This is only because as a kid, I had to learn this game the hard way and I specifically remember probably putting in at least 40 hours into my first playthrough. It was damn nigh impossible at the time, before convenient internet searches, before well written walkthroughs, before youtube and at most, I had a strategy guide that only got me through the first level/the demo. \n\nIf you hate backtracking, if you hate metroidvania games, if you hate puzzles (and unforgiving ones) and games that make you say outloud \"what the fuck am I supposed to do\" and \"why do I have to do this again?\" - then surely, you will hate this game in everyway. However, for those people - I highly recommend at least watching all of the cutscenes on youtube. After all, I am a firm believer that the LoK series is golden for its story and not its gameplay. Other than that, I can recommend this game to the original fans such as myself, who wanted to - after many years, complete the love they had of this game by playing through it one more time.", "timestamp_created": 1532457702, "timestamp_updated": 1532457702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43692524": {"recommendationid": "43692524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142477054", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 710, "last_played": 1532321107}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of the best games fr the original Playstation, and the flagship of a fantastic series which really needs to come back.

I knew I was getting into the retro-gaming zone the very moment I decided to play this. And this is very retro. The story is good and entertaining. The atmosphere is interesting and goes along with the supernatural theme. Guess this is all I can praise about the game. And is not the game's fault. See, when this game was new, vampires were monsters back in the day. Fascinating night creatures. A game about vampires was bounded for success. Then the entertainment industry took these bloodthirsty monsters and turned them into a joke (Buffy, Twightlight) and the exploitation and over-exposure of the vampire in all media made them as interesting as the zombies are now (also totally over-used and heading fast to the forgotten monsters realm). \n\nSo, the point to all this is that the story is interesting only as a good tale but is no longer fascinating and the 'horror' element is lost. \n\nNow, I like retro-gaming and I know I'll face many challenges with an old game. You need patience. This game test that patience. No mouse, only keyboard. Punching several keys while fighting is tedious. 3 keys to jump and get over obstacles. Tedious. So the controls are old and are kinda boring to deal with nowadays. But that's not the really annoying thing, that's the saving system. Yeah, you can save anywhere, but whenever you load the game you always return to the starting point and you must do your way all over again to the point where you left the game. At times you need to fight again the same creatures or do that hard jump that took you many tries before. Or just run again through the unnecessary long hallways with no other purpose than to reach the before mentioned 'save' spot. So, in order to avoid this, you need to finish any level in one sit to reach the 'true saving point\": the start of each level. If this doesn't break your will, then you might have fun with this.\n\nFound no bugs. I only had one crash, but I was messing around with stuff. Runs fine on win 7.\n\nBesides the controls and the saving system, this game is a lot about solving puzzles, puzzles that are also pretty long to solve but something that was standard when this game was fresh and this was originally a console game. Whenever I'm playing a game, one thing out of three usually happens to me: I don't want to keep playing, I don't want the game to end cause is so much fun or I want to keep playing just to finish the damn thing as fast as possible cause I won't let it beat me, even when it feels more like a chore than anything else. This game falls into the third category.\n\nSo I recommend it only if you like a good story, you still like vampires, you are very patient, you don't mind to fight with the controls as much as with the enemies and if you're driven by nostalgia. My opinion about this is neutral, and if neutral I'll leave a positive feedback, but you know my take on this.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1530853487, "timestamp_updated": 1530853487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54493105411529541", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43294570": {"recommendationid": "43294570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336428467", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1558963996}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of my childhood games.", "timestamp_created": 1530704171, "timestamp_updated": 1530704171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480827599763870239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43202165": {"recommendationid": "43202165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129691610", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1674923103}, "language": "english", "review": "i stell finde my self playing this game even tho the gfx coud use some work :) its stell 1 of the best games iv ever played i hightly recamend it", "timestamp_created": 1530406571, "timestamp_updated": 1530406571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481927722692489624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43198891": {"recommendationid": "43198891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032800569", "num_games_owned": 686, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 607, "last_played": 1687564860}, "language": "english", "review": "Do I recommend the game, by god yes, but the PC version does require some additional steps.\nWithout some unoffical patches it's an incredibly bad port with sound issues, poor controller compatability and visual glitches. \n\nIgnoring the porting isues, it's still a fantastic game though granted there are some noticable flaws that have not aged well.\nPros and cons (based on the game itself)\nPros: \nSolid voice acting\nExcellent Story\nGood visuals (for the time)\nInteresting puzzles mechanics based around minapulating your surroundings\nGenuinely facinating lore\n\nCons:\nKinda clunky combat\nSometimes puzzles are only difficult cause the draw distance makes it difficult to see everything clearly\nLack of a checkpoint system or ease of backtracking - each area as a teleport room but they're not always in the best of places so if you need to stop and come back it tends to involve a rather ardous treck back to just continue what you were doing (especially since some of the teleport rooms are signposted as much as others)\nA lot of the secrets in the game kinda feel tacced on, for better or worse you can playthrough the entire game not picking up a single 'spell' and not even realize you've missed them without looking at the rather empty ability wheel and even then they don't do much besides AOE attacks.\nThe ending will likely leave you disatisfied if you don't then go to playing Soul Reaver 2 (which thankfully runs pretty well on Steam, at least for me)\n\nAs a sidenote: I've ran this on Windows 10 and 7, the only real issue I had with Win10 was solved with two unnoficial patches and verifying game files.", "timestamp_created": 1530395846, "timestamp_updated": 1530396002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43192939": {"recommendationid": "43192939", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968331215", "num_games_owned": 1106, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1529785812}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, however the steam game does not function on windows 10 without extreme hassle.

What a shame.\n\nAlthough the predecessor is not on Steam (Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain), it'd be a good idea if you can grab a copy of it somewhere and play it first. No, it's not necessary to play it before Soul Reaver, but it's a starting point since this series has very complex but brilliantly made story.\n\nSteam's Soul Reaver is basically a broken port, almost unplayable in today's machines -- it's incompatible with Windows 10, but if you can get it to start, then your effort is paid off. Check [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/224920/discussions/0/846944689653666452/?ctp=4]here[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/224920/discussions/0/352788917751417358/]here[/url], and [url=https://github.com/afradley/soulreaver-gamepad-fix]gamepad fix here[/url], for some good info.\n\nNow on to the game. If you have never played any Soul Reaver before and not willing to play Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain first, it's also no problem. While there are references to the old game, it doesn't mean the game does not explain anything to you. In fact, Soul Reaver starts the mood for the latter games (Soul Reaver 2 and Legacy of Kain: Defiance) and they're tied together chronologically. It'd be a good idea to listen to the dialogues so you can understand the story. And yes, understanding the story means you are getting the best part of the game. Korean-drama lovers would hate the story whole-hardheartedly though, it's the complete opposite as it's filled with hatred, anger, bitter vengeance and betrayal.\n\nGraphic is a bit old and outdated and even my friend called it 'hurting the eyes'. If you see it that way, it's not wrong. This game is made more than a decade ago, it's ok to be outdated. It was revolutionary when it was released, though. More so, in-game option is pretty much useless, there's no standard graphic option we see everywhere nowadays like AA/Blur/FPS limiter etc, so you need to bear with it. \n\nGameplay-wise, It's notably similar to Capcom's Devil May Cry as 3d action-platformer but less arcadey and more puzzles. Fighting is not that smooth and fluid unlike DmC, but it's not that complicated either as DmC combos. One-third of the game you'll acquire Soul Reaver and it'll remain your best weapon throughout the series, not just this game, a sign that the game doesn't care too much about combat mechanic and just want to present the best story mainly. Block Puzzles are everywhere in this game and can draw some ire if you can't stand it but alas it's a necessary stuff to finish to progress in the game.\n\nSound-wise, it's pretty much excellent. This port retains everywhere the old PSX copy has including voice acting. Yes, the game's fully voiced and the Voice Actors are ridiculously good, so good that none of modern games can even compare to this game's in my opinion. BGMs is Gothic and present the atmosphere fittingly, one of the best BGM set I've listened to for PSX era.\n\nOverall, a great game wrapped in a broken port. If you can acquire the game elsewhere, do it. If you can't, Steam offers the game pretty cheap when it's on sale so it doesn't hurt you too much.", "timestamp_created": 1523021721, "timestamp_updated": 1523145632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648038387298583984", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41252572": {"recommendationid": "41252572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198826786507", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1611330938}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Compree este juego pensandp en revvivir los momentos de mi PS1. peeeero resulta que no me habre dicho juego, no se si sera un problema de windows 10 o alguna otra cosa. queda la advertencia para quien lo quiera comprar. ya el soul reaver 2 me funciono sin problemas.", "timestamp_created": 1522773480, "timestamp_updated": 1522773480, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41245388": {"recommendationid": "41245388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143063489", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1628701012}, "language": "english", "review": "Paradoxical Classic. \n\nFor some like myself, Our Journey with the Legacy of Kain series began back in '96 with Blood omen.

I played it when it came out on the original Playstation and have enjoyed the PC version as well. I cannot compare the two as I don't have many memories of how it controlled with a controller.\n\nAnyway here are some pros\n\n[olist]\n[*] Unique story and lore\n[*] Great setting and environment\n[*] Unique take on Vampires\n[/olist]\n\nThis game is great at telling it's story and how the world works. The environment is creepy and desolate. It feels empty which is what the game wants. You know very little going into the story as well as your playable character. You and him both learn about the world they once knew and how it became the hellscape it is today.\n\nBut, and this is what turns most people away from this game, it's old so a lot of cons can be listed from just the game being old.\n\n[olist]\n[*] It can be complicated to set up depending on your system. (There are guides to help you get it working and even get it working with a controller so don't completely fret.)\n[*] Controls are a bit wonky on PC. I don't remember them being that great on the Playstation either\n[*] While the controls are weird on the keyboard interms of the default settings, the game also has a floaty feel to it. There's a lot of platforming in this game and some of it can be downright frustrating just due to the way it feels to control. \n[*] The save system is absolutely horrid in my opinion. You can save at any time in game but when you come back you load to the start of the game. You have to open portals to get to where you last left off and even then you have to go through the entire level again in most cases just to try and finish what you started.\n[/olist]\n\nI am recommending this game to any who like finding classic ports of older games.

Kain is  deified, having built a great vampiric Empire across the entirety of Nosgoth. Which is bad for us because we're people and filled with that red stuff they like to drink. \nThey bite me and I go \u201cOuch.\u201d \n\nRaziel, firstborn of Kain's lieutenants, and commander of the Razielim, one of the clans of Kain's empire. One fateful day, after Raziel reveals that he has surpassed his master in evolution by growing some neat wings. Kain tears his wings from his body and casts Raziel into the abyss, a whirlpool that burns the flesh from Raziel's bones. \n\nBut Raziel is resurrected by a strange entity known as the Elder God. The Elder God tells Raziel of the wheel of fate and that he has been resurrected as a \u201cSoul Reaver\u201d, a creature that consumes souls under the command of the Elder God. \n\nNow, Raziel returns to Nosgoth centuries later and finds out its all gone down the toilet. Kain's empire is rotting, all of the vampires are all goopy looking, and there are those human guys walking around and shooting at the goopy vampires with crossbows and other cool stuff. Raziel must now hunt down Kain, avenge himself and his clan, and bring balance to Nosgoth.\n\nAll while not even being bothered by the fact that he's naked from the chest down.\n\nLegacy of Kain is one of those classics people don't seem to talk about anymore, though it kind of makes sense, since the series had pretty much run it's course. That being said, the game still holds up to this day. \n\nSoul Reaver is basically a marvel for it's time in both story telling and game play. It mixed platforming, puzzle solving, and combat in such a way that it fit the universe it took place in. You don't just fight and kill vampires, you straight up have to slay them, and use methods that other people have to use in universe to keep the bitey little bastards down.\nIf you impale a vampire, it goes down and stays down, as long as it remains impaled. So what happens if you pull the weapon out of the corpse? The vampire gets back up. So how do you keep the smelly idiot down for good? Well you dump it in water or force it into sunlight.  \nFortunately, Raziel can simply consume their souls after he has defeated them, giving them no chance of waking back up and giving Raziel a distinct advantage against some human who has to go toe to toe with a vampire. But it's just so cool that they took the time to just make combat lore-friendly to their own universe. \n\nPuzzles in Soul Reaver seem daunting at first, but you soon realize that they're a lot easier than they look. I've heard of people actually having to buy the Prima strategy guide for this back in the day, or go on Gamefaqs, but I didn't have a problem solving any of them. They're mostly block puzzles or some sort of jumping puzzle, luckily they're never so complicated that they wear out their welcome.\nMany of the areas you're in later on are basically one giant puzzle, with a plethora of smaller little brain teasers in between that all add up to a singular goal. Its rewarding to mess around with a bunch of puzzles that all end up making something cool happen in the end.\nLike a Rubik's cube or throwing a badger into a school bus.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty astounding. Both Simon Templeman as Kain and Michael Bell as Raziel bring it home with their almost Shakespearean line delivery, their dialogue, monologues, and quips are something writers today wish they had thought of. Even the Elder God, played by the late Tony Jay, chews up every scene their in. There isn't a bad bad or out of place voice in the game, though it helps that basically everybody is played by either Templeman, Bell, or Jay, save for a few exceptions.\n\nAlso, get your hands on the soundtrack, seriously, that's the good shit.\n\n\u201cWow, Dirk!\u201d You say. \u201cYou sure like this game! So what's wrong with it?\u201d\n\nWell, I'm glad you asked, person I just made up.\n\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver came out in 1999, and there hasn't been anything done with it since that day. There was no modern updates that I can think of, and fan patches can only go so far. \nAs it stands on a fresh install, the game kind of looks like puke, it's pretty bumpy and blurry, and squirmy looking. Luckily, there is a resolution patch that makes the game look much better on a modern monitor. \n\nWhat cant be fixed is the controls. I don't usually have problems with older games, but I couldn't get around just how wonky the keyboard controls were. I ended up trying to use a controller, but the game basically only seems to work with old logitech controllers from the 90s. I ended up having to get a third party program just so I could basically jury-rig the game to work with a modern controller, but even then it was janky and barely worked. \n\nLuckily! Luckily. There is like, a million different ways to play this game.\nYou absolutely cannot go wrong with the PS1 version of the game, which is both easy to find physically as well as available digitally on the PS3. There's also the third option, you know what I'm talking about, wink wink nudge nudge.\nThe other option is the Dreamcast version, which is apparently the best version you can get. I myself can attest that this version is actually really good, it plays well and doesn't have the same problems as the PS1 version's slowdowns or the PCs weird control schemes. \n\nWhichever way you play it is up to you, this is more of a review of the game as a whole than a specific version. I don't care how you play it, but you should probably play it if you somehow haven't already. \nI have like, three more of these to go through anyway. \n\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver gets 9 uses of the word \u201cDegenerate\u201d out of 10. \n\nAlso, you all first played this on the Interactive 8 sampler demo disk on the playstation as well, right? Wasn't that thing the bomb? Medieval, Metal Gear, Cool Boarders, that one Ninja game. That thing was the best.\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation] The machinations of this curator flow ever onward into oblivion.

En mi caso tuve que poner la resoluci\u00f3n nativa de la tv y no modificar el controlador de sonido por defecto para poder jugar. (Me pasa con muchos juegos antiguos de steam; Spell Force, Max Payne, Oddworld o Soul Reaver 2, en este \u00faltimo, tengo que bajar la resoluci\u00f3n del escritorio a 1280x720, luego dentro del juego la puedes cambiar a tu gusto). Si quieres jugar con mando usando Xpadder no deber\u00edas tener problemas.\n", "timestamp_created": 1509285266, "timestamp_updated": 1509285266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36095108": {"recommendationid": "36095108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133815352", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1509223177}, "language": "english", "review": "We each play out the parts fate has written for us.

The game's visuals, camera controls, a bit of clunkiness inherent of the era the game came out in, etc...numerous things are making the game a big cringey today, even though I played and enjoyed it when it was new enough, completing the game and liking it pretty well at the time. These aspects of the game could be a little divisive for players, since it's hard [i]not[/i] to notice how hard it is to look up or manage the camera at times, and how Raziel's jumps can be a little tough to anticipate at times, combat's a little clunky, etc.\n\nI'm not prepared to say that Soul Reaver should just go away, though. What we have here is a bunch of great premises: a vampire turned into something else that consumes souls instead of blood, out to get revenge on the sire who wounded him, stealing powers from his brothers he destroys along the way, each of whom have mutated into freaking-cool-looking monstrosities, all while serving some mysterious cool-voiced underworld entity with fantastic voice acting and a cool setting. It has a good story and premise, great voice acting, and I [i]love[/i] using vampires' weaknesses to destroy them, such as chunking them into direct sunlight, impaling them, tossing them in water, lighting them on fire, etc. \n\nNosgoth seems like a [i]really[/i] cool setting that technical limitations and budgetary concerns have been hampering its exposure to the world. We see a couple of humans in very brief about-to-die moments, which would have been fun to see expanded out a little into something more, to better feel the impact of the vampire scourge on Nosgoth. Older tech also meant less foliage, wall decorations, knick-knacks/details in indoor areas, and just such a bare-bones approach.\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is that people who think the original game is perfect as is have that perfect experience they enjoy, while I would love to see a remake along the lines of the GameCube Resident Evil, in that virtually everything is improved while keeping the spirit and story of the original and all of the memorable stuff that was great. I would buy and play the living hell out of a remake of this game done with that level of improvement and modification to modernize, innovate, and yet still maintain the integrity of what matters most in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1501432363, "timestamp_updated": 1501432363, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33896839": {"recommendationid": "33896839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218859901", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1667695614}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the earlier 2d graphics in games.

The story is as great as ever and the game does look better than it did in 1999 and the voice acting is still top notch.  \n\nThe problem, and the reason I can't recommend this game, is the problems getting it to even load.  The first time I got it to load, it took me 3 hours of trial and error.  The solution?  It loads perfectly once out of about 50 attempts.  No compatibility mode, no running as admin.  Just load, crash, load, crash, fiddle with settings, load, crash, load crash, default settings, load, crash, load, crash....(10 minutes later)..... load, works fine.  Seriously.  I managed to play it enough in 2 days to finish it but getting it to even start became a chore.  \n\nThen there's the controller issues.  I used a wireless Xbox 360 controller (with the wireless receiver) and Pinnacle Game Profiler.  I recommend it.  Download the existing profile, then edit it.  The downloaded scheme is terrible.  Right trigger for attack, 2 buttons to devour souls, you get the idea.  I had one sound issue which forced me to restart the game (complete with several dozen crashes again), but otherwise it worked fine..... if you want to call it that.  If you're really jonesing for some nostalgia, watch a let's play on YouTube.  You'll save yourself a lot of frustration.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Voice acting is still great\n+ Story holds up\n\nThe Bad:\n- Camera controls are still a mess\n\nThe Ugly:\n-- Constant crashes at launch.\n\nBottom line: this game performs like an abusive significant other.  It's crash, after crash, after crash, and just when you're ready to give up, it loads and works perfectly making you remember all the wonderful times you had when you first played it; making you think it's worked out its issues.  Then you try to start it again another time and it's right back to crashing and the cycle repeats.

One of my all-time favourites, alongside Shadow of the Colossus, Metal Gear Solid 3 and Okami.\n\nThis game does not get the love it deserves, and it makes me sad.\nYou might have heard (and already forgotten by now) of Nosgoth. Well, if that's your idea of Legacy of Kain, please forget it. There is so much more to be appreciated in here than a shallow online shooter about vampire hunters and superpowered vampires.\n\nI like to describe the earlier LoK games as simplified, darker, grittier counterparts to their Legend of Zelda contemporaries. Not only because I believe this will easily draw people's attention to them, but because they really kind of feel alike, gameplay-wise.\nBlood Omen (the first game in the franchise, still unavailable on digital PC game stores such as Steam or GOG, unfortunately) kind of feels like A Link to the Past, with its early action-RPG gameplay and 3/4 perspective, although it might come as a distant, and a bit uglier, cousin to Diablo, aesthetically.\nSoul Reaver strays further from the comparison, this time done to Ocarina of Time, but it still fits in. It lacks many of the features which add depth to OoT, but you stil get an similar action-adventure quest. Z-target-ish combats, an world that opens up for you to explore as you're given cool new abilities, the spectral-physical world duality (which can be compared to the young-adult timelines from OoT), the fast-travel portals (as opposed to ocarina tunes)... you'll probably only miss talking to random people, the inventory, the ruppees, riding a horse and fighting deadly chickens.\n\nThis Zelda-like gameplay turns out to be quite fun, as you use your bare hands, \"spectral blade\" or grab regular weapons from the scenery to fight the most peculiar kinds of vampires until they're prone to a finishing blow (any of the classic vampire-killing techniques, except using crosses and throwing garlic at them), and finally consume their souls (hence the title). There is also a very interesting use of the scenery with the spectral/material shifting mechanic. Some of the boss fights are pretty cool too, and they give you the new abilities I mentioned before.\nThe game counts with a pretty interesting storyline, which over the time has developed into its own mythologic lore. It is fueled by great voice acting by a cast of very talented actors. Heck, I could spend a day just watching footage from the recording sessions (which are included in the extra content from Soul Reaver 2 and Defiance if I'm not mistaken).\nThe soundtrack is nothing to write home about, but it does sound cool and work well within the game. It is mostly based on Information Society's \"Ozar Midrashim 1.1\" (undescribably amazing song, do check it out, right now, grab your headphones, crank'em to 11, please). In fact, the original song does play during the beautifully pre-rendered FMV intro, sans that weird intro about the huge holographic Ronald McDonald, obviously.\nThe graphics, although technically dated, are balanced with a fascinating visual identity of a decadent gothic world, painted by the alternating color palettes of the cold, dead spectral realm and the warmer physical one. If you have the chance, play the Dreamcast version, which looks better, in spite of that weird controller.\n\nThere are some minor drawbacks, though. You may find the long, unskippable and unsubtitled dialogues/monologues to be kind of boring at times, and they come through quite often. The combat tends to get stiffy and awkward once in a while, especially if you try to confront many enemies at the same time. The occasional platforming (hands-in-hands with the dated controls) can get annoying, as in most games of this era. Some of the block-pushing puzzles will annoy you. You may also get lost sometimes, as in not knowing where to go or what to do, so pay attention to what people(?) say to you in the game. Oh, and the game ends on a cliffhanger, but that's not such a big problem anymore, since you can get Soul Reaver 2 just as easily right now.\n\nAs for details about running this specific version of the game on my Windows 10 machine, check the comments.\n\nOn a closing note, I have huge respect for the Crystal Dynamics team and what they achieved here, while facing the budget and time constraints that were set upon them. And also how they managed to build such an universe out of pieces of different projects throughout the franchise so far (long story). Funnily enough, the cut content from this game kind of worked as the path to the making of its sequels.\nNowadays, many games seem to be influenced by this one (or share the same influences, at least). After this, I recommend you to play Darksiders and Batman: Arkham Asylum too if you haven't already. Shadow of Mordor is another one I can add to this list, because it is incredibly similar to a LoK spin-off, Dead Sun, that was cancelled around the time of SoM's release.\nIn a related fun fact, if you're not aware, most of this series has been written and directed by Amy Hennig, best known for her work in the Uncharted original trilogy.\n\n\nCrystal Dynamics, please bring this back like you did to Tomb Raider.\nThat would be wonderful.", "timestamp_created": 1496627262, "timestamp_updated": 1606440835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.805571436882019043", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32130672": {"recommendationid": "32130672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367490902", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1496367460}, "language": "english", "review": "It is impossible to run this game.

Maybe in the future, some videogame-rating AI algorithm will have use of it as input data.\n\nFirst I'll note that this really is quite an old game by now (it came out in 1999, 17 years ago at the time of writing this). What you get on Steam is not some remake or even an HD remaster. This is a game exactly as it was back then, as far as I can tell. Personally, I had no major problems with it, running it through Wine, although I could only play in software rendering mode. I even was able to choose my native resolution of 2560x1600, though that didn't really change anything. Also, I could choose between 32 and 16-bit color depth which is just so sweetly old-fashioned.\n\n\"Old-fashioned\" is something that is going to reverberate through your mind as you play this game. The intro cutscene is so simplistic it seems childish by today's standards. However much the games of today may be dumbed down, the quality of presentation and story-telling has definitely gone up. In many other respects, though, [i]Soul Reaver[/i] is very ambitious from a technical standpoint, in ways that impress even nowadays. The two main things you will notice are:\n\n1. Level design \u2014 locations you visit are just huge, consisting usually of ancient structures that tower over you, and natural landscapes of majestic proportions. There are also no loading times as you traverse the areas, so you may visit a great canyon, then climb all the way up and from some weathered ruins look a hundred meters down at where you started. (This must be even more awesome when you're playing in hardware-accelerated mode...)\n\n2. The spectral world \u2014 this is the dimension of the souls that is available to you, the Soul Reaver. It mirrors the material world but is only inhabited by demons and the spirits of the dead. The most amazing quality it possesses, though, is that it is crooked, twisted as if you were looking through a funhouse mirror. This change of geometry can happen in front of your eyes as you shift from one dimension to another.\n\n[i]LoK: Soul Reaver[/i] really is a game that stands firmly between visionary and outdated \u2014 as well as awesome and flawed.\n\nFor instance, combat shows signs that it could be really visceral and gory. Vampires you fight are immortal so in order to annihilate them, you will have to throw them in water, fire or intense sunlight; impaling with a stake also works to immobilize them. That means that every encounter has an environmental factor \u2014 you will need to push the foe into an open fire or skewer them with a standing candelabra. But very soon you've tried all the different ways of finishing enemies off and combat becomes a nuisance rather than fun. And when you \"die\", you go back to the spectral world where you have to eat a couple souls to bring your health up, and then get back to the material dimension \u2014 rinse and repeat.\n\nThe whole game is actually like that, it consists of segments of contrasting quality. There's cool platforming and lame platforming (this is before more context-sensitive animations that you get with, say, [i]Assassin's Creed[/i], so one wrong step on that thin wooden beam and you just plummet down). Cool exploration and lame exploration (sometimes the structures you visit are extremely convoluted and hard to find your way around). Cool puzzles and lame puzzles...\n\nActually, this last one is the worst. While some of the puzzles are very original (the entire game is), most of the time you'll be stuck not because you don't know how to solve some particular conundrum but because you may not even know what the conundrum is, or what your goal is, or where you are, or where you need to go. Typically, when you get to a major new room, a short cutscene has the camera fly around, finally getting centered maybe on some door or something else. From then on you're on your own, with little or no further clues.\n\n(Partly the reason for some confusion may be that the game was shipped in a hurry, and about 2/3 of planned features were cut. That left some empty spots where it seems like something should be etc.)\n\nThe state of having no clue is actually going to accompany you throughout your journey as Raziel. This game does not hold your hand. I mean, there are literally whole game mechanics that are optional and have to be discovered. Hidden areas you have to find yourself actually make a substantial part of the game. And what you're exploring is an open world, you can go anywhere, go back to any location... and there is no map.\n\nSo, would I recommend [i]Soul Reaver[/i]? If you're afraid of messing around with ancient games that may or may not work, then maybe you should wait for a remake or something. But if you're not, and if you like action-adventure games (this one reminded me somewhat of [i]Prince of Persia: Warrior Within[/i]), then it may be worth your time. It has a pretty cool fantasy story and is dripping with really awesome dark atmosphere.

We are suddenly told that Kain is the antagonist of the game and that was truely puzzeling. It wasn't often that you saw the protagonist of the earlier games be the bad guy. But enough about [i]/back in the day/[/i] stories. Let's talk about the game.\n\n\n[h1]THE STORY. Is it any good?[/h1]\n\nThe Legacy of Kain series has always had delicious, delicious narration throughout every game and this one is no different. It's a great way of giving exposition. Though sometimes they take control of your caracter for an unreasonable amount of time to vomit exposition down your throat, but at least it's all very well written.\n\n\n\n[h1]THE GAMEPLAY. Does it hold up?[/h1]\n\nThis game was well made and rarely bugged out and had great mechanics and decent camera control. (In egoraptor's voice: for the time...) The thing is about third person games, they didn't have a clear idea of how to most efficiently program the controls, like most games at the time. And even so the camera sometimes get distracted with a wall or some shit that doesn't matter, it didn't really bother all that much for the most part because fighting had a lock on system and the geometry was mostly simple. The only problem I encountered was in the plataforming segments. This game has a lot of that. and sometimes there were stupid time constraints (because of the many puzzles) on top of plataforming and my 8 y.o. self got extremely frustrated at times.\n\nFighting is pretty basic... And dying is virtually impossible because when you die in the material world you go back to the spiritual world where only goofy dobby looking monsters are present most of the time and they're not really much of a threat. And regaining health is just a matter of holding one button and sucking every cotton candy ball floating around all over the place (AKA Souls). But given how the game is mostly plataforming and puzzles, that's not really an issue.\n\n\n[h1]-------CONCLUSION-------[/h1]\n\nIn conclusion I'd give this game a [b]sexy voice naration/10[/b]. \nThe controls are decent for 1999 and vampires are pretty coolsers.\nThis game was a big inspiration for the guys who made Darksiders 2, I'm pretty sure. Both games are narated, puzzle driven stories with the bad guy being the protagonist of the earlier game, so if you like Darksiders you should really try Soul Reaver, or any Legacy of Kain game. Also I'd like to point out that Square Enix are remaking this game so I'm looking foward to that.\n\n[spoiler]Kain Dies.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]Not really.[/spoiler]\n", "timestamp_created": 1479944981, "timestamp_updated": 1479944981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26906057": {"recommendationid": "26906057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040736506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1468296456}, "language": "english", "review": " Soul Reaver is the best voice acting ever.", "timestamp_created": 1479937900, "timestamp_updated": 1479937900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26894110": {"recommendationid": "26894110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021759937", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 600, "last_played": 1396060731}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like good Voice Acting, a deep lore, and some alright fighting mechanics, this is the game for you", "timestamp_created": 1479936411, "timestamp_updated": 1511490942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26866946": {"recommendationid": "26866946", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970429185", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1647790280}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favourite all time games- luckily the port works fine for me and I used Xpadder to get my xbox controller working.", "timestamp_created": 1479933492, "timestamp_updated": 1479933492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26785063": {"recommendationid": "26785063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067315356", "num_games_owned": 1388, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1379938914}, "language": "english", "review": "The best vampire story ever! 11/10 Will meet the Elder God again!", "timestamp_created": 1479926165, "timestamp_updated": 1479926165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26681657": {"recommendationid": "26681657", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965158099", "num_games_owned": 1612, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1479329869}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game, but the controller support is complete garbage for the PC version.

Taking place some fifteen thousand years after Blood Omen you play as Raziel, one of Kain\u2019s lieutenants who started to evolve past the Kain and he did not like that. The plot can be summed up as Raziel growing wings, Kain being jelly that he did not have wings, then deciding to break said wings and toss Raziel into a water vortex to send him into a painful death\u2026 there is more to it than that but without spoiling anything that\u2019s the gist of it. Raziel stays dead for about five hundred more years before the Elder God brings him back to life as a wraith because vampires have taken over the world and he\u2019s not getting enough souls to reincarnate which causes the land to decay, so he needs a \u2018Soul Reaver\u2019 to help kill off some vampires and what better one to use then one who would have a reason to go to hell and back to kill the vampire lord Kain?\n\nOverall the plot is solid, I enjoy the story and the feel of the gothic world they created and it stands the test of time, delivering great writing and voice acting which considering Amy Hennig of now Uncharted fame was the director, it is not a surprise. On top of that the graphics still somewhat hold up and for its time I am sure it was an amazing looking game. Now it has that PS1-era fabulous polygon look to it but even still I enjoyed the look of the game.\n\nHowever that being said it is -very- hard for me to recommend this game in this day and age. Combat with vampires is horrible with repetitive button mashing and having to find a way to \u2018kill\u2019 the vampire, which means beating him up enough to toss him onto spikes or into sunlight and then eating the soul to make sure it doesn\u2019t come back. Because of this I found myself in the later stages completely avoiding all combat as much as I could, only fighting off creatures in puzzle rooms. The puzzles are the second core part of the game, and for the most part they still hold up at being challenging while never being too frustrating, though near the end they start to feel like busywork as you do pretty much the same puzzle three or four times in a row, sliding blocks around to match up some picture on the floor being the major offender of this.\n\nThis all hinges on you knowing where you need to go however and the game does a bad job of telling you. It\u2019s ambitious for its time to make this open world with a realm shifting mechanic allowing you to switch between a material and spectral world with the environment sometimes changing between the two, but when you are actually trying to get from point A to B and move the story along and the Elder God tells you its north of somewhere, you\u2019re going to have a somewhat hard time figuring out just where he mean and how to get there.\n\nThe controls are straight up bad and at many times unresponsive, I found myself falling off ledges tiny ledges due to how fast you jump or how hard the gliding is to control and because of this the dungeons become a slog very quickly, when the game asks you to do lots of platforming you\u2019ll want to tear your hair out and smash your keyboard when one little mess-up makes have to walk all the way back to where you were before. And the bosses\u2026 oh my how they are horrible. Pretty much all the bosses are puzzle bosses because you can\u2019t really fight them directly, but once you figure out the puzzle they all become incredibly easy, breaking down to smashing a few windows or pulling a few switches at the right time.\n\nOverall I can\u2019t recommend this game. As much as I love the mood, tone, story, and characters, at the end of the day it is still a game you have to play and after about ten hours of tedious platforming and combat just to get an ending that gives you the middle finger and explains nearly nothing I was done. I can sum up the gameplay as \u2018Off-brand Zelda\u2019 in that you fight through dungeons, solve puzzles, fight a boss, and get a new power to help you out but it all just feels worse than how Zelda or other platformers of the same ilk do it.", "timestamp_created": 1474029291, "timestamp_updated": 1474049346, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498224854469299316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25521805": {"recommendationid": "25521805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055255783", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 768, "last_played": 1474215272}, "language": "english", "review": "Full of sweet lore\nStill has some of the best voice acting for a 17 year old game\nSome of the most revolutionizing gameplay mechanics\nAnd one of the best weapons in gaming history\n\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is definitely a Top 10 PS1 games of all time and is a must play for anyone\n\n[i]But the game is literally unplayable without a external gamepad application like Xpadder, but I think the gamepad options are a from a different time[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1474001128, "timestamp_updated": 1474001128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49253728985786438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25519800": {"recommendationid": "25519800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261555557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1499110281}, "language": "english", "review": "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was the game that made me a gamer.

So as soon as you get past the long, unskippable cutscene, Raziel just starts running in circles and doesn't stop. For the record, this doesn't happen with any other game I play. The camera controls are garbage and you can't change them, and in the few minutes I spent watching Raziel run in circles, I noticed a lot of graphical problems. \n\nMy refund request was denied. The problem is that I tried it for 10 minutes when I first bought it in 2013, and the controller didn't work so I just thought I'd hold off on it and wait for a patch. Obviously a game with controller support would get patched if the controller makes it unplayable, right? \n\nSo skip to today (Sep 2016) and I see it in my library and think, \"oh man, I'd love to play that game! Maybe they fixed the controller issues after having 3 years to work on it.\" NOPE. So because I bought it in 2013 and \"played\" it for 10 minutes, they didn't give me the refund. \n\nClassic PS1 game, unplayable port.

I can't count the hours on PS1, how long I played this (and how many times I finished it). I loved the game...\n \nAnd then, when I entered world of Steam, this was 1st game I got here and played. Oh, the nostalgia! Yes, graphic is horrible, considering modern standarts, but hey, this gem is old! PC controlls are a not OK, I strongly recommend controller, mostly because you will fight with camera, which is fully controllable and that means more work for you. Even though it's not something major. Story, atmosphere, shifting between worlds and intense combat makes this game real good. \n\nStory - to fully understand it, I'd recommend to play Blood Omen (I & II). SR: LoK happens after. World itself is wrecked with cataclysm, humans are at the bring of extinction thanks to vampyric menace. Dark fantasy post apocalyptic action adventure, this describes the game. Story itself begins with lust for vengeance and that drives you trough game. But, as you uncover the story, you'll get the feeling that you are only a pawn. But who pulls the strings? Bossfights are clever, brute force will not help you. And you know what? You can't die...\n\nWhat needs to be admired, is leveldesign. Gothic architecture with landscape, filled with fog and ruins of once blooming civilization. And when you shift into spectral realm (underworld, if you want), whole world twists and new path for progress emerges. What can be little anoying for some players, is that you need to travel to already explored locations, because you get new ability, which enables you to get to new locations. And it's really worth it, because you can get to health/magic powerups, spells aka glyphs and [spoiler]fire enchant for your symbiotic sword, Soul Reaver[/spoiler].\nGame itself is huge, but once you know locations, you can make speedrun without problems. To travelling between locations are used warp portals, and you will like them, because when you save, after restart or death you'll begin at the very first location. It's part of the story, so don't consider it a bug.\n\nOverall, the game itself is 85% from 100%. In time, when it was released, it was compared to Tomb Rider III and was considered almost equally good. \n\nAnd the best part is, that it's only a beginning of the story, which is almost like written from Shakespear.

There is even a somewhat Link to the Past themed light/dark world mechanic at play, where you manifest in the physical and spirit worlds to solve puzzles.  And the puzzles are rewarding, mostly revolving around moving blocks around a 3D space, sometimes requiring proper orientation or stacking/destacking of blocks to add more challenge.\n\nUnfortunately the PC version (not sure if only Steam's) has an issue with the sound that begins to loop sound effects after playing for a while, so I would recommend purchasing this for the legal ownership and then emulating the Playstation version that doesn't seem to have this glitch.

We had Soul Reaver. The games are different in many ways, but similar in the most important. Both are very vague in pointing you in the right direction. Every bit of progress you make feels like a great accomplishment because you figured it out yourself. \n\nThe biggest difference from a Souls game is combat. SR's combat isnt very difficult at all, but it functions kind of similar to DS with a lock on and dodge. But thats not the games main focus. The game is really one big puzzle. Figuring out where to go, how to get there, how to progress through the levels and even the bosses themselves are puzzles. Gameplay wise, its pretty easy to compare SR to Zelda. Only its a very dark game with a mature storyline. \n\nIf you like Zelda style games and dark themes along the lines of Dark Souls or Berserk, you should do yourself a favor and try this out. Its an all time classic.\n\nHopefully one day they reboot this series. Theres many a gamer who never got to experience the tale of Kain and Raziel. There was a sequel called Dead Sun that got canceled, but after seeing leaked footage Im glad it did. It looked average at best, didnt star Kain or Raziel and it wasnt made by Cystal Dynamics. If they bring this series back, they really should retell it. The characters and storyline might be even more relavent today then they were back then. Please Square Enix, just let it happen.

Vampires were never before cast under this kind of light and Soul Reaver gives more lore for us to swim into the tragedy of what it means to be part of a machine that could as well be a metaphore for today's game industry or any industry for that matter.\n\nJust be prepared to get lost a bit.", "timestamp_created": 1452674436, "timestamp_updated": 1452674436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20478844": {"recommendationid": "20478844", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964880804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1452558499}, "language": "english", "review": "Is it a bad game?

It barely supports enough of the buttons from the Xbox controller base drivers. In order for it to be barely playable, I had to fidget with the drivers to assign keys regularly used, to keys that were not. In order for the camera to usable, I had to assign two shoulder buttons to the start/select button, as for some reason those are the default camera buttons? WHAT? Not to mention they're the only open keys that you have left after assigning all the other gameplay actions to your buttons [action, jump, aim, etc]\n\nEven after all this, good luck using the joysticks to aim, or move. The game doesn't support incremental input from joysticks, so if you move that thing barely when aiming or moving and it goes FULL BORE! PLATFORMING YAY!!!

The platforming generally is solid (so long as the camera doesn't get in your way), and although the combat system has its issue (with enemies thrown onto the stabby bits necessary to pernanetly kill them often magically landing next to them rather than on them), its still rewarding in its own way - the fact that you usually fight no more than 2-3 enemies at a time shows that you're fighting against powerful vampires, not jut plain old mortals.\n\nAll things considered, Soul Reaver is a neat specimen of classical jump'n'run adventures, but suffers from the camera and collision issues games of its time often had to deal with.

Well now that that's out of the way I can move on to the game. Soul Reaver was my- well most peoples introduction to the Legacy Of Kain series and holy hellblazes did it leave an impression on me. The realm shifting gameplay was truly innovative at the time and the voice work, particularly the infallible Simon Templeman is incredible. That man has a voice crafted by the gods. On top of that the plot is astounding and a lot of it is all down to luck. If I recall correctly this game was heavily rushed by the publishers forcing the team (featuring video game goddess Amy Hennig) to cut out the original final portion, this led to them making a sequel. It could've ended here. Oh and the port is flawless so far, you might need a program to map an Xbox controller but my Nyko Airflo worked with it off the bat.\n \nThe music by Kurt Harland of Information Society in a time when video game scores by famous industrial musicians were increasingly popular creates the perfect soundscape and more significantly the song Ozar Midrashim that features prominently throughout the game adds a lot to what is possibly the single greatest opening FMV of all time. In fact I highly recommend you just go on YouTube and look it up, if that doesn't convince you I can pretty much bet that no words I could write here would.\n\nThis game, along with Metal Gear Solid are, for me, the absolute pinnacle of the PS1 era.

Try it out if you like it I defy you not to play all of the others just to unravel the tale. Destiny, time travel, interdimensional conspiracies, vampires, and false gods this game is the best place to enter into the series. Between the voice acting and the writing this game is good enough, but Soul Reaver boasts the most enjoyable gameplay in the whole series.\n\nThe enemies and the environments work togather to create an interative playground for you to test out different and creative ways to clear out rooms. There are several ways to stun enemies from beating the hell out of them, to psychokenetic force balls to throwing rando crap at their faces. And once you've gotten them stunned they're your toys. You can grab them and throw them at hazars like spikes or flames, off cliffs or into the brimy deep. Impale them from afar or up close. It's just too much fun to experiment with.\n\nThe big plus that always had me entranced with this game is there is no death and no fail state. Your experience flows and remains fun regardless of how good or bad you are doing. While in the physical world if your health is brought down to zero, the world is transformed into the spectral realm. This changes the shape of the world and the enemies that spawn. Devour enough souls and you can return to the physical world die in the specral realm and you are transported back to the first room in the game.

Soul Reaver is an action/adventure/puzzle solving game in where you (Raziel), are harnessing a deep hatred for your former leader and pseudo-father figure, Kain, that runs so deep that an elder god decides to  utilize you as his weapon of destruction against Kain and his forces, as they have left the entire world in shambles from centuries of war and butchery.  So let's get down to it!\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]  Definitely one of the high points of this game (and there are many) is just the overall gameplay.  The controls might be a little loose, but the targeting and the executions are spot on.  And fun.  Like, suprisingly fun.  Nothing quite like taking a spear from a wall and impaling a demon/vampire creature straight through the abdomen, while absorbing it's soul afterwards for sustenance.  If this sounds like fun, definitely get this game because you will be doing this a lot.  Don't misunderstand though.  Incredibly, this game actually focuses more on puzzles rather than direct action.  Even boss fights are generally a small puzzle that needs to be solved, rather than directly assaulting the giant, horrific monstrosities (because let's face it, that immediately doesn't sound like a good idea as soon as you see any of the bosses).\n\nOh, and this game is not exactly easy.  Some of the platforming can be very difficult due to the loose controls, and the world does not exactly hold your hand.  It is very open-ended.  Very few hints are littered throughout the world to guide you on your way, but just enough is given to you if you really pay attention to what is being said.  In an age of games that practically play themselves, this particular type of difficulty in a game is a very welcome feeling.\n\nThe only slightly negative part of this game are the overwhelming amount of block puzzles.  Block puzzles.  Block puzzles.  BLOCK PUZZLES.  At any point in time through the game, it's a good bet that a block puzzle is within at least two rooms of where you are currently located.  They are interesting, but the developers really went all out with these puzzles.  None of them are too overwhelmingly difficult, but when they're in every room, it becomes mundane and repetitive.  \n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]  Fantastic graphics for it's time.  Remember that this game did come out in 1999.  A mere three years after Super Mario 64.  There are a lot of clipping issues obviously for this particular period in time when this game was developed, but overall the game is pretty gorgeous.  Animations are very smooth, enemies are interesting, environments are gloomy and downright spooky, and bosses are horrendously disgusting looking.  Even for today's games, those bosses are the things of nightmares.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]  So the sound in this game is phenomenal, and probably the highlight of the entire game (at least it was for me).  Every movement makes a sound that is very adequate for what it is representing, but the sountrack that kicks in every once and a while is perfect for the theme of the game.  Dark, gothic, and eerie.  Partners perfect with what is happening on the screen at all times.  Especially the opening cutscene music, that also just happens to play near the end during a particularly important part of the game.  Oh, and the voice acting talent is, for lack of a better word, incredible.  Tony Jay is still severely missed.  The script is so well written that several games that are released these days, could learn a lot from sitting down and playing this game.\n\n[h1]Lasting Appeal:[/h1]  So the total game took me about 12 hours to beat, and that's exploring a good amount of the world.  Didn't go for 100%, but pretty close.  Beyond reliving the adventure again, there is not too much reason to revisit this game after beating it.\n\n\nTL;DR - Great gameplay with a few flaws + decent graphics + fantastic audio + incredible story = 8/10\n\n[h1]PC PROBLEMS:[/h1]  I would strongly recommend against using they keyboard and mouse controls (even though it is possible to just use them), and follow the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=436113337]community guide[/url] in the hub that points you to XPadder so that controller use can become enabled.  It is a very short and easy to follow guide that will have you using a controller flawlessly within ten minutes.\n\nAlso, I know other Steam users are claiming that the game would crash on them constantly, but I personally never had this problem.  I only ran into a few glitches in which I decided to restart because the audio would fall behind drastically, but if anything that was just an annoyance and I wasn't forced to restart if I didn't choose to.", "timestamp_created": 1443998909, "timestamp_updated": 1443999382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457456499338150024", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18271398": {"recommendationid": "18271398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083072281", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1618779383}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE this game!

Not to mention the amount of times I had to reinstall this game.\n\nAlthough I'm totally fine with the game only being 30FPS, I tried SRHook to play it at 60. Doing so will make the game skip all the cinematics. I asked on the Game's Discussion page if there was a way to still get the cinematics to play while using SRhook, and was told that there isn't anything that can be done. So, I just decided to remove SRHook when I got to parts that had cinematic cutscenes.\n\nI used a Dualshock 4 and Inputmapper to map the controller buttons to be keyboard inputs since just using an xinput controller won't make it work properly.\n\nIt's really a shame that this game suffers from these problems as it's still pretty solid during the times when it actually worked. It felt like it did when I first played it on the Playstation, I never finished it then, which is why I got it here on Steam. Besides the problems stated above, I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs or glitches. Just make sure that when using SRHook, cap the framerate at 60 as it'll mess the game up a bit when played higher than that, specifically with some puzzles that need the constrict ability. But that's not the game's fault. The gameplay still holds up, each boss isn't just a straight up fight, and are themselves puzzles (except for two).

Unspeakable pain... relentless agony... time ceased to exist... only this torture... and a deepening hatred of the hypocrisy that damned me to this hell. An eternity passed, and my torment receded, bringing me back from the precipice of madness.  The descent had destroyed me... and yet I lived.\" ~Raziel\n\nThis game, to me, was the start of the Legacy of Kain series. Although, technically, that was actually Blood Omen. As a matter of fact, the first Blood Omen unknowingly set the stage and essentially serves as the backdrop for all of the Legacy of Kain games. In Soul Reaver however, you do not actually play as Kain. Instead, you play as one of his vampiric lieutenants, Raziel. But almost immediately, things immediately go bad as when Raziel approaches Kain and shows that he has evolved by gaining a set of wings (the first evolution of all of Kain's vampiric brood), Kain considers this a transgression against him. In an act of rage, he rips your wings from you, and then has you thrown into the Lake of the Dead. Burning, trapped in the abyss, Raziel reaches the bottom but he is lifeless, his body practically destroyed.\n\nBut centuries pass, and Raziel awakes, somehow still alive, but a twisted shell of who he once was. Then, as he looks around at his surroundings in the Abyss, an onimous voice booms: \"Raziel, you are worthy.\" This being, only ever referred to as \"the Elder God\" in the Legacy of Kain games, claims that it is he who is responsible for your rebirth, or rather... your undeath. He calls you his Soul Reaver, and gives you the mission of hunting Kain down, for it is him that is responsible for the decay and ruin of the world, Nosgoth. But to reach Kain, Raziel will have to also hunt down and kill his vampiric brothers, long since corrupted while Raziel was away from the mortal world. Raziel himself had only just gained a set of wings before his execution, but his brothers... they had became monstrous to say the least.\n\nThis game, like all of the other games up until Nosgoth, are action adventure games. As this is a PC port of a game that is  sixteen or so years old, it's important to have reasonable expectations. For instance, some textures may flicker or not appear properly like they were meant to every once in a while. Controller support for this game is unfortunately borked, for when I tried to use my 360 controller, it appeared to work at first, but then Raziel would not stop moving at all. I at first recoiled in disgust and anger, using keyboard controls, but eventually became used to it and also remembered how much I still loved this game so it didn't matter to me after a while. Controller support does in fact apparently work for the other Legacy of Kain games, although, I can only confirm this for Soul Reaver 2 as that is the only other one I've started to play after finishing the first Soul Reaver. Personally, Soul Reaver 1 crashed for me about five or so times. But as you can save at any time while playing the game, I shrugged it off and considered it only a mild annoyance.\n\nYet, keyboard controls aside, I found combat as fun as it always had been in this game. As most of the enemies you face are vampiric in nature, simply knocking it down and shouting mean words isn't enough. Either pick up a weapon, impale, and then devour their soul, or beat them down a bit, grab them, and toss them either into water, a spike, or onto a fire. Combat becomes a simpler matter once you obtain the Wraith Blade, however, if you get hit and are no longer at full health, you lose it, forcing you to go back to the earlier methods. Another thing I always loved about this game is the bosses aren't \"hit it until it's dead\". A spider boss? Grab its eggs, set them on fire, and toss them back at them. A boss that is immune to water but not sunlight? Break some windows to let a little sunshine in and watch as it screams in agony. A certain boss near the end of the game that is invulnerable otherwise, you literally lure into a gigantic incinerator and burn him alive. There are only two specific boss fights that are... well, disappointing, and honestly, frustrating.\n\nAs you adventure through the wastelands of Nosgoth, as an undead vampire turned Soul Reaver, you have the ability to go between both the spirit world and the material one. As a matter of fact, if you run out of health in the material realm, you are forcibly sent back to the spirit world until you consume enough souls to regain your strength. Unfortunately, this does somewhat make there be little stakes in the game... as you can only receive an actual game over if you run out of HP in the spirit world. It makes bosses an easy matter as well. Get sent to the spirit realm, eat souls, find a portal, and try again until you win. Still, I always (and still do) thought that going in and out of the spirit world to bypass obstacles and solve puzzles was such a cool thing to do. I just love the visual effects it has on the world. It's not literally just the absolute same area but with a blue tint, no, these columns become shorter in the spirit world, allowing you to climb up them and then using a portal, you're back in the material world in an area that would have otherwise been inaccessible.\n\nEventually, when playing this game, it becomes second nature, but I'll just say it beforehand: \"If you are in a spot and are seemingly stuck and it absolutely seems like a dead end, transfer over to the spirit realm.\"\n\nPerhaps for me, the only truly infuriating aspect of the gameplay of the game is... well, block puzzles. I can't blame the game for having puzzles, no, but good god, if you actually explore the side areas, there are just so many block puzzles. There are other puzzles that are not block related but every time I ran into another one that did involve blocks I just... I hate block puzzles so much.\n\nBut in the end, I recommend this game (and series, as I wouldn't consider this a spoiler whatsoever, but Soul Reaver 1 ends by directly leading into Soul Reaver 2, so I don't know why you'd buy and play Soul Reaver 1 and then not buy and play Soul Reaver 2) not for its gameplay but... well, for everything else. The story, the music, the voice acting, the atmosphere. As long as you are able to appreciate an old game (and be willing to use keyboard controls) and move past the issues of... well, less than perfect PC ports, you'll probably enjoy this game/series.\n\nSo yes, even though I somewhat feared that the nostalgia I felt for this game was greater than the game itself, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not perfect of course, but it's very much worth playing.\n\nOne last thing to note, though. A couple of days ago, one of my friends actually recommended Nosgoth to me. I said I had it in my Steam library, and had been meaning to try it out because I loved the original Legacy of Kain series.

The game has a steady drip of interesting lore and a plot that leaves you wondering what the next part is. The puzzles often have you stumped until you remember that you can change the world by changing planes, which adds a layer of depth to them. The combat feels pretty decent but simple and can take a bit to become good as different enemies actually have slightly different approaches. The boss fights though are almost all amazing in that they are not blunt fighting but more puzzles. When you die you simply shift to the spectral plane, giving you a chance to come up with a new plan. The platforming, much like the typical combat, is simple.

Some were introduced to the series with Blood Omen, others began with Soul Reaver. While the core gameplay was different both of them shared rich story and nice voice acting. Soul Reaver is the second game in the franchise and is a direct sequel of Blood Omen.\n\nThe gameplay consists of exploration, battles with vampires, boss battles, platforming and puzzle solving. While I do like the franchise I also do not have bias due to nostalgia and do not like to see the game through pink glasses. Exploration is fairly nice, game offers interesting locations and architecture and there's a lot of backtracking and hidden secrets. Battles (at least at first) are interesting, but quickly start to get redundant and boring. While the game introduces a couple of new enemies the core battle mechanics stay the same, as you advance more through the game you get more power and enemies aren't a real threat, just an annoyance to stall you a bit. Boss battles are good, but short. They're not the \"win by brute force\" type of battles as you need to find a weak point / solution to defeat the boss. Platforming is fairly frustrating as the camera and controls are far from perfect. Nothing is impossible and can be mastered after trial and error, but jumping onto series of tiny ledges can be painful, especially if you fall down and are forced to redo the entire segment. Puzzle solving is fairly Tomb Raiderish, but also gets too repetitive: \"Block puzzle A is introduced, now do it a couple of more times. Block puzzle B is introduced, now do it a couple of more times again.\". The best part of the game (aside from story and voice acting) is the soundtrack. It's great and memorable, a lot of people know Soul Reaver's \"Ozar Midrashim\".\n\nThe PC port has flaws. It runs on newer systems, it's possible to run at 1080p and 60fps. However, it suffers from audio issues. The music has crackling noises, dialogue skips. The only solution is to play it in software, texture unfiltered mode. Another flaw is that the hardware mode goes up to 1080p, while software mode goes up to 2160p. Makes sense, right? When compared to PS version the soundtrack is pre-recorded. It has less tracks and doesn't really change according to what's happening around you.\n\nShould you get this version of the game? That's up to you. If you can oversee no texture filtering then go for it. If you prefer better overall experience, but lower framerates then go for the PS version. Dreamcast is supposed to be the best version.", "timestamp_created": 1420730314, "timestamp_updated": 1420730314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560983598232269287", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13860316": {"recommendationid": "13860316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001115310", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1532753966}, "language": "english", "review": "(Ignore my time on record as I've spent most of my playtime offline)\n\nEasily one of my most favorite games of all time! I remember playing this on the original Playstation like it was only yesterday. In my mind this game set the bar very high for what video games were capable of. Wonderfully written script and rich dialogue, Extremely clever puzzles that make you consider all possibilities. A unique and large open world game that managed to pull off one of the first concepts of streaming data directly from the disk, cutting out loading screens from area to area. Crystal Dynamics had outdone themselves when making this game, and it's a shame that we don't get games like this more often.\n\nBy today's standards this game would be considered a little rough around the edges (remember, this is 1999 we're talking about), but if you can look past its dated graphics and very rare glitches you will find a well crafted story with unique characters, all of whom are well rounded and are even pursuing their own goals.\n\nFollowing the noble vampire Raziel, now turned undead wraith, on his journey to seek revenge for the betrayal of his creator Kain, you will find that the world they inhabit is dark and desolate, but not without reason. As their destinies unravel, you soon realize that there is more at stake than just Raziel's personal vengeance. \n\nThe Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is heavy on storytelling and puzzle solving, but the combat isn't the best (in fact the combat is terrible). Many of the puzzles are far from obvious. Some are on such a large scale that you may have to visit several areas just to solve one and move on, but they are definitely rewarding as the further you go the more you learn of kain's actions, Raziel's resolve, and this dark, slowly dying world and how it came to be the way it is.\n\nI have tried this on several computers and can easily say it runs quite well on modern machines. It runs on essentially any resolution, although I'd recommend playing at 4:3 resolution as that is what this game was made for. Widescreen works, but the game stretches. If it doesn't run well on yours then there may be a complication or something affecting its performance. \n\nThere is a problem with the audio, however. Sometimes the audio suffers from problems and you may miss some dialogue and key ambiant effects without realizing it, but it's easy to figure out as you can identify it when the sound starts to get choppy or, say, when you jump and the grunting noises you normally hear are missing. It's an easy fix, simply quit and restart. Now I know some people might find this a daunting task, and all I can do is assure you that this game is well worth the time and patience.\n\nWhen I saw this game on steam, I was a little apprehensive to play it at first, as I was afraid my nostalgia would cloud the fact that this may be a terrible game after all. But once I ran it, I fell in love with it all over again. It can stand on it's own merits, and comes from a time where people were more worried about clever storytelling and breaking new ground than trying to introduce exclusive features and new DLC packs to increase product longevity. It's a masterpiece from another era, and shows that video games can be more than the generic \"Action Adventure\" label that is used to describe them.\n\nI [b]wholeheartedly[/b] recommend this game and any other in the Legacy of Kain series.", "timestamp_created": 1420526571, "timestamp_updated": 1420526571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709321260452270508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13846229": {"recommendationid": "13846229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040089526", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1383, "last_played": 1420822332}, "language": "english", "review": "If you think that all joypad games are casual - you're wrong.

The characters in this game are pretty likable in telling the story of the game, the character you play, Raziel, often tells you, time to time, his views of the current world he is in, in a pretty elaborate and amusing way during his journey. I have to say the character development regarding him is well done once you are done with the game. This game's story takes you far into the future, centuries after Blood Omen. There are few references from Blood Omen that are mentioned in the game, I'd say it's not that important to play Blood Omen, but it's clearly recommended for future references in the other games.\n\nThe gameplay seems fresh for a PSOne/PC(1999) title, 3D Platforming is a notable element of the game, jumping around the place feels very organic in a way that it paved way for future 3D action/adventure to takes notes on basic things such as climbing using the ledge to reach another platform. Gliding feels pretty organic too because of the big and high places you will venture to, it proved useful in Raziel's journey. \n\nThis game also has puzzles for you to uncover while most of them are cube puzzle where you have position the cube like objects to its correct positions, although it feels pretty ridiculous as God of War's Kratos doing the same thing(and Thank golly, it was this game that started this element of gameplay), it felt pretty fun and I had the feeling I have to finish it right away, but I can't help that I'm thinking that Raziel would be better off as a \"Plumber\" of sorts, he certainly has a great talent for it, *snicker*.\n\nThe fighting system feels that it contributed a lot to upcoming games such as Devil May Cry, Dark Souls and other action/adventure games that have a feature for you to lock on the enemy in close combat while holding a button. While holding the \"autoface\" button, you automatically focus on your current adversary and anticipate his move. While in this state you anticipate his upcoming attack and dodge with the proper directional button and the jump button. This would lead the enemy to be in the open, off-guarded. It's a simple mechanic that does its job well in the starting stages but as you progress, you uncover more skills you can abuse to your enemies such as things from side quests.\n\nSide Quests in the game does make the game a little easier but it is no easy task to uncover them blindly though. The side quests contain powerups that would increase your health, your magic and your arsenal such as glyph spells. The game would be little more of a challenge if you play without the powerups, but just a little because of one little thing.\n\nThis game setting has you going into different realms time to time in real time. I'd say it's an impressive feature back in the day, because the 3d setting changes/transforms IN REAL TIME as you change from one realm to another and it is needed for you to do in order to progress more into the story.\n\nThe enemy designs are pretty grotesque and scary, it is what repelled me from playing it as a kid. I think third boss and its minions takes the cake that will keep preventing me from getting a sleep for a day, two or three if I was dealing with this game back then. Dealing with the bosses require you to analyze the environment and take it as an advantage to defeat you adversary, it will take time figuring it out but you will accomplish it nonetheless. \n\nThe sounds are fit the setting but the ambience of the setting puts me on edge especially when the game decide to bugs regarding the sound such as sound loops and what not, you know I just have to reset and load the game from where I was. Voice acting is top notch, it is dramatic but it does its job pretty well for a video game of its age.\n\nThis game has certain bugs/glitches such as game crashing suddenly during lengthy play times in a sitting, enemies going T-Stance on you all of the sudden, sound loops that are pretty scary and nerve wrecking. They are pretty minor and not necessarily would break the game render unplayable.  Just save consistently, you can save anywhere. I MEAN IT.\n\nI played this game using a twin PSone/PS2 controlller usb converter and the game responds well to my controller. I don't know about 360 wired controllers though. \n\nPlaying this game in this day and age is pretty refreshing from the modern games we have now and I have to say this game did age well in its own.

So, when I found the collection was available on PC for $5, I quickly scooped it up because Gaben.\n\nTLDR: Moar Puzzle, Less Fight. Like? Buy. Not like? PASS\n\nOverview: This game takes place in a land called Nosgoth. You play a death angel who turns into a zombie-vampire hybrid who can't die now. Your job is to get revenge on Kain, for leaving you in this ghoulish state, and then ruining Nosgoth while you were in the underworld. The game truly is an Eidos title in more ways than one.\n\nPacing:\n\nThe game's pacing is nonexistant. It managed to feel the same during all 10 hours I played. Maybe it picks up later on, I don't know tbph. Once could call it postapocalyptic.\n\nGameplay-Combat:\n\nThe combat just seems to lack flow. Many many areas are full of enemies that respawn so constantly that it's almost not worth it to fight them every time, and just run+jump past them. Or use Spirit Realm if you can get away with it. The first boss of the game is a puzzle boss. Bleh. Without spoiling anything, I had to use a walkthrough in the same manner I used a walkthrough with HeXeN.\n\nGameplay-Puzzles: BLOCK PUZZLES, SON. Also, stuff that isn't obvious. Painful and requires a walkthrough beyond the first twenty minutes or so.\n\nStory: The story is an odd thing, one that doesn't irk me or compel me. Perhaps it's because the first game in the series isn't available for PCs. The game manages to advance the story without drowning you in exposition too much, although there are a few too many cutscenes for my liking.\n\nControls: Standard clunky PS1-ported-to-PC controls. Can't even use a mouse. A shame, because i'd love to LOOK UP.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I can't wholeheartedly reccommend or deny LoK:Soul Reaver, in spite of me being forced to put a NO. It depends. Do you like Tomb Raider and other similar games? Liked HeXeN? Dive right into this gem. Want a more actiony thing to play? AVOID.

Feels good, no immersion-breaking \"you died, try again\" scheme. However, the game is still far from perfect in my opinion.\n\nThe camera and controls are just messed up. Seriously, it feels like they weren't tested enough. For example, seeing Raziel's butt zoomed in when you need to judge distance is nothing but good gameplay design. The level design often doesn't conform the camera movement, which, combined with camera-dependent movement direction, makes it very easy to fall off narrower platforms.\n\nI understand that many of those issues were common in that gaming era, especially the camera work, which apparently was a plague of TPP games back then. On the other hand, it's weird that noone complained about that during testing stage.

It has been a fundamental pillar in my gaming life, it was one of the first PC games I played and I love it. Just look at my avatar - it's Raziel. First time playing it was way back in 2002 but I have fond memories of how awesome this game was. Yes, I can see the flaws it has today, it did not age that well ... but please hear me out. Soul Reaver is a game that was revolutionary in it's time. It combines combat and puzzles in the big post-apocalyptic world of Nosgoth. Both are difficult so if you like more casual games I guess this one is not for you. The game does not take your hand, you have to try stuff out for yourself. And die a lot in the process. But not really die since this game created a great mechanic of shifting between physical and spectral realm. So if you die in the physical world you shift to the spectral one. If you die in the spectral world you reset at the Elder God. You can however shift when you want and this gives the game it's dynamic feeling. Boss fights feel very satisfying when you finish them. You also get a power from each boss you beat, adding extra layer of gameplay each time. All of this was fun, but the story and narrative is why I LOVE this game! The story telling is what this game nailed - from the writing to the voice acting. Plus it has a really cool soundtrack as well. Some downsides are here as well, the game is old so graphics and compatibility are not that great, though it worked fine on my Win7 laptop. The open ending can also be annoying for some people, although it is not that bad (and continues well in SR2). And I could write all day about this game but I will stop right here because you already know if you want it or not from what you have read. I will end this review and give one of the most true and heartfelt recommendations I ever gave on Steam!\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1414693847, "timestamp_updated": 1669801302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718138039112091064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12687170": {"recommendationid": "12687170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024443949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1383263452}, "language": "english", "review": "An epic adventure filled with a magnificent sound art, 3D models, history and a breathtaking voice acting!

At first, the sound would just keep looping forever, getting worse whenever I paused the game.\n   Aside from that, the soundtrack was great.\n   The dialogue was also great, given that most of the games of its time had little dialogue.

It's controller support is total ass. \n\nThe in-game character likes to run up to the right when you idle, and he never runs straight. You can't just use the d-pad like the original game either.

It combines puzzles with a pretty nice fighting system and one hell of a cool story to top it all off. If any of you have played the original release on PS1 you already know this game hasn't been named one of the best games on PS1 without a reason.\n\nHowever this port is quite unsatisfactionary to say the least. It plays just like on PS1, it looks good and I had no problem with setting up my controler to work with it (be sure to not only change the configuration of the controler in game but also to select it to be the prefered method of playing from the pause menu in order to make it work) but there is one huge problem. It crashes randomly. I have tried multiple different resolution settings but either way it crashes every now and then.\n\nI have managed to get only about 4 crashes throughout the whole game but at the very end of the game, there are a lot of cutscenes and I had to replay all of them at least 5 times to get past them. It would always crash. Finally, I decided to check for integrity of the game cache (which is an option that can be found when you right click the game in your library and then go to properities) and it found 2 corrupted files. Guees what? One of them was my save file and it got deleted. Right before the last boss fight. All in all, I have managed to find a save file at this exact point on the internet and I have finished the game but I am still quite dissapointed that Crystal Dynamics have done nothing about this problem.\n\nTo sum it all up - If you like adventure games with good combat system, original story, puzzles and a big world to explore (with a lot of secrets to find, optionally) then this game is definitely for you. Even after over a decade this game still feels right and puts a lot of newer titles to shame. If you don't want to deal with multiple crashes though, you're probably better off buying the original PS1 version and playing it on some sort of emulator.\n\nOh and if you're wondering about gameplay time, it takes about 16-17 hours to complete if you decide to find most of the glyphs and some of the health upgrades but it should take even up to 30 hours (or more?) if you decide to find every upgrade and all of the glyphs. It might also vary a lot depending on how well you solve puzzles. It sometimes takes long time to figure out what to do.

This game is quite dated, having originally been released in 1999. Despite its age, and the poor graphics by today's standards that comes with such age, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and truly the entire Legacy of Kain series in general, still remains my very favorite video game of all time. The game's story is marvelously  well written, leaving you wanting to know at all times what happens next, what's around that corner, and what kind of environments you will discover. This game hits it out of the park with not only its well-written story, but its phenomenal audio work too. The soundtrack is absolutely superb, and one of the best video game soundtracks out there. The voice acting is amazing, featuring some big name voice actors, including Tony Jay - famous for Judge Claude Frollo in Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame - Simon Templeman, my personal favorite voice actor - famous for many roles, including Gabriel Roman in the Uncharted Series - and many more. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was developed by Crystal Dynamics (famous for the Gex series and Tomb Raider series) and published by Eidos Interactive. The lead director for the game was Amy Hennig, who later went on to co-direct the Uncharted Series. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is filled to the absolute brim with secrets and hidden rewards, and I highly encourage those of you who purchase this masterpiece of a game to explore them all.\n\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and the entire series in general, is a true masterpiece of gaming. Its graphics may be rather dated by today's standards, but they're rather good for the standards of when it was released in 1999. The true art of this game is not in the graphics, but rather the storyline itself as you follow the fallen Vampire lieutenant Raziel avenge himself and uncover the dark truths of the hypocracy he sought to destroy. With twists and turns around nearly every corner of this exquisite work, you will be highly entertained and likely will want the other games to complete the story. I do warn you however that the storyline can get very complex, but I feel as if that merely adds to some of its charm and beauty.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I cannot recommend this game enough. I grew up with this game as a kid with the original PSOne version. I now own the PSOne disc for this game, the PS3 download of the PSOne classic from the PlayStation Store, and the PC version from Steam. Even as I own three copies of the game, I cannot help but feel as if the game deserves to cost more. At a marvelous price for the quality you get, this game and its entire series are both a must-buy and must-play, and Legacy of Kain remains to this day a true example of what video games should be: An interactive story, and an art form, not just a mindless shoot-em-up. If you've still read to this far in my review, please, do yourself a favor and get this game. If you are not pleased, I will be extremely surprised.", "timestamp_created": 1392737731, "timestamp_updated": 1392737731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9132373": {"recommendationid": "9132373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098561538", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1615343684}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't let that low playtime deceive you; I've spent more time in Soul Reaver on the console than I'd care to mention.\n\nThis game has an absolutely riveting, Gothic story narrated by some of the BEST voice actors to ever grace the field (RIP Tony Jay), solid gameplay, decent block puzzles, and more secret content than you can shake a stick at.\n\nSpeaking of the secret content... Dear GOD is there a lot of it! It is possible to complete the game, start to finish, and only experience about 40% of the entire game! There are so many glyphs, eldritch energy pickups, and life coil extension pickups that you can get lost in just collecting the miscellanious crap!\n\nCombat can be hit-or-miss (moreso on the PC than the console because of the movement controls), but overall it feels visceral and satisfying; there is something disturbingly cathartic about beating a vampire about the head and neck area before tossing him bodily onto the nearest pointy bit of architecture.\n\nHowever, I WILL admit that this game has not aged well graphically. At all. The opening movie aside (which shames current-gen consoles TO THIS DAY I might add), everything is hilariously blocky, even by late-90's standards, and it was one of those games where no one had a moving mouth texture....

When Raziel, the \"hero\" of the new game, grew wings before his leader did, Kain saw it as blasphemy, tore them from Raziel's back, and cast him into a giant swirling watery grave. \nAfter his features have been almost completely eaten away by the water, Raziel is saved by a being known as the Elder God, who sets him on a quest to free the world from the parasitic influence of the vampire clans and destroy Kain. \nFor the time of the release of the game the graphics are good.

However, equally noticeable are the inadequacies of the game engine in realizing the ambition the devs had regarding \"the bits in between cutscenes\", or \"gameplay\" as it is otherwise described.\n\nThe first, and perhaps most irritating problem is that this is at heart a console game, and the port is BAD. The controls are, by default, WASD for movement and the arrow keys for actions. That's right - NO MOUSE. I know this is an old game, but it's a real shame that including support for one of the most basic faculties of a PC wasn't considered a priority, it couldn't have been too difficult to implement considering how much better the game would be for intuitive camera controls.  Without them establishing even a basic awareness of your surroundings can take around half a minute of slowly shuffling around and resetting the camera, which makes even simple tasks extremely fiddly and only accentuates further problems.\n\nSecondly, the combat. I can see what the devs were trying to do but it comes out too clunky and situationally a nightmare in the hands of some poorly designed environments. The combat is based off some novel principles - most of the games enemies are undead, and as such require more killing than usual, most encounters will involve incapacitating enemies before destroying their body, with the use of fire, water, sunlight or simply impaling them. This is an interesting mechanic but quickly becomes at best a chore and at worst extremely frustrating. \nThe worst example I can provide is when the player is required to enter a room which contains 3 aggressive enemies but no environmental means of finishing them off, by this time the player has access to a weapon which can incapacitate and finish enemies, while remaining available at all times - but only when the player has full health, as a result, taking even a single hit will remove the player's only means of winning the fight and will require the player to retreat to heal before trying again, this would perhaps be a \"fun challenge\" if the combat possessed any depth, but the lack of any means of blocking or countering enemy attacks makes this an almost impossible task, requiring either luck or to get enemies stuck in the terrain - there is only one attack type (which I might add, is assigned to the same key as USE, have fun bashing doors), this gives the player basically no options regarding combat and allows no means of skill to assist in most encounters. (BTW the example takes place in a room with a multi-level block puzzle. Also the enemies respawn occasionally. FunFunFun.)\n\nLike I said, the story is excellent, but if that's all you're there for then you might as well just watch a silent playthrough on youtube, which I actually do recommend.\nBut as far as playing the game yourself is an option, I'd say don't bother.\n\nTL;DR -- Gameplay sux, v. dated, bad port but great story, voice acting & visual design.", "timestamp_created": 1386261535, "timestamp_updated": 1386261535, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46997109055519104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "7862510": {"recommendationid": "7862510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020419012", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1379584348}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the game on dramcast but avoid this one, it doesn't even support xbox game pads, it's full of bugs of all kings.

I haven't played Blood Omen, and you don't need to in order to enjoy this game. It's a good idea to read up on a bit of the backstory as it will help you understand things to do with the world and the main antagonist, Kain. You play as Raziel, Kains lieutenant, who was sentenced to death by Kain. Thrown into an burning hot abyss Raziel is killed but is brought back in a more demonic form by the Elder God. In return for this 'gift', Raziel must become the Elder Gods 'Soul Reaver', and feed the Elder God by absorbing the souls of his vampire bretherin during his vengeful hunt for Kain.\nThe game is an action adventure puzzle solver, very much in the same field as Tomb Raider, but more demonic (obviously). Of the 3 Soul Reaver games (that's including Defiance) this is definitely the most dark and chilling. There isn't as much story in this one as there is in the other 2 games and the story progression is pretty straight forward. You must find your vampire bretherin to help lead you to Kain in order to get your revenge. Along the way there are a few plot twists that make you think there's more to the current events than meets the eye, and the ending proves this even more so.\nThe gameplay itself doesn't drive the game nearly as much as the story, and you'll probably find that with all the games. Combat is pretty basic, and the majority of the puzzles involve pushing blocks around. Some may find the game becomes stale, but it really all depends how attached you become to Raziels cause. As the story progresses and secrets unfold you'll find yourself driven purely by the need to know what it all means.\nThe voice acting in this game is fantastic, the characters are fantastic, the environments are fantastic and the soundtrack is phenominal. Everything in the game pulls you in and makes you really care about what has happened to the world, and makes you want to know why (i won't go deeper as i don't want to spoil anything).

Tomb Raider 3 just came out and while it was more of the same, it was my first full 3D game I have ever played and it was disorienting at first. However, ever since then, the action adventure genre became my favourite and the sense of exploration and excitement pulled me back again and again. When Soul Reaver came out on PS1 in August 1999, several months past its initial release date, it created a big impact. Eidos also poured a lot of money into advertisements in magazines and even cheesy TV ads. The game, luckily, lived up to its potential. \n\nPlaying as Nosgoth\u00b4s most wanted vampire wraith, Raziel, we got a game which almost seemed impossible to make within the PlayStation constraints. Detailed graphics, seamless loading of areas, shifting between realms, excellent atmosphere and music in a vast, decaying world. These are the reasons that SR1 became a classic which everybody  who played it at release remembers to this date. How can anybody forget the iconic intro where Kain rips off Raziel\u00b4s wings in a dramatic fashion? The dialogue and interesting story pulls you into the world right from the start. Even if the cutscenes are not the shortest, the flowery dialogue is a joy to listen to when delivered with such profoundness and heart. This is accompanied by an amazing atmospheric soundtrack by Kurt Harland whose eerie compositions are great to listen to even 20 years later. He designed a layer system based on variations triggered by certain conditions being fulfilled and it dynamically changes in according to what is happening on screen. As Raziel shifts between the realms, the soundtrack changes as well. Creatures\u00b4 cries become more twisted and warped.\n\nHowever, it is the game\u00b4s core mechanics which make it such a good game. You start off weak, thrown into the realm of the dead and your ever present guide in form of a voice leds you to a portal which brings you back to the living. While indestructible, Raziel will still fall back into the spectral realm if he is damaged too much in the real world. Time stands still in the spectral realm which is useful in certain puzzles. To regain his former strength Raziel needs to consume the souls of his enemies and in epic confrontations, the souls of his former brothers. Those grant distinct powers - phase through gates, climbing, telekinesis and swimming - and thus open vast possibilities on exploration. Entirely new areas open at some point, sometimes leading to a secret spell which you wouldn\u00b4t be able to acquire otherwise. These glyphs are useful but not required to finish the game. Raziel can also collect health upgrades over the course of the game which adds a reason to explore every nook and cranny. Warp gates are great for this as each time the game is turned on, you always start in the bottom of the Abyss but a nearby gate can transport you around whole of Nosgoth.\n\nExploration on its own is not enough and when traversing, Raziel must fight his now newly devolved kin. You only start with your claws but soon find out that using torches and spears is important to finish the vampires off as their wounds heal fast. The culmination of exploring different vampire clan territories is a meet up with one of Raziel\u00b4s brothers, now monstrously deformed. Due to their sheer size conventional weapons are not enough to bring them down and you have to retort to using the environment against them. With each lieutenant\u00b4s soul, Raziel gains stronger and new paths open. One of the upgrades is the legendary Soul Reaver, which attaches itself mysteriously to Raziel as his permanent weapon. It can only be used when Raziel\u00b4s health is full but once manifested, it will sustain Raziel indefinitely and two strikes are enough to send any enemy into a vulnerable state.\n\nUnfortunately, the game slightly suffered in the end as many areas, abilities and events have been cut to make the deadline. Even though it ends on an infamous cliffhanger, it gave us Soul Reaver 2 and Defiance. This amazing series is far from forgotten but it is sad to see this port being subpar in comparison to the later entries. The dynamic soundtrack has been completely removed from this version, replaced with pre-recorded tracks. It actually reacts to Raziel being close to an enemy, in boss battle or just simple indoors or outdoors, something not so common back in the PlayStation days. The game is also locked to 30fps which is possible to unlock with fan tools but this shouldn\u00b4t have been the case. There are other frequent issues such as sound effects endlessly looping which happens a lot more often in the pc version. Dreamcast version which came out in 2001 has 60fps and higher polygon models of all main characters and enemies. It is sad that they didn\u00b4t port this version instead.

Stepping aside from its vampiric roots, Soul Reaver ventures into a demonic area, telling the story of Raziel, one of Kain's \"first-born\" vampire leutenants who was thrown into the Abyss for daring to evolve prior to his own master, only to be awaken centuries later by The Elder God in a spectral realm.\nOn his quest to avenge his death Raziel must solve a lot of environmental puzzles that involve switching between material and spectral realms in real time. Enemy encounters are quite rare, but the fights look stylish thanks to many various ways you can finish your opponents using either weapons or the environment.\nControls are somewhat awkward and require some time to get used to. Being released in 1999, the game looks amazing even today. The world of Nosgoth is huge and seamless, you will never see a single loading screen here. Voice actors do an impressive job reading through beautifully written dialogues, which makes the complete lack of subtitles even more disappointing.\nSoul Reaver is simply one of the best action-adventure games of its time.

He kills you and throws you into an abyss. After that your corpse is resurrected and you have to traverse a dead world you helped destroy inorder to kill your murderer.\n\nThe game is focused on puzzles moreso then combat, due to the fact you actually cannot die. The player instead shifts between the lightless and weightless dimension of the dead to the material realm. This is very important for specific puzzles and sidequests. The game takes place in a semi-open world with no loading screens. \n\nAnother big part of Soul Reaver is just how many sidequests there are. Just running through the game will land the character with no health upgrades and no special glyph powers. Should the player return to prior areas you can find new things that you didn't see previously.\n\nHowever there are some minor flaws.The game ends on a cliffhanger that leads directly into Soul Reaver 2. There is also an entire website devoted to all the content that was cut prior to release.\n\nThe other important aspect of this game is it's port. SR1's PC port is flawed in a few ways. Much of the soundtrack doesn't play at specific moments, and this reduces the quality of the game in a lot of unfortunate ways.
