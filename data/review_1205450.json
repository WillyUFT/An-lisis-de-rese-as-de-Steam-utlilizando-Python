A rebellious turnip with a penchant for tax evasion.\" Well, fear not, because Turnip Boy is here to fill that oddly specific void in your gaming experience!\n\nFrom the moment I booted up Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, I knew I was in for a wild ride. The game's plot is as absurd as it sounds\u2014our hero, Turnip Boy, is slapped with a hefty tax bill, and instead of selling his precious turnip farm to pay off the debt like a responsible vegetable, he decides to embark on a mission to commit tax evasion. Forget Mario saving princesses; Turnip Boy is here to save his hard-earned turnips from the IRS!\n\nThe gameplay is a delightful mix of puzzles, quirky characters, and turnip-based chaos. I never thought I'd see the day when solving tax-related puzzles would be so entertaining. From navigating bureaucratic mazes to outsmarting IRS agents with turnip disguises, every moment is a hilarious adventure. The controls are intuitive, and the graphics are charmingly pixelated, giving the game a nostalgic feel that pairs perfectly with its absurd premise.\n\nOne of the highlights is the diverse cast of characters Turnip Boy encounters on his tax-evading journey. From a chill mushroom landlord who just wants his rent in mushrooms to a caffeine-fueled coffee cup, each character brings a unique flavor to the game. The witty dialogue had me laughing out loud more times than I'd like to admit, and the writing is so on point that even the tax documents have personality.\n\nThe soundtrack deserves a special mention, too. It's a catchy blend of tunes that perfectly complements the game's quirky atmosphere. I found myself humming along as I guided Turnip Boy through his unconventional escapades.\n\nTurnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion is more than just a game; it's a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of bureaucracy and taxation. It's a reminder that sometimes, you just have to laugh in the face of impending financial doom. So, if you're looking for a game that combines clever puzzles, charming characters, and turnip-fueled shenanigans, look no further. Turnip Boy has got your back, and he's ready to make tax evasion the most fun you've ever had!\n", "timestamp_created": 1700729785, "timestamp_updated": 1700729785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151267751": {"recommendationid": "151267751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817707207", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 458, "last_played": 1700727647}, "language": "english", "review": "evaded taxes and defeated god with the irs. great game. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1700727711, "timestamp_updated": 1700727711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151266845": {"recommendationid": "151266845", "author": {"steamid": "76561199309365354", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 96, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1700772353}, "language": "english", "review": "***I love ripping stuff*** Speaks in vegan.", "timestamp_created": 1700727340, "timestamp_updated": 1700727340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151186010": {"recommendationid": "151186010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061507305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 209, "playtime_at_review": 177, "last_played": 1700701110}, "language": "english", "review": "Had no idea what to expect going into it, but it was an amazing time with hilarious writing, great music, and surprisingly intriguing lore!

The problem is, these mechanics are extremely basic and not very fun. Turnip Boy simply isn\u2019t very fun to control, the enemies are all extremely simple, and there\u2019s no particularly interesting fighting mechanics \u2013 you just swipe at things with your sword, and none of the things in question have particularly interesting fighting abilities. The original NES Zelda is a greatly superior game to this in terms of gameplay. And the fetch quests (which make up virtually the whole game) are inane and often require a bunch of backtracking back and forth across areas you\u2019ve already explored.\n\nThe story is jokey and not very interesting; it isn\u2019t designed to make you care about any of the characters, everyone is terrible, and the jokes rarely land. While it tries to go with some Deep Lore as it goes on, it\u2019s nothing particularly interesting or innovative, and doesn\u2019t do anything to rescue the game world or narrative.\n\nThe art in the game is very basic \u2013 it is not terrible, but it is not beautiful, and doesn\u2019t really engage me at all. Games can have simple art (like Chicory: A Colorful Tale) while still looking really good; this game doesn\u2019t accomplish that.\n\nThis game is only about three hours long, but the time I spent playing it was nevertheless far more than it deserved.

That's not exactly the negative statement it sounds like.\n\nIt's a short, charming little adventure to be sure, that manages to start at an idyllic setting, dips down into an intriguing horrific backstory, and then climbs back up to a silly and outrageous climax. A journey accompanied by the many...let's say [i]heartful[/i] characters that inhabit its world.\n\nIt's a rather linear experience, mostly comprised of go to place and do/grab thing objectives--even the puzzles are rather straightforward, and can be easily intuited within the time it takes to, say, walk from the room's entrance to the first part of the puzzle, so if you're looking to be actually challenged, then this game might not be for you, but if you're just looking for a comfy, casual little adventure, then look no further. There's also not an insignificant amount of backtracking, but thankfully the world itself is pretty small, so it's only a considerable amount of backtracking within the game's scope.\n\nAs for why I didn't like it as much as I thought I would...I guess it's just personal taste. See, even though the characters are all these cartoony plant lives, they openly talk about committing crimes and being general vandals and the like. I've never been a fan of those cutesy-aesthetics-meets-dark-and-gritty-subjects schticks. Also memes. Not a fan. There's one character who is a JoJo reference for the sake of having a JoJo reference.

Well, I judged a game by its name, and I have no regrets. \"Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion\" - who could resist that title? But let me tell you, this quirky adventure is so much more than tax dodging vegetables.\n\nFirst off, the game's art style is as sweet as candy, with colorful, cartoonish characters that scream \"wholesome.\" But don't be fooled - this game's humor is as edgy as it gets. It's like an adorable fa\u00e7ade masking a dark internet meme addiction.\n\nNow, humor is subjective, and I have strong feelings about it. American stand-up comedy? Not my cup of tea. So when a game doesn't even label itself as a comedy but has me laughing out loud, that's a surprise.\n\n\"Turnip Boy\" doesn't shove its jokes down your throat. Instead, it's all in the game's DNA. Picture this: Every character is a fruit or veggie with charming, clever designs. Turnip Boy himself has a hilarious wobbly walk that adds to the charm. And the first boss? A giant pig king that turns into bacon when defeated. Need I say more?\n\nBut where \"Turnip Boy\" truly shines is in its writing. It's got that internet vibe, self-aware and witty. A streamer blocking your path until you buy them a sandwich? Yep. A quest to collect rent that ends in, well, murder? You bet. Turnip Boy tearing up every piece of paper handed to him, not just tax documents? Classic.\n\nThe game pokes fun at pop culture tropes and references various memes, but you don't need a PhD in internet culture to enjoy it. The puzzles are straightforward, and the story keeps you engaged. Plus, the game's length is just right \u2013 enough to satisfy your gaming craving without dragging on.\n\nNow, let's talk about the dungeons. They're like mini-Zelda adventures with clever puzzles. You gather tools, like a watering can and boots, to solve challenges. It's satisfying to figure out how to use these tools together to progress.\n\nBut, and there's a but, boss fights can be a real pain. The combat system feels clumsy, especially during these battles. It's like trying to dance but tripping over your own feet. The dodge move is funny, but it's too slow to be useful. It's as if they sacrificed practicality for the joke.\n\nDespite the hiccups, \"Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion\" is a must-play. It's a weird and hilarious adventure with a killer soundtrack. A very fun game that'll definitely leave you feeling warm once you beat it.", "timestamp_created": 1695518960, "timestamp_updated": 1695518960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695271611213684082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146818727": {"recommendationid": "146818727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080809642", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 153, "last_played": 1695423737}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]\"Now I am become turnip, the evader of taxes\"[/i]\nOpen Homer or smt like that", "timestamp_created": 1695426667, "timestamp_updated": 1695426667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146818228": {"recommendationid": "146818228", "author": {"steamid": "76561199248374342", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1696107083}, "language": "english", "review": "i love tax evasion", "timestamp_created": 1695426084, "timestamp_updated": 1695426084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146798940": {"recommendationid": "146798940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198811200597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1695434743}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a relatively short experience but one that I ADORED!!!

Turnip Boy commits tax evasion and then needs to figure out how to get his greenhouse back due to Mayor Onion taking it as collateral. In order to do this, Mayor Onion tasks Turnip Boy to do a variety of tasks for him. It is one of those games where one quest leads to another quest, and the entire story centers around the various story points you see while completing these quests. It certainly isn't a bad way to tell a story, and this game puts a bunch of personality into each scenario you find yourself in. The overarching story, once you complete all the tasks, is also pretty ridiculous, funny, and downright enjoyable. \n\nThe gameplay is quite standard. It certainly isn't as good as the story, but it acts as a nice vessel for the story's delivery. I don't know if there is a specific category to describe the gameplay, but if you played or seen any of the older Zelda games, then you know what the gameplay is like. However, the stakes are very low in this game, as you will likely never die while playing a majority of the game. Even with the boss fights, there is likely only one or two that will give you much difficulty. However, past the main game, there is a \"roguelike\" section where you travel through train carts battling enemies. That piece of content can get a bit difficult after a while, but it's entirely optional. \n\nThe graphics are very good. They are simple, stylistic, and fairly unique to the game. The sprite work is well done, and I also find it to be quite recognizable outside of the game. If I'm being honest, it's one of the reasons I even had an interest in the game, apart from the title and concept of the game alone. \n\nThe music and sound design, in my opinion, is one of the weakest parts of the game.

Sadly, the gameplay that follows doesn't consist of shootouts with the IRS, but it's still pretty good. \n\nThe gameplay can broadly be split into two halves - combat rooms, and puzzles. The former are dungeon-crawler-esque and see you taking on various herbivorous creatures, typically culminating in a boss fight (which are pretty good). The latter are like if the strength puzzles from Pok\u00e9mon weren't designed so that babies can complete them. Not mega challenging, but also pretty good.\n\nAll of this takes place in a top-down overworld where you perform fetch quests for various NPCs to earn rewards and progress the story. The dialogue is genuinely funny, so these interactions are fun, and as a result these quests never feel too much like a chore.\n\nThe pixelart style works well, and all the sprites are great. The soundtrack goes far harder than it has any right to (except for the credits song, which I didn't like at all), and the secret final boss fight is hilarious. There's also a roguelike mode, for some reason. I didn't go super deep with it as I didn't feel the combat system warranted it, and the enemy scaling seems to work in such a way where you eventually just get OHKOed, but it's there.\n\nOverall, while it wasn't a masterpiece that blew me away, I don't have any major gripes with it.

I think it's a cute game as a concept, and I did like the storyline of Matt & Liz which gave the supposedly silly & lighthearted game a more dark undertone. But overall, I wasn't really satisfied with it because:\n\n1) The game is too short. It takes too little time to complete the story, and once you do, there's not much else to do other than challenge the limitless train. And even that gets boring because it's the same 4 bosses over and over again, just powered up each time.\n\n2) The mechanics, especially for combat. You have a \"trip\" button which is basically your way to dash/dodge attacks, but it is so annoying because the range is short, and you can't stack dodges as you have to wait for Turnip Boy to get up after he has tripped. You run into the same problem when you're walking around and want to dash (because the walking speed is pretty slow and there are no sprint options) but you have to wait after each trip. The attack is also just one hit with your weapon (sword/shovel), so it does not require you to learn and get better at it as there are no combos to master or strategies you can apply to your attack. Controlling where exactly to place the petalportal is difficult, and switching between equippable items is inconvenient. \n\n3) Gameplay. It's basically a lot of NPCs needing you to fetch them something, and they basically spell out what it is they need and how you will get it, so there's not even any puzzle solving or thinking that you have to do. I think the only quest I can even consider a puzzle was the graveyard one. I realize the spelling out is meant to be humorous (such as when it's like \"You're doomed, not even talking to Old Man Lemon will help you now!\"), but the jokes often fell flat for me. Also, the walking back and forth between the same regions gets repetitive, and it's especially tedious because there is no map in the game.\n\n4) The Tone. I'm sorry, but I really did not care for the \"I can has cheeseburger\" type of dated humor the dialogues and the interactions had. The characters are super flat and lack personality. I realize they're meant to be caricatures rather than real characters (such as the vain influencer) and that's the joke, but again, the caricatures are nothing I haven't seen before, they're unoriginal and not that funny. It's also a bit difficult to get through the story when I am not just not rooting for Turnip Boy, our main character, but I'm actively annoyed by his destructive actions or apathy. He did not come across as fun and chaotic as the game probably intended for him to, but just irritating and tiresome.\n\nMaybe I'm critiquing too harshly what is meant to be a quick, lighthearted, and fun game - but for the price it is originally being sold for, I expect there to be more engaging content.", "timestamp_created": 1689655789, "timestamp_updated": 1689655789, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551558494567871094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142294619": {"recommendationid": "142294619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859442841", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1689631794}, "language": "english", "review": "I learned to chop onions when I decided to start working in the kitchen.

Previously mentioned bad brain gives me a hard time with reaction times, so some of the boss fights were a bit too hard for me (especially the final boss) so the fact that I could make the game easier as needed was a lifesaver to be honest.

Not a huge or detailed one, but there is one. You're obviously playing as Turnip Boy, a turnip living in a glass house who can only speak in punctuation marks in intervals of three but paying his property tax. Mayor Onion shows and makes Turnip Boy his assistant to go get increasingly questionable items for him so he'd look the other way about his taxes not being paid.\n\nOh and there's a macaroni who just recites a slightly friendlier version of the navy seal copypasta. The humor is mostly on-point! There are some references to stuff, though not as many as in Henry Stickmin; I don't think that will be topped anytime soon.\n\nSince I'm trying to keep this review spoiler-free I'm gonna leave finding out how you get from collecting fertilizer for Mayor Onion to finding a nuke in a mafia stronghold to you.\n\n[h1] Gameplay[/h1]\nYou're gonna meet lots of characters, like half of whom will give you side quests. It's not at all required to complete any of them, but if you do, you more often than not at least get a funny line or two you otherwise wouldn't have seen.\n\nYou will have some weak enemies to fight every now and then, but be aware that they all respawn if you leave the area and come back. They can only ever drop a heart, so if you're not short on HP, it's not worth to kill them, just trip out of their way. Oh yeah, there's no sprint, but you can trip some distance in the direction you're facing.\n\nThere are some puzzles, most of which are quite easy. You use a water can to complete them, later unlocking more items to use in puzzles.\n\nThis is the basic gameplay loop: receive quest, get item it wants, go back, repeat. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but I'll talk more about it in the Achievements section. You don't really play Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion for the gameplay; you play it for the jokes and achievements. Speaking of achievements:\n\n[h1] Achievement Scope[/h1]\nYou can 100% the game under 4 hours. It has that going for it, however, it requires SO MUCH backtracking and grinding. The map isn't that big, but it gets much bigger because of the constant backtracking. Of course you have to complete every side quest, and after the game ends, you gotta grind about 50 tickets in the endless bossfight train. That gets quite tedious, but it certainly could have been much worse.\n\nAchievements I think are notable are\n- Taxation without Representation - you have to beat the final boss again\n- Fashionista - collect all hats, which means grinding and beating all side quests\n- ??? - the rarest achievement, you gotta reach a certain point in the endless mode\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nAll in all Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion is a short, humor-filled, laid-back experience. There are of course some cons to that, which you see now on the screen, but it is overall an enjoyable game.\n\nIs it worth it?; you might be asking. Is it worth \u20ac12,49 in my opinion? No, I don't think it's worth that much. If it was longer, I'd say it's worth it, but at this length, I'll have to say no. However, on sale it is absolutely worth the money!\n\nWhat about the score?; you also might be wondering. Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion get a solid 72/100.\n\nTurnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion is a very solid and funny experience, and if it's on sale, I absolutely do recommend you pick it up!", "timestamp_created": 1688412189, "timestamp_updated": 1688412189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141233794": {"recommendationid": "141233794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817616016", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 158, "last_played": 1688411063}, "language": "english", "review": "mid", "timestamp_created": 1688408986, "timestamp_updated": 1697770694, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141231732": {"recommendationid": "141231732", "author": {"steamid": "76561199084919146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1688221892}, "language": "english", "review": "when i grow up im going to commit tax evasion like turnip boy!!", "timestamp_created": 1688407155, "timestamp_updated": 1688407155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141231205": {"recommendationid": "141231205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338867944", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1688406414}, "language": "english", "review": "I got it through the summer sale for $5 for a couple hours of content (I 100% it).

The puzzles are also pretty intuitive and don't really outstay their welcome. The subtle world-building is immaculate, it's rare to see a game nail the background stuff this well.\n\nOn the minus side, first and foremost is the price. Is this a cute game? Yeah. Is it 5$ an hour cute? Absolutely not. I got this through a Humble Bundle, but if I had actually paid 15$ for a game that took 2.8 hours for me to get every achievement I would have been pretty annoyed. I think $7.50 would be a solid price if you love games like this and $5 if you don't.\n\nPrice aside, if you want to experience everything there's a LOT of backtracking through areas that don't change at all. I think about 1/3 of my time was spent walking through areas I had already been through and it made me really, REALLY wish for a fast travel system, but given the length of the game that might have been done to prevent refunds.\n\nAside from those hiccups, the game has so much love put into it.

I get that the point of the game was for it to be a stupid game, so I don't feel like I missed the point of the game, but god it was a stupid game and I felt it was a waste of my time. Most of the dialogue was references to memes, one was actually funny (not that it made me laugh, but made me slightly exhale), some had a mediocre execution, and most were just badly executed. Some of the areas you had to go back and forth through and it took a while to get through, which I didn't mind while I was fighting enemies...but when travelling back after, it felt needlessly long and winding. The point of the game was to rip things up, which is fine, I guess it's kinda funny, but it made your character have no personality at all, expect a stupid blob that runs around ripping up things it finds. I felt like this could've been executed so that it was a fun treasure hunt...but it was far from well executed. None of the characters had any personality, nothing about the game was memorable, and I only completed it because I was able to do it in two sittings. I could've finished it in one sitting if I found it interesting enough to play for more than an hour and a half at a time.\n\nI only bought this game because it was in a bundle with another game I wanted, getting the bundle made me pay less than $2 more than if I got the other game by itself....I still think it was a waste of my money, It astonishes me that this game is well reviewed, especially at the price its at. \n\nI feel bad giving this a bad review, but as it seemed so low effort, I can't imagine the creators would take it to heart.", "timestamp_created": 1686181652,

Developed by Snoozy Kazoo and released in 2021, this charming, top-down adventure game will hit the spot if you are craving a bit of classic action. You're Turnip Boy, a character who's been caught red-handed for tax evasion and must now make amends by running errands for his town's mayor.\n\nTurnip Boy follows the puzzle-adventure style of classic Zelda titles like A Link's Awakening or A Link to the Past. The gameplay places equal weights into both combat and engaging puzzles. The puzzles, while not overly difficult, are cleverly designed and require some out-of-the-box thinking. By the end, you'll find that every item you've collected has its purpose.\n\nI clocked in at around 2 hours and 75% completion -- which is not bad, but the game definitely feels like it could be longer and left me wanting more. TBCTE does increase its replay value by introducing an NPC who gives you hints about the achievements you're missing after you finish your first run. If you are looking to 100% the game without the use of a guide with all the answers laid out, this will help you with the challenge without major spoilers -- a feature I wish more games had.\n\nLooking forward, I'm excited for the announced sequel, Turnip Boy Robs a Bank. If it's anything like this one, we're in for a treat! I give Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion an 8 out of 10. While the relatively short playtime and less challenging puzzles hold it back from a perfect score, the game's charm, creativity, and nostalgic appeal make it a must-play.

From it's cute artstyle, fun gameplay, and humor that it throws at you, this game is nothing short of well crafted! The music too, like God some of these songs tracks just slap insanely hard. [strike] I am kind of disappointed with the track \"Mutation\" on the soundtrack because the bomb alarm just adds to how hard that track is, and it kind of leaves the track itself a bit emptier than it should be if the alarm was part of the track. [/strike] All in all while the gameplay is fun, it does seem quite a bit easy to cheese the bosses, since the main way of going about it is spam attacking once they hit the corner, but it is still fun nonetheless. On top of the fun gameplay elements that are present, the humor too is pretty well made and funny. Apart from the macaroni copypasta, things like getting a physical tier three sub to get access to a barnyard was quite funny, and that's just the start of it!

The game itself is existing from pixels and I love pixel games sooo much. But this game is different from others because the dialogs in game is unique. \u0130t's fun to read them and sometimes I laugh so hard tbh. Fights at game is pretty good and Turnip Boy ripping everything lol. The negative side of this game to me is; while swapping to watering can and sword in fight it's quite hard. Gameplay is short I wish it was longer cause I really liked this game but still I recommend it.\n\n3.

The puzzle(s) design, soundtrack, and pacing/flow of the game were the biggest standouts to me.

I know that's the case with almost all games but when I looked at this one, I didn't initially think it'd be the case. \n\nThe only real technical problem I have with the game is that it started crashing on me randomly, after I beat the main game and was doing other stuff. It happened 4 or 5 times in one day and I think it may have to do with my blue light filter app but its still a shame. Besides that I felt that the added roguelike/roguelite mode was anemic and lacking variety as far as they go and this coming from one who went through a big Binding of Isaac phase and similar games during high school. It is a post game, optional mode so I'll go easy on it otherwise I would write an entire essay on its flaws. \n\nI am interested in the announced sequel that is supposed to be coming out this year. It has an interesting premise and leans more into the roguelite/like direction which I wish them all the best with since its a complex and tricky genre to get right.

It's been skinned with a sloppily done mismash of cartoony graphics and pixel \"art\" with a vegetable/comedy theme.  The mobile app reached middling success with Gen Z and Millennials.  While I am going against the \"popular\" tide here, it's worth pointing out that, even if there were no other reasons to not recommend this game, it's FREE on mobile app stores but costs money on Steam.  If you want to play this kind of game, if this is the kind of game you really want, stop wasting time and money on gaming PCs and Steam and pick up your mobile phone.\n\nWhile this is well polished as far as mobile app store apps go, it's not pushing any technical boundaries and isn't designed with PC gamers in mind.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nA choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel \"art\" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics, but the developers couldn't get that right, it looks inauthentic because it's paired with many assets and intersitual graphics that aren't 2D pixel art.  Which means the developers could have done better, but didn't.  The overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result of this inexplicably poor decision making.\n\nWhile there are options to change the resolution for the mobile app, all this does is scale up the simplistic low quality vector art assets used to make the mobile app, which makes little or no difference to the graphics quality.  Without any other substantial graphics tweaks, it's not possible for gamers to improve the mediocre 2D visuals.\n\nThere's no mouse support whatsover, perhaps the mobile app developers don't know what they are because they couldn't work out how to plug a mouse into their iPhones.  Regardless this makes navigating the game menus a tedious chore, it's simply not acceptable for mobile apps to be ported so badly to PC. \n\nBecause this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.\n\nThese technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nOnce more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $15 USD, on app stores, it's free. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay a [b]COMPLETELY INSANE FIFTEEN BUCKS FOR A FREE MOBILE APP[/b] just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this can be played free elsewhere, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.

Later we find out that the mayor, Turnip boy's papi and mr. Lemon had history together. Turnip boy helps other veggies around the village, rips apart any tax documents that he finds, collects hats and reads lore with the help of notes and journals. \n\nGameplay wise the game behaves like a cartoon Zelda (I dislike these types of comparisons but I'll use them for lack of a better term), I played on the default difficulty and the game was easy especially with health upgrades, the bosses were interesting, however the game has plenty of accessibility options that help the player tweak their game experience. \nI loved the writing, there's many Easter eggs from pop culture and quirky characters. Heck, you're even going to get a portal gun and implement it into your rotation either to solve easy puzzles or fight bosses. \n\nIf you have it from a bundle try it, if not maybe wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1681995394, "timestamp_updated": 1681995394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136979732": {"recommendationid": "136979732", "author": {"steamid": "76561199144309423", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1681943339}, "language": "english", "review": "like i don't even remember how i discovered this game but i do remember that when i read the title and saw this cute turnip i immediatly bought it lol. the design is really cute and the story very tax-evasion-ish hehe. \nyou can clearly see a lot of passion flew into the making! the game absolutely meets my sense of humor and even after 'the end' the game isn't over because there are a few more secrets to reveal.\nyeah so it's a total 10/10 and worth every penny (in real life tax evasion is a little too risky imo so i actually paid the money unlike turnip boy) i can't wait to rob a bank with the little gangster tho :)", "timestamp_created": 1681946134, "timestamp_updated": 1681946402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136969283": {"recommendationid": "136969283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006781799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 162, "playtime_at_review": 4538, "last_played": 1699794055}, "language": "english", "review": "it is amazing", "timestamp_created": 1681928891, "timestamp_updated": 1681928891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136968293": {"recommendationid": "136968293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198896645709", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 467, "last_played": 1697066123}, "language": "english", "review": "turnip stab nuke. nuke go brrrr.", "timestamp_created": 1681927553, "timestamp_updated": 1681927553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136934269": {"recommendationid": "136934269", "author": {"steamid": "76561199215424316", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1681674774}, "language": "english", "review": "Turnip ip ip", "timestamp_created": 1681864007, "timestamp_updated": 1681864007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136921473": {"recommendationid": "136921473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047889520", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1681549044}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun 2-3 hour game.

It matches the expected aesthetic and goes well as a mirror to the games darker undertones- The main section of the story is simple but enjoyable and the side quests don't feel like they take you out of that main story too much and actually compliment it quite well- The lore is nicely woven into the story so its not to difficult to understand the context behind the world but its also not given in huge lore dumps or exposed in large pieces of written textNegatives- You can't rebind buttons for a controller and the game clearly works best on controller.- Its too short and honestly a bit too straight forward. I'd be more mad if I didn't get it on sale but it only took a few hours of casual game play to get all the achievements and hats not related to the train. I was hoping for a much longer story with more to do or at least a more satisfying ending :/ The train feels like an add on they slapped in there once they realized the game was too short or something just to pad out the game play time.- The boss fights are actually pretty basic and don't provide much of a challenge. There's no puzzle to them or interesting trick on how to take down each enemy its just dodge and poke. The final boss battle was the least interesting of them all and in no way had you rely on any of the interesting skills you had picked up along the game. :( So really I'd rate this game 3.5/5  but yea I would tell ppl to just watch a lets play of it rather than buying it yourself", "timestamp_created": 1679768005, "timestamp_updated": 1679768005, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495412856340408325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135401695": {"recommendationid": "135401695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039187627", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1679444068}, "language": "english", "review": "fun, casual game with a good sense of humor and a great soundtrack", "timestamp_created": 1679758785, "timestamp_updated": 1679758785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135396259": {"recommendationid": "135396259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110965831", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1679754518}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay was very tedious and boring.

I barely looked at the screenshots. The name was enough to sell me.\n\nI do not regret my purchase of this game.\n\nTurnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion is a \"Zelda clone\" but that's not a bad thing whatsoever. The visual style is charmingly retro with a comic book-esque spin that I welcomed with open arms.\n\n The story is very \"Saturday morning cartoon\" yet it never felt boring. The characters were all funny and engaging in their own ways, with plenty of funny Easter eggs and references thrown in. The writing in this game is witty and really doesn't take itself seriously at all. Overall, a very relaxing story to kick back to on an evening!\n\nThis game is pretty short, clocking in at around 3 hours, BUT WAIT!\n\nThere's more-\n\nThe DLC for this game is a rogue-like with a LOAD more content,, there are more hats and things to unlock so I will be going back for seconds c:< \nThere's a shocking amount of content here and, in my opinion, is fully worth paying full price for!\n\nThe bosses in this game are really fun and some are fairly challenging, offering a healthy dose of punch to an experience that you think would be relatively easy. This doesn't make the game overbearingly difficult however, as there are accessibility options you can tweak to play the way you want to and VERY generous checkpoints littered throughout :)\nEnemy variety in this game is pretty vast and it was nice to see very obvious love put into crafting this game's world.\n\n10/10 - Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion is a very very fun game where you commit tax evasion. What else do you want from me?\n\n(i will be getting turnip boy robs a bank when that comes out, mark my words)", "timestamp_created": 1679545194, "timestamp_updated": 1679545340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.742967605590820313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135202673": {"recommendationid": "135202673", "author": {"steamid": "76561199083300995", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1679966836}, "language": "english", "review": "A great and cute game. i came into it liking the art style, but i thought the gameplay would be similar to stardewvalley, but instead i was pleasantly surprised on this games unique atributes. instead of farming your land, you must do work for the town mayor in order to get your land back!\n", "timestamp_created": 1679537597, "timestamp_updated": 1679537597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135185092": {"recommendationid": "135185092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202141575", "num_games_owned": 1947, "num_reviews": 274, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1679518109}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty much what i expected\n\nthe game is kind of funny and has some alright combat and puzzles\n\ncompleted this in one sitting , and had a reasonably good time\n\nyou can complete the game without guides or other outside help , which i think is nice", "timestamp_created": 1679518501, "timestamp_updated": 1679518501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135178718": {"recommendationid": "135178718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114293579", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 483, "last_played": 1651328594}, "language": "english", "review": "he really did commit tax evasion", "timestamp_created": 1679513128, "timestamp_updated": 1679513128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653017640113830566", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135178238": {"recommendationid": "135178238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011542422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 316, "last_played": 1679297933}, "language": "english", "review": "Pro: It's sassy Zelda!

"last_played": 1678750291}, "language": "english", "review": "Half a game with horrendous grammar.  Graphically, it's fine, to a point I'd even argue it looks really nice, but the game never really picks up.  The enemies are very basic, with limited mobility and simplistic AI of simply following the player, pacing back and forth in a straight line, or a few other simple actions from a few other simplistic enemy types.  The bosses run on patterns and are fine, they're not some RNG hellscape, but there's also very few of them.\n\nThere's almost no combat in the game, it's mostly just walking around, speaking to people,  and solving simplistic puzzles.  Initially, I thought the first dungeon in the game was intended as a tutorial dungeon, then it'd pick up, but it never really did.  There's a small moment at the end where it combined the puzzles you learn to do in each dungeon throughout the game, but when there's only a few of those, it's really short and unsatisfying.\n\nThe most interesting part of the game is already displayed within the trailer for it, wherein it shows the bosses and some of the wit of the dialogue, but that trailer really does give away the majority of the game.  The regular enemies aren't interesting to deal with, they're not satisfying, and they feel incomplete, like a high school student's project.  The first trailer visible on Steam, as of the time of my writing this, only shows gameplay of the train ride you unlock at the end of the game, but more on that later.  The second trailer shows some of the gameplay of other portions of the game, but I highly suggest you look up some gameplay videos without commentary to see how dull it actually is, since trailers can be edited in a way which makes the product look far more interesting than it really is.\n\nAs for the dialogue, it's ruined by the aforementioned poor grammar.  Commas are frequently missed or misplaced and there was even an instance where \"it's\" was used in place of \"its\" to show possession.  \"It's\" is ALWAYS a contraction, either of the formal \"it is\", or of the the informal \"it has\"; \"it\" plus the second word, with a portion cut out, the two jammed together, then a marker placed to indicate there's been an alteration and combination.  However, there was only a single instance of the incorrect its/it's use, but it still suggests a lack of care in the grammar and proof-reading.\n\nEven if you ignore the pathetic grammar, you'll have to read through the dialogue of everyone you come across if you wish to progress through the game.  Your job is relegated to speaking to someone, speaking to someone else, speaking to someone else, and so on, acting as a liaison between people so as to receive some object in order to continue onto the next dungeon.  Along the way, you'll also need to look for a bunch of random papers to rip up.  If you find 100% of the papers to rip up, you then unlock the second form of the final boss, but even it feels shallow and unsatisfying.  When you defeat the final boss, no matter which form you end the game on, since the game ends after defeating the first form if you didn't find all of those papers, you're forced to sit through minutes of end credits, with no ability to speed up or skip them, even if it's your second time through them.\n\nAfter completing the game, you unlock a train ride, but that train ride is nothing but endless fights against monsters with increasing difficulty.  However, this train is the most interesting part of the game, and it's a massive shame that they didn't decide to expand the game's world and create far more dungeons while combining the concepts from the train into the rest of the game.  After every boss you defeat in the train, you're allowed to choose an upgrade which boosts your abilities, but only while within the train.  Had they used those boosts from the train and added far more dungeons with greater complexity, better puzzles, more enemies, and the use of combinations of puzzles as the game progressed which slowly grew in complexity, then the game could've potentially been something enjoyable.\n\nUnfortunately, this game is just another failed \"Zelda\" clone, and for an overinflated price that's nowhere near worth the cost.  At most, and it'd still be hard to suggest it even at this amount, the game should cost $5.  If you want to waste your time with it, get it on sale for $5 or less.  Otherwise, spend a little more and get something that's actually good, something that's actually worth it, something like \"Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos\".  If you aren't certain about the one I've now suggested, go ahead and try its demo and see for yourself, just make sure to avoid this game.", "timestamp_created": 1678834179, "timestamp_updated": 1678918927, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481481492519378662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134671540": {"recommendationid": "134671540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198840983906", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1691282153}, "language": "english", "review": "Hilarious.

It follows the same general formula of finding new items and using them to complete dungeons. The game doesn't change said formula, but it may very well be for the better. Sometimes I just want to play a simple game and have some fun. The game is pretty easy - no puzzles are too difficult, but some of the later ones do require a bit of thinking. The combat is also simple, but the last few bosses do pose quite a challenge. Whilst I have died a few times, I never felt frustrated over my deaths.\n\nNext, the story and the writing. The premise is simple - you are a Turnip that commits tax evasion. While a lot is obvious from the start, TBCTE surprised me with a few twists. You can also find many documents that tell many interesting stories. Overall, the game's lore is deeper than it seems at a first glance. As for the writing, the game doesn't take itself very seriously. You'll come across many jokes, some funny, some not. While not everyone might find the puns, references and 4th wall breaks funny, you can still enjoy the experience without them.\n\nAs for the soundtrack, that was probably the biggest surprise for me. Most of the OST is the generic music I expected from a game like this. It's not bad, but it wasn't great either. It simply did it's job well. However, later in the game, I was genuinely shocked by how good some tracks were, such as \"Mutation\", \"Vidalia\" and \"Turnip Boy Go\".\n\nIn terms of collectibles - there are two types. One unlocks a secret boss and the other one new outfits. Both are simple to find as long as you look around and talk to some NPCs. After beating the final boss, you can load to just before entering the final dungeon, so there are no missable achievements. Beating the game also unlocks an NPC that tells you hints on where to find the missing items.\n\nSpeaking of post game, there are only two things that you unlock - one is the previously mentioned NPC and the other is the endless battle dungeon. Neither are amazing, but the battle dungeon can extend the game's length a bit.\n\nI only have one gripe with the game - how short it is. I got all achievements in about 2 hours and the game doesn't have a lot of replayability. TBCTE is pretty fun, so it's a shame how short it is. The price is a bit too high something so short. I heavily recommend buying it either on sale or as a part of a bundle.\n\nTo sum up, Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion is a short but great game with great humour, nice story, gameplay, artstyle and OST. If you like 2D Zelda games, you will enjoy this hidden gem. I will be patiently awaiting the sequel.

And it's not a fun sort of backtracking like in a metroidvania or survival horror, it's just walking between NPCs and giving them items.\nThe visuals are overall competent, the sprites are clean, but nothing about it is remarkable. There were no interesting visual setpieces at any point. I've played games that are literal scribbles that are much more visually striking. You get an awful lot of hats but all of them are worse than the default sprite.\nThe music is... intentionally bad? I think? It was ear-bleeding at any rate.\nThe writing is terrible. Bad uninventive plot, unfunny dialogue full of immediately dated references. It's really riding on the mildly odd title. But it's not like you spend the game finding creative ways to evade taxes, the tax evasion happens right at the start and then it stops mattering, it's just a sequence of random fetch quests.\nThe length is just under two hours, and that includes doing every single optional fetch quest.\nI hate to be this negative but there is really not much to like about this game, and yet it's so highly rated.\nThe entire thing gives the air of \"it's bad on purpose you guys\", but even bad games are often interesting, this is not.\nNot even remotely worth $15, I wouldn't even say it's worth $6 on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1677818282, "timestamp_updated": 1677818282, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439999997615814209", "comment_count": 0,

It has a pretty funny story line that is sure to make you chuckle. Besides, who wouldn't like a cute little turnip that never speaks but loves to commit tax evasion? The graphics are pretty basic, but it looks visually pretty for the style of game that it is. Audio is nice, simplistic background ambiance that is pleasant to listen to. Sure, you might tone it out after a while, but it's definitely not something you feel compelled to mute while playing the game. The game mechanics are pretty simple and easy to do. Some of the boss battles are a tad on the challenging side, but nothing that can't be completed with a little bit of practice. When it comes to the steam achievements, they are completely achievable! One hidden achievement in particular gave me a run for my money, but I reckon it's probably more due to my skill level than actual difficulty. I would highly recommend this game, and think that you get a good amount of fun game play for a price point that is just right.  \n\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2611 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10\n\nTL/DR: Great game for the price point, but does have someone limited game play.

Talking is tedious, scrolling through rambling, uninteresting, unhelpful dialog. Walking is tedious, you move at a slow crawl with no real movement abilities. Combat is tedious and unchallenging, with a single slow attack that easily dispatches even the bosses.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.", "timestamp_created": 1677563838, "timestamp_updated": 1677563838, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620200157165527344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133784365": {"recommendationid": "133784365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009752238", "num_games_owned": 935, "num_reviews": 211, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1677541530}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm gonna be honest, I would have never known about this game had it not been for one of my kids who I work with had told me about it. He said it was a short and silly adventure game and I would like it. Lucky for me, it was on sale and I gave it a try.\n\nYou play as Turnip Boy and just as the title suggests, the game starts with you not paying your taxes and losing your greenhouse home to Mayor Onion. The only way to get it back is to become his assistant and do strange tasks for him in order to win your home back. Well, let's get to work!\n\nThis game is fairly simple and has a lot of meme-y writing. Lots of puns, 4th wall breaks, etc. I don't mind it and found myself chuckling at some of the jokes. In the beginning, all you can do is dodge roll and talk to the inhabitants of the world who are also vegetables and fruits. As you progress, you will be able to use plants that make bombs, a sword, and other fun doodads. The gameplay was never too hard and I had fun solving some of the puzzles too.\n\nJust like classic adventure game fashion, there are collectibles you can find in the game as well. Hilariously and fascinatingly, they are documents that expand the story and give the game a deep story for those who are interested. It's hilarious that Turnip Boy just rips them all up, but you'll need them to get the true ending of the game. There are also side quests you can do and lots of equippable hats to customize your look. For a game so simple, it surprised me with its depth.\n\nLastly, once you finish the game you unlock two things. One is a survival train mode. You can play on a train level that has you fighting old and new enemies to see how far you can get. There are new collectibles and goodies for you to unlock as you play it for those who just want a lil more Turnip Boy. Also, you unlock an NPC who gives you hints on where to find the missing document collectibles so you can unlock the true ending. I super appreciated that one since on my playthrough I was only missing one and it helped me find it quickly to do the hidden final boss (which was sooo worth it).\n\nGripes? I have none honestly. The game is short, yes, but honestly, that is its charm. You can finish it in about 3ish hours and you'll feel satisfied. I left this game smiling and really enjoyed the comedy as well as the gameplay. There was never a boss that was too hard to beat. If I lost, it was because I wasn't playing cautiously enough, and I didn't encounter any bugs or glitches. All and all, this was a short and sweet package.\n\nFinal verdict? If you're looking for a short adventure game, this is perfect. Very fun and doesn't take up too much of your time. Has some nice bonus content if you wanna play a lil more and even has a surprisingly deep story if you want one too. I have to say, I'm looking forward to the sequel, Turnip Boy Robs a Bank to see more of this team's work.

So for me this would be a half-half recommendation, If you're willing to read it all feel free to do so. Now I'll say some points:\n\nPROS: \n- Nice game, interesting plot, nice animation, cute graphics and the walkthrough of solo game was easy, fun instrucitions and all.\n- interesting/fun/easy achievments, easy follow-through.\n- good for chill and relaxed game, doesn't require to stress.\n- Got this game for \"free\", so the price wise didn't affect me. HOWEVER! i don't think it's a bad price to get this game, is it should be lower? yes, but imo it's still worth it. my recommendation is to get this game on sale.\n\nCONS:\n- *personally* It was way too easy for me, i mean, i finished the game and all the achievments in around 4ish hours. Personally, expected to have a difficult platform game. However i really enjoyed this game to the point i finished until the end. BUT, if you're expecting a difficult platform game, this is not for you.\n- It sometimes lag on the beginig and when entering to new rooms, but thankfully i didn't face any bug or lag in the fights.\n- Very easy game and once you finish the game, the way they get you back are pretty much the infinite mode fight in the trains, however for me it was a bit broring because the lapse of the bosses are basically the same and predictable. and the items that they sell (hats) with tickets are like hmmmm, is it worth it?? like, do 3-4 turns on the infinite mode and you get 15 tickets to buy a hat, if i played it a bit more i would be able to but all the hats in maybe 10ish turns but it would be boring fighs the same thing over and over again. \n\nhowever that is up to you if you're the relax type that just wanna have fun, then go ahead. For me the game is overall good, fun and relaxing, but as a difficult multiplatformer player it was hard not to get stressed by how easy it was haha.", "timestamp_created": 1677534732, "timestamp_updated": 1677534732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133719732": {"recommendationid": "133719732", "author": {"steamid": "76561199129556260", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1677473820}, "language": "english", "review": "The IRS had a great character arc", "timestamp_created": 1677473852, "timestamp_updated": 1677473852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133712919": {"recommendationid": "133712919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026121953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1674257539}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is way over-hyped. I really fail to see the appeal of this game\n\n1. There is no meaningful story\n\nNo characters have any meaningful development. There are no plot developments that are worth any real consideration. Turnip boy doesn't talk. Any 'dialogue' is just one-sided exposition or bad humor\n\n2. The gameplay is boring.\n\nThe puzzles are simple and the combat is just unfun. You are locked in place when you attack which feels awful. It's one thing in souls-like games where long attack animations force you to be more methodical about your approach to combat, but in this game it just makes the game feel clunky. The game isn't hard and the gameplay isn't satisfying enough to justify self-imposed challenge like a 'no-hit run'\n\n3. The comedy is asanine\n\nOne could argue that the game's charm is in its 'comedy' but I find it to be asinine. The whole 'committing tax evasion' thing is just a gag and is only really funny the first time due to its novelty. I imagine the humor works something like the Borderlands series where it has a specific tone it shoots for and it either lands or misses horribly. I find myself in the latter camp\n\n\nThe one saving grace is how short it is. It actually felt like a chore getting through this game. If it was any longer I would have just dropped the game. There are literally HUNDREDS of games out there at the same pricetag or lower which are more worth your time. In this day and age where the indie games market is so saturated, I don't think this game is worth your time or your money. \n", "timestamp_created": 1677465958, "timestamp_updated": 1677465958, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497299551963806152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133709598": {"recommendationid": "133709598", "author": {"steamid": "76561199034191494", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 177, "last_played": 1676695993}, "language": "english", "review": "The little boy does stuff like he is cool in doing so because who cares about taxes \n#fucktheirs", "timestamp_created": 1677461413, "timestamp_updated": 1677461413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133703656": {"recommendationid": "133703656", "author": {"steamid": "76561199084782641", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1677484668}, "language": "english", "review": "literally the best game ever made", "timestamp_created": 1677454136, "timestamp_updated": 1677454136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133695021": {"recommendationid": "133695021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015038674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1677468329}, "language": "english", "review": "So much ripping and tearing that it would make the Doom Guy shed a tear of joy", "timestamp_created": 1677444825, "timestamp_updated": 1677444825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133681421": {"recommendationid": "133681421", "author": {"steamid": "76561199118135744", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1677432835}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun but quick (I've finished all achievements in about 4h)", "timestamp_created": 1677432222, "timestamp_updated": 1677432222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133663451": {"recommendationid": "133663451", "author": {"steamid": "76561199139366946", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1677419950}, "language": "english", "review": "101 lessons on how to avoid tax", "timestamp_created": 1677416492, "timestamp_updated": 1677416492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133643990": {"recommendationid": "133643990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053930985", "num_games_owned": 576, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 179, "last_played": 1683269805}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't pay taxes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen played this game.", "timestamp_created": 1677394580, "timestamp_updated": 1677394580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133633056": {"recommendationid": "133633056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401902851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1677380804}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and chill game.

The game is set in a world inhabited by vegetables and other plant-like creatures, and features a colorful cast of characters and a charming art style.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you'll need to solve puzzles, interact with characters, and avoid getting caught by the authorities as you try to pay off your debt and clear your name. The game has received generally positive reviews for its engaging gameplay, quirky sense of humor, and charming visual style.\n\nOne personal story that comes to mind is the time I got lost in a foreign city while traveling alone. It was a hot summer day and I was visiting a new place for the first time. I was feeling adventurous and decided to explore the city on my own, without a map or a tour guide.\n\nEverything was going well until I turned down a small side street and suddenly realized that I had no idea where I was. I didn't recognize any of the buildings or landmarks, and my phone was running low on battery so I couldn't use it to look up directions.\n\nI started to feel panicked and unsure of what to do. But then I remembered something my mom had told me: \"If you ever get lost, just stay calm and try to retrace your steps. You'll figure it out.\"\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to calm my nerves. Then, I started walking back the way I came, slowly and carefully, paying attention to the turns I had taken and the places I had passed. It took a while, but eventually I recognized a familiar street corner and knew I was headed in the right direction.\n\nI made it back to my hotel safe and sound, and from then on I always made sure to have a map and a fully charged phone with me when I traveled. The experience taught me the importance of being prepared and staying calm in stressful situations.\n\nAs someone who has experienced the feeling of being lost and unsure of what to do, I can relate to Turnip Boy's predicament in the game. In my own personal experience, I got lost in a foreign city while traveling alone and had to rely on my wits and my sense of direction to find my way back to my hotel. It was a scary and stressful situation, but I learned the importance of staying calm and trying to retrace my steps.

With such a outlandish title, I bought this out of pure impulse and found myself a clever Zelda-Style game. The game has beautiful and colorful 32-bit art style that just fits what a Zelda-Like game is and the portraits during any cutscene and dialogues are adorable and well drawn.\n\nYou play as Turnip Boy, you inherited your grandfather's home but the Mayor inform you that you need to pay your taxes or else. Well our adorable little root vegetable decided that taxation is theft and ripped the paper right in front of the Mayor. Now you go on a wacky adventure as a wanted turnip against the tyrannical vegetable government all so you don't have to pay property taxes.\n\nStorywise, you're simply avoiding taxes that ends up with you with doing various tasks and assisting various other vegetables in town. The \"story\" takes a backseat as you simply enjoy the interactions and humor the game throws at you. However, as you play through the main story, this cute game actually have quite a dark lore that caught me by surprise. The more you progress through the story, the more layers you unravel about the world of Turnip Boy. Trust me, the ice berg goes deep in this game.\n\nThe character interactions are the highlight of the game. If you're familiar with a lot of early 2000s to 2010s internet humor, then you will know what to expect. There are a lot of dated/ reference humors to the internet culture of the past that are actually executed pretty well. The humors are entertaining enough to get a chuckle or amusement out of you but never overstays its welcome. Every veggie you meet in the game are fun characters. While many characters are one note characters, their design and personalities are so varied and vibrant that you can't help but to like the majority of them.\n\nGameplay wise, you have light combat and a lot of running around doing chores for other vegetables. Combat is very similar to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. You see the world in a oblique eagle-eye view and you can move in any direction. There is a button to swing your weapon and a button to roll/dodge/interact. Very simple controls but it provides a good amount of engagement. The controls are very responsive so there was never a point in the game where I felt frustrated or felt like the game was unfair due to the controls. (Note that the game isn't really difficult unless you decide to play the optional rogue-like mode). The majority of the game, like past Zelda games, simply have you talking to folks and running errands for them that will lead you to new parts of the map. This is the best part of the game as this lets you explore the world and personalities that reside in it. Oh and you can collect different kind of hats/ stuff to put on Turnip Boy's head. Its great. I made my Turnip Boy bald.\n\nFinishing the game in just 3 hours, the game is not long at all but enjoyable and memorable nonetheless. The only gripes I have of the game is I wish some of the darker backstories/lore was explored a bit more before reaching the conclusion but maybe my answers will be met in the upcoming sequel \"Turnip Boy Robs a Bank\". Overall, Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion just oozes charm throughout the whole game and is a simple enough game for any casual or hardcore gamer to just pick up and enjoy the ride. As soon as you lay eyes on Turnip Boy's smile in game, you'll be hooked immediately. If you can not justify yourself buying a 3 hour game for the full price of $15, then I highly suggest you grab this game on sale.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1672826998, "timestamp_updated": 1672826998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130082121": {"recommendationid": "130082121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043595516", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1672805551}, "language": "english", "review": "Devilishly charming at times, Turnip Boy is a relaxing Zelda-like with a great sense of humour, tight gameplay, & wonderful presentation.

This makes the later bosses who have the same attack as you very difficult to dodge since you cant move in the first place! the enemies are either boring, or annoying. And the bosses are wack. The first boss is extremly easy and only has one attack, the second boss is annoying and forces you to do a mini puzzle while its flying around. The third boss summons a billion enemies and makes you have to focus on them instead of the boss. The fourth one is possibly one pf the worst bosses ive ever fought in a videogame. Every time you attck it spits some stupid poison that makes you take a lot of damage.

Everything has a slightly wobbly quality to it, but mostly due to leaning very much into a cute aesthetic. I admired how they didn't fall back on an 8-bit style, but rather a polished 16-bit one.\n\n+++ Humorous and quirky interactions with NPCs, lots of offbeat humour, and quite a few pop culture references without obnoxiously overloading the player with them. If you get the references, then you get them, otherwise you still enjoy the whimsical atmosphere.\n\n+++ The story starts out cute and has you fetch items and run around back and forth. Then it takes a strange detour partway through until the end. However, it still remains generally playful and light-hearted for the most part until the end. The recurring allusions to taxes and fighting the system are used to humorous effect.\n\n++ The music is pretty good! Upbeat, happy tunes for the most part...and appropriate atmospheric music for the rest.\n\n+ If you love collecting hats, you'll love the post-game. Thankfully, they're not linked to achievements so you can safely extend your experience without worrying about grinding towards them.\n\n- I only died about thrice in the entire game, mostly wihiin some of the latter half's boss battles, but only because there were more mechanics to initially trial and error through simultaneously. Otherwise, there is absolutely NO penalty to dying and you can easily retry instantly after understanding what to do from the first time.\n\n+/- The game is very short and is great to consume in one go in an afternoon/evening. The post game content is optional and not terribly difficult, although it still presents a little jump up in difficulty from the main game.\n\n_____\nIn conclusion, definitely snatch up this game if it's on sale and you don't mind the length. \nIt is very well worth the price for the whole package if you're looking for a compact unique experience for a lazy afternoon/evening in.\n\nLook for something else if you want a longer experience to revisit for days to come.", "timestamp_created": 1671429022, "timestamp_updated": 1671429022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128834006": {"recommendationid": "128834006", "author": {"steamid": "76561199187215474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1745, "last_played": 1661385392}, "language": "english", "review": "Who doesn't want to be a turnip with hats and a hatred for taxes?

It's just memes and the bosses are all block pushing puzzles. It wants you to make Zelda comparisons but it's closer to old free flash games. These developers are too inexperienced to be charging for their game.\n\n1. Half the game is backtracking. The worst kind. Walking around rooms you already walked around before just to talk to an NPC because another NPC told you to talk to them. As far as I can tell the game isn't joking, so the devs probably don't know that this kind of padding is boring to play through.\n2. The game has three buttons dedicated to three items... Not in the obvious way anything with common sense would have it work, two of the button switch the items, and one uses it.\n3. It tries to be dark at times, and by dark I mean ripping off Adventure Time. It doesn't do anything differently than Adventure Time, it's just a few bits of lore from it without adding anything. It also does the Pokemon ghost thing except less. That's a good way to describe this game, just stealing things and cutting it down until you wonder why they bothered.\n4. It's just streamer bait that was made when Yoshi Commits Tax Fraud was popular. This is the worst kind of game, the kind that was designed to be enjoyed by watching some screaming idiot laugh at every joke no matter how unfunny it is. The very foundation of this game is scummy.\n5. This game has a rouge-like mode. It's two new bosses and the rest is filler. That's it. Why not just make the bosses? Why waste so much of my time? It doesn't have replay value.\n\nThis is not a game for people that like games. If you had any sense you'd skip this one. I would list some games that are better, but Zelda and the Lampshade of no real significance was better, so that would be a long list. Seriously, do not bother, even if you get it for free.

Me ha parecido un juegazo (comprado en oferta) y me ha durado unas 4 horas (unas 5 si quieres conseguir todos los logros). Tiene muchas cosas buenas a los que hacer referencia, como el estilo art\u00edstico, las mec\u00e1nicas habladas con anterioridad, la f\u00e1cil jugabilidad, el protagonista que manejamos est\u00e1 bien gracioso, los momentos en los que el juego rompe la 4ta pared, etc. Lo \u00fanico malo que podr\u00eda comentar es la bso, que se acaba haciendo un poco trillante y a parte, quiz\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n le hubiera metido un mapa para poder guiarte un poco al principio del juego, ya que tienes que ir a muchos sitios, el mapa es m\u00e1s o menos grande y puedes acabar dando bastantes vueltas.

Later on this progresses to love letters, notices of military service, and countless random documents. Yes it's a basic gimmick, but other character's reactions to the senseless ripping is beautiful. Every character's dialog is pretty entertaining, and it's a great motivator for completing the next little quest.\n\nThe combat is relatively smooth, but nothing too new.
