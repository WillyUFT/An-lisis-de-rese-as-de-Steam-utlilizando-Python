This game is absolutely what you're looking for if you want to play something like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The story can get surprisingly dark and mysterious which makes it very compelling.\n\nThe game also features a game mechanic where your companion learns passive skills from the equipment that you find from your journey (Weapons, Shields, and Armor). Enemies drop elemental \"force\" that you can use to give stat buffs to your character, unlock new offensive magical spells, and treasures to gain more power for your character (advancement of this mechanic is restricted at certain points until you further advance the story).\n\nThere is also a passive system that uses the items that you find and craft on your adventure to empower your character and offer unique benefits to your character such as increased resistance to all manner of status effects, increased exp, increased coins from enemies, and even passive Health recovery.\n\nMany treasures are well hidden, and side content like the Arena offer fantastic rewards. The story is linear, but at certain points you are able to backtrack to seek missing treasure or additional force to power up your character. There is content in the game that you can miss depending on your decisions at certain points in the story.\n\nI spent quite a bit of time on this game and it was very enjoyable. I honestly did a bit more grinding than I needed to when I could have just used a different setup to defeat a certain boss. Mix up your tactics and try different weapons as wildly swinging your weapon may not be enough to overcome your enemies.\n\nThe sound quality can be off at times as some enemies make strange sounds, but this game's soundtrack is quite fantastic. Visual quality is also very good overall. Be wary that some bosses fire many projectiles and you can lose track of what's going on if you have additional characters on screen when using your character's abilities. I would also strongly advise that you reduce the screen flashing in the options menu.\n\nOverall this game is easy to recommend for anyone wanting a Metroidvania with a lot of content.

It can assume many shapes and comes from various places. Yet, there's something uniquely magical when love takes the form of creative passion, an art. This particular form of love is something that can be cherished by many. Astlibra: Revision represents the digital embodiment of one creator's affection. So, what fuels this game's essence? This review seeks to provide some insights.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\n\nTo begin with, Astlibra's primary measure of progress revolves around numbers. This balance leans more towards a player's character skills than their skill and reflexes. For someone like me, who isn't particularly skilled at reflex-based games, this approach is favorable.\n\nThe progression system consists of several layers. The most straightforward is the level-up screen.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3065178799\n\nNext is the \"grow board,\" where you can accumulate force points of different elements and use them to purchase stat upgrades. This is also where you unlock various spells, a topic I'll delve into later.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3065179817\n\nThroughout your journey, you'll amass a vast array of weapons, shields, armor, and accessories, each impacting your gameplay differently. There are swift weapons to pair with shields, though their reach is limited, and slow but potent two-handed weapons with extended range. Additionally, magic staves serve as projectile weapons, firing elemental projectiles.\n\nPlayers acquire equipment by crafting with materials and blueprints dropped by monsters. The game cleverly encourages experimentation with various gears. Equipping them allows you to gain experience, and maxing them unlocks passive skills or yields magic crystals to slot your passive skills. However, one downside is that you won't know the skills acquired until you've maxed out the experience, necessitating trial and error in crafting and equipment selection.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3065180877\n\nLastly, the game boasts a variety of magic spells, each aligned with one of six elements and spanning different tiers. Progression is well-paced, with new tiers of magic introduced in each chapter, ensuring the game remains engaging. On harder difficulties, it can become somewhat grindy, as acquiring as many passive skills and stat improvements as possible is crucial. Given the emphasis on numbers, the game allows for some forgiveness in terms of player clumsiness, depending on your build and system understanding. Players with better reflexes may have a different experience.\n\nOne occasional issue, particularly in later game sections, is visibility. As you advance, enemies unleash more potent attacks that can occasionally clutter the screen.\n\n[b]But Wait, There\u2019s More[/b]\n\nBeyond the main storyline, the game offers a \"postscript\" chapter after Chapter 8, lasting an additional 10-20 hours. This segment is a crucial continuation of the story, introducing further progression elements in the form of weapon enhancement and the board mechanic. In postscript, all weapons, including starter ones, can be enhanced up to +99 using ingredients dropped by monsters.\n\nBoards are also dropped by monsters and can be attached to specific equipment. Acquiring boards is somewhat RNG-dependent, as you can't predict when the right board for your specific equipment will drop. However, when obtained, the attached equipment's stats see a major boost. Some boards also contain upgrades for your existing passive and active skills. This evolution leads to earlier, less impactful spells becoming powerful tools in your arsenal. That weak fire bolt early evolved into a fast shooting bolt that explodes on impact and end-tier skills become a boss shredder on their own. \n\nOne drawback of the postscript is that you'll revisit most of the same dungeons as in the main game, with the same inhabitant that's stronger. It's only at the very end that you encounter a new dungeon and set of bosses. Nevertheless, by this point, the story's  multiple twists, turns and long-awaited revelations keep you engaged.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe game commences with a familiar JRPG trope: the protagonist's hometown is besieged by demons, setting the stage for an epic battle against the demon king. However, Astlibra consistently hints at a more intricate narrative beneath the surface. While the story may appear slow at the outset, it gradually evolves into something unexpected and captivating. This subversion of traditional plot elements extends to the characters you encounter and recruit, endearing them to you as comrades.\n\nWhat lags behind in the JRPG genre cliche are the lines of dialogue. They seem to strive for depth but often come across as a rough translation of generic JRPG conversations. While it doesn't significantly impact the overall plot, it leaves room for improvement in terms of editing and translation.\n\nThe most noticeable residue of generic JRPG writing is the use of eroticism as humor, which often falls flat and feels juvenile. It seems as if the game is attempting to resurrect the cringeworthy aspects of teenage humor. While dirty jokes can be effective when skillfully employed, Astlibra misses the mark. For instance, the humor in peeking at female party members in a hot spring ceased to be funny for me over a decade ago. The jarring aspect here is that the writer, while clearly amateur, effectively engages players' emotions and investments in the world and characters. When the storytelling is sincere and heartfelt, it fosters a deep connection to the game's universe.\n\n[h1]Technical Issues and Bugs[/h1]\n[u]Specs: RTX 3080, Ryzen 3700x, 16GB RAM, 1440p[/u]\n\nThe game maintains a consistent level of polish from start to finish. While it's not without some rough edges, I encountered no issues that hindered my overall enjoyment.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Visual[/h1]\n\nAstlibra's graphics appear to be stitched together from diverse assets created by different artists. Some areas, especially in the early game and the main hub, look somewhat rough. However, the game manages to establish a unique aesthetic that's unmistakably Astlibra. At the very least, the blocky terrain and square caves and mountains serve their utilitarian purpose. Occasionally, when everything aligns just right, the backgrounds can be visually stunning.\n\nCredit is due to the developer for enlisting the talents of Shigatake, the character designer from Vanillaware, to enhance the portraits and sprites of various characters. The visibility of equipped gear also contributes to the game's coolness factor.\n\n[h1]Audio and Music[/h1]\n\nThe game boasts over 130 tracks sourced from various origins, both free and paid. Surprisingly, they blend seamlessly within the game, with some tracks being particularly impressive. Given the sheer number of tracks, each locale, dungeon, and boss fight has its own unique theme that complements the mood perfectly. On the other hand, the sound effects serve a utilitarian role, indicating the success of a block, a successful hit, and telegraphing enemy attacks.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAstlibra is a labor of love crafted by developer KEIZO, a project spanning 14 years. This dedication and struggle are evident in the game's creation. Like homemade cookies from a dearly beloved, it may be a bit uneven and blemished in places, but it's something you can wholeheartedly enjoy. Astlibra is a form of art that resonated with me at the right time, and I'm likely to fondly remember it for the rest of my life.", "timestamp_created": 1698586302, "timestamp_updated": 1698586594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584233403205871582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149126571": {"recommendationid": "149126571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069755486", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3378, "last_played": 1698585938}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible from start to finish.\n", "timestamp_created": 1698586128, "timestamp_updated": 1698586128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149101252": {"recommendationid": "149101252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039732833", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4953, "last_played": 1698555835}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

story seems to do time travelling story telling decently well.\n\nMain complaints, in repeated reloads of areas, glitches can occur, this is unlikely to be seen as a casual player, but as i was playing impossible I died a lot, which lead to boss sprite sheets being visible, sometimes the floor disappeared and one time an enemy appeared fragmented.\nOtherwise, some enemies tells are a little odd/ some enemies just instastrike which can cause issues, enemies hide attacks behind their sprite which causes issues when trying to survive and some attacks look like other attacks, but carry slightly different properties such as a lasting damage area.\nLastly the final gatcha achievement is broken, I tried various times to get it in multiple ways, and each way was refused.\n\nDespite all these issues I do recommend the game, just be warned some enemies are visually questionable, its not persona Mara bad, but its closer to castlevania bad, if not slightly worse (as noted by the achievement: Stronger than an M-Shaped Spread Legs).", "timestamp_created": 1698043580, "timestamp_updated": 1698043580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

With that said however I just wanted to write a review to point out to anyone considering buying this game who doesn\u2019t enjoy the demo that I also didn\u2019t really enjoy the demo, and yet I absolutely love the game. The demo tries to give you an idea of what it feels like to play once you\u2019re unlocked all the skills and are really powerful. For me what this ended up doing was showing a cluttered screen with lots of numbers and explosions but little understanding on my part as to *why* the numbers worked. It felt\u2026 clunky, and not as engaging as I\u2019d hoped. \n\nHowever the other reviews were talking about the game in ways that made me feel that this game is right up my alley. I took a risk and purchased it, and I\u2019m so glad I did. The game builds naturally, understandably, and in a very fun way as you play it. This made it so much more enjoyable to me: suddenly a new ability makes sense, a new weapon is exciting, and the growing power fantasy of the game is incredibly fun. It was everything I was hoping for, and I\u2019m thankful I took the jump. \n\nThe game is excellent. Almost bizarrely good. Plays excellently on Steamdeck (in the in-game options I had to change the Sound API to Direct Sound to avoid crackling, but that solved the problem entirely), and the story is actually legitimately good.

Though, fairly, that's also your fault for filling the screen with clutter before you knew what was coming~.\n\nYou're doing yourself a favor by picking it up and playing it.

I can put up with my fair share of anime cringe, Neon White was unironically GOTY, but there's a line man. Once you get to chapter... I believe it's 5, the game just starts getting overtly sexual in a way that's more than a bit uncomfortable. The big tiddy anime girl goddess(es) were one thing, the wink-wink-nudge-nudge 'one bed' bit was pushing it, the lesbians who are only lesbian to talk about fucking was a bit much for my taste, forcing the sorceress character to parade around in lingerie (something she explicitly doesn't want to do) is where it started to feel unforgivably gross, and following up by having her be told by the leads that she got blackout drunk and started stripping for the town is where I decided I wasn't recommending this game to human people. \n\nThe worst of it is that it comes (almost, there had been a few sex jokes before that) out of nowhere so far into the game. If this is where you're going, you've gotta frontload it a bit so people aren't getting to that point then being annoyed with the content.

Seriously.\n\nLong Review: I was honestly skeptical when I first saw the reviews. A game with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating and everyone dropping GOTY comments and some people saying it's on par with Zelda TotK. That's HIGH PRAISE. I've had this sitting in my library for a while and decided to finally boot it up. I wish I had played this last year! It's easily going to go down as one of the best indie games I've ever played.\n\nThe story is phenomenally well written, but I HIGHLY suggest playing the demo first, as there's a story element you get from it that gives context to the actual start of the game that I think without it, the prison world the protagonist is in is more confusing. I have been super engrossed in this character's plight to release themselves from this consciousness prison they found themselves in and it gives huge Matrix vibes.\n\nThe combat is just downright genius. It's super fast paced and still quite simple, but the genius lies in the gear mastery system. There's an insane number of weapons, armor, and shields you have to master in order to gain a permanent upgrade to your character. This means you're constantly changing out your gear and trying new builds. It keeps things feeling immensely refreshed and the differences between the gear make subtle changes to how you have to approach combat. I love this and wish Dark Souls games used this system.\n\nBoss battles are absolutely magnificent, right from the get go. You jump right into battles with gods, dragons, and mega demons, instead of having to face small-time bosses. The game makes you think it's going to be that way though, before completely subverting your expectations. The designer of this game really understands that players want COOL experiences and they sure as heck deliver.\n\nI actually find the graphics quite appealing. They're kind of painterly and surreal. I honestly have been surprised because screenshots really don't do it justice. Places like the main town you get to are quite beautiful and well designed.\n\nI cannot understate how incredible this game is. I know it has like 20,000 reviews, but this seriously has to be one of the biggest sleeper games of all time, if not the #1. Anyone who's had the opportunity to play this game should consider themselves lucky.

Astlibra Revision is a revamped version of said game, worth every penny.\n\nAlthough graphically offputting at first, the polish of the game is felt through every fast paced action you take. The music, although from a free sound library, is simply amazing and well-picked for each moment of the game, and the ammount of content, including side quests, secret bosses and dungeons, rivals some of the classics.\n\nGameplay is essentialy a 2D Action platformer moreso than a Metroidvania, although some exploration and backtracking is expected for secrets and completion. You level up and invest resources to upgrade your weapons and skills, and your equipment also gains experience, which in turn lets you learn the abilities that otherwise you can only use while keeping it equiped.\n\nThe story is also quite good. The writing isn't stellar and can be quite tropey, full of classic anime tropes and lewdness here and there, but it's also good and sentimental enough for you to want to keep playing just to see what happens next, with stakes upping during the mid and final portions of the game.\n\nOn the negative side, it has some jank and occasional bugs, but nothing game breaking. Menus can be clunky to use, and the aftermentioned fanservice/lewdness can get in the way and create some awkward moments, but none of this detracts from the amazing experience Astlibra gives.",

What matter is timing and mixing up your attack.\n* Timed blocking: You have a shield, use it. Even bosses' attacks can be blocked perfectly. But being passive and hiding behind your shield means becoming a sitting duck. Your stamina is limited. You can't keep blocking indefinitely.\n* Special attack: Normal attack fills up a gauge that can be used for a wide range of special attacks with devastating damage.\n   It starts with holding a button, inputting a fighting game style sequence of directional keys (e.g: down up) and releasing the previous button.\n   You would summon and sometimes transform into Final Fantasy style GF spirits.\n   They also grant you a short period of invincibility.\n   The best defense is a well timed offense.\n   You can negate a bunch of hard to dodge, costly to block attacks by a timely special.\n   Which brings us to:\n* Counter attack. Block an attack and immediately counter also grant you invincibility frames.\n   This is a key to get through some seemingly impenetrable defenses.\n   It feels amazing to execute that perfect sequence of blocking, counter attack then special, throwing a bunch of numbers up while dashing through a flurry of threats being thrown at you.\n\nNot only that, the battle system is supported by:\n\n* A host of varied craftable weapons and equipment each with their own play style.\n* Weapon mastery can give you a bunch of useful passive skills.\n* A skill tree system that looks more like a skill maze.\n\nIt may sound like there is a lot of grinding but there isn't.\nEven on hell difficulty (the second highest), I never had to grind.\nJust exploring, walking from one objective point to other, killing everything on the way is enough to get through the game.\nNot just that, before boss fights, the game always let you respec your stats for **free** so you can tinker with your build to find the best way to tackle a boss battle.\nYou are never trapped in an invalid build, making you grind to make up for it.\nThere are respec potions but I never had to use them since the game is so generous with respec points.\n\nAlso, the mixtape (music) is fire. Even in the beginning when you only have a tree branch to hit some slime, the music goes hard.\nIt makes me want to be a JRPG heroes and save them waifus.\n\nCons:\n\n* The dialogue is kinda silly. Jokes are sometimes made in serious scenes that just breaks the mood and then characters went serious again.\n* The story is pretty cliched so far. A do gooder, self sacrificing hero with insane strength (you) trying to save everyone with the power of friendship.\n\nIf you do play, I recommend starting with Hell and lower it to Hard if it's too challenging or your progression is too slow.\nAt certain point in the game, you can't raise it up to Hell again.\nOn hard, the game is moderately challenging, you do die often if you are careless.\nIn difficulty below Hell (second highest), the game pauses when you are inputting your fighting game style button sequence for your special attack. It makes timing a lot easier and forgiving.\nIn Hell and above, there are no more pauses. You have to perfectly master those timings. It feels good to do the same damage cancelling sequence said above in real time, dodging death by a hairline.\nHowever, I admit I'm getting old and my progression in Hell is too slow since I have to keep retrying the same path and bosses.\nI dropped to Hard later and the game is enjoyable so far.", "timestamp_created": 1694112142, "timestamp_updated": 1694112645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145862719": {"recommendationid": "145862719", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983239974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1691261772}, "language": "english", "review": "This game absolutely sucks.

The art is good, the combat feels fluid, [spoiler] well as long as you have enough agility lol [/spoiler] the art is great, and the story is really something to behold. I want whatever the dev was smoking when they made this plotline because it's fantastic but makes no sense if you try to describe it to someone. Just when you think you're finally going to get to the conclusion, it goes insane-o mode and really sucks you in (spent like 3 straight nights playing it trying to finish only to find out there's still more story).\n\nI think the endgame is where this stuff really shines. You feel as powerful as the game says you are at that point, and the big completionist style rewards are surprisingly achievable. Sure there's some tough spots at the end, but beating a boss is less about \"git gud\" and more playing around their patterns and knowing your toolkit. If something feels too hard, chances are there's some skill/item you've overlooked or haven't unlocked that'll put the boss to bed.\n\nThe progression system is also really nice.

ASTLIBRA Revision is one of the most unique games I've played in recent memory. It is a strange frankenstein of a game that manages to be so much more than the sum of its parts. It's paradoxical, a game which uses assets from countless sources strongly coalesces them into its own artistic style. Royalty free music, assets that I've certainly seen in RPGMaker games, the game is stitched together from a thousand different places. I feel a strange nostalgia for this, as though it was a browser game from an online ecosystem which hasn't existed since the early 2010s. In that sense it's almost a period piece, but I digress. \n\nI see a lot of praise for the story, yet it's similarly chimeric, for better and for worse. On the surface, it's a large pot of generic Anime Fantasy tropes; an adventurer's guild, a demon king, a nameless self-insert protagonist, (and a lot of crossdressing). Some people may not have the same level of tolerance for that sort of thing, but if you're seriously considering a game that looks like this from the outset, you've probably got that under control. All of this belies the fact that the story is well-paced; Almost episodic in nature, yet with each chapter effectively building towards successively larger climaxes and reveals. Tropes are tools, and even if the fantasy anime toolbox is well-worn at this point, this story uses them better than I could ask for. \n\nAs for the gameplay, it's quite solid and straightforward, once one understands the meaning behind each of the menus. There's about 4 and a half systems for improving your character, but there's really only one style of gameplay- sword, shield, and the occassional spell. 'Action-RPG' is a nebulously defined genre, but this feels like the platonic ideal of it; Combat's fast-paced and relatively snappy, yet the character building is consequential. Aside from that, everything else is pretty self-expanatory. (Thank goodness for that, this game's only wiki is in Japanese.)\n\nI cannot stop thinking about this game.

I understood from the footage this was a low $ type of game but the encouragement from the positive reviews made me think there was good combat and a different and interesting story. What I found was frustrating gameplay (combat) and only a mediocre story that for me, was pretty slow to unfold and had some pretty readable twists (although one I was not expecting in chpt 4). After lots of frustration with the combat, frustration with lack of info in game about how to proceed in certain areas (i.e. you need to unlock an invincible jump move prior to progressing at one point) and lack of any character connection with the story or really more than just passing interest in what was going to happen next, I gave up. I believe a lot of the positive reviews stem from people desperate from an old-school ARPG in the vein of Castlevania (although this one has a different combat than that and made me think of Trails of series from all the gemstone explosions in loot). If you want something janky that scratches that itch, then I guess this game may be up your alley but for me I can't recommend.\n\nGameplay: This is a combat-focused game interspersed with narrative scenes. You will be platforming (which I didn't care for in this setting) but mostly focused on slaughtering tons of enemies to earn gems to help you power up your character and hoping for some rare loot drops and component drops to help you purchase (although it's a light forging system) better equipment. I respect those who wanted to master this system as it does have some depth to it, but for me it was missing some QOL (like ability to zoom out of the skill tree and see the different routes and abilities/skills you could learn) and was very repetitive in a button mashing way in game, with some instances that casting a spell was useful. It was not my cup of tea. 3/5.\nStory: I only got through chapter 4 in terms of the story. You have a brief cut scene that sets that stage for our amnesiac and silent protagonist with the only thing he remembers and the talking crow, Karon, that accompanies him. There are a few side characters and temporary characters that accompany you on your quests, but I did not find them very well interesting in the 7 hours I played. Perhaps the story gets better from here, but there wasn't much drawing me in and I felt no connection to any of the characters and only mildly interested in Karon. 3/5.\nMusic: If you want some electric guitar (which is my jam) get ready for a lot of it. Very generic guitar wailing during your action scenes and slower music during the rest of the time all fairly forgettable. 2/5.\nGraphics: You can tell from the trailer what you're getting, fairly cheap graphics but considering it was a small team putting this together you can't expect much. While not a graphic issue per se, I found the level layouts to be very bland, but they do differentiate each chapter with different areas although you'll be running back and forth within an area quite often. I didn't care for the aesthetic and especially didn't like how ridiculously huge your weapons were compared to the character's size, but to each their own. 2/5.\nFun-factor: From nearly the beginning this was a grind. I had to look up some guides to get started as the in-game instruction only gets you so far. one particularly grueling platforming section made me so frustrated until I finally found a walk through showing that you had to unlock a specific ability prior to progressing - something that the game doesn't indicate for you as it seems to tell you to explore your builds, but really you do need to obtain certain abilities in linear progression based fashion (double jump, invincible jump, etc). Stuff like this really soured my enjoyment of the game and made a lot of it more of a job to figure out exactly where you're meant to go next as I had assumed that I was at an impassable point and tried running through the levels multiple times to see if I had missed something. 2/5.\nOverall: If this game looks like your jam, more power to you. If you're on the fence and think the overwhelming positive reviews are enough to sway you (like they did me) I'd just check out a few more walk through videos to see exactly what you're getting into before you get this.

I came into this game knowing basically nothing, it was just this interesting-looking side scroller that was highly rated that I bought on sale. And here I am almost 70 hours later, absolutely blown away at the end of it all. So, let me shill this game and talk a little more about it.\n\nOverall: 9/10\n- This game is not perfect, and has its flaws, but I believe it is very worth giving a shot if you enjoy action games, JRPGs, metroidvanias, etc. There is even a demo to play to give it a shot, although the demo throws so much at you at once, I honestly think it's better to just jump straight into the game itself. There is a lot of information and systems to understand, and its definitely digestible in context of the game and story, but not so much all-at-once. Also this is my score on my feeling for the overall game, I'm not averaging my scores based on some individual sections.\n\nStory: 9.5/10\nI was shocked at the story of this game. I really did not see a lot of what happened over the course of the game coming. There are times that get a little uncomfortable because of over-done fanservice and some of the character writing, but overall it's insignificant compared to the twists and turns and genuinely interesting paths the story takes (I really would go more into it, but I don't want to spoil). Seeing the story through to the post-game end was very satisfying, and I would definitely recommend even to those who may be hesitant based on how the game looks or even if they did not enjoy the combat as much. \n\nVisuals: 7.5/10\nAstLibra Revision is an odd-looking side scroller at first glance. The character models sort of float in front of the backgrounds as these very clear 2D images and the combat animations are also nothing to write home about. As you progress in the game as well you will notice that there are a significant amount of enemies with very horny designs as well, which also made me uncomfortable at times. Overall, however, the art design and direction for many of the bosses, weapons, armors, etc. impressed me and were very detailed. I think the visuals are the weakest part about this game, especially if you aren't into the fan service, but not a deal-breaker by any means.\n\nMusic & Sound: 8/10\nThere are genuinely some bangers in the ost 100%. However, songs will loop quite a bit in the sections of the game that they play in enough that you may get a little tired of them, so it's not perfect. Music most of the time was nice and added to the atmosphere to some story scenes significantly. Besides the music, most of the time you'll be hearing the combat sounds over everything else, and it can definitely get loud at times compared to the rest of the game. There are also quite a few re-used sound effects between bosses, magic, and many of the weapons sound the same as well. Can get a bit repetitive, but I still liked it even at the end of the game.\n\nCombat: 9/10\nI think this is the biggest love it or hate it part of the game. I think to enjoy the game overall, it's important to enjoy the combat as it is the biggest portion of it. Weird hitboxes on attacks and the absolute reliance on magic to help invulnerability yourself through some genuinely stupid attacks during fights are my only real complaints. The weight system is interesting because as you progress in the game, weapons get heavier and heavier, and you need to level agility to be able to move and wield them with any sufficiency at all. High-weight combat is worse than fat-rolling in souls-likes because you cant even swing your weapon, you're just locked into the animations as they slowly roll through. However, if you get your weight to 0 (which I HIGHLY recommend) you are machine-gunning attacks and building your magic gauge incredibly fast so you become a dps god and can focus more attention on the rest of the fight. Magic and abilities are also incredibly important, but many of these are earned through a progression grid or mastering weapons & equipment, so the game can feel a bit grindy sometimes. Combat itself is very simple, but there are several systems at play, so there is a satisfying amount of prep-work and builds you can put together for different fights. I had a ton of fun with the combat, and while it does take some getting used to, I think it would appeal to many action game fans.\n\nPerformance: 8/10\nThis game is not very intensive and usually runs pretty smooth, but there are times in combat that there is genuine game lag when there is a lot happening. The entire game just slows down briefly when it happens, but I never experienced any crashing or performance spikes on my computer. It's there and noticeable when it does happen, but it didn't really impact my experience with the game.

At minimum these skills should be able to be *toggled* on or off as far as if they can activate or not. Holding down is also block, which you *can* do mid-air, so it becomes impossible to do so without also activating the other thing. Really, reaaaaaaalllyy clunky.\n\nThe enemy telegraphs, hit boxes, etc., are pretty rough. Enemies get stuck in walls, treasures fall where you can't reach them, screens don't move with you and you get stuck, lots of quirky engine stuff. None of it was game stopping, but several of them could be - and there's no autosave, so you could really get screwed by that. Several parts of the game are also needlessly obtuse - solution to X puzzle is right in front of you, you understand it, but you didn't talk to random NPC *three* times before attempting to solve it, so you can't solve it and are confused. Enemy attacks will clip through terrain - yours don't usually. Some abilities do more harm than good. Block and counter damage? Great, but then you get no iframes after the attack and are in the middle of the enemy that you just blocked the attack of and thus take damage, making it usually useless if not downright detrimental to use. Stuff like that. \n\nThe writing is pretty stiff to say the least, it definitely exudes the translated vibe. A proper, localized pass with some better writing for the characters' voices and all would go so very far. The story is actually not too bad and has some interesting beats (though also some pretty cringe-y ones, especially those dealing with suggestive situations or female characters), but the writing pulls a good bit of the punch it could otherwise have.\n\nAlmost every single chapter starts to feel same-y - go in, story/fight to a midpoint, story/fight, boss, return. This doesn't feel too bad except that many of the materials you need to craft new gear, and obtain most your abilities, only comes from the *second* half of each chapter.. ergo the obvious way to play is to rush the first part and grind the second. It makes it feel a bit too rigid and predictable. Having actual enemy variety, discover-ability and such would go far.\n\nAll that said, it has a good bit going for it, the gameplay and combat are decent once you get a feel for it, and I liked all the unlockables based on gear and whatnot. Later in some of the enemies and areas get pretty cheap and thus can be a bit frustrating. The \"XP\" system is neat as far as having a huge pseudo-passive tree with interesting-ish unlockables strewn about (handful of abilities, special gear, etc.) The point-type system for setting abilities unlocked from gear is solid.\n\nI can see the \"diamond in the rough\" that the game seems to be regarded most for but I'd almost say it's more of a *rough* diamond in the rough. The edges are fuzzy for sure - with polish I think it'd still be a little off feeling, with polish *and* better writing it could really knock it out of the park.\n\nUltimately, though, mostly positive, but much of the roughness shines through a bit too brightly to be ignored, especially with many of the other systems have their own roughness or shortcomings.\n\nedit: I will say, as a tack-on thought, the post game is shockingly good - frankly it should've been rolled into the whole game. The board system and such adds a neat level of depth/variety for gear, whereas throughout the game proper otherwise you just unlock skills and then use the strongest, there's not much reason to choose or vary. Also the story doesn't feel \"post-game-y\" at all, they really should've just added it as a few extra chapters to expand the original parts! I'm also very relieved it's not just a standard \"new game+ do it again for some reason with nothing new\", so really great job there.\n\nedit edit: Sadly the last boss of the most game is really awful. WAY too much garbage on screen, your summons cover up projectiles, attacks are random and not patterned in a way that you can learn/improve, and every hit does way more damage than any other boss/enemy leading up to it, dead in 2-hits at most with three spews of projectiles covering the screen at most points.. It's weird because most bosses up to this point were similarly badly telegraphed and all but the damage was low enough that you could work through it. Quite a buzzkill, really, as the writing being awkward doesn't make me want to run around grinding for hours just to see it.", "timestamp_created": 1691566563, "timestamp_updated": 1692166060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143692507": {"recommendationid": "143692507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005700188", "num_games_owned": 737, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 1808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1693445077}, "language": "english", "review": "Really addicting gameplay, kind of reminds me of a Vanillaware game.", "timestamp_created": 1691549430, "timestamp_updated": 1691655289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143670429": {"recommendationid": "143670429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122476060", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4786, "last_played": 1692083465}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10", "timestamp_created": 1691519566, "timestamp_updated": 1691519566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143598250": {"recommendationid": "143598250", "author": {"steamid": "76561199171796087", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4601, "last_played": 1691425419}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1691425484, "timestamp_updated": 1691425484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143580759": {"recommendationid": "143580759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060084148", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4007, "last_played": 1691404540}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10.

And man was I blown away. I do not usually review games - I just play them and move on - but man this is different. \n\nThe screenshots, previews, and the demo that comes with the game understandably temper your expectations. The backgrounds and environments are off-putting the first time you see them. And the combat feels stiff.

With Astlibra, you charge into the fray of battle, execute combos, and devastate your opponents with combos and magic. It's all so satisfying. \n\nAnd the graphics grow on you. They mesh perfectly with the combat and magic graphics. Some of the animations for the gods and mechs look surreal. \n\nThe design Keizo implemented into the game encourages grinding and fighting. He wants you to battle and enjoy yourself. And you are rewarded for it!  You get crafting items, and a multitude of other types of experience to grow and power up your character - and it all feels so intuitive.  Nothing is hidden, and you always feel rewarded for your time commitment. \n\nThe storyline is probably the most unique narrative I have come across in a long time. it starts our so simple, so that you (the player) are not expecting much. But layers and layers keep getting added on, and when they all come  together, you are taken aback - you simply are not expecting the plot twists. And the ending ties up all the loose ends perfectly. Others have mentioned that you can't go into the storyline much without giving too much away, and i agree. You should experience it for yourself. I will say this, though, that crow is my ultimate bro. \n\nIf you are a fan of action RPGs, or RPGs in general, or if you grew up during the 90s and 2000s with RPGs like Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, or maybe even Ragnarok Online, play this game. You will have a blast. \n\nKeizo, if you are reading this, you are the man. This man spent a decade creating a game that feels so good to play - a game that looks and feels like it knows exactly what it wants to be.

So it is slightly below average. \n\nSince this game tooks 15 years to make, there was a continuous shift in developer's perspective that is reflected in the game design. \n- Chapter 1 - 3: Early stage of development. The dev is obviously a avid gamer. So the boss battles were challenging, and but quite fair. \n- Chapter 4-6: Middle stage of development. The game has become more balanced. There are various moment of levity in between serious moments. The humor is somewhat awkward, but at a same time very endearing.  This is my favorite segments of the game in term of both story and game play. \n- Chapter 7-8: Late stage of development. Like his peers, the dev has been successfully gas lighted by FromSoft into thinking that gaming supposed to hard. But just like peers who have tried and failed at imitation, the end result is a discombobulated mess. In late game, despite having good gears, you will be two-shot and one-shot left and right by normal enemies. Boss battle requires check point run-a hallmark of time wasting feature. Every screen will be littered with projectiles that are obscured by particle effect of your own attacks. \n\nThe good: \n- The story is engaging. All characters are likable. \n\nThe bad: \n- Grindy combat. Mini/chapters boss should drops silver/gold chest \n- Half of gears do no offer special ability. And you do not know in advance which one to buy. To equip the ability you need to grind for efficiency. FFIX does this system much better (in 2000) \n- The grow tree is another convoluted maze, without allowing you to progress in the direction you want. There should be only possession skills here to unlock.\n- The dialogues and cut screens are deliberately slow to stretch out the story. \n- Dubious puzzles that grind the progress to a halt. \n\nThe ugly \n- Late game goes out of it way to annoy the player for the sake of artificial difficulty.  \n\nMy recommendation: \n- There are games out there that respect your time. \n- Only buy with deep sale if you have to.", "timestamp_created": 1691146383, "timestamp_updated": 1691146383, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497855603694915771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143301409": {"recommendationid": "143301409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169264027", "num_games_owned": 481, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 4598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4598, "last_played": 1691036905}, "language": "english", "review": "Addicting action RPG game that is way better than it looks.

Its an action JRPG/platformer with all of its standard fare, but with the added bonus of everything being really well done, having good gameplay mechanics, an amazing soundtrack, and a fantastic story to keep you immersed in the game.\n\nThe game is an action JRPG, so nothing turn-based about the gameplay. The action is smooth and really fine-tuned, at least in my opinion, and that becomes especially apparent as you grind and raise your stats. One part of the game has some elements in it that are added to the existing game later on and it opens up the possibilities for all manner of grinding and stat min-maxing. The weapons handle different and weight will determine how fast or slow you go with a weapon based on what type of weapon it is (some weapons are slower than others, and some are really fast). Weapon range and handling also play a factor in how well a fight goes. On top of this, there is a growth tree that can up you stats and give you summoning skills that are really helpful through out the game (and some are so helpful that they are on par with the most powerful summons you can obtain). On top of all of that, there is the Libra system where you can put items on a scale that gives you even more stats or resistances and even allow for more money/force (used in the growth tree)/experience gain. Balancing it perfectly allows you to get the stat boosts and such from both sides of the scale without them being diminished on one side versus the other. \n\nThe weapons, armors, and shields are all items that you can play with and level which will net you either some new abilities that you can select later or magic crystals that will allow you to equip said abilities if you are not using the item in question. If you equip the item with an ability, you can choose to equip that ability with no extra cost to your magic crystal pool, which is a great way to maximize your usage of abilities to their fullest. Accessories do not come with any leveling mechanic so they are static (at least until the latter half of the game). There is also a new customization mechanic later in the game that will enhance weapons, armors, shields, and accessories that can not only up the stats of everything, but allow for changes to abilities or adding new stats, which was a interesting answer to the usual \"I've grinded all the stuff, now what?\" question and even attachments that can be added to them (although most of it comes with RNG, so there is a reason to continue grinding to get the best stuff). \n\nThe story itself is absolutely wonderful, well written, and executed so well done that it ties up all manner of loop-holes very well, including ones that you didn't even know it had (or forgot about which is a phenomenal surprise when you realize some things later on or remember certain characters). It has its tense moments, which are assisted by the gameplay obviously, its funny moments, its sad moments, and some of the twists you don't completely see coming either. It does well in foreshadowing some events and even some inconsequential story pieces end up showing up when you least expect it, There are some things that are predictable and, again, this is a JRPG so it has many of the staples embedded in the story, but it works in its favor rather than to its determent, or at least I think so. \n\nIts been a while since I've played another game as enjoyable as this one.

It seems that the \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" reviews and the absurdly high number (~33%) of all players that got the \"True Ending\" are for a reason, after all.\n\nWhen I first saw the game, I thought it looked ugly and that the gameplay looked boring. I could not be happier to have been wrong, as it ended up being a fantastic game. The story was great - full of twists and turns, insanely increasing stakes and comedic relief. The gameplay was surprisingly fun - fluid and responsive with lots of different abilities to master and press. There is a giant skill grid called \"Grow\" in addition to a traditional leveling system and an armor/weapon/shield mastery system that also unlocks various skills (\"KARON\"). There is blocking, and i-frame dodging (\"Backstep\") and i-frame magic to avoid damage or even heal.\n\nAs it turns out, the reason for both the initial off-putting impression and it actually being really good is that it was made by a single developer over the course of 15 years; a mixture of extremely limited resources/budget and it apparently being something he really wanted to make; something he himself wanted to play -- a rarity in a world where games are made by a boardroom decreeing they want yet another seven Assassin's Creed games being made simultaneously.\n\nI would not really advise playing on the highest difficulty as all it really does is extend grinding periods, but you can freely change it for the duration of the first chapter so you can easily see for yourself. Hard difficulty is probably the best balance between grinding and being a completionist.\n\nAn amazing one-man accomplishment, for sure. \n\n\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046KEIZO\u3055\u307e\u3002\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1690597989, "timestamp_updated": 1691299197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142982203": {"recommendationid": "142982203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198863283765", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5082, "last_played": 1691010258}, "language": "english", "review": "This games been fun but the end(I think) is just really dragging.

Eso s\u00ed, a\u00f1adir que me ha atrapado y tiene varios giritos que no me he visto venir... y alg\u00fan que otro clich\u00e9 de anime trillad\u00edsimo de hace 15 a\u00f1os.\nEn total me ha durado unas casi 40 horas y ahora ando d\u00e1ndole ca\u00f1a al postgame (c\u00f3mo comento m\u00e1s abajo, es bastante lineal aunque tiene sus secretillos en forma de mazmorras ocultas con su recompensa y un coliseo). Ni se os ocurra darle carpetazo en cuanto veais los cr\u00e9ditos, este juego tiene postgame y muy elaborado (o dadle carpetazo, no soy qui\u00e9n para deciros a qu\u00e9 ten\u00e9is que jugar).\n\n\n[b] - Gr\u00e1ficos: [/b] Los fondos y escenarios te pueden parecer horribles o te pueden parecer que tienen su encanto, pero no hay punto medio (en lo personal me decanto por lo segundo). Por otro lado, el dise\u00f1o de personajes y las ilustraciones me parecen bastante buenos (eso s\u00ed, no jugu\u00e9is con la puerta abierta que hay alg\u00fan que otro dise\u00f1o con \"jiggle physics\"... Efectivamente, en un juego 2D) e incluso el artista de Vanillaware ha participado en alguno de estos.\n\n\n[b] - M\u00fasica: [/b] Excelente OST que me ha recordado bastante a la m\u00fasica de la saga YS. Mi tema favorito es el que suena en la mazmorra del volc\u00e1n, que si hab\u00e9is jugado a [i] YS: The Oath in Felghana [/i] sabr\u00e9is que por norma general, las m\u00fasicas de las mazmorras en un volc\u00e1n tienen que ser lo m\u00e1s ca\u00f1ero habido y por haber.\n\n\n[b] - Gameplay: [/b] Dejo esto para el final porque aqu\u00ed hay mucha chicha que cortar. Que no te enga\u00f1en esos fondos y esos assets gratuitos que se usan en el apartado gr\u00e1fico porque en el gameplay se nota ese mimo y pulido que le ha dado KEIZO durante esos 15 a\u00f1os (bueno y en la historia).\n\nA grandes rasgos, es un Action RPG de scroll lateral con un desarrollo bastante lineal. La trama se divide en cap\u00edtulos (es un puntazo que cuando empiezas un nuevo cap\u00edtulo se muestra el opening del juego, como si estuvieramos viendo un anime) y son bastante directos (sin misiones secundarias de comprar ajos tan de moda en los Triple A ni historias. Aqu\u00ed hemos venido a hacer nuestras cosas de protagonista rubio de shonen y a darnos guarrazos con lo que se nos ponga por delante). Una vez finalizado el cap\u00edtulo, puedes volver a la zona por si te has dejado algo (porque hay muchos secretos y cofres puestos de manera muy pu\u00f1etera que cuesta verlos). Tambi\u00e9n a\u00f1adir que hay un coleccionable que son unas medallitas que utilizas en una m\u00e1quina Gacha y te van dando cosas cuando las usas en la m\u00e1quina (y no, lo que te dan no es aleatorio, va siguiendo un orden establecido).\n\nEn cuanto al combate es bastante sencillo: tenemos un bot\u00f3n para dar guantazos (que dependiendo de la direcci\u00f3n a la que apuntemos y del tipo de arma que llevemos, haremos un combo u otro), un bot\u00f3n para lanzar magia (lo mantendremos pulsado y haremos una combinaci\u00f3n de dos flechas para lanzar la magia de un elemento u otro), uno de defenderte (gastando la barra de parada del escudo que lleves equipado, luego se recarga. Si llevas un arma de dos manos, pues te la paras con el pecho) y un dash para esquivar con un peque\u00f1o cooldown. Conforme vas jugando, vas aprendiendo m\u00e1s t\u00e9cnicas.\n\nY ahora es cuando llega la madre del cordero, la cerecita en lo alto del pastel, la punta del iceberg, la... personalizaci\u00f3n del personaje. Tenemos varias capas, por un lado est\u00e1 la t\u00edpica subida de nivel en la que te puedes asignar 5 puntos al stat que quieras (no te preocupes si te equivocas que los puedes redistribuir sin penalizaci\u00f3n en las tiendas o consumiendo una poci\u00f3n en cualquier lado). Luego tenemos algo similar al tablero de esferas del [i] Final Fantasy X [/i] en las que gastas unos puntos que te dan al matar enemigos en subirte un stat concreto (adem\u00e1s de que las magias se aprenden en este tablero) formando un caminito. Luego (venga, que ya queda poco) tenemos las habilidades de las piezas de equipo, que si hab\u00e9is jugado a [i] Final Fantasy IX [/i] o a [i] Tales of Vesperia [/i] os pod\u00e9is hacer una idea de c\u00f3mo va la cosa... En caso contrario comentar que al matar enemigos, tus piezas de equipo (el arma, el escudo en caso de llevar y la armadura) van ganando experiencia hasta llegar al tope, en ese momento aprendr\u00e1s una habilidad pasiva (o ganar\u00e1s un cristal m\u00e1gico... Luego llego a eso) que puedes activar sin coste alguno mientras tienes esa pieza equipada o, en caso de no tenerla equipada, la puedes activar gastando X cantidad de cristales m\u00e1gicos (al desactivarla se te devuelven). Por \u00faltimo (y no por ello menos importante) tenemos la balanza, en la que ponemos dos objetos en cada extremo y nos proporcionan varias ventajas... pero tiene su miga, por ejemplo, no se puede acumular la misma ventaja del mismo nivel pero s\u00ed la misma ventaja con dos niveles diferentes (igual aqu\u00ed me he explicado como el ojete, pero lo entender\u00e9is cu\u00e1ndo lo ve\u00e1is en el juego) y los platos de la balanza tienen que estar equilibrados para que las mejoras sean m\u00e1s efectivar.\n\nY hasta aqu\u00ed todo lo relacionado con la personaliz... Ah no, calla, que en el postgame se a\u00f1aden TODAV\u00cdA M\u00c1S COSAS (que no voy a explicar, ya lo ver\u00e9is).\n\n\n[b] - Otros: [/b] Comentar que en la ciudad principal hay un coliseo y eso, en esta casa, autom\u00e1ticamente le da a un juego 11 puntos sobre 10.\n\nNada m\u00e1s que a\u00f1adir... Bueno s\u00ed, dos cosas: La primera que me lo he jugado en la Steam Deck de principio a fin y tanto en modo port\u00e1til como conectado al monitor se juega de esc\u00e1ndalo sin toquetear nada y la segunda es que si os ha gustado lo que he comentado ten\u00e9is una demo en la p\u00e1gina de la tienda dividida en dos partes, una en la que est\u00e1s al nivel 50 con varias piezas de equipo y habilidades para que puedas probar el combate avanzado (y ojo, que tiene su mini historia) y otra con un cachito del principio del juego (no s\u00e9 si puedes pasar la partida luego).\n\nY ahora s\u00ed, ya me callo que seguro que tienes mejores cosas que hacer que leer la review de un tipo random al que le ha gustado este juego...

It's a sidescrolling 2D RPG (Think Metroidvania with less focus on exploration) with a very cool skill and combat system. Using your partner to use \"possession skills\" you can summon or transform into various spirits of different elements using a very intuitive casting system (almost like fighting game inputs rather than menu navigation), in addition to your weapons, armors, and shields teaching you passive skills (similar to Final Fantasy IX) and a MASSIVE skill tree to increase your stats and learn new spells. \n\nIt's also quite long, often with a \"just when you think you're done, there's a new arc of the story\" factor that feels great. Playing on Hard is a good balance of difficulty, and it's not particularly grindy. With optional bosses, lots of completionist achievements, and postgame methods of improving your character and gear, you'll be fully occupied all the way to the end.\n\nThe story is actually pretty good too. A lot of twists, turns, drama, and comic relief, none of which overstays its welcome. There is some time travel in the plot so as you can expect things get pretty crazy, but it's never convoluted or hard to follow. \n\nThe only cons I can really give are bugs so minor as to be negligible (a certain achievement not unlocking until a complete game restart for instance) some translational errors (to instead of too) and in my opinion some of the terrain construction looks a bit odd with how tiles match up. None of this is so obvious or egregious as to be distracting from the overall quality but I would be remiss in not mentioning it. \n\nDespite these cons, I can only recommend it.

I felt like a kid again playing their first rpg and genuinely looking forward to the awesome adventure that awaits. The first stage? that song? it really set the whole tone for the entire duration of the game. I was never once bored. The music, the gameplay, the storyline.. all of it met my expectations, hell I'll even go as far as to say it surpassed it. The game is truly worth its price tag and because of how I felt for it, I bought the game again and gifted it to a friend. As I am writing this review they are in the process of also finishing it. This is the first time I cared to 100% achievements in the first playthrough. If you're thinking of buying this game, go for it.

It's an incredible game and a real labor of love spanning over a decade (yes, >10 years). If you're even slightly curious, please try the demo, it gives a great sense of the game's combat system later on and you also get the first full chapter. Extended thoughts below.\n\nASTLIBRA on the surface reminds me of a game I would've played in the early-mid 2000s with aesthetics that look like it would've been a polished remaster, but this works favorably and the game + its environments are GORGEOUS. It's nostalgic while at the same time not? Chapters 6-7 are probably my favorite. \nThe story and characters are introduced in an episodic tone of sorts (the chapters) where between each chapter you're at a small hub world where you can revisit past areas. It works great, and the characters are nicely written. Note there was a second English translation that polished up the original which is what I played. I may try the original on a 2nd playthrough but I heard it was rough. Who knew stories about [spoiler]time/space travel[/spoiler] could still be handled well? A couple of weird moments in Chapter 4 & I personally wasn't as crazy about Chapter 8, but what comes after these chapters more than make up for it. \nThe music reminds me of Ys/Falcom games with a mix of Anime OP stuff whiel also being varied. Basically, the music selection is outstanding and I learned late into the game a lot of it is royalty free. The sound design is also excellent, especially in gameplay.\nWhich brings me to my last point: the gameplay. Mechanically it starts off simple, but it gradually adds more mechanics, opportunities to boost your stats, unlocks to enhance your base moves, and rewards experimentation and grinding. Yes, there is grinding in this game but the sound design and all the goodies you get from beating up your enemies and maintaining a high combo give you so much dopamine and adrenaline that you WANT more of it, and working towards these unlocks and wondering what you will get next is so much fun and it never feels overwhelming to lean or too tedious and boring to work through. The difficulty is reasonably challenging. Some spots around midgame and later do make you work for learning the mechanics like using your shield, juggling items and spells, but they never got too frustrating. The sidequests and going out of your way to find extra rewards are actually worth the effort too. This game REWARDS you greatly instead of just giving you a piece of gear you may stop using shortly after. There is also one more aspect of gameplay I'd like to talk about, but I'm putting it in spoilers out of respect for those who want to find it out for themselves. \nBe warned.\n[spoiler]\nAfter you beat the game, you unlock a post-game/pseudo NG+ that takes all the growth you've done up to that point and cranks it up to 12. Every piece of gear you get can be enhanced with these \"command boards\" you find in loot and these can do anything from adding more stats to increasing the diminishing returns threshold on your level up point allocation to modifying your abilities and skills. Not only that, but you can enhance pretty much all of your gear infinitely(?) by using leftover materials you've found throughout your adventure. That's right. Pretty much every piece of gear becomes a potential option in gameplay. Oh but that's not all. Your growth tree extends massively. There's also a secret involving the scales, but I won't spoil that. This post-game stuff is, in my opinion, brilliant game design and takes the game from a 10 to an 11 for me. \n[/spoiler]\n\nI'm really glad I came across this game when I did because it has become one of my favorite experiences of all time, and I have a lot of respect for the developer sticking with it and working on it for years. Very inspiring.\n\n[21NOV2023 EDIT] This game gets a co-GOTY with Zelda. Both are amazing but come from backgrounds so different that it's hard to compare.

What I didn't expect was that a game that I thought is a metroidvanian-like sidescroller became one of the most memorizable games of nowadays for me. ASTLIBRA simply is amazing in every aspect! Honestly, the story alone kept me staying at the game from the first moment on. It is dripping from emotions, great characters, and great dialogue writing. One of the best story-RPGs of modern times!\n\nThe atmosphere of ASTLIBRA is outstanding! The combination of realistic landscapes and manga-/anime-like characters is a piece of harmonic art. When it comes to the plattform-part, everything is easily to be seen, may it be a platform or a background. That's not a usual thing in modern plattformers where I often confuse background with foreground. It might be me. Or an art lost since the era of SNES, which ASTLIBRA strongly reminds me of.\n\nAs I already said, I thought ASTLIBRA might be a plattformer. It is not. It's an RPG of immense depth. Not only can you upgrade your character, and equipment, you also can pause the game to conjure beasts like good-old guardian forces in Final Fantasy. Battling with the weapons is real-time, and once you get into the gameplay, the battles are fast-paced and reaction-driven, with spells to be cast and potions to take - it's unbelievable!

Again and again, neverending fun until finally I got to the REAL ending. This game was fun and even addicting for me. The design was beautiful... like anime! The story was interesting, cool and funny. The way you can upgrade your weapons, armors, items.... the gameplay... the music... ... I loved everything about it! It even got a tear from me at the end. In fact, I played over 90 hours, completed everything and I still didn't want it to end. But all good stories have an ending and can give place to a brand new one.\n\nThis game has now officially a special place in my heart and is surely in my top 10 (probably even 5) games of all time. I want to say congrats to the indie developer KEIZO 'cause this was a quite remarkable game and I will surely try out Magicus on my phone really soon. I hope there will be other games like Astlibra Revision coming out eventually. I would love to see it being made as a anime movie... That would be spectacular!

Go play the demo for free and then plan a vacation from work - this game is HUGE and BEAUTIFUL![/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Castlevania & Chrono Trigger Had a Baby and its Name is ASTLIBRA Revision[/h1]\n[b]Do you enjoy addicting combat? Compelling stories? Memorable characters? A KICKASS soundtrack that sticks with you even after you've stopped playing? This game has all of that, and so much more![/b] Look, when I first saw this game, I told myself, \"damn, this looks a bit dated. I haven't played a game like this in a long while, I'll probably not like it.\" I proceeded to try the free demo, went absolutely wild with all the fun equipment, magic, and tools you're given to play with, and got extremely interested in the brief bit of story that was teased. It was a little overwhelming at first due to how much stuff you're given to test out, but I bit the bullet, bought the game, and went on an emotional roller coaster that kept me invested every step of the way!\n\n[b]Story (no spoilers):[/b] My god, where to begin? You're an orphan who got separated from your childhood friend, and you set out on a quest to find her. A simple enough premise, but add a talking crow, some magic scales that give you the ability to travel through space and time, and you've got yourself a recipe for a plot that will keep you guessing up to the very end! You'll meet so many wonderful, memorable characters that will win your heart and make you want to do everything in your power to help them, even if that means making some very difficult decisions. In the end, you'll grow to love your companions, especially your talking crow, and you'll come to appreciate how much you've accomplished together.\n\nTime and fate are, of course, key themes of this story, and you'll leave every session thinking about how the story relates to your own life, and be inspired to take your precious time on this earth more seriously. I can not emphasize enough how much this story will stick with you as you slowly but surely make your way through every chapter.... it's a masterpiece.\n\n[b]15 YEARS IN THE MAKING:[/b] Did I mention that a single dude poured his heart and soul into this game? Every played Stardew Valley? That game had a similar development cycle, and it was friggen AMAZING - same holds true here - Keizo has truly perfected his vision for the experience he wants players to feel as they progress through this game, and I can 100% attest to that. I'm not ashamed to admit I wanted to cry a few times through the story.\n\n[b]ADDICTING COMBAT:[/b] Ok, let's say you don't care much for story - that's ok, you're gonna love this game's combat. Swords, hammers, maces, axes, magic staves/wands, bows, crossbows, guns, and much, much more are available for you to use and abuse on your enemies. You've got an extremely rewarded leveling system that makes you really feel like you're growing in strength from your battles, and it's extremely fun being able to harvest materials and craft new equipment for yourself as you progress through the map.\n\n[b]EXTREMELY CATCHY/MEMORABLE SOUNDTRACK:[/b] Friends, when you boot up that demo and start fighting a few demons, the very first song you hear is going to give your ears an orgasm. I kid you not, the official game has the most BADASS music to go along with you fighting beginner enemies! Keizo didn't need to go that hard, but that's just an appetizer for what you're going to be enjoying as you play. The music, like the story and combat, gets better, and better, AND BETTER, AND BETTER. Every single stage of this game kept blowing me away with how great the soundtrack is!\n\nI'm a guy who likes to exercise to kickass tunes, and I can tell you now, Astlibra Revision's soundtrack has been added to my lifting and cardio playlists. Simply put: this is the greatest JRPG music I've heard in a LONG while, and I've played a lot of fantastic JRPGs with banger soundtracks... this is in a league of its own... similar yet arguably better than the music you'd hear in the YS series.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] Look, I don't write reviews often. See that giant wall of text up there? It means: THIS GAME IS AMAZING! BUY IT RIGHT NOW! You could wait for a sale if you like, but I guarantee that this is one of those rare gems that's worth every single penny. You're going to remember this game for the rest of your life.\n\nThank you, Keizo, for sharing your passion and vision with the world. Your game has truly touched my heart and I've a greater appreciation for life and the journey I've taken to reach this point.

I found that overall there were very few plot holes or things left out. The characters were all extremely well written and none of the dialogue felt forced or artificial. The artwork was gorgeous beyond belief in my eyes and I always made sure to stop and appreciate the scenery. Even though the game play loop was simple and basic spam attack I always had fun just plowing through mobs, especially in the end game where you can make yourself infinitely more powerful. The music was spot on and Astlibra had many straight bangers. My favorite part was definitely the weapons mastery system because It forces you to use and learn the different weapon types. Enemy designs were also stellar and I love the way they all look. Even though some achievements got extremely grindy it did not take too much time to achieve everything after I finished the end game.

(7.5/10). Very well done for an Indie Game! Definitely worth buying and playing!\n\n\n#1 Recommendation, start on Difficult/Hard to get the best experience out of the mechanics and to not just stomp through everything. The mechanics are what make this game fun.\n\n\nAfter playing 101 hours and getting all the achievements here is my full review of this game:\n\n\nSTORY: (6/10)\nThe first thing I want to address is the story. In some parts it feels like a well done fanfic rather than a professionally edited story. There are some plot holes; there are some plot lines stolen from other things and poorly integrated into the game (Chapter 4 is the worst for this); there are parts that are super cheesy; there are parts where you are going to roll your eyes and facepalm; BUT, I feel like the story as a whole was engaging enough to be enjoyable. It goes in some pretty interesting directions and there are a few pleasant surprises. If it really bothers you though every part of the story can be skipped. For the most part, the chapters flow well and the climaxes usually feel satisfying. Basically what I'm getting at is that it is good enough.  \n\n\nMECHANICS: (9/10)\nThis is where this game shines. There are several different progression systems in the game that interweave and support each other flawlessly without becoming over-complex. It is a rather addicting progression cycle. There are a lot of ways to play into the mechanics and quite a few different play styles work well within the limits of the system, so you can customize combat to your preferences. The hit boxes are well done, and the fighting is fairly intuitive. The bosses are surprisingly well done, and I found very few disappointing duds on my playthough. The one issue that I found with combat is that between the bosses flashy moves, and your flashy moves, sometimes the screen can get a little cluttered and it can become difficult to see where you need to dodge.\n\n\nART: (6/10)\nThe art is stylized. I think that the aesthetic fits well with the story and it gives you the feeling that you are reading a generic manga off a pirate website. Overall the art is decent for an indie game and I kind of like it \n\n\nMUSIC: (5/10)\nThe music is not the best. I think it is clips of royalty free music looped. It didn't hinder my experience too much, but it is probably the part of the game that could use the most improvement. The other sound effects were decent though. \n\n\nWell, I've basically said what I wanted to say. It was a good game and I feel like I got my money's worth out of it. Just to reiterate, starting at a higher difficulty is recommended. I started at the normal difficulty and found that, after a small amount of grinding, I was slaughtering everything with little resistance and it was not that exciting. Also, after the early game is over you can't make the difficulty higher, only lower. So I ended up losing a few hours of game time when I restarted to change to Difficult/ Hard mode because I wasn't having fun on normal. After making the switch the game felt much better and I enjoyed it to the end. Lastly, do yourself a favor and don't spoil the story by looking at the achievements until after you are finished with the post game.

Some of the lines that are probably intended to be \"sexy\" or \"arousing\" are just totally out of place, and they become more frequent as you reach chapters that have female companions with you. \n\nIn addition to the overabundant spew of writing, they feel the need to CONSTANTLY pause the dialogue to have a word bubble with \"...\" animating in it above the characters' heads. This animation takes about 2 seconds, and they sometimes have it between EVERY line of dialogue. It takes the already glacial pace of conversations with characters repeating the same thing 4 times and drags it out further. Many cutscenes also forcibly slow roll the text, waiting a few seconds before presenting the next line. \n\nFinally, some of the \"puzzles\" are aren't really puzzles at all. They just require walking back and forth or repeatedly talking to the same NPC's until you have finally found the one that is ready to give you the next step.

The game definitely starts with some common jrpg elements such as a childhood friend, amnesia, and an animal mascot guide.  However, at the very beginning, I have never seen a jrpg story hook that starts with \"and then the main character and his animal companion wanders through a seemingly endless forest for eight years.\"\n\nI mostly watched my girlfriend play this game since she really wanted to play it after I beat the first boss of the game, but there were a lot of elements of this game I could appreciate even just watching.  The storyline has a lot of subtle references and foreshadowing that don't seem significant, and then later it blows you away by showcasing them as central focal points of the story.  Much like Dark Souls, even small tidbits of lore you find in pages on the ground such as gods, otherworldly beings, and concepts about the world become relevent to the story.  You read about a god of war?  You actually encounter said god in the story.\n\nThe way they present dialogue is also quite good and shows a particular attention to detail.  The dialogue has natural slowdowns and pauses as if the characters are actually talking, and it feels incredibly natural to read.  This takes a lot of time to attention to detail to perform itself considering how much dialogue is in the story.\n\nIt's sad to say, but it has been a long time since I've seen a story with main characters who genuinely try their best.   I didn't see too much woe is me type of characterization while watching this game all the way past post game.  The attitude of everyone is generally hopeful while still having moments of heart breaking despair throughout the storyline.  There isn't any character in this story I was actively annoyed with, which is a feat because I typically find animal mascot companion characters extremely annoying (looking at you Paimon), but Karon ended up being one of the most endearing characters I genuinely cared about.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and easy to get into.  There are many ways to optimize your character and instill growth from leveling up, the grow tree, balancing libra scales, equipment, mastery of equipment, customizing Karon skills, enhancing scale pans, enhancing equipment, setting scale boards, mastering/using different possession skills, and gaining new techniques.  The game encourages you to use and collect every piece of equipment (except accessories) since mastering equipment grants you magic crystals to use more Karon skills or gives you a new Karon skill entirely.  You can distribute your level up stats however you want and redistribute them however you wish very easily.  Techniques you don't want to accidentally use can even be sealed temporarily.\n\nI watched this game being played on Hell difficulty, and the beginning of the game is quite difficult but becomes more manageable as you continue playing.  Enemies are not to be taken lightly on the hardest difficulty you can play when you start up the game, you can die typically within a few hits.  However, there are a lot of systems in place to mitigate damage, but none of them are able to be used infinitely.  The backdash has a cooldown, guard has a guard gauge you have to watch, some attacks can't be guarded, and possession skills have i-frames but aren't immune to status effects (unless you equip a very expensive Karon skill) and use ST.  This game is not impossible on the hardest difficulties, but it is not easy.  Only after gaining access to specific Karon skills that boost magic power was the game starting to reach the godlike game breaking power I'm used to from most jrpgs.\n\nIn the past, the game supposedly had a poor translation, however I only esperienced the game post translation edit patch.  I must say, whatever bad translation was part of the game doesn't seem to be present.  Occasionally I'll see the random grammatical error, but nothing that breaks the immersion of the game.  If you are worried about this, don't be.\n\nAtlibra Revision is an epic adventure game about a hero's journey with many twists and turns, as well as endearing characters.  The gameplay is entertaining and easy to get into with many aspects of grinding to improve your power level.  The grind is more of an equipment and item grind like Monster Hunter, the best kind of grinding.  After fifty hours of gameplay, the game still isn't done yet.  Recommended unless you don't like anime for some reason.", "timestamp_created": 1688872791, "timestamp_updated": 1688872791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141641161": {"recommendationid": "141641161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018612478", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2681, "last_played": 1688862094}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow this is really good!

It's shockingly good. This game plays more linearly than a few other Metroidvanias, but I never felt like this detracted from the game at all. Combat is relatively simple but the content the game has allows you to create a few cool strategies that can give the game a lot more depth. I did initially play the game as a \"just keep whacking the enemy before they die\" sort of playstyle, as I did for most Metroidvanias, but this game genuinely allowed the option for a fun playstyle where I had to think about when to utilize i-frames while performing magic that took HP away to stay net neutral with costs while outputting significant damage. Honestly? Not many games tend to have that sort of freedom which is really cool.\n\nAlso, I have to say that I also thought that both the OST and the story kicks ass. The story can be a bit zany so for people looking for a more grounded and realistic story for one setting, it's sort of understandable, but even then, I still think it's really cool. The fact that the game's able to introduce details, and somehow make them all relevant at some point of the story is really admirable.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, the 74.4 hours of playtime are all part of one save file, with me playing on the \"Hard\" or \"Difficult\" setting. It's just that particularly long of a game, with it never really feeling like it falters, and even delivering during post-game, which is fantastic.

I'm not usually a fan of this genre (odin sphere, castlevania, metroidvania), but the combat in Astlibra just feels ridiculously fun, thanks to its' hitstop implementation. Really well done to the DEV KEIZO.\n\nCombat starts out simple, but the arsenal quickly builds up. Unlike castlevania games where you can only equip a few special abilities and you pretty much just use whatever is strongest, Astlibra allows for over 10 sword techniques concurrently, while still giving you access to 6 different spells at any time. The gameplay is fluid, feels amazing to hit, and gives much flexibility to encounter each boss your way. \n\nAstlibra also doesn't contain much of the annoying fluff in metroidvania, where you need to unlock new abilities and go back to old areas to get unlocks. Every chest/unlocks can be gotten in their own specific chapter, without the need for much backtracking.\n\nThe story starts off interesting enough, with enough intrigue to make you want to find out more. The main cast is likeable, believable and well developed with individual backstories and connections. After they throw a few plot twists to you, the story keeps climbing upwards in the best way possible. You may need to follow a guide though, as there are quite a few false happy endings. There is a japanese guide wikia, which you can use google translate for.\n\nThe story is easily the second best highlight of the game for me, it's not a cliche generic plotline. I will remember the storyline for a long long time to come. The pacing is well done and I was surprised a few times throughout, with my story guesses turning out to be wrong in a good way. The soundtrack contains over 140 tracks and I'll look for certain tracks even after I have finished the game.\n\nThis game, together with Demons Roots and The Last Sovereign, renewed my enjoyment and love for video games in the 2020s era. In fact, Astlibra might possibly be my GOTY for 2023, as I cannot remember the last time I had so much enjoyment out of a game in recent years. \n\nI eagerly await the upcoming side story content by KEIZO regarding the baker's daughter revision, as well as future games by KEIZO.", "timestamp_created": 1688277269, "timestamp_updated": 1688277545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141094318": {"recommendationid": "141094318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162687543", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5795, "last_played": 1688260646}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to Anulis", "timestamp_created": 1688260808, "timestamp_updated": 1688260808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698464810848236084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141093556": {"recommendationid": "141093556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023583430", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 2327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 490, "last_played": 1689451114}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite its horrendous graphics, this game hits multiple spots like a M0F0 : general nostalgia, retro gameplay done right, the retro anime scenario -both cringey and endearing, with surprising spots of gravity- and the retro music.\n\nIt plays and feels like a balanced and addicting arcade game, with an aftertaste of Visions of Escaflowne, Odin's Sphere, D&D Chronicles of Mystara and old Castlevanias.\n\nGet it.

Got curious cause of the positive reviews its been given and I was not disappointed by this one.\n\nSystem and Combat mechanics are all made to give you the most amount of fun you can have in a sidescroll ARPG. The progression does not stagnate to a point where you need to farm since you have been given 4 systems to progress to make your character stronger while also maintaining balance to make sure you do not bonk the enemies with raw stats alone (at least till postgame)\n\nPlot is MASSIVE ;) emphasizing on causality and determinism of a laid out path and the inevitability of the repercussions of changing what is supposed to happen. The story has plot devices that is utilized to an impressive way for the story to take on a massive turn and overall be bold on the usage of its characters. Plot twists are pretty much are pretictable, but its predictability becomes its strong point as they use it as an emotional drive rather than an overarching mystery. The mix of Sci-fi and Fantasy is fantastic to the point that when I was playing the game, It came across my mind that thought of \"This and that should not work together, but it does\". A bit of downside is that given its a JRPG, there's a lot of irrelevant fanservice that does not service the story but it is what it is. The story could be a bit overarching sometimes specially at the late game to postscript, but the whole experience of picking up clues, piecing up events, and overall the whole story ride is rewarding to say the least.\n\nSoundrack is a BANGER. as soon as I heard the \"Rain\" in chapter 2's soundtrack I start bopping my head. If you like music from games like cytus or Nier:Automata, the catalog should be a banger for you. Even the Vocaloid song they included which I generally dislike, becomes somewhat good since it has the Theme of that area to help it match the soundtrack. The whole Soundtrack has been great from start to finish and I hate that they did not release an official soundtrack for this game (probably because the devs did not secure the license for the music or whatnot)\n\nThe Postscript does not just give you lazy content and actually has plot in it. It is very reminiscent of Dragon Quest 11's postscript where the game's story does not end when you \"finish\" the game and though it uses same areas that you have been before, it at least has a reason on why you are revisiting the places. They also introduce 2 more systems that COMPLETELY CHANGES THE GAMEPLAY for post script and I somehow wish that they have integrated it right from the start, but I can see why they don't since it will be hard to balance the game throughout the main story. It does completely break the game but at that point, you want to break the game and be more inventive on how your playstyle and it does not fail to deliver\n\nAchievements are super easy to accomplish to the point that the only thing I need to grind for an achievement is the walking 50,000 steps one since I need 5,000 more after I finished all the game has to offer. it took me 55 Hours in-game time to be exact. Probably less If you deduct the large amount of time I have shitting, eating, and even sleeping while leaving the game open.\n\nAll in all, The devs really wanted you to have fun at this game. Gameplay has been carefully balanced and thought out; Story has an incredible introduction that made it rough on its edges when concluding it, but It tried its best to tie it up at the end; Soundtracks a banger; Postscript is entertaining as hell; and you can see the thought that is given for this game to be this good.\n\nI will tune in to the next KEIZO game for sure.

The player character can level up, distribute attribute points, learn magic, add items to a magic Libra to improve all kind of stats, distribute points on a giant Sphere Grid, find and craft dozens and dozens of weapons, shields, armors and accessories and unlock boards for every single weapon, armor and accessories to improve them even more.

The combat is fantastic and makes grinding not a chore. There\u2019s a wide variety of weapons, armour, and skills to master. I like the pseudo-crafting system they use for buying new equipment too. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s the story. It starts out interestingly enough. Kind of generic but with a couple of hints of twists to come. But around chapter four, it derails in a distractingly bad way. It pivots to being very juvenile. It is briefly horny - which is fine, I have no issue with sexual themes, but it comes out of nowhere - and then abruptly stops in favour of \u201ctwists\u201d that feel like a little kid making up a story. The chapters stop leading into each other and become just a series of \u201cand then this happens.\u201d It was still fun, but I found myself getting bored and even frustrated watching cutscenes. I\u2019ll recommend it, but with the caveat that you might want to play it while doing something else to keep your attention during the non-combat parts. \n\nPros:\n- The gameplay is great.

It promises a lot more at the start than it can actually accomplish.\n- Plot twists are either bad or bizarre.\n- Side characters are inconsistently written.\n- It drags in the middle.\n- The puzzles are either basic or obtuse with not much in between.\n\nI played this on the Steam Deck and it works perfectly right out of the box.

Its the game saying its almost done, and while you wish the ride would continue, the journey was already very long, and its time to say goodbye. Very few games make give this fulfilling experience of a complete ride, and this game hits way above its weight.\n\nLike others mention, this isn't so much a throwback game as it is a game made with passion from a gaming era where games were not designed to be movie experiences, but to be games. The combat is solid and delivers in truckloads, the boss fights (that throw less than 4 characters at you at the same time) are a blast, room layout is thoughtful, enemy design is like the best stuff 2d games used to throw at players before 2010. Players are free to change their stat point allocation at shop locations, and there's a lot of weapons and accessories to mess around with to resolve hard fights. Music goes hard, why the ost isn't on sale is beyond explanation, along with an artbook that would help flesh out the rest of the world.\n\nThe game's progression is the secret sauce to the whole experience. There's the story that, after the dialogue heavy intro, continues at a much faster pace. Then there's leveling up, which happens at an acceptable rate. Each weapon/armor/shield has a mastery that never takes too long and usually grants a permanent ability to be slotted, and to get new gear you have to forge them through monster drops, that come in just fast enough that once some of your gear is mastered, you've got enough loot to make new gear that has other abilities you want to know. On top of that, there's a growth system kind of like a simplified version of FFX sphere grid, so the player is intermittently leveling something up on their own. All these progression systems are running simultaneously, so the player always feels like they're two steps away from another milestone, and this is all on top of a solid 2d action game.\n\nThe game isn't flawless, as some puzzles make really no sense, like going through invisible walls that are actually corridors of invisible walls, or doors that are placed just above your ankles yet you can unlock them and walk through them like the ceiling doesn't exist. Bosses 3+ enemies attacking you can get nigh-impossible with no enemy giving you breathing room to reactively block, so the solution is just out-dps the situation. Playing the game on impossible difficulty to the very end, there are fights late game that feel more luck based than skill based.\n\nThe greatest criticism for the game is the demo: the combat section gives you a bunch of high level gear so the actual nuance and difficulty of the real game is not felt, and the text-heavy intro presents the game like its a by-the-books jrpg story when it really starts pulling the rug and the whole house midway through the game. Really wish they just let the player play the entirety of chapter 1 as that it ends with the narrative hook the game hangs on.\n\nFor those still reading this, the recent translation patch is solid. Maybe a weird word placement once or twice, but its nitpicking. The translation feels faithful. Also, max difficulty is doable but you will get cheap shotted a lot - the game lets you adjust difficulty until end of chapter 2 so best to play with that setting until the game hard stops you from raising it. Its a great game, a great experience, and hope for the best for any future projects the indie developers delve into.

But, there are some parts that are so bad it could deter people from playing this game. But I think I've got a succinct reason, and that's because every single mobility or function (back dash, double jump, **invulnerability for a brief moment after taking damage**, etc) is locked/hidden. The most important one being the ever so brief period of invulnerability after taking a hit. Without that, you can and most likely will be killed by an attack you get caught in, forcing you to start back at the beginning of a gauntlet. \n\nMy only other gripe about this game that some of you may not mind, is the random barely story related busty babes with jigglies in battle with me, all but hitting me with their cleavage as an attack. \nFor me that was my initial experience. \n\nHOWEVER!! \n\nWhen you get those abilities, and youre more mobile, you truly start to love this game. Every weapon, every armor, every shield (and some accessories), all show up on your character. Each piece must be crafted, and actually used in battle to get its benefit and it makes you experience weapons you wouldnt normally use. The areas are fairly huge and have such incredible detail. Every creature is unique. There are so many ways to play the game and alter your character. \nBut as a true metroidvania lover, you ask \"What about the secrets?\" \nThis game has so many damn secrets and things that are hidden that when you discover them, it kind of gives you a sense of wonder. \n\nHighly recommend this game to anyone who loves metroidvania style games with exploration!", "timestamp_created": 1687143426, "timestamp_updated": 1687143426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140310955": {"recommendationid": "140310955", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985570918", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3098, "last_played": 1687643149}, "language": "english", "review": "comfy.", "timestamp_created": 1687139702, "timestamp_updated": 1687139702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140307440": {"recommendationid": "140307440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012094079", "num_games_owned": 744, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4122, "last_played": 1687131948}, "language": "english", "review": "One heck of an adventure from start to finish. \n\nEvery step of the adventure adds something new to enjoy so that it never feels old.

I just wanted to add another perspective that will help evaluate whether to spend the money on it or not.\n\nPersonally I don't think this game is like Castlevania SotN or Bloodstained, more of a linear RPG with similar combat. \n\n\n[b]PROs[/b]\n====\nAmazingly beautiful character and sprite artwork (REALLY really nice)\n\nTons of content and optional bosses that can be tricky to beat\n\nKaron and Gau have amusing personalities\n\nIncredibly wide weapon, armor, and accessory options that all look fantastic\n\nLots of ability to modify your character build and min/max \n\nEarning special attributes from the weapons is a fantastic idea and was well implemented\n\nSpectacular looking and very useful spells that are easy to use on the fly\n\nThe story premise is interesting and more introspective than most\n\nYou can easily dodge the enemies if you don't feel like fighting them\n\n[spoiler] The little floating house shop is a fun addition [/spoiler]\n\nSave points are well spaced and restore life\n\nDifferent difficulty options make the game accessible to all skill levels\n\nFinding the hidden targets and arrows is entertaining\n\nController support is excellent\n\nFun achievements to unlock in Steam\n\n\n\n[b]CONs[/b]\n====\nThe largest issue by far is that It can be very difficult to know what is foreground and background. This complicates progression as it can be difficult to know what to do next... platform assets are not obvious, hidden entrances can only be found by throwing yourself at walls, it would be nice if the background was blurred, had less contrast, was darker, etc.  \n\nMusic during fighting is frenetic rapid tempo electronica or synth rap that is irritating. This is my second least favorite part of the game. More approachable music would have been preferable. \n\nTons of travelling back and forth solely for the sake of increasing game time\n\nCut scenes with the dialog feel long because of the constant ellipsis and pauses. \n\nWhile I normally love puzzles, many in this game seem obtuse and will require you to consult the web. \n\nDialog has tropey anime stuff baked in [spoiler] (e.g. an overly prude/shy male female relationship, the tsundere, weird foot stuff, the feminine looking male who has to cross-dress to trick someone, women throwing themselves at the main char, the alcohol lush, the hot spring peeping scene, etc.) [/spoiler] \n\nI personally don't like the silent protagonist, but I realize it's an artistic choice. \n\nThe decision to replay the intro after every chapter is strange, but at least can be skipped\n\nSome artwork is taken from photos and is sometimes a 3D view which clashes with the 2D sprites, and the bridges that are a black silhouette are odd. \n\n[spoiler] A char dies and unless you have a recent save to fix your decision you just have to deal with it. [/spoiler]\n\nGetting the ingredients you need for crafting can require plenty of mindless grinding until end game when your luck is much higher.\n\n\n\nUltimately at the end of the day I feel like the amount of content and effort easily justify the price, I find myself getting a little bored with the slow pacing, running back and forth over the same areas, grinding for drops, not being able to figure out what to do next, and rapid pressing the button to get through slow dialog scenes. I wasn't sure if I would finish the game but it gets better after Chapter 5 and is more enjoyable. \n\nMy ideal version of this game would make the platforming surfaces more contrasting and obvious and make the background look like the background, add a couple more clues on what the character needs to do next, eliminate the fetch quests back and forth, allow the user to skip the dialog bubbles and pauses with a button press, and include some music that's not high tempo. \n\nIf you have the patience to deal with the issues listed above, there is much fun and tons of content to be had.", "timestamp_created": 1686709716, "timestamp_updated": 1687231231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140023870": {"recommendationid": "140023870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091857970", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 3986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3986, "last_played": 1686697600}, "language": "english", "review": "What an absolutely odd game that some how is good but overstays it's welcome by a long time.\nStill a huge recommend for me.", "timestamp_created": 1686701387, "timestamp_updated": 1686701387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140022814": {"recommendationid": "140022814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079243240", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 8355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2557, "last_played": 1688132137}, "language": "english", "review": "ASTLIBRA is a great example how to reward grinding in Metroidvania games.

Played on normal and wasn't too hard though starting from normal you could always turn the difficultly to easy. Total game time to complete is 30ish hrs(from what a dev had said), but I've grinded for nearly every possible item to acquire and master. Try out the demo first I implore you as it gives a rough grasp on the combat.\n\n  The story is based around the Libra scales of time and fate which are the manifestation of the Goddess Astraea's powers. It's interesting, thought invoking, and largely linear [spoiler]with a few player decisions that are inconsequential in the grand scheme of the story here and there that make you feel guilt and remorse that maybe you made a wrong decision and could've maybe changed what happened if you rolled back a save. But don't feel too bummed out, as the bad things are intended to happen and fate can be changed. After the \"Happy Ending?\" game ending it lets you make a save and should you feel like you want more and load it you're put into the postscript which is essentially a new game plus, BUT where you can progress by enhancing the current gear you have and the story is that you're now starting over the story from the very beginning going through the same areas now with stronger enemies and twists to how the story played out before trying to get the ideal ending to the game[/spoiler].\n\n  Only gripes with the story are that in two chapters there was an annoying amount of abrupt \"oh you thought\" moments where you think the chapter is over and you're leaving the zone only to be halted and told to go back up to three times before the chapter decides it's over. In the other chapter you think you're going to catch up to your friend as he's always just out of eyesight before you suddenly and coincidentally start having abrupt visions repeatedly as you chase throughout the zone like the developer is having fun teasing you with \"but wait, there's more!\" The last gripe is that after conclusion of every chapter you'll be re-watching the same cutscene over and over same as when you have to watch the Libra sending you back in time. These cutscenes are skippable, but I watch them the first 5-6 times as a brief intermission just to appreciate the journey so far and to collect your thoughts about whats happening in the story.  \n\n  The gameplay is fantastical with combat based around techniques(combos), utilizing shields to bash(group them up for aoe) or parrying, dodges, magic skills, making use of I-frames, using weapons your enemy is weak against, putting items on the Libra scale and balancing them to gain their effects, making use of two-handers for their range advantage and bigger hitboxes if you can keep your agility high enough. A gross weight of 80 or higher is a no no akin to the dark souls \"fat roll\", so to avoid this either choose a lighter weapon/shield or give yourself higher agility to wield it effectively. Fire is weak against water, Earth is weak against Wind, Darkness(lightning) is weak against Holy and vice versa for a total of 6 elements, you can also see this by how the game has the magic skills ordered in the skill menu.\n\n  Progression in this game is looking for treasure chests that contain very useful items. gathering materials and monster drops that're unique to each monster in a zone and purchasing every weapon, armor, shield, and accessories in the store then mastering them to either get a magic crystal or a Karon skill(passives). As well as gathering \"force\" from defeated enemies in order to spend in the Grow menu to grow your attributes, obtain weapons unobtainable elsewhere, and new magic skills. I highly recommend you master the tree branch at least by chapter 3 as it gives a Karon skill that improves the rate at which you master weapons. An example of how powerful your character could get by the end of the game is that your agility is high enough to have a gross weight of zero, having the \"full burst\" Karon skill that consumes your full ST bar to increase the power of your next magic skill in proportion to the amount consumed(there's two other variants of this skill) then casting the magic skill that increases your movement and swing speed. You'll be swinging so fast that the swing animation has to cancel itself for the next swing which is funny to look at and amazing to hear how fast you're landing hits on an enemy melting through them.\n\n  I've haven't played anything quite like this before excluding the samey side-scroller rouge-likes that pad the game time by having you die a lot and starting over from the beginning.

In short, I don't think I've had this much pure FUN with a game in ages. \n\nTo be a bit more verbose:\n\nAstlibra presents as a love letter to a lot of games; the first impression gives that old Ys 3 feeling. Then it shows its love for Chrono Trigger. There are a lot of references buried in the game from Castlevania to Dragon Quest XI. The story takes some interesting turns until it goes entirely off the rails in the best way and stays there.\n\nBut the real heart of the game is its gameplay. Astlibra can be challenging at times but gives you so many tools to overcome anything it throws at you. If you like unlocking new stuff, this is the game for you. It never stops throwing new mechanics at you all the way until near the end of the post-game (that's a whole other post but suffice it to say there's lots to do). There are dozens of weapons, armors, shields and trinkets to unlock. There's crafting. Every single thing is worth digging into. Got a new weapon? Try it! It might not be your favorite but all the weapons feel good and fun to use. And mastering that weapon might grant you something useful!\n\nThe game is just a huge gift to gamers. It respects your time, plays with your expectations and never stops trying to wow you. \n\nIt's an absolute juggernaut of a game and I cannot recommend it more.

Literally one of my favorite games right after NieR:Automata including the musics which is a really high praise because I [b]LOVES[/b] NieR OST and I swear I heard vocaloid in at least one of the songs and damn it was good. You have to play this game to experience the story yourself, I think this game is best play on hard.\n\nWhen I first saw this game on release I thought it was weird base on the gameplay trailer, enemy movements kinda stiff like papercut animations, the game seem to have microstutters or pause for a bit when you hits your enemies, I thought it was a low quality product but trust me it's not, I was dead wrong, those things are crucial to the gameplay. This game may look like a metroidvania but it's not, it's more like a liner game where each chapter take place in an area that you can come back later, there's no one big map with many zones\n\nI highly recommend trying the combat demo, if you like the basic combats you gonna loves this game. I played on Hell and only just finished like half postscript. This game is the definition of underrated, it has no reason to be this good for this price, normally I don't even like JRPG (mostly anime games not Janpanese games) or side scroller.\n\nThe combat actually has a lot of depth in it, at first I thought it would just be stand in one place spamming attack button to build up ST to use possession skills but the more you play the better the combat gets. You can do melee attack, range magic attack, guard, perfect guard, back step, double jumps, air dash, upper cut, downward slash, guard counter, shield bash, shield charge, you can also change how some of your attack works later on.\nThere are many weapon types and each has different basic attacks moveset, swords have medium range and speed, daggers are short but really fast, hammers are really good at breaking enemy poise/posture which will stun them for awhile, magic wands are crazy good at ST build up but need to be used at melee range, spear has long range and medium speed but need to be two handed, big swords/hammers are slow but have highest damage per hit. This is not a game where you pick a weapon you like and stick with it, expect to change weapons a lot depend on what you're fighting, there's a very early weapon you can get that will help you cheese most of the arena challenges\nThere are 6 elements in the game, each has 5 possession skills that you will slowly unlocks. They are really fun to use and you will be using them a lot as they are your best damage source, they also provide iframes, you can get healed if you're attacked during possesion skills later on so they are very important.\n\nBoss fights are awesome, it's like a dance where you have to learn the boss movesets, some boss are just bullets hell though. There's only one boss that I despite in this game even in postscript, it's literally just a bad boss design that is unfun and unfair to fight on high difficulty, even in the lowest difficulty this boss is still a menace. It's chapter 3 boss which is like a breaking point for this game, the story will only get better after chapter 3 but it is also the worst boss fight I've ever experienced in any video games, I swear killing Sword Saint Isshin in Sekiro is less frustrating than this stupid boss. \nThe boss is [spoiler]|a giant eye that will only take damage if you hit the eye protected by a circle of lights that will hurt you if you touch it which is the ONLY time in this game you're not allow to touch a boss, nothing in this game will hurt by simply touching them. The shields are extremely tanky even in postscript I'm only able to break one of them, you will die in 2-3 hits, you can't guard much because your shields are weak and healing take a few seconds and you are not allowed to get hits during that time. Sometime the boss will remove the shield to attack you with yet another circle but this time it's fire projectiles, it won't stop blinking, spinning, phasing in and out so it's really annoying to dodge, it's the only opening for attacks and yet you can't do much during that time, the boss has way too much hp and the opening for attacks are too small.[/spoiler]\nAt one point the game turned into a[spoiler] megman X level [/spoiler] which is niche\n\nI do have some minor nitpicking: \nThere's absolutely no [b]AUTO SAVE[/b] what so ever, even after a long boss fight or a long cutscene, you literally have to manually save at a checkpoint.\nIf you die in a boss fight you'll have the option to restart the fight but that doesn't mean the game will load previous save because there's no auto save in this game, any consumable items you used will be gone.\nLater on there will be moments where so many things are happening on the screen you can't see the enemy animations so you don't know when to guard or dodge so you just take damage for no reason.\nRelic soldier's attack hitbox is bigger than what the animation shows.\nChapter 7 by far is the worst (it's only like 30m or the first half of the chapter but still), no karon, can't walk without dying in 3-4 hits at level 50, shield can only block so many hits before it break, long walks without save spot, not even after a CUTSCENE, you have to fight 2 BOSSES without karon, I know there's a rare item that you can use to destroy mobs and probably intended to be used for this chapter but I don't like using items, it isn't fun but neither do stripping the player's abilities.\nThere should be a setting to adjust brightness and contrast, the map sometime too dark so you can't appreciate the details\nSome attacks will just blend in with bright background and you can't see anything.\n\nThis is probably the longest review I've ever written and that's how much I like this game, one of the must play game just like Nier:Automata.\nEdit: Finished the postscript. Wow, what a journey, I've played nearly 100 games, 10 000 hours on steam and this has to be one the most amazing story in gaming I've ever experienced, my second favorite story ever after One Piece which I still love after probably over 10 years.

It perfectly fulfilled my expectations for a game of this genre after playing \"13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim.\" The story is just as captivating as other JRPG+sci-fi+cute girl games like \"Nier\" and \"13 Sentinels.\"\n\nWhile these types of games may not be extremely popular worldwide, I personally really enjoy them. However, I have to point out one thing. The script relies heavily on character illustrations. Many times, the reason I kept playing this game was that my wives (referring to the characters) are incredibly beautiful. I would be devastated if they died. If it were a man or an ugly woman who died, I wouldn't bother risking my life to save them. Consequently, the plot wouldn't progress either. As for the protagonist, his only motivation might be to save himself and the world.\n\nLater in the text, it's mentioned that the gods specifically designed these scripts to train the male protagonist and challenge the rules established by the Creator. However, these scripts also seem too coincidental. It's stated that the male protagonist is the only one to reach the end among tens of thousands of parallel worlds. It's also said that the Divine Balance is actually a device to restart the entire floating island, not just time and space travel. Furthermore, it's mentioned that time and space travel did occur, and the gods bore the consequences. It's also said that the gods have abandoned humanity but want to train them to fulfill their purpose. Honestly, as I progressed, I found the setting of the script somewhat confusing. These settings are actually inconsistent. If the Divine Balance isn't a time and space travel device but just a repeated restart, then there's no need for the goddess to pay the price. The true time traveler is the artificial intelligence Anubis, who can send consciousness back in time. But that has nothing to do with the gods.\n\nOverall, I feel that the author intentionally tried to make the script more logical and scientifically convincing, but it ended up creating some contradictions.", "timestamp_created": 1686112141, "timestamp_updated": 1686112564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139667149": {"recommendationid": "139667149", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978439158", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 4566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1344, "last_played": 1687482855}, "language": "english", "review": "She took off her pants and did the bridge!", "timestamp_created": 1686101914, "timestamp_updated": 1686101914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139665492": {"recommendationid": "139665492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049751297", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 645, "last_played": 1686412203}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1686098646, "timestamp_updated": 1686098646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139659702": {"recommendationid": "139659702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986540748", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 527, "last_played": 1689242344}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!  I played the post English translation patch using an arcade stick. \n\n The writing and story is good enough to warrant complaints if there were indeed translation issues before, but I'm glad this has already been addressed.  The soundtrack is great, the controls are great, the leveling and strength progression feels good.  The grow tree feels a bit awkward, but is an afterthought when all the other systems in the game are fine tuned and feel natural.  I highly recommend this game, especially if you have a steam deck.  Cool ass game for sure!\n\nUPDATE! \n(80 hours in near 100% complete, this game is amazing even the endgame min-max)\nMy only complaint is that the main character doesn't have more of a dialogue in the story.  The other characters are so pivotal and unique, and that only makes us feel less so.  When the situation is dire and emotions are high all we get is a few main character scribbles....  I know this is a trope from many jrpg/rgp's from the past, but this is a bit much.  After all you go through with the whole cast, I'd expect even a reserved MC to say a few words and exhibit some semblance of humanity in these absolutely heart wrenching scenes.  It would go a long way for someone, who only the player witnesses their true struggle, is finally broken down to rock bottom nothingness covered in tears and darkness and to participate not in some lackey scribbles.  I feel for the MC even though he has never been written into the game to show an ounce of weakness, fear, or absolutely hopelessness... it's only fair with the challenge given to them.  I get the classic feel of a carte blanche MC open to be whatever the player wants them to be, but even a few physical sprite animations of absolute despair or joy would give the player a lot more to go on besides the hardboiled silent/perfection that is every late 90's early 2000's MC rgps.  If you are going to approach topics of a more mature age you have to give this MC some life is all I'm saying (this certainly is more serious than say Chrono Trigger).  If not after all this the MC feels like kinda a like a piece of shit, distant and un-relatable.  Yeah, he has no heart, emotion, and is represented so poorly that all the serious undertones that the designers painstakingly wrote into the game make him look so fake and un-involved that he might as well be the MC from legend of mana (same issue for me back then).  We all know how strong the story is... it's good enough for us to come up with our own story, in our own minds, from the character we created....Don't take that as a win for a malleable MC, but as a necessary adjustment for your players.  Just a little bit gives us a sense of gravity, see John Wick> just turn the squiggles into actual dialogue for some parts.  We don't need much but the only criticism is the lack of an actual MC in the game to be honest.  Good fucking game tho.\n\n\nI can't believe how good the progress balance is in this... nothing is free or out of the ordinary, and if it is!!! it's on purpose!!!\n\nI love it!\n9/10 near perfect for me!

But after a week or so, I realized I couldn't stop thinking about the game. So I gave it another shot... and I'm glad I did. I've changed my mind. This is a great game. But the game still isn't perfect, and I want to go over it's flaws first.\n\nThe game is less of an action-RPG and more JRPG-action. That isn't an inherently bad thing if you like JRPGs, but for me, I've found as I've gotten older I have less patience for these types of games. However, if you hate JRPGs to the core, I think you can stop reading here; you won't like this game. There is an action element to this game, certainly, and being better at action games will give you an advantage, but as compared to skill, your stats are much more of a deciding factor.\n\nSpeaking of stats, be prepared to grind. But not in the way you may think. There are a ton of things to collect in this game, but what I want to talk about is equipment. Armor, weapons, and shields all can be mastered by killing enough enemies with them equipped, which grants a permanent bonus or skill unlock; even when you don't have the weapon equipped. The thing is, you have to kill so many enemies that there's no way to progress through the game and master weapons naturally; you have to grind enemies over and over again if you want to master everything. Which believe me; you do. The bonuses are too good to pass up and mastering equipment is a big part of this game; that's just how it is.\n\nThere's also a lot of backtracking. Go A, then B, back to A, then B so you can go to C, then back to B so you can go back to A... etc. It isn't horrible, but I almost rolled my eyes a few times when story events unfolded in such a way that I had to go back to ABC AGAIN.\n\nThe grinding and backtracking gets in the way of progressing the story, which is cheesy and somewhat predictable... but at the same time, it's charming, and while there are a lot of things you'll see coming a mile away, there are also a few twists you'll never see coming. One of the best elements of the story is the characters, in my opinion. At the end of the game I realized that I was very fond of many of the... \"main-side\" characters in this game. Many of them had an external struggle or a personal weakness to overcome; a few had neither, some had both. When everything finished, it left me with an immensely satisfied feeling.\n\nThe game's story drastically improves when the \"main game\" ends and something called the \"post-script\" begins. Even though it's called the \"post-script\", many of the most important events in the game take place and some things that didn't make sense before start to add up. There's even new mechanics added. The post script is about 1/3 of the actual game, I'd say. With more interesting mechanics added(on top of the ones that were already interesting), less grinding and less backtracking, it's easily the strongest part of the game. I hope i'm not giving off the impression that you have to get through 2/3 of the game to get to the \"good part\", because everything before the post script is still worth playing on it's own, but I do wish the first part of the game played more like the second part. There is still some potential grinding in the postscript if you want to unlock everything though, especially if you had the misfortune to not find certain optional items that you could only find before the postscript... in which case, buckle up, because those items are an extremely rare drop.\n\nA couple of other negatives I need to bring up; firstly, there's some odd progression issues in the story, as well as in equipment. You can acquire legendary swords early on that don't even remotely compare to normal equipment you'll find later, and your character will accomplish such unbelievable things that some of the conflicts later in the story seem silly after reflection. Secondly, this game has a few bugs. Reading a book for the very first time doesn't allow you to scroll down to read more text, and there's also a bug with a hidden ability that tells you how many unopened chests are still on-screen; if there are 4 of them you've found and 0 you haven't found, it will tell you 44. Nothing is game-breaking and I've never had the game crash once over 60+ hours so this is just a minor nitpick.\n\nFrom here on out I only have praises to sing. The game's combat system is excellent, it's so good that even someone like me, who normally doesn't like hack-n-slash games, loves it. I don't have anything more to say, it's that good.\n\nThere's plenty of ways to make your character stronger. You can level up, which gives you crystals to allocate to stats. You can also acquire \"force\" by defeating enemies, which you can allocate to a growth tree to increase your stats that way. Furthermore, you can place items, which weigh different amounts, on a set of scales to get different kinds of bonuses; which vary by the item. The catch is that obviously, the scales need to be balanced. All this, PLUS all the mountains of equipment in the game, which can be upgraded and customized in the postscript. I wouldn't go as far as to say there's \"builds\" in this game but I'm willing to bet everybody's endgame character looks at least a little different from eachother's. \n\nThere's plenty of hidden secrets to find by being attentive to your surroundings. They can be a big help, they're not just cosmetic or very small upgrades, so it pays to pay attention to your surroundings. Furthermore, while they aren't usually in plain sight, they're also not hidden in the kind of old-school, cryptic \"how was I supposed to know that\" way; if you search for long enough, you should be able to find pretty much everything on your own. Additionally, there's an optional area you can visit to complete challenges to earn even more upgrades.\n\nThe music is fantastic. I believe most if not all of it is free useage/open source, but it all sounds great and fits what the mood should be. I believe a good soundtrack is one of the most important parts of a game, and this passes with flying colors.\n\nThe art style is... interesting. I wouldn't say it's amazing, nor would I say it's bad, but I'm not sure I've seen anything that looks quite like this game, and it's grown on me to the point that I'd say I like it.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, I think that this is a special game. Certainly it isn't perfect, but I doubt I'll ever forget it.

Unfortunately, I'm not playing this game as a kid trying to kill time on their commute, and even if I was, there are FAR better options now than whatever this is.  I played through until a fair bit after the intro and first boss before I couldn't take it anymore and skimmed a full game playthrough video to see if it got any better later (doesn't seem like it). \n\nThe combat feels mindless and grindy.  There's basically no difficulty here beyond the raw numbers and stats, you spam your weapon attack and press a spell when you get enough ST, maybe dodge if you're fighting a boss, open the menu to heal occasionally, etc. you probably know the type of combat I'm talking about if you've played some bad side scrollers before.  From what I've seen the gameplay is like that all the way through to the end, just spam attacks and spells, let your numbers do the work.  The scale mechanic is the only somewhat interesting part of the gameplay; I obviously haven't explored it fully but from what I've read it doesn't appear to be an insanely must-play!!! level groundbreaking mechanic that changes the entire game.\n\nThis game also looks pretty rough, there are probably flash games that look better than this.  The \"city\" is just a bunch of pictures of churches and stone buildings cropped and set against a static background.  Enemies look lifeless or like they were drawn in paint; sometimes they're also just cropped pictures.  There are only a handful of sprites that look like they were made for this game, which is fine if the art direction is strong and they're used creatively and smartly.  Plenty of games use still photos and can look fantastic, but it's painfully noticeable in ASTLIBRA that they just wanted to cut corners on their art assets.  Animations are also pretty stilted and awkward looking, particularly on larger enemies.\n\nObviously can't speak to the quality of the story, you'll have to look at other reviews for that.  From the few hours I played it was at least interesting enough to not feel the urge to skip any cut scenes, so there's that.\n\nAnyway, this game is definitely not for me, maybe my standards are too high since the other reviews are overwhelmingly positive, but my recommendation is to steer clear unless you like low quality mindless JRPGs.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1685860779, "timestamp_updated": 1685860779, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.309228181838989258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1685865706, "developer_response": "thank you for your feedback."}, "139519775": {"recommendationid": "139519775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832670702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2582, "last_played": 1686763847}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty good and unlike anything else so I do recommend it, but movement is a bit clunky and it really needs a \"double speed\" option for cutscenes that are sometimes ridiculously slow and an \"instant text\" option for dialogue that loads suboptimally, and sometimes it's hard to figure out where to get a material or what to do next without looking it up.", "timestamp_created": 1685855746, "timestamp_updated": 1685855746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139515058": {"recommendationid": "139515058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965051574", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 1489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 709, "last_played": 1691764395}, "language": "english", "review": "At chapter 4 currently.

I'll be updating this at some point. For now this is sort of a first impressions from someone whose only in chapter 3.\n\nYet again ANOTHER steam indie hit with overwhelmingly positive ratings that is at best mid, and at worst, quite bad. There's genuine merit to a lot of the base systems in the game. Weapons needing to be mastered so that you learn skills, exploring yielding skill points/new skills. The Libra scale system where you try to balance the \"karmic\" weights of two objects in order to buff yourself. The somewhat clunky but still neat Growth system where you use element drops you pick up from all the enemies to give yourself gradual buffs and eventually unlock new magic etc in a grid/node based system. The level up system is also based off getting \"crystals\" after each level up and choosing which stats to invest them into. VERY similar to that Dust: Elysian Tail game.  There's apparently even more system mechanics than just those. These are probably the strongest part of the game and all do a good job of supporting the main grinding loop.\n\nUnfortunately, the actual gameplay is incredibly scuffed, and it's shocking to see no one really bring up how bad it is. I-Frame sources are scarce. You have an awkward backstep with a lengthy cooldown. You have a shield that you can only use with one(1) weapon type. The shield blocks 100% of damage but has a stability bar that drains in around 3 hits. When the bar drains you can't block for 10-15 seconds. If you're reliant enough on the shield to see that happen you might as well put the controller down because you're about to get comboed to death. The last and most potent source are possessions. By attacking enemies  you build up stamina, and you can use that stamina to trigger highly damaging summon/transformation magic attacks that also have tons of i-frames. It's strange to see many comments talk about fun melee combat when the combat seems to be entirely balanced around pure mashing. I'm never really styling on an enemy or skillfully countering them. I'm just building stamina and mashing a possession before an enemy attacks. Speaking of enemies...\n\nEnemy design in this game is also quite boring/bad. I'm sure you've noticed the game's collage-esque asset artstyle. While that can be sort of charming, what isn't is the resulting effects it seems to have on  animation/ clarity. So many attacks in this game have poor tells. Lot's of attacks where an enemy will do a \"rear\" animation, awkwardly repeat a few frames of this animation for like 2-3 seconds, and then just do one of their attacks. Like they could have 3 separate attacks, but all three will start with the same rearing animation loop and then you just have to pay attention to particle effects to guess what attack they might do. Sometimes it's clear and many other times it isn't. Also, because this is an anime game there's tons of particle effects that completely obscure what the enemies are doing. So even if you can accurately read and evade an enemy, in actual gameplay when you're fighting a room full of them you won't be able to dodge at all. This makes every encounter boil down to safe/ranged pokes into possession spam. I really need you all to realize that possession spam IS the game. There are no interesting combos, or exciting defensive counterplay. The game is building up stamina to spam these moves. \n\nBoss design seems to be even MORE scuffed with bad hitboxes, and more complex patterns that don't suit the rigid control of the MC, but as i'm only at chapter 3 I need to play more to say something more concrete.\n\nFinally the story. As I'm only on Chapter 3, I can't really speak on this. I've seen hints of strange/degen writing but none of the major ??? scenes yet. Story seems quite tropey and big on obvious twists. Many cases of \"this is your TRUE identity\" or \"MC wakes up in realistic dream to meet important NPC\" (btw what the actual hell is the MC's name... is he just unnamed???). World building seems... okay. There's pages you can pick up that talk about gods/towns and that's neat. As for what happens in the actual game though I'm not too impressed. That being said I do think the main story is interesting at the moment. There seems to be hints of some sort of greater force monitoring the astlibra scales and foreshadowing conflict with them. Speaking of the scales, they're a time travel macguffin so get ready to see some confusing plot holes.  \n\nAll in all, the game is still kind of fun. The main grind loop is fun it's just when the grinding gets interrputed by bosses/difficult enemies and you actually start dying you realize the game really isn't all that.", "timestamp_created": 1685753807, "timestamp_updated": 1685753807, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.362621515989303589", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1685762218, "developer_response": "Interesting!

Every time I asked myself about some implication of an event - how or why did this happen? what will result from it? - the game dev proceeds to answer or at least acknowledge it.  It shows a lot of thought went into the story which tackles a topic that so often creates plot holes.\n\nThe gameplay is very fun and is what mostly reminds me of Bloodstained.  Each \"chapter\" provides opportunities to grind - there are a multitude of progression elements to grind for - and I was always excited to do so.  This was helped by the fact that there is a pretty clear-cut way to determine if you're done grinding for a given chapter - it made it feel like an optional goal to hit each time.  And no problem if you don't hit that goal, you don't have to backtrack but you certainly can!\n\nI'll stop myself from going on and wrap up with a testament:  Every time I turned the game off late at night, I always literally said out loud \"my god this is such a good game\".

You unlock defensive abilities, and you learn how to use magic I-frames to avoid damage. But the real answer? You dont REALLY avoid getting hit. \n\nThe game isn't about taking zero damage. It's like Dark Souls. You learn to take exactly enough damage to not die. The first 3-4 hours is about learning how to upgrade/purchase items to stay ahead of the curb. And how to take just enough damage so you don't die.\n\nWhen you run into the Skeleton (simple enemy) in the beginning of the game, it's not about DODGING, it's about how you place yourself to avoid the occasional hit, but probably MORE about the fact that there's 10 items you could have unlocked before that point. None of them are great, but all of them unlock attributes upon mastery.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. It's a pretty good game that expects you to deal with the fact that you're powerless for a couple hours. After those couples hours? You're not powerful, you're just not weak anymore. And if you find yourself in a spot where you're weak - you probably need more basic items mastered. Grind.\n\nThis game is a 10/10 if you will spend the time to unlock and master things.

Your mom needed to return the dress she only wore one time to your aunt's wedding to her 3rd husband.  You ask her if you can stop by Babbage's (or whatever place it is you people in Canada shop for games and computer software, IDK) or maybe you're at a Hollywood Video because on the weekend you get pizza, a movie, and rent a video game on the two weekends a month you stay at your dad's and his 26 y/o GF's apartment.  \n\nEither way, Xenogears and Suikoden II aren't available, you see this game on the shelf and if you're at the mall with mom, you can get it for $34.99 (or whatever maple leaf money you Canadians use).  If you're with dad you can rent it and he'll burn a copy for you since his tech-savvy buddy sodded that modchip in your PS1 a few months ago.  Choose your own adventure here gamers.\n\nOn the way home you read the manual and while you really wished you were able to get a copy of Suikoden II because your friend at school won't shut up about it, you weren't going to leave empty handed. You begin cautiously optimistic but become skeptical after looking at these weird backgrounds that look partly pre-rendered but digitized in a weird way.  You haven't really heard of this game or it's developer and you're beginning wonder if you're going to regret your purchase.  As the cigarette's embers from your mom/dad's gf burn your little sisters face in the backseat driving down I-10 back home, you figure that if the game isn't great, at least you were able to borrow those anime OVA's on VHS from your friend at school so the weekend isn't totally lost.\n\nYou get home, throw a couple slices on a paper plate, and briskly head to your room.  You turn on your 19 inch Toshiba TV/VHS combo.  You take Astlibra throw the disc in your PS1 and flip that bad boy upside down.  Ope!  You forgot to pour yourself a very large Sprite into you're scratched up giant plastic Jurassic Park cup you've had since 1993.  It begins to rain outside on this cool, late afternoon and you're greeted by the title screen.  You start the main quest...\n\nDRUM AND BASS floods your room it melts your eardrums.  You're blown away by the soundtrack, each strike against the enemies the feels so satisfying.  It's challenging at first but as you progress, you notice you're getting good fast.  The story is ridiculous but you're a kid/teen, so you think its awesome because you think anime and video games about getting to literally KILL GOD is peak story telling.  You get stronger and there are so many weapons and custom builds you can make for you're character.  There's big breasted women and bad ass dudes with head bands and big swords.  DRUM AND BASS, Metal, Electronica, Hip-hop!  Fan service!  There is even an adorable anime pig that runs a shop floating on strings of balloons!!!\n\nTHIS is a game released in late 2022 but feels it came out so long ago.  It feels like a hidden gem when hidden gems were exactly that. The kind of hidden gem you tell your friend about, let borrow and they return it to you with the jewel case cracked. The kind of hidden gem a game mag gives a middle of the road review to because it's lack of 3D polygons.  Astlibra feels like a PS1 era game from a time you may have never actually experienced, but have misplaced nostalgia for.  It feels like a memory your adjacent to but may not exactly be your own.  This is a game that if released in 1998 someone on Youtube 2023 would be write a video essay for decades later.  \n\nAstlibra is a game about changing the past, and if you're an older gamer you'll be returned to a past you hold warm memories of.

Surprisingly solid story with some satisfying combat + RPG systems, as well as an absolute banger of a soundtrack. \n\nThis one really surprised me. I don't recall any fanfare around this game releasing, and had no idea there was a web-based version to begin with. This game is the product of 15 years of development total, and it definitely feels like a passion project. Gameplay is very reminiscient of SOTN-style Metroidvanias, but your progression comes from all of your passives and equipment rather than new world-traversal techniques. Make no mistake that this is first and foremost a JRPG, so the game plays out -very- story heavy and mostly linear. Minor exception being the completely optional farming / item hunting for achievements that you can do between chapters. Nothing in the game is overly tedious to farm, and I was able to get 100% achievements with minimal farming after the final boss with a total playtime of around 47 hours according to Steam. The story itself is well-done, and although it foreshadows certain elements a bit too hard, there are a good amount of genuine twists and turns along the way to keep you guessing. There is unfortunately a pretty consistent amount of fan-service in both dialogue and a few character designs, but being a JRPG it's to be expected.\n\nThe art is good though nothing particularly mind-blowing; it has a bit of an old-timey feel like you're a new gamer whose friend recommended them a SNES-era game, and for that it's got some charm to it. It doesn't try to be anything crazy, but for how long of a game is, the fact that there are essentially no recolored assets is commendable. The designs of the enemies and bosses are really cool, and do a good job of keeping things from getting stale by throwing some unique encounters at you throughout.\n\nThe boss fights themselves are challenging but very fair. I played on Hard (difficulty 3 of 5) and there were no major roadblock type bosses. Some of them get a little projectile heavy, but you have multiple tools to deal with this including i-frame during spells, the ability to destroy all enemy projectiles when you cast a spell, a generous dodge, and blocking. Both melee and magic-based playstyles are viable, and respeccing is incredibly simple / affordable to encourage both experimentation and per-fight changes. This is especially useful in the arena mode (preset encounters with stipulations like \"don't get hit\" or \"don't use items\"). You can definitely farm and get very overpowered, and there's a nice sense of progression from \"dying to level 1 slime\" to \"screen-wiping invincible god\" if you put enough time in. \n\nLastly, the soundtrack for this game is nuts. It's really unfortunate that the official soundtrack isn't purchaseable, because there are some tracks that bat way above the average you'd expect for a relatively unknown game like this. Jazzy songs with female vocals, somber piano and strings tracks for emotional moments, boss fight tracks that would fit in to an EDM festival, rock tracks that evoke Mega Man X's soundtrack, and even a Halloween rap. The game is 100% worth playing through for the soundtrack alone, and I found my list of \"no wait, this track's my favorite\" growing with every chapter. \n\nAll in all, a ridiculously good game made all the better by its criminally underpriced price tag. Any fan of ARPGs or JRPGs owes it to themselves to give this a shot. For everyone else: it has a free demo so you have no excuse to not at least give it a try, and if you find yourself having even a little bit of fun with the combat, 100% buy it; you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1684132815, "timestamp_updated": 1684132815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138326657": {"recommendationid": "138326657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025057897", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 6553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6553, "last_played": 1678092286}, "language": "english", "review": "Play this game NOW", "timestamp_created": 1684132720, "timestamp_updated": 1684132720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138312618": {"recommendationid": "138312618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036904258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 5065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3812, "last_played": 1686494925}, "language": "english", "review": "Just super good\nDont fooled by its graphic\nIts kinda boring at the beginning, but after chapter 2. the game is just beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1684100083, "timestamp_updated": 1684100083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138294438": {"recommendationid": "138294438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041076271", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3786, "last_played": 1683779011}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will eat your life.

On the timer 16.5 hours (Proton does not count playing time offline). In-game time is as follows: about 70 hours on \"Normal\" difficulty, and about 17 hours on \"Hard\" difficulty. Had to go through the game twice, as I wanted to collect all the achievements. It was two completely different experiences. On the subject of time, to confirm my words left only one word: [spoiler] \"Geas\" [/spoiler]. If you know, you know.\n\nSo, review. Saw a lot of good reviews of the game, decided to try it. I can say with confidence - it was one of the best gaming experiences.\n\nWhat I liked:\n-The story is strong, and it really is very good. The story leaves a nice aftertaste, it is completely finished and leaves no blank spots behind;\n-Music accompaniment fits the game perfectly, the combination of multiple genres sets the pace of the game. It's a subjective feeling, but through the music you can somewhat predict which way the story might move;\n-Various bosses, especially it feels that way on difficulty \"Hard\" and above;\n-Was pleasantly surprised that some bosses can make a real bullet hell, it was a very pleasant experience since the days when I played Rabi-Ribi. It's not often you see a 2d side-scroller project with bullet hell mechanics;\n-One of the best endgame content, with new mechanics and a big part of the story (no spoilers, it's just worth it);\n-The game is well balanced on \"Normal\" difficulty, and some will find it challenging on \"Hard\". I can't speak for the other difficulties.\n-Responsive controls, the character always does what you want to do;\n-A lot of RPG mechanics, some mechanics show themselves very well in the endgame;\n-Many options for enhancing a character's power, their combination makes the game very entertaining;\n-Well-hidden secrets and puzzles that are fun to solve;\n-The ability to quickly skip dialogues, which saved a lot of time on a second quick playthrough.\n\nNeutral points:\n-Although the secrets are hidden very well, there are some secrets that can be found either by accident or by digging every stone. Although I only had a few of these moments, [spoiler] the location where the Castlevania reference takes place is particularly memorable. [/spoiler]\n-Maybe not everyone may like the graphics, but the game manages to pleasantly surprise with stunning views, especially in the second half of the game.\n\nControversial points:\n-If you properly level up your character, the endgame part may be too easy for both \"Normal\" and \"Hard\".

One of the rare times where the phrase \"greater than the sum of its parts\" is not only applicable, but is a gross understatement. I completed all achievements in 65 hours and I was very surprised at how much content this unassuming indie title has for you. \n\nThe basic premise is that it is a 2D JRPG \"Metroidvania\" with fast and smooth combat. When I say \"Metroidvania\", I don't mean Symphony of the Night, where it is one (two) giant map. This is more like Order of Ecclesia, where there are several smaller maps that aren't physically connected. \n\nThe visuals are both great and also lacking. The sprites are all wonderful, though I wish the animations had more frames. In the middle of combat you don't notice the frames of animation that the sprites have in the slightest and everything moves fluidly as the actual FPS is stable. The biggest complaint I have visually are some of the background and foreground environment sprites have clear lines so you can tell exactly how it is all tiled together. Again, in the heat of combat you will not notice it at all. That being said, everything looks cohesive and nothing ever seems like it was designed and created for another project and just pasted into the game without care. \n\nThe combat is awesome. It is fast and simple on the surface but also has depth to it. You will have a bad time if you are just mashing the attack button and not much else. You must utilize the offensive and defensive skills you learn along the way. Possession skills are great and eventually become very overpowered once you master how to fight. It becomes so fun once you get into the groove of it all that you will want to take the time to max out the exp on all of the weapons, shields, and armor... and it won't feel like a chore at all. \n\nThe RPG mechanics for leveling stats, crafting, weapons, armor, shields, Karon magic, the Force board, Possession skills, Libra system, Item boards, and enhancing your equipment keeps you busy and you always feel like you're making progress and improving. Each aspect is straightforward on its own and in conjunction with the other systems forms a tight web of character progression not seen often enough. This game respects your time in ways most others in the JRPG/RPG realm fail to by having several ways to respec almost at any time. There are tons of free places to do it in town or at mokyun shops. From shops you can buy respec potions so you can do it anywhere. It is a nice touch. \n\nThe story is very JRPG but man did I care about it. I didn't really expect that going into it based on the demo and screenshots of the game, as well as other reviews that suggested it was all over the place and what not. I didn't think so at all. I don't normally care about story too much as a lot of times it appears to be just a means to an end, kind of thought up on the spot to justify mechanics of the game, but that isn't the case here. I was very invested in the goings on of everyone. Almost brought to tears, empty pit in my chest levels of invested in the story. \n\nThe music is done by a bunch of different artists and it is basically all wonderful. There was some random rap song in one optional room I didn't care for. On the other hand, the third area music was done by the legendary S.S.H. and it shreds. Other styles are present as well and it really fits so much better than you would think. I'm going to be listening to a few of these tracks for a very long time down the road. \n\nSome things that you need to do to progress the game aren't totally communicated well to you, though that is most likely due to the translation. If you pay attention and don't skip cutscenes or conversation, you'll probably be able to figure out what you need to do 90% of the time. There were a couple spots where what was needed seemed sort of obtuse and I didn't really seem to understand how I was supposed to glean what to do from the story or conversations with NPCs or environmental clues. Though when you bring up the menu it will give you direction on what you're supposed to be doing overall, but again, a couple times that wasn't any help at all. \n\nTrust me when i say this game is great. I don't ever write reviews. I am sacrificing sleep to write this because I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game. This is much better than so many AAA big budget RPGs and it was just a labor of love from one guy.

The characters are likable and almost all of them have depth and some form of a backstory. \n\nGame play is excellent if you like side scrolling hack and slash, metroidvania-esque item hunting, and loot farming type of games. The controls aren't extremely precise but the hit boxes feel fairly accessible so the game play isn't hindered. The challenge remained consistent on hard mode although by postscript endgame, I was severely overpowered. That's more a testament to how satisfying the grinding/loot farming was than a critique on the balance of the game.\n\nIf I absolutely had to complain about something, it's that this game reeeealllly leans into tropes of traditional gender roles, damsels in distress, and casual misogyny for humor. Not really anything that we're not all used to and probably has a lot to do with the fact that this game has been 14 years in the making (!!!) but just seems like we can progress beyond that at this point.\n\nOverall, a fantastic game that you makes you feel like you're visiting old friends when you boot it up.

Playing it alternately on my PC and Steam Deck throughout the whole week on Hard difficulty it took about 60 hours to 100% the game, without really being stuck anywhere.\nIt's not perfect, far from it. But it was so entertaining and fun to play, I just have to recommend it.\n\nGame ran absolutely flawlessly on Deck and hardly drained the Battery.\nOnly flaw in that regard is, that as of now the Deck automatically sets the resolution to 1280x720 and saves the resolution for when it is next started on PC, and to change it on PC the game has to be opened, resolution changed and restarted again. Little tedious.\n\nThe Story was the biggest surprise. No matter how you guess the Story continues, the game throws a curveball and something completely unexpected happens. And that exact scenario happened like 15 times; just when I thought I knew what would happen the game did a sharp turn and shattered my guesses.\n\nThe Combat is simple, but very fun nonetheless. You mash a lot, try to jump and dash around to avoid being hit while occasionally using items. Simple stuff, but executed very well.\n\nThere are a couple flaws I want to point out though.\nFirst of all, as many said before, translations are a little weird at times. It's not unintelligible, but it's just... off at times. You will notice the weirdness here and there in the translations, but that won't stop you from understanding the Story. If you don't understand the Story, that's just because the Story is absolutely convoluted and insane (but still great), not because of any errors in translation.\n\nAlso, the game feels a little stretched with a lot enemies being recycled throughout the end (last chapter).\n\nBut that's it already, there isn't much else for me to negatively point out.\nI had a ton of fun, more fun than I had with some Triple-A Games.\nIt certainly could profit from some improvements to the UI and its navigation as well as improved translations, but it's perfectly fun as is.

I remember the first time I saw pictures and videos of this game on Steam, I thought \"Mmh. Looks stiff\". And now that I've played it for quite some time, I have to admit: I still think the same. But on the other hand, I had a lot of fun. And this dichotomy might be at the center of Astlibra, a really fun game plagued by some technical/design flaws.\n\nFirst of all, I have to talk about not the animations but the battles. They are fun. And they're also flawed. To begin with, ALR is a very dynamic action RPG where you will jump everywhere and hit everything that comes your way. You can do some combos, use some magic skill, do some special moves like an uppercut that also works as a launcher, etc. When looking at it quickly, you could say it's a kind of character action game. You do a combo, launch your enemy, jump, continue your combo in the air and finish it with a magic skill.\n\nBut here's the first flaw of this game and the biggest one too, the total absence of hitstun. Every enemy can and will hit you in the middle of a combo, even when they're launched and you're in the air with them doing an air combo. Second flaw, the absence of readability. The game is filled with particles effects, each of your hits will hit 2 or 3 times, there are often multiple enemies on the screen so that's why it can be hard to know what's going on. A lot of time, you'll get hit by something and wonder what touched you. By the end of the game, enemies will hit very hard while the screen will look somethign straight out of a bullet hell, so you'll get hit multiple times by something you didn't see coming and lose 1/4 of your life for each hit. In the end, the combat system is the biggest flaw of the game.\n\nOne other flaw are the controls. They aren't bad, they are even responsive. No, the problem comes from the manipulations. You have to push a direction and a button to activate a special move, but in the heat of the action, it's not rare to do something else, because of how similar some moves are. One example is the possibility to launch your weapon and the launcher. To do the launcher, you have to hold the attack button and press up. To launch your weapon, you have to hold the attack button, then release it. Now, if you want to launch your weapon upward, you can see how problematic that can be.\n\nAbout the controls, there's two schools in action games: manipulations and cooldowns. Historically, arcade/console games use mostly manipulations to allow you to do special moves (Street Fighter, Guardian Heroes, etc.), while pc games use cooldowns (Diablo). Here, strangely, even though the game plays clearly like a console game and some special moves need a manipulation, some of them also have a cooldown. I guess in this particular case, it's a matter of personal taste but the game should get rid of all cooldowns to allow a more fluid gameplay.\n\nThe hitboxes also need to be adressed. It's not a game breaking problem but sometimes, you'll get hit even though you thought were out of range. One other problem with the hitboxes is how the game seems incapable of handling diagonals. If there is a slope and you run on it, your character will fall. So, every slope is in reality some kind of stairs. On the other hand, that means your character can't run towards the top of a slope, you'll have to jump.\n\nBut ALR is good. It's not a technically exceptional game, the animations are really limited, the graphics are strange with a style that use realistic background and anime characters. However, what it lacks in the technical department, it makes up for it by giving the player a lengthy game (60 hours with a lot of griding) with a lot of content and secrets, multiple endings (sadly, only the true ending gives you an achievement), a great soundtrack (with some vocaloid here and there apparently), attaching characters and a story that is \"basic\" for a JRPG but still interesting, if you know some of the clich\u00e9s that comes with the territory. It should be noted that tropes common in shounen manga are present (like an onsen sequence for example) with some jiggles physics to boot.\n\nThere is something that I also should adress right now. The game is described as a metroidvania and it's absolutely not one. You can go back to previously visited area, you can unlock skills that will let you reach new areas but those are just for items. You won't go back to a previous area to unlock a whole new one. In the contrary, ALR is a pretty \"linear\" game: you only progress forward.\n\nLike I said, Astlibra Revision is a good but flawed game, it's even a great one. But I had to point out those glaring flaws though, especially its battles. But those, in the moment to moment gameplay, are also fun. In the end, this game is clearly an indie, a game with a lot of heart and some obvious limitations. You should also know before buying that it can require some grind if you want a seamless experience.

I can't explain why it is, it just is. The heavy grinding is slightly redeemed due to how addicting and satisfying it is to mash the attack button and whip out different spells.\n\nThere is an absurd abundance to collect. You get skills, and you get weapons that you need to use to get more skills, and then you level up to get more skills, and you level up to get points, and you collect gems to get stats that also give you more skills and it just keeps going, and normally I hate it, but for some reason it's fun here, I really don't know why.\n\nI give it a recommend if you want a game with an absurd amount of content and some addicting hack and slash game play. I don't think I'm far enough into the story to know if I can recommend that yet, but I'm definitely wondering what's gonna happen next.\n\nEdit @ 30.9 hours in: The  dialogue is still really rough to get through some times. It's hard to write good RPG dialogue, but when it's read out one line at a time which is sometimes just 2 words and a bunch of ellipses, it really gets rough. However, the story has really taken shape pretty well in my opinion, and the gameplay loop is still fun.\n\nOne thing I will say is that I widely underestimated the importance of Defense and HP. All the way through [spoiler]Chapter 6[/spoiler], I had no HP, and just max Speed and Attack. [spoiler]Chapter 7[/spoiler] hit me like a truck, and I basically just switched all my level up points into Defense and HP and my damage really didn't suffer that much, but my survivability went wayyy up. Still having a good time, looking forward to the rest of the story.\n\nFinal Edit 37 hours: The story ended up being a lot more interesting than I thought it would be. [spoiler]Chapter 8[/spoiler], however, is BRUTAL. There's one enemy in particular that kind of ruined this section for me, and I knew I was close to the end, so was more just looking to get through the game which made it more annoying. I was wrong however that I was close to the end!

To put it in vague terms, the story is constantly able to keep me on the edge and give me surprises. There are a few other comments that mentions some occasional juvenile humor that really troubles them. However, it hardly bothers me and gave me a few good chuckles on occasion. But I will mention it just in case you are sensitive regarding this type of humor. \n\nThe combat of this game is also great! I never knew that having multi hit per weapon attack will feel SO GOOD. This is something that more 2D side-scrolling action combat game needs to take note. The music is freeware music that is available on the internet. But not only does it not diminish the experience, it just highlights that the freeware Japanese music creation community are masters of their craft. Every important moment is accentuated so well by the music, and quite frankly, I prefer this style of music of the vast 99% of AAA game that I have played. Many of those musics are now on my regular playlist.\n\nThank you Keizo, for spending 15 years giving us this amazing experience.

Utterly enraptured. I didn't want it to end. \n\nCombat was always an absolute blast. Well-tuned difficulty aligned perfectly with an expected and gratifying grind. Constant twists in the story to match equally compelling character growth systems. I want to call this _THE_ sidescroller RPG experience. \n\nThank you KEIZO for a game I'll never forget. \n\n---\n\nGetting into this game was so fascinating for me. ASTLIBRA evokes an air of nostalgia surrounding perhaps a respected sleeper PC-98 game, one that you've only ever seen on the periphery of game lists. A game always just out of reach but always lauded whenever mentioned... a remake of a game for another day, maybe. The art, animation, and overall design experience lend themselves [i]so[/i] well to this feeling, as if you're playing something utterly classic and uncannily familiar. This makes ASTLIBRA feel like a triumphal love-letter to the genre, obfuscating itself as a hidden lodestone. As you play you'll learn it sets a new mark, surpassing expectations set by its forebears.  \n\nGameplay was consistently engaging and rewarding. Always new techniques to try out after grinding for mastery and equips through each new zone, culminating in zany, creative abilities and combos that allow for a surprising range of builds. I recommend playing on at least Hard, since the grind makes itself worthwhile without becoming overbearing. There are some difficulty spikes around bosses-- some early ones being absolute HP sponges-- but as you experiment with your various options and find patterns you start to see how the game is really played. Hint: Possession skills give i-frames. \n\nI said earlier that the story is compelling- and it is, if you have a ounce of soul- but take this with a grain of salt... as seasoning, rather than skepticism. The translation [i]is[/i] pretty hard, yeah, especially at first. The vast majority of the game is extremely well translated at this point, but there are still some moments with typos, syntax, or strange idioms that stand out. Personally, this is a pinch of that aforementioned salt: just part of the experience of doujin/fan translated media, lending strongly to ASTLIBRA's authentic feeling. The charming episodic openers make it clear that this game was formed chapter by chapter in its original doujin publishing online and make for excellent stylistic bookends. ASTLIBRA retains a lot of sentiment this same way through its storytelling: narratives and plot spectacle shenanigans that wouldn't be out of place in a LN or anime, moments of sudden levity that strike from nowhere, and an ambient level of horniness (providing much of said levity) that matches any given classic shounen. \"Forgivably horny\" is the term I've been throwing around. Wrap your expectations within this package and you'll be a very happy camper. \n\nThe music selection and placement throughout the story are top-tier, and it makes me wince that we probably won't get a compilation for easy direct access. \"Wintering Ezo Red Fox,\" \"Go When,\" \"Black Tears and Lives to Protect,\" and especially \"Relic of Agunamonita\" are all living rent-free between my ears now and forever.\n\nThe heart, dedication, and compassion put into this game by its developer are entirely evident, and he deserves every last ounce of praise we can give. KEIZO, you can have my \"Love,\" specifically the one Porin found on the ground for me.

To use the Shaq meme, \"I have to apologize, I wasn't really familiar with your game.\"\n\nHave I changed my mind about the critiques I mentioned? No, the translation still hurts the game and the graphics are still somewhat underwhelming. However, after finishing it and experiencing it firsthand, I can say without reservation that the story is SO good that even despite the terrible translation it carries the game and makes it a must-play. I don't want to spoil anyone but it really is the sort of thing you have to experience for yourself, just hearing about it doesn't do it justice. It's been a long time since I actually felt emotionally attached to a game's characters, but this one actually did it, and I got tears in my eyes during one of the climactic fights (you guys will know the one). So yeah, I'm turning this review from negative to positive and encouraging everyone who reads it to forget my earlier churlishness and buy this game. Just try to ignore the bad translation (so far, hopefully they'll patch it soon).\n\nA couple other reasons for a positive revision. First, when you get a wider variety of combat skills, it really does become pretty satisfying and engaging. The fact that there are so many mistranslations (for instance, the description for one crucial skill says it recovers ST when it actually recovers HP) hurts it, but like I said above, they should fix it with a new translation soon. Second, while it's still not genuine Vanillaware quality, some of the boss sprites, especially near the end, do look super cool. Third, the music is MUCH better than I gave it credit for at first. Most of it is taken from free stuff, but by the end you can tell the dev became an expert at choosing good songs, as a lot of the themes and event music are absolutely perfect and wonderful to listen to, I especially love the Belkade late-game themes.\n\nFinally, more than anything else, there's one primary reason I revised my review to a positive one: One of the devs themselves (specifically the publisher) took my concerns to heart. In general, I'll almost always support a dev if they acknowledge my suggestions and make changes even if I'm dissatisfied with a game at first. I did this with They Must Be Billions, didn't like it at first but changed my negative review to positive after they released a patch making the game less annoying and adding more content. The publisher, WhisperQ, acknowledged my complaints with the translation and has mentioned there'll be a patch to fix it soon! So I'm definitely all about supporting folks who want to improve even if they've made a mistake, and I can't wait for the revamped translation so I can enjoy the game as it was really meant to be played. I now encourage all of you to buy it, support the devs, and join me!\n\n(OLD REVIEW)\nFirst solidly negative review I've written in a while, but while I really tried to give this game a fair shot, it has too many problems for me to recommend it. Despite some extremely good points--15 years of effort, an absolutely massive, in-depth combat system and art from Shigatake, one of the Vanillaware guys--the flaws of this game make it impossible for me to recommend or even justify paying 20 dollars for. Specifically, like I said, it has one of the most in-depth combat systems you can find anywhere, but the atrocious translation hurts it severely. There's a huge amount of skills to unlock, many of which are absolutely crucial, but mistranslations or outrightly incorrect translations make it very difficult to tell which skills you actually need--you need to use some of the guides friendly people on Steam have provided, which isn't acceptable for a professionally produced game. The control mapping is also absolutely terrible. Thankfully, you can change some of the more annoying button mapping, like the dash and enter room buttons being the same, but there's a shield bash move that makes some of the platforming segments nearly impossible when it activates when you don't want it to, and you can't disable that without either not using shields at all (locking yourself out of a pretty significant number of abilities and gameplay choices) or going through a bizarrely arcane method, one again described by some good steam folks. Like I also mentioned, the art from Shigatake is very nice, but unfortunately you won't find the delightful backgrounds of Odin Sphere or 13 Sentinels in this game, because the great artist just did character portraits--the backgrounds, terrain, etc. looks like cheap freeware fare. The plot, from what I've gathered, is actually relatively compelling despite how it starts off as not a basic riff off an old-school Ys style platformer, but again, the poor translation cripples its impact. As much as I wanted to love this game I cannot in good conscience recommend it, though if my refund request doesn't go through since I've beaten the first chapter, I might play through it some more if I'm stuck with it after this.

I guess I'll start by saying I love this game and I'll probably play everything this developer continues to make for the foreseeable future. That being said it also has a LOT of issues. \n\nThe game straight up lies to you. There's multiple points in the game where it tells you \"this is the final battle\" and then the game continues to give you more missions after that final battle. And not like Super Ultra, secret post final boss missions. The game literally just casually continues like it didn't just tell you it was about to end. It's like that awkward friend that says goodbye, and then continues to hang out for hooours. Which wouldn't be as bad, if that friend didn't also continue saying goodbye throughout the night. \n\nThe game lying to you is made even worse by the fact that there's a lot of mistranslations too, so not only is the game lying, but you're also being given just completely untrue information. \n\nAnd I understand this next point comes with the territory of making a game centralized around Time Travel as a theme, but Astlibra really takes it too far. Killing off and resurrecting characters multiple times really desensitizes you and trivializes any sense of tragedy. There was one character that died in a bad timeline because I made a bad choice. I struggled tooth and nail to save her, and was so relieved to have her back, only for her to die again in another timeline, and then revived again because I went even further back in time and did something that undid it all. Again. This doesn't happen once, twice, or even just three times. It happens a LOT to multiple characters. And it's a shame, because I actually cared a lot about every single character that was introduced, until they were killed and resurrected for the fifth time. \n\nThe combat is fun, but only if you unlock everything. And I cannot fathom why the developer hid some of the combat mechanics as secrets. One of the early game skills you have to really go out of your way to unlock is a jump slash. And if you miss this secret skill, you essentially go through the whole game not knowing that air combos exist, because you have no way of launching enemies into the air. It really feels like a bad oversight to have splintered these essential skills off as secrets. And it wouldn't be so bad if the secrets were easy to find, but a lot of them are really obtuse. \n\nAnd the last thing I'll touch upon is that the game has too many twists. There were several versions of the story I liked, but each of those stories then got undermined by another new twist that revealed that was never the real story all along, all along. \nFor example, there's a \"main story ending\" that is probably one of the more incoherent and straight up idiotic endings I've ever seen. But then there's a New Game+ that is supposedly just extra content, but at some point it continues to main story and fixes the ending by making it all actually just a dream. I accept this, because the main story ending was REALLY bad, but it really leaves you scratching your head if the NG+ content is canon then, because it specifically refers to itself as just extra content. This goes back to what I was saying about the game straight up lying versus misinformation. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game and recommend it, but expect to be left very conflicted. There's simultaneously so much good and so much bad, I'll be very surprised to find anyone that just straight likes or dislikes this game.", "timestamp_created": 1679564358, "timestamp_updated": 1679564358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135191683": {"recommendationid": "135191683", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997942711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 864, "last_played": 1680126597}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me start this review by saying that I NEVER post or review games, even if I absolutely love them.\n\nThat being said, this game hits SO many buttons, that I cant even do it justice, so here I am, helplessly trying to convey into words what this game has done to me.\n\nAstlibra is by no means a perfect game; it can be clunky at times, have lazy or simple animations, and easy to read and obvious foreshadowing in its story.\nTaking that to account, I have NEVER been so moved by a game before.

I didn't expect much, but it was a nice ride. The game is simple, but the music, boss variety, design is absolutely gorgeous. The story was kind of cheesy, but note that this was made for more than a decade, so if you're ready to expect a 10-year-old style theme, delivery, you're in for a nice, warm ride.\n\nEDIT: I'd also like to point out that about 40% of players finished this game, with about 30% finishing the extra story. Most AAA \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" games out there do not have this kind of completion rate. This is one solid evidence of how great this game is.\n\nPROS:\n- Addictive combat. While it can be simplistic, it is very satisfying in a sense. It's not as pretty as other modern games of its kind though.\n- GREAT progression. Character progression is very, very good. If you take a little bit of time to grind A LITTLE, you can pretty much reach and grab all missables as you progress through the story.\n- Railroaded, but you can revisit other stages. So you missed an item from a stage? You can go ahead and go back to it after you finish your current \"chapter\".\n- No missables. In connection to bullet 2, this game very much respects the player's time. If I miss something from a stage, I can go back. Before I finished the game, it warned me that I can no longer go back if I progress, so there is always a clear indicator if I'm about to miss some stuff.\n- Finish the game now, or play more. You can finish the game with a \"good\" ending, but you can play more. I'm not going to spoil it, but this game is about 50-60h long storywise.\n- Endearing and engaging story. It's a 10-year-old theme, and you can see how the cheesy interactions supports how long this took to deliver. But it's very endearing, heartwarming, and the twists and plot, while not over-the-top, are very good.\n- Very, VERY good character development. Each character is very much developed properly with their own backstory, and not just simple backstories, but intertwine through your own to build theirs. They are VERY much fleshed out, and they are just not some lame background. You will learn to remember and appreciate each character, not just because they have their own motivations, but their story doesn't end when they met you, their story goes on as yours does.\n\nCONS:\n- Animations are limited. Animations themselves, like joint twists and physics look like the old Flash games. But they are not that bad, just looks old.\n- Bad translations. While the translations were somehow fixed in a lot of places, there's still some awkward translations in a lot of spots, and line breaks where it isn't necessary. Some of the jokes and parody can't be appreciated to their full potential because of these awkward translations, but the story still overpowers these bad translations because it's really nice.\n- Bad translations on skills. Some skills, called KARON can be VERY confusing. This is also due to translation, but the information that some of the skills give are extremely unclear in what they do.\n- Why do I have to keep watching the intro movie each time I finish a chapter?\n- Why does the grow board give infinite keys on the very last and bottom node if there's nothing to use it for?\n- Some few imbalances, but these do not make you OP or gimp you, it just feels it could've been fleshed out more, but the developers didn't because there wasn't really anything you could use it for.\n- Lack of \"infinite replay\" endgame. Because of the design philosophy of the developer, the endgame is revolved and heavily tied to the story as well. You can grind a little to max out everything, but basically the \"infinite replayability\" is tied to a 4-level procedurally generated dungeon that has 3 variants of themes. Not a big problem, because this game wasn't designed for that. It's great the developers tried to incorporate something for people who can't get enough of the game though.\n\nAll in all, this game was worth every penny. There is great progression, very good variety of enemies, bosses (more then Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild), and the best feature that I personally like, VERY VERY good character development.\n\nBuy it full price. It's worth every penny you drop, and don't let the limited animations in combat disappoint you. Play for a few hours and it'll grow on you and you'll suddenly find yourself trying to finish it and unlock everything!", "timestamp_created": 1678992943, "timestamp_updated": 1678993655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134702803": {"recommendationid": "134702803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076953064", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3098, "last_played": 1678031357}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ! story so rich", "timestamp_created": 1678890261, "timestamp_updated": 1678890261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134695154": {"recommendationid": "134695154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015450864", "num_games_owned": 743, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 9552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9184, "last_played": 1680719158}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed a ton of aspects about this game, and while it isn't the perfect game it does many things really well :)\n\n\nGameplay 9/10\nI felt like the movement in this game felt so fun especially once you get more upgrades/levels. Gets a lot more challenging when you play at a higher difficulty and you master the movement. I really enjoyed the leveling mechanics and looting as well. There are a lot of weapons you can choose from and upgrade, and each weapon has its own uniqueness to it which felt nice. Also have to mention that there are a plethora of difficulties to choose from so it doesn't matter if you are the most casual gamer or extreme. I will say I played on hard which felt very challenging for myself, and I don't think I would have the patience to play on the 2 higher difficulties lol\n\nMusic 8/10\nReally enjoyed the music, I felt like every song fit very nicely with what was going on in the game. I thought it was funny how later on in the game they started to use more vocaloid, shoutouts to Hatsune Miku lol. If you are a vocaloid/dnb/jrpg style music fan you will enjoy the OST pretty easily. Some dubstep wubwub in the ost which I'm not the biggest fan of but it was fine. PS I think there is over 100 tracks? There's a ton of music.\n\nVisuals 9/10\nI noticed a lot of people in the reviews are saying this game looks ugly? I don't think those players made it very far in the game because there are a lot of really nice looking backgrounds/scenery, awesome looking bosses and some unique style animations. Maybe this style of visual is not for them I guess. A lot of scenery in the game looks fantastic especially if you can make it to the later stages of the game (final boss fight for example was one of the sickest looking things I've seen in gaming). In terms of 2D visuals this is a very nice looking game.\n\nReplayability 8/10\nI'd say this game definitely has some decent replay value especially in the post game where they add a lot of roguelike elements like randomized dungeons with a new loot system where you can further upgrade your skills and weaponry to give you way more customization than you thought you already had before the post game story. For me personally I don't think I will come back to the game for quite some time because I felt like it was just so much grinding to 100% the game so it kind of wore me out but I could definitely see myself coming back to play again at some point. If you are a completionist I will admit it is a challenge, there is a lot of hard things to find and you have to do a lot of grinding but if you really like the game it will feel just right, maybe a bit overwhelming at times. \n\nStory 9/10\nAs many other reviewers said it definitely starts slow but it ramps up like crazy especially near the end, I was extremely invested in the characters and progression, always wanting to know what was going to happen next. KEIZO the dev definitely went hard with this story and you could tell a lot of their passion went into this story. You ever seen those commercials where you think it's over but then they are like \"BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE\" THIS GAME HAS THAT WRITTEN ALL OVER IT LOL NOT GONNA LIE. A lot of times you think you are done there is way more to do, I swear the amount of \"final boss\" fights I thought would end the game did not end the game and there was always something else in the story popping up to keep it going. If you enjoyed the game enough to make it to the end of the main story I highly recommend doing the post game content because there is actually a lot more to the story after the game initially \"ends\"\n\nPrice 10/10\nAs far as pricing in the US the game is $24.99 I think that is perfectly acceptable for a game of this caliber. As you can see I have 100+ hours invested into the game and almost enjoyed every single minute of it. \n\nOverall 9/10\nI noticed the game getting some flack in the negative reviews and I just don't think this is the kind of game for them. I must say don't click \"Add to cart\" blindly for the sole reason of seeing \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" reviews. If you enjoy JRPGs, Metroidvania style games, 2D sidescrolling, looting/upgrade system, decent story telling etc this will be right up your alley.  \n\nIf you want a passionate game made by a passionate game developer this is the one. \n\nThank you KEIZO and all involved.

It was previously translated even worse, to make players believe they would deal more damage under certain circumstances.

Yes. 100% yes.\n\nNow for the explanation. Gameplay spoilers ahead.\n\nThis game is a bundle of good ideas. You've got so many ways to improve your character. The weapons, shields and armors you get have a dedicated EXP gauge, and when it's maxed out, you get either a new passive that you can toggle in a separate menu or a boost of its stats along with a crystal. Said crystal is used to equip passives BUT if you equip the piece of stuff that gave you a passive, then you can equip the passive for free. Long story short, think FF9 or Tactics.\n\nWhen you level up, you get 5 gems that you can allocate among HP, ATQ, DEF, MAG, SPD, LUC and ADA. The first 4 are obvious, SPD allows you to wield your weapons faster and to go further with your shield bash, LUC nets you more exp per enemy defeated as well as more loots of course. ADA, for adaptability, is a niche stat which allows you to make the breathing gauge last longer when your character is underwater. Basically, you never up it except when needed. In case you're worrying about a bad choice, don't fret, you can change the allocation at every level up as well as at a spot in the shops here and there.\n\nAt some point, you get a set of scales, on which you can put items from your inventory, granting you several effects, which work at best when the scales are, as a certain Marvel villain would say, perfectly balanced. As you advance, you'll get more scales, to put more items and activate more effects.\n\nThere's also a massive tree similar to FF10, in which you expend Force, a currency dropped by enemies, to earn more stats, as well as bonus crystals and pieces of stuff. The clever part is that it's blocked at several points, and you need to advance in the story to go further.\n\nThe gameplay is terrifyingly efficient, and once you've got a nice stuff, you mow enemies like there's no tomorrow.\n\nThe story is quite nice, with some plot twists. There are a few mistakes here and there, but nothing that would stop you from understanding the plot.\n\nA little negative aspect would be that there are some \"false choices\", leading you to the main screen and making you load your game. Fortunately, the game is generous in the number of save points, and when such a choice is ahead, there's often a save point right before.\n\nIf you've read this all, congratulations, but... why are you still reading instead of playing this game ?", "timestamp_created": 1678036914, "timestamp_updated": 1678036914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134104684": {"recommendationid": "134104684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167567665", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3070, "last_played": 1678008854}, "language": "english", "review": "fun action side scroller with interesting story about time travel, albeit with cheesy delivery, packed with gigantic scantily clad anime girls.\n\nthe game is grindy, the exploration and level design is meh. boss fights are okay. funnily enough, the earlier bosses are harder than the later ones. late game bosses are easy with all the tools you are given (seriously, Eliminate Karon skill is fkin OP) and how easy it is to be overlevelled. because of that, the [spoiler]young anulis[/spoiler] fight is my favorite, as it strips you of your powers.\n\nstill, it's still a fun game that managed to keep me interested all the way through.", "timestamp_created": 1678004710, "timestamp_updated": 1678011087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134102476": {"recommendationid": "134102476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135155831", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 648, "last_played": 1680941605}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has taught me cakes make the best weapons.", "timestamp_created": 1678001594, "timestamp_updated": 1678001594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134082780": {"recommendationid": "134082780", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984849765", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1678335055}, "language": "english", "review": "so.... good.... play this.", "timestamp_created": 1677974474, "timestamp_updated": 1677974474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134018242": {"recommendationid": "134018242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043108500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 728, "playtime_forever": 5430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5430, "last_played": 1677900676}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally beat this game, and I have to say this game has my expectations off the charts, blew me right out of the water. KEIZO did an amazing job creating this game, making it feel like a beautiful work of art.\n\nSo heres what you need to know about this game.\n\nThis game pretty much welcomes any gamers thats into 2D JRPG games, as it has 5 difficulty settings. Easy, Normal, Hard, Hell, and Impossible. A Action RPG game that involves hacking and slashing your way through the levels.\n\nCombat is amazing, the level up system and the \"grow\" system is extremely helpful and fair to those that struggles to beat certain levels. Making it more easier for you to progress if its too hard. This game also doesnt lose its charm when it comes to challenges for those that wants the game to be hard. Feel free to try Hell or Impossible difficulty if you want that sort of challenge. Casual players can try out Easy mode which shouldnt be so much of a struggle. Even so regardless of the case, the level up system will help your character get stronger it'll reduce the difficulty.\n\nPlot, amazing. Very beautiful. If anyone has played Chrono Trigger, you'll enjoy this game without doubt. No turn based game this time though, just pure 2D action adventure game. There are choices in this game but it doesnt really matter MUCH but there is a certain reward thats very important plot wise. But dont worry, if you miss it, theres always a chance for you to get it in the future. I wont spoil much about it.\n\nThe story is full of emotions. You'll be amazed, you'll cry, you'll laugh. It has such wonderful feelings that would get you to feel more connected to this game and the characters.\n\nGot any doubts or having trouble whether you should buy this game or not? At least play the demo and see for yourself. I can assure you this game is VERY much worth to get. My hours already said enough how much I enjoy this and the gameplay length is LONG.\n\nThank you KAIZO for such an amazing experience, truly unforgettable. Theres alot more I really wanted to say, but I dont know what. Its just too good for words how amazing this game is. Strongly recommend buying it, at least try the demo if you are unsure. Its too good to pass it out, you'll miss out if you dont try it all the way to the end.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention.\n\nFuture note: The game has multiple endings and some will end it early, whatever choice you make go back and choose the opposite because the story progression keeps going. If you beat the game, save and load back in because theres more. You dont want to miss this.

The weapon mastery system ensures that you're always trying out new gear so the combat never stagnates, the magic, growth, and spell systems are very well done, and the post game equipment boards and weapon upgrade systems add everything you need to keep the game feeling fresh from the very first level to the true final boss mechanically, and the story has plenty of turns to keep you engaged the whole time.\n\nNormally I'm a bit more reserved in my reviews, but honestly?

Gameplay and story go hand-in-hand, making what I would consider a near perfect game for players seeking an RPG experience.\n\nThis is one of the few games in years that has genuinely held my interest from start to finish and I would highly recommend playing this to anyone looking for a challenge, looking for a story, or looking for a fun game.\nThank you KEIZO!!!", "timestamp_created": 1677322962, "timestamp_updated": 1677322962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723086237907409668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133533080": {"recommendationid": "133533080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050016667", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2507, "last_played": 1686284742}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game. It's really special to me. I played a bit of the demo and thought to myself \"the combat is kinda nice and the story seems a bit interesting.\"\n\nIt gets better. It gets really good. The equipment system works out really well since it incentivizes trying most weapons you can buy, which in turn makes you farm the areas you explore. There is grinding involved, but I never felt it was excessive.\n\nThere are plenty of secrets, which mostly involve paying a attention to your surroundings. Some are hidden kind of cleverly, making you think \"Aha, I got it.\"\n\nThe bosses are made really well. The patterns are fun and predictable, but varied. When I die, I rarely felt like it was an unfair death. Some bosses feel like they have a lot of HP, but it is reasonable (except for one boss, which I loathe)\n\nThere is a NG+ mode, but it is a significant change up from your first play-through, to the point where it could be considered a part 2 of the normal campaign.\n\nThe writing is .. cute. Sometimes a bit awkward, but I found the characters endearing. The story is different enough from your normal JRPG-plot to stand out, even if it sometimes falls back on the same tropes. The MC is probably the weakest one.\n\nAll in all, the game is one of the most enjoyable ones I've played in a long time.

Like everything else, it has pros and cons. But in my opinion after playing for 250+ hours and beating it three times in a row (including on highest difficulty - impossible mode), I\u2019m still not satisfied enough to drop this game and move on. \n\nI won't spoil the plot, cause you have to see it yourself. It's good. Like the old one Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross games. But in gameplay it's something else, action RPG side-scroller with Castlevania spirit in mind, I think. You can say that gameplay is highly repetitive, but very promising. You always learn new moves, mechanics, and styles. You can choose what build your character will use, and so on. \n\nThere are classic archetypes, like a sword master or archer, mage. But you can be above that. Berserk blood mage sword master - all-in-one? Spirit master with \"minions\"? Ninja with multiple escape (evade) mechanics? Paladin tank with reflection? Abnormal stats glass-cannon carry?\n\nWell, you can become everyone you want. And you can actually change all your skills, equipment and everything in fight, in real time.\n\nThe problem is that game is highly complex. It was made by one person with high hopes of ARPG game for himself to play with. So, many strange ideas were implemented in the game. If you are not common with old-school gameplay features, where you must think outside the box, well you could stuck. For example, many tools are locked inside battles with very though enemies. When I say very tough, I mean it. Sometimes I checked if I\u2019m playing souls-like game. \n\nWell, on the easy difficulty fights are boring. You can get literally a stick and beat everything with ease from start to end. But I think if you want a competitive gameplay where you must use all to win, play on hard difficulty and higher.\n\nSo, I want to say thanks to KEIZO and WhisperGames, it's a cool game.", "timestamp_created": 1676455027, "timestamp_updated": 1676455027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132801164": {"recommendationid": "132801164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126091737", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 5561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5560, "last_played": 1676408110}, "language": "english", "review": "9.2/10\n-Amazing Game just play it\n\n*Also this game is pretty much 2 games in one, after you beat the game the story continues and it's pretty much a whole new game which is pretty awesome.

The graphic style of cobbled-together assets is incredibly charming, the effects are varied and bombastic and the game is as over-the-top in both plot and visuals as you would expect from a game of this genre. It plays incredibly fluidly and is highly customizable - one-handed weapon and shield, staffs, two-handed weapons, magic and so on. You can put force you gain from enemies into a kind of attribute sphere board, think FF-X, and level up weapons and armor. To describe every aspect of this game would probably make this review a bit too long, but all parts of the game fit together perfectly to create a very fun experience.\n\nThe game is a *bit* too long, which is especially owed to the additional  chapter which just essentially rehashes most of what you have already done, with only a few new things near the end, though the fun gameplay balances it out. Depending on your difficulty setting, the game can also get very grindy; I recommend Normal for a balanced but still challenging experience. Something that irritated me as well was that some bosses can get very cheesy or just have too much going on on the screen, resulting in some quick deaths; and restarting the boss battle immediately does not refill your consumables like in most other games, which can be frustrating. The game's story is the perfect mix of convoluted and engaging, but some of the dialogue suffers from some iffy translation errors and some of the more \"adult\" themes in this game made me raise an eyebrow or two.\n\nStill, ASTLIBRA is a fantastic experience. It's fast-paced, fun JRPG goodness with plenty to do, and there is even a demo! And as a special mention, the soundtrack of the game rocks - it has rocking battle music, vocal rap tracks, dirty dubstep beats, heartfelt melodies and anything else you can imagine.

Only a negative in the sense that the game could have done more with this facet of the game.\n- Also, at endgame your weapon almost doesn\u2019t matter because overall gear power is dictated by special drops that add insane amounts of stats or modify abilities, so your random drops play a greater role in your weapon selection than weapon characteristics.\n* Some amount of grinding is needed especially at the harder difficulty levels and against the optional bosses.  However, the grinding in this game was fun and did not get old for me, and it wasn\u2019t an excessive amount of grind.

One of those games that you gotta play to get it I guess.\n\nAccordingly I'll just do a quick breakdown of the game features. \n\n[h1]The good stuff[/h1]\nThe game is 2d side scrolling action game with a strong emphasize on character progression. A dedicated post would be required to give a in-depth explanation of all the various features related to character progression. So if you're into character building just know that the game has plenty to offer.\n\nDo note that the game isn't a metroidvania, you go through the levels in a linear fashion, you do not need to come back later on (you can however if you wish, grinding or missed stuff for example). There are plenty of secrets to find though, even basic moves like dodging (back step) can be \"hidden\" for example. Keep your eyes peeled!\n\nThe battle system can seem button mashy but will become a lot more \"tactical\" the higher the difficulty and the more you progress through the game (do note that you can become quite OP during the post game).\nOnce I got a good understanding of the mechanics I really started having a blast.\n\nDepending on the difficulty, the game expects you to grind moderately to heavily. However it's actually not that bad. You have plenty of reasons to do so and since the game is also an action skill based game, it give you an plenty of excuses to level up your skill as a player.\n\n[EDIT:\nAs you can tell from the reviews, the game is [b]lengthy[/b]. There's really a lot of content especially for the genre. I didn't get \"burned\" but some people might. This here is no casual game].\n\n\n[h1]The bad stuff[/h1]\nThe writing is really not to my liking, I find it be all over the place, messy, very convenient in some parts and quite hard to follow. It can be related to the very poor level of the English translation, quite expected from a JP inde one man project tbf. But still, it's barely above google translate.  Luckily you can skip cut scenes (there are loads of them btw).\nA poorly translated story is one thing, but when it also impacts the better aspects of the game like skill descriptions, it becomes really annoying. \n\nAnother reviewer said that the game had a bit of male fandom, I found it to be quite an elegant way to put it.  I personally found that some parts of the game had a distinctive pervy tone sometime worthy of a hentai doujinshi intro.\nNot really about being prude or anything but more about being really embarrassed for the writer. Felt like out of place poorly worded teenager fantasies that don't add anything.\nIt's a jp thing though, dragon quest games have always been a bit \"naughty\" for example. So yeah [i]lost in translation[/i] for me I guess.\n\nYou'll probably have to resort to guides to progress through some parts of the game. It's sometime not really clear what you're supposed to do.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nDespite the negatives, I still think the game (thanks to the gameplay) is a must play, fully deserving the overwhelming positive reviews.\n\nJust wanted to end the review saluting the 15 years journey that KEIZO (the lone dev) took to make this game.

And in some sense, it really is\u00a0\u2014 being mostly made by a single person over 15 years. It is one of the comfiest games I've played, with difficulty tuned to be just right (I beat the game on Hard), the grind being just long enough not to become dull, the progression giving you new things to look up to and think about often enough to keep the combat from turning stale, and the story always throwing curveballs to keep you on your toes and prevent you from guessing what's going to happen next.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the closest comparisons I can draw are Dust: An Elysian Tail, and the Ys series. The former being a straightforward action platformer with a robust combat system. The linear structure and the fast-paced, action-oriented gameplay are rather refreshing in this age of endless roguelites and metroidvanias. The latter having a classic JRPG story about fighting against seemingly insurmountable odds to save your loved ones. After falling out of touch with modern JRPGs that either overload you with a dozen of proper nouns in the first hour and try to involve you in some political conflict; or simply being about a bunch of whiny school children (and often being very problematic about it) doing stupid things but still coming on top of incredibly incompetent adults this game's story is anime, but in a good way\u00a0\u2014 in the same way as TTGL or DBZ is.\n\nAstlibra starts slow in every sense of the word. The game begins with a lengthy cutscene (the textbox even warns you that the intro is long and absent of action), slow and simple combat, and a bare minimum of RPG progression. But over the course of 60-80h, it really ramps up, only dropping the tempo a handful of times, but never entirely stopping until the very end of the 3rd ending. What initially began as a search for your childhood friend turns into a time-travel adventure involving gods of inner and outer realms, multiple intertwined storylines, and a sizeable cast of major and episodic characters. A relatively slow and simplistic attack-and-block combat turns into an air-juggling and spell-slinging visual feast.\nA basic STR/DEF/MAG RPG system expands multiple times, unlocking more and more ways to affect your character stats and abilities, including, but not limited to systems similar to NieR: Automata's Plug-in Chips, FF X Sphere Grid, and FF Tactics' Equipment abilities.\n\nPS: I almost forgot to mention an absolute banger of a soundtrack, consisting primarily of a Vocaloid-infused drum and bass EDM tracks straight from '00-'10, with an occasional brostep thrown into the mix. While it might not be everybody's cup of tea, it definitely works well for the action and the story that it frames and deserves to be called one of the most daring soundtrack choices in my recent memory.", "timestamp_created": 1675016516, "timestamp_updated": 1675018983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707108497619628906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131815844": {"recommendationid": "131815844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064647026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6067, "last_played": 1675008109}, "language": "english", "review": "What a surprise.

It is probably as good as it can get for a side-view, button-masher action RPG.\n\nGameplay:\nWalk left or right and mash the attack button.  Also has a good variety of special moves any many different weapons and items with different attacks.  It has grinding, but there are multiple systems that progress together as you grind, so the grinding is not so bad.\n\nGraphics:\nLooks alot like a playstation game.  I think this is good overall for this type of game.  There are too many effects overall which makes it very difficult to tell exactly what is going on so the game gets stuck as a button masher since you can't see through the sparkles well enough to use strategy.  Would have liked an option to turn off the motion trail and any other distracting, pointless effects.  The artist appears to be obsessed with breasts.\n\nSound:\nHas a great soundtrack.  Also has a music player option from the main menu so that you can listen to the music.  The music that I could actually hear was mostly pretty good and was varied.  Unfortunately, the sound is poorly implemented in game.  The volume changes dramatically very often.  So much so, that you will need to keep changing the volume or will need to set it so low that you can only hear the loudest music or you can get super blasted by the 1000x as loud audio in any action area.  This is very disappointing.  The game even lowers the volume by a great amount when opening the menu.  Going from story scene to action area sounds about 1000x lower.  I just set volume so that the action area sounded right so every other part of game was not audible.  Games should stop doing this nonsense and just normalize  the music to the same volume in every context.  At least we need an option.  Combat areas should not be louder than other areas.\n\nStory:\nIt starts off slow, but picks up and does a good job to transition through the chapters.  It is interesting to see what which happen, but is similar to other RPG stories.  It is pretty good for what it is for.  Does a good job of making you want to play the next chapter to see what happens.  Only big negative is there is idiotic adolescent humor which breaks the mood in almost every serious scene and makes it appear that the author is very immature and may have a sexual problem or some problem with women or is just an idiot.

I can think of no other word to describe it. Calling it a diamond in the rough would be doing it a disservice, because the only thing rough about it is the localization being just a little bit spotty at times (but never enough to be an issue, I have to stress).\n\nThe gameplay is fairly basic, but it evolves as you get further and you can customize your loadout a fair bit. In the beginning, your moveset is quite limited, but you will quickly find yourself unlocking more options that dramatically increase your versatility, as well as alter your approach to combat. One of the greatest strengths of the combat system in this game is that you can re-allocate your stats at will at zero cost at almost any point in time. If you want to be more tanky at the cost of your damage output, you can do that. If you want to have far more potent magic, but be squishy, you can do that. Want to make your attacks obscenely powerful at the cost of dying in one hit? You better believe you can do that. It offers an insane amount of freedom when it comes to how to approach any given fight, and I frequently found myself changing my stats and weapon loadout to better suit a new challenge.\n\nThe music, weirdly, is phenomenal. One of my favorite tracks in the game, I discovered, was a vocaloid track from almost a decade ago, which was pretty shocking. The variety of songs and how well they are used really caught me off guard, and there is a surprising amount of certified bangers included. If you had a vocaloid phase, or just listen to a lot Japanese music in general, you'll probably like a lot of the songs this game throws at you.\n\nGraphically speaking, it's obviously not gonna win any awards, and the animations are a little on the stiff side, but your character's armor and weapon actually do affect how their sprite looks. Literally every single weapon and armor piece, and even some accessories, dramatically alter your sprite, which is a frankly absurd amount of effort to put in. I went through most of the game using sub-optimal gear just because I liked how it looked.\n\nLastly, I have to mention the story, and I have nothing but praise for it. I very rarely get invested in stories, but this one caught me hook, line, and sinker. I've ruined my sleep schedule staying up late to play this game because I just had to find out what happened next. I implore you to go in as close to blind as you can, so that nothing gets spoiled for you, because the twists and turns this rollercoaster of a story throws at you are genuinely some of the best I've seen in any video game, ever.\n\nThe sheer amount of content is also staggering, and it's all well-made. There are some instances of bosses being reused, but it was never distracting or even close to being a bother. I cannot stress enough just how much content is crammed into this game, and how it just keeps going and going long after I thought it would be over.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I love this game more than I can possibly express with words, and if you have even the slightest interest in this type of game (or even if you don't and are just feeling experimental!), you owe it to yourself to give it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1674515791, "timestamp_updated": 1674516062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131425436": {"recommendationid": "131425436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030770901", "num_games_owned": 926, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5833, "last_played": 1674507545}, "language": "english", "review": "If Elden Ring didn't exist, this would've been GOTY 2022.

If the Scale of Destiny favors a soul, it destroys the fate of another. Will you change this balance, or cast your eyes aside? Is it true that your choices bear no responsibilities? Is it true that you committed no crimes?[/i]\n\nDo you ever know from the very moment a title screen hits you're about to play an all-time great? The PC-98 music hits, the moonlit background descends, and I knew instantly Astlibra was about to become one of my favorite games.\n\nThere's something to be said for the sheer freedom of expression allowed when one has absolute authority over their creative expression, especially in a culture like Japan routinely producing off-kilter ideas. Keizo is, like any good Japanese artist, fucking horny. You thought Takahashi was horny while directing Xenoblade 2? Nah, fam. Astlibra is plagued with scantily clad titty beasts. Plant monsters whose only censorship is her vines, floating bodies without appendages but no deficit of cleavage, goddesses whose battle armor is lingerie, [i]individual boob physics on each breast[/i], and a year's supply of juvenile sex humor you've seen in literally every ecchi you've ever watched. To really round off the sentiment, there's a traditionally JRPG colosseum-like arena with individual matches and one of those matches is titled \"Harem\" in which you have to slay every degenerate demon the game has ever thrown at you. Keizo is fucking horny.\n\nKeizo is also, like any good Japanese artist, fucking [i]extra[/i]. This man has read his fair share of visual novels, clearly loves time travel, and probably threw every idea he ever had over its development time at the wall and performed mad science to fuse it all together. This design philosophy extends to the gameplay for sure, but I'll come back to that later, because there's a phenomenal story here if you can make sense of it all.\n\nTime travel is fascinating; even when it's riddled with plot holes it's gotta be one of my favorite genres. There's not a lot of \"meaningful\" choices in Astlibra, but there are choices, you can make the wrong ones, and you will feel the weight of them. There's VN-style epilogue-like \"dead ends\" (not always bad endings, necessarily). But most importantly, Astlibra's central theme is its opening tagline: life is a series of choices, and every time you make a choice to help someone, to save someone, you hurt or lose someone else. You could have the literal tools of God in your hands with the ability to correct any history you saw fit, but the butterfly effect unfolds -- what will you lose in the process?\n\nChapter 7 really struck an emotional chord with me, one that all-time greats like Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica have, when the price of obsession was made manifest. What are you willing to sacrifice for your obsession? I watched a dry comedy-drama called Russian Doll last year, also a time travel story, and a certain character described something they termed a \"Coney Island moment\": your one past decision where everything went to hell. You made one catastrophic decision, however inconsequential it seemed at the time, tugging the lynchpin that kept your entire life together, and the butterfly effect surely unfolds. Astlibra's thesis is thus: if you could reverse time and undo the \"Coney Island moment,\" sacrificing all the bonds and memories you made in the process, would you, and could you live with the consequences afterward? So many ideas are thrown into the story & lore it can be difficult to untangle, and yeah, I'm pretty sure it's riddled with plot holes (although I'll note that by the end it *felt* like every loose end was resolved), but if you can untangle the mess and bask in the distinctly Japanese zaniness, it packs some serious emotional weight.\n\n[i]If you choose one, you lose another. I made my choice by weighing my options on the Scales.[/i]\n\nThe over-the-top design philosophy is infused into the gameplay as much as the narrative. By the postgame there are four different progression systems, a wide variety of techs with near-infinite build options and the ability to respec whenever you want.  I finished the game on hard, and it was fucking hard. My final clock time -- getting 100%, including achievements -- was 61.5 hours, and Steam registers a playtime of 95 hours. There's idle time in there for sure, but that demonstrates well over a dozen hours of lost progress because there is no autosave and trash mobs can fucking rip you a new one. By chapter 5 or so, it's entirely practical to be dying within 3 hits.\n\nCombat is visceral and the gameplay loop is crack. You will be [i]swarmed[/i] by fields of mobs as you hack 'n' slash your way through them, manipulating your iframes, guard gauge, cleverly hidden techniques, and Karon build to steamroll them as efficiently as possible, the gamepad rumbling in your hands with every slash, the frustration of playing what often feels like a 2D soulslike where every input matters, dying, dying dying to trash. Every chapter has its own equipment section with materials dropped by mobs only found in that chapter, accompanied by a super streamlined and super rewarding crafting system, making it sinfully easy to blow 5 minutes grinding for a few more mats to purchase that next available weapon. The game rewards grinding almost [i]too[/i] well.\n\nThe game's biggest flaw is how it reeks of early-to-mid 00s development. The gameplay loop is simple. The shitty ESL translation steals heavily from American idioms, like \"using the John,\" in ways that just make zero sense within the setting's context, yet it's nonetheless nostalgic to a time of mediocre VN translations (Tohsaka's anus is defenseless), shitty anime subs, and downloading new episodes on BitTorrent then burning them to your DVD while posting screenshots of your ripped DVD collections on fan forums. The puzzles and platforming are excruciatingly retro; satisfying in their own way, but to solve them you have to think about them from a design perspective of a different era. You literally walk through glitches in the scenery to solve puzzles. Secret treasures in the game are well hidden in fucking pixel-sized green arrows, in the late game behind scenery, obstacles, and other hurdles making them, frankly, impossible to find unless you have a treasure guide up, and I absolutely recommend one to the side while playing. It's borderline cozy how there are virtually zero guides available online because it's so niche and playing it draws you into a real community; but there is a treasure guide, you should use it, and expect that otherwise, you will probably have to figure shit out on your own.\n\nEverything comes into harmony to produce a grossly addictive game as I was propelled from literally the first 30 minutes to see the plot unfold, yearning to see the story's earliest and most harrowing mysteries resolved -- in most cases, far differently than I could have ever imagined.\n\n[i]Struggling to regain what I lost made me lose everything else.[/i]\n\nIt's rare these days I can play a game and not levy a dumptruck load's complaints at it; I'm aging and I have a lot to bitch about it. A game's worth isn't so much defined by its flaws as it is how much its draws transcend those flaws. Astlibra is a gem. It's uniquely its own, there's so much to digest, and its creative expression is something you can really only get out of a game developed by one KEIZO for 16 years. The sort of poetic beauty to it all: the slice-of-life adventure of handling a new town's dilemmas every chapter; your guild master opening each chapter with a spine-tingling, heartrending summary of whose woes you must resolve; to see a VN-style opening theme at the end of EVERY FUCKING CHAPTER; all in a spacetime transcending romantic epic in pursuit of your first love.

Heavy weapons feel exactly like magic weapons which feel exactly like shortswords. Combat appears flashy but is pretty shallow when you get into it. It boils down to find the summon with iFrames and abuse it while you spam whatever attack most efficiently builds up the summon gauge. The game feels like it's running at a lower FPS than it is because of all the slowdown when you hit an enemy with a weapon. Combat is like a vintage car, very pretty but you wouldn't want to drive it to work. \n\nArt wise, in screenshots it looks incredible - but the animations don't feel fluid. Most enemies and characters feel like cardboard cutouts stuck on ice-cream sticks. Character animations look like they were created with motion tween, 10 000 layers in Photoshop and blutac. Personal taste though - your mileage may vary.\n\nPeople are really hype on the story - leading me to assume they played the game in Japanese or Chinese because some translations to English feel, for lack of a better term, constipated? (Like they're nearly right but still not quite there and it's really difficult to squeak it out and get a good flow going).

If you like long action JRPGs and collecting equipment you will love this game.\n\nPros:\n\n- story\n\n- tons of equipment and skills to collect\n\n- a lot of enemy variety and plenty of bosses\n\n- music is really exceptional\n\n- long (70h+)\n\n- plenty of options for builds and variables to play with\n\n- only 1 missable achievement (play the game on hard or higher)\n\n- arena challenges (mostly normal battles but there are some dps checks and a bit of a puzzle fights too)\n\n- you can skip cutscenes\n\n- bossfight checkpoints between boss phases (with 1 exception for some unknown reason, maybe an oversight)\n\n- situational humor, no modern day politics or meme/celebrity references\n\n- over 100 save slots for your game saving needs\n\nNeutral:\n\n- if you are underleveled you will be 1 shot, if you are overfarmed you will just steamroll. I played the game on Hell difficulty which is next to last and honestly it wasn't so bad. Last difficulty makes the enemies too spongy for my taste for most of the game and Hell was perfect for me (there are like 3 or 4 lower difficulties too and you can always go lower but not higher)\n\n- ability scrolls are hidden in the world (there are some ESSENTIAL combat skills that make this game so much better, hiding them isn't the best idea imo)\n\n- a lot of cutscenes and reading (no voiceovers)\n\n- a lot of time in the menus\n\n- nostalgic feel, it plays like an \"old\" game so you have to think like you are playing an \"old\" game. For example, if you want to use an item on an object in the wold like a key on a locked gate you have to go into your inventory, select the key and use it.\n\n- backstep instead of dodge forward but on the other hand shields are very strong in this game + you can always quickly turn around and \"backstep forward\", it just needs getting used to (there is a skill to make it into a forward dodge but you get this skill mod in postgame so it is waaaay to late for that)\n\n- when you die you have to load your last save so you know, you lose everything you gathered up and done to the point of your demise (which is a great incentive to not die)\n\nCons:\n\n- the further you progress the more flashy abilities you have, same goes for enemies and sometimes it is impossible to tell what the hell is going on during those massive bossfights because it's all overlapping\n\n- solutions to some problems the game presents are mostly reasonable and were in one way or another mentioned along the way but this one part where you have to fill a huge jug with water so the STONE would float up to the surface is so mind boggling I would have never guessed wth I was supposed to do\n\n- berserk skill breaks the game (3x damage but 1 hp), you can just turn skills on and off without any consequences and it seems to be a solution to many difficulty related problems people have, just turn berserk on when boss is \"broken\" or when  the window is open and turn it off the second you feel threatened, repeat to win ez. In other words, there is easily available cheese in the game.\n\n- when you restart a boss fight from the \"bossfight checkpoint\" it doesn't give you back your consumables that you have used so better stock up before bosses", "timestamp_created": 1673841171, "timestamp_updated": 1673841171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600902199745178223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130947469": {"recommendationid": "130947469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028733229", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 5175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 907, "last_played": 1676152384}, "language": "english", "review": "Dang it, I really wanted to recommend this since it has many things I like, but it also has so many weird or dated mechanics like huge hitboxes that have way too many active frames (lingering hit boxes on enemy attacks) and worst fo all, loading a save being the only option after death, making you loose real progress, not money or experience; real rare items, your skill unlocks, scale configurations, all gone, most of the items will take hours to get again, specially at the begining.\n\nIt's also very easy to get stuck or die unexpectedly.

I've quite literally learned how to read and write because of RPGs with the original Final Fantasy weaning me on letters and it only escalated from there. So I've played a lot of games across every flavor of \"RPG (JRPG, SRPG, TRPG, ARPG, DRPG, etc). With that out of the way.\n\nAstlibra is one of the better games I've played in the last decade. Though not without it's faults, it's a pretty quality experience from start to finish. For the most part.\n\n[b] Story [/b]\nTo go more in depth. The story is sometimes predictable, sometimes completely insane, all parts neat to watch unfold. There's a decent amount of tropes played to comedic effect and the story doesn't always nail it's delivery (particularly at the end end game)  but for the most part it's well enough to follow through. \n\n[b] Combat [/b]\nThe combat is good. For an action RPG it's pretty high up there. The skill system letting you summon different spirits to assist combat as well as multiple special action the player themselves can engage in, once you get your upgrade and the combat gets going it REALLY gets going. The only downside is that towards the end game many larger skills summon creatures large enough to block your view of bullets which can become a substantial problem.\n\n[b] Customization [/b]\nThe game avoids many of the pitfalls of all upgrades just being different flavors of starts towards the same end build. There are so many ways to build out your character with different skills to use, abilities to equip, weapons to use, and items to work around. The game has layers on layers of how to work on your character until the super end game.\n\n[b] Presentation [/b]\nI was originally turned off of the graphics of the game for all of about 5 minutes. But it takes all of 5 minutes to start appreciating  the games aesthetics and how it designs it's worlds and monsters to the point that a change anywhere wouldn't feel adequate. Good overall design and aesthetics.\n\n[b] Difficulty  [/b]\nI'm going to have to replay the game on impossible. That said on hell the games difficulty curve is one of my sore spots. At the start of the game you'll do relatively very little damage. Towards the midpoint of the game you are an unstoppable juggernaut that soaks hits with ease while effortlessly powering through most fights. Due to the overabundance of items you can carry, the rule \"if it doesn't one shot you it doesn't matter\" applies here. If the attack isn't enough to end you, you can full heal shortly after and continue with the fight. Sometimes that requires steps (like becoming invulnerable by using skill) but it still applies.\n\nThe game is well balanced until Chapter 8 but when the difficulty drops it REALLY drops and it never really recovers.\n\n[b] sound [/b]\nThis games sound phenomenal. Not only is the music and selection fantastic, the sound effects and UI sounds are also fantastic. This is an understated aspect many times but UI elements need good sound design as well for something you're going to menu through countless times over your entire game. The game nails it. Great UI sounds. Great combat sounds. You'll instantly know what's happening by the sound alone. Not many games can properly succeed at this. \n\n\nAs stated the game does a lot right. There's only a few cons which I'll list briefly:\n[list]\n    [*]No way to refight most bosses\n    [*]The final chapter needed more padding\n    [*]The process of getting every weapon and shield upgraded is a bit too time consuming. The thiefs glove and the corresponding skill that increases unique drops come way too late into the game.\n    [*]There's a part halfway into the game where a character can die if you don't choose the right option and you lose access to an entire boss. I replayed about 4 hours of game just to go back and undo that decision.\n    [*]The aforementioned inverse difficulty curve makes the game hard to stay satisfying at the end when you're bulldozing fights with no effort\n    [*]The Growth screen is a bit awkward to navigate\n[/list]\n\nThat's about all I've got. This is the very first game I've gifted to anybody else on the merits of the game itself. The developer should be proud of their accomplishments.

It'd be a disservice to what this game is.\n\nThis game is its own thing. Sure, it shares some similar mechanics (weapon variety, \"spells\", license board-like power ups) but the meat of the game is in the fluid combat, how you go from melee to \"magic\" and back, the importance of using the right elements and the right abilities for each combat, and how each \"build\" is viable. It's a fun experience and a treat to both the eyes and the hands.\n\nThe downside is there's not much [b]real[/b] variety in the style of gameplay, if you want to blast enemies with magic, you have to use your weapons to charge up. If you don't care about magic and want to go full caveman, you're still gonna have a hard time passing up those i-frames and high-defense moments the spellcasting gives you. However, that's kind of a minor downside if you ask me.\n\nThe GREAT thing is how much you can customize. Seriously, you prefer to have a skill that lets you shield bash more often AND one that lets you put your shield up more quickly over having double jump? Sure, you can do it. You want to get skills to suck up money but don't have enough currency for activating the skill? There's ways around it. And don't get me started on the puzzles. They're great.

From what little I've played, NOTHING is there by accident, and that's amazing.\n\nNow, the real downer is the translation: this game has got a terrible translation. I'm sorry, there's just no way around it, you're gonna be scratching your head half the time figuring out the mechanics of a skill or how to solve a puzzle solely on the fact that the translation is dead-wrong.

Between combat and leveling the story keeps you wanting to know more and progress to the next area simply to continue the plot. Though the game is VERY long by arpg standards, this can be a good thing depending on how you like your rpgs (im just about through the story at the time of the review and thats about 50 or so hours, and theres lots of quality end/post game story content that a friend told me about).

Never have I seen a more hidden gem in all my time. This game deserves so much more recognition than it has.

I nonchalantly added it to my wishlist because it was in my discovery queue and I thought \"Hey this looks like it might be pretty good when it comes out\".  Pretty good hardly even begins to describe how much I enjoy this game.\n\nThe combat is okay at first, then it steadily trickles in more ways of fighting and different mechanics and it just does so without it being just a massive overload of stuff.  Sure by the time you get to the end there are a lot of things but it was slowly given to you over the course of the game allowing you to learn before smacking you with another thing.\n\nI very much enjoy the story, I think it is a bit cliche in some parts but overall I have to say it is a great premise and is very well executed for the most part.  I will agree with another review that I read saying that some of the character dialogue detracts from the whole.  I do believe it is somewhat damaging to the presentation of things but it goes with the 90's jrpg vibe of things.\n\nThe characters do feel quite fleshed out, the main character is a mostly silent protagonist with the characters around him sort of repeating what I assume he says.  There are some of the cliche character things happening a little pervy here a little tsundere there, not terribly overbearing but as stated above it does take away from things a little.\n\nThere are some issues I ran into, mainly way towards the end of the game, which really ends up amounting to just the screen freezing and not being able to see anything, can still attack and hear though.  A fix that works for me is alt tabbing out of game and then coming back in, pausing first if I am fighting.\n\nAdding this which I forgot, the music is great.  It is really well done and it can fade into the background as you're playing really easily and then you start paying attention and think \"Wait this music is really good\"; lather rinse repeat.\n\nShort version, I highly recommend this game and if I see another game from Keizo I will probably just buy as soon as it is available.", "timestamp_created": 1673594169, "timestamp_updated": 1673655461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130730682": {"recommendationid": "130730682", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977971443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2336, "last_played": 1674764845}, "language": "english", "review": "Janky and cool AF. do recommend.

The demo should give a good idea on whether the basic gameplay will be fun for you, this review will mostly cover what isn't in the demo.\n\nLet's get some positives out of the way first: The story is pretty good, it may seem a bit boring/generic at first but as it goes on it gains a lot of depth and intrigue to it. In particular the game does a very good job at making you dread things that you know are coming both in the short and long term. The basic combat system is pretty fun, with some of your progression systems expanding on it and giving you options in interesting ways, some of which can completely change your play style. Spells are fun and extremely useful since they're powerful and give you i-frames on cast. The variety of upgrade systems is interesting; LIBRA is particularly creative and well-done. Some of the progression systems can make things a bit grindy, but the game [i]usually[/i] does a good job with making the grinding fun (more on that later). The translation is a bit iffy at times, and sometimes this results in misleading information, but usually it comes across as charmingly earnest and there's a patch coming that's supposed to improve it.\n\nThe biggest issue I have is that the combat gradually becomes more and more of a headache as time goes on due to a few really questionable design decisions regarding your defensive options. Attacks with status effects still apply the status effect even if you i-frame through them, unless you block them, which requires having a shield equipped and that shield not breaking (if your shield breaks, it stays broken for a good 10-15 seconds, which might as well be 10-15 years). You do unlock an ability that makes you immune to status effects while spell i-frames are active, but it costs quite a few KARON points to equip while the ability to cancel most actions into a block only costs a single point. Eventually you'll be able to stack enough status resistance that this doesn't matter so much, but that won't happen until the endgame/postgame.\n\nEven in the absence of status effects, 2 of your main i-frame sources (spells, backstep) have cooldowns while the third requires a successful block in order to trigger. However, the weapon mastery mechanic requires the occasional use of 2-handed weapons, and you really want to be leveling new weapons whenever you have them. 2-handed weapons do have a range advantage but it's not quite enough to negate the threat of melee attacks from most enemies even with the attack speed and stagger upgrades, and does nothing at all about ranged attacks unless you can use the environment to block them (which doesn't work with all ranged attacks, just most of them) or can get off a spell to block them (which requires having enough ST, which you can only get from getting enough hits in melee). Like with status effects, you eventually unlock an ability that lets you use a shield alongside a 2-handed weapon but it costs the maximum possible KARON points and the equipment that teaches it is from the final chapter.\n\nIf there are more than 2 or 3 enemies on screen (which happens frequently later on) you can forget about being able to see whether any of them are attacking under all the particle effects of your own attacks, which is an unfortunate choice in a game where blocking is so important and gets stronger when perfectly timed. This also affects a few bosses, in particular the postgame final boss.\n\nThe level design takes a huge dip in quality at chapter 6. The first half of the chapter is a constant blizzard that reduces your visibility while pushing you back and making all your movement related abilities worthless, with the only remedy for the pushing also making your attacks as slow as molasses. The other half is platforming over bottomless pits while dealing with enemies that either fully heal every other enemy on the map every 3 seconds, spam ranged attacks, or continuously block and have attack hitboxes twice as big as their attack animation, interspersed with puzzles that are so obtuse they wouldn't have been out of place in a 90s adventure game.\n\nThe start of chapter 7 is only a little better due to the sheer number of screens of boring flat terrain filled with enemies with annoying attack patterns. The second half of chapter 7 is, if anything, worse than chapter 6, thanks to how you lose access to your spells and KARON upgrades due to plot reasons. Thankfully the rest  of the game and the postgame make up for the chapter 6-7 dip in quality, with the partial exception of the postgame final boss who has the readability issues described above as well as an attack that can bug out and become almost impossible to dodge.\n\nThe \"GROW\" upgrade grid has some usability issues. You're unable to move off the rails of the path but the path is frequently convoluted - the chapter 6 part is an actual maze. Pressing Start teleports you to the beginning but this is actively useless since it's at the bottom left corner of the grid. Being able to move the cursor independently of the paths or at least teleport to different sections would be massively helpful. There's also a consistent problem with running out of one of the upgrade point colors because there are no enemies in your current chapter that drop them, leaving you the choices of either spending 3x as much, repeatedly crafting the same 1 or 2 food items, or skipping out on a bunch of stat points and magic until the next chapter, none of which feel very good.\n\nSome negative reviews have complained about the treatment of women. As someone with a moderate tolerance for ecchi, I felt some of the complaints were exaggerated but others really weren't.\n\nSome of it is dramatically appropriate, like a villain capturing your female party members and mentioning they'll be useful for his soldiers' morale. Some of it is genuinely funny, like the time the protag's lady friend sends him on a quest for panties so she can make him crossdress and help her replace the lesbians in the ritual sacrifice, only to find out she screwed up when ordering the commission so she has to give you [i]her[/i] clothes while [i]she[/i] wears the Leia bikini. Some of it is old hat anime tropes, like walking 500 miles to peek into the hot springs only to be immediately caught and destroyed for it.\n\nBut some of it is a big bare broad bearing bouncing balloon boobies being a boss battle for no bloody reason (I don't think it's possible to really describe this boss properly without getting flagged by Steam content auto-moderation), or a girl barging into your room and threatening to step on you and shove her panties in your mouth. The same girl is involved on both occasions, and NPCs sometimes comment on her looking a little young for you when she's following you. Moments like those are excessive enough that they sort of detract from the experience a bit. Fortunately there aren't very many of them, the game usually takes a serious tone, but that does make the questionable moments stand out that much more.\n\nEdit: I have now finished the game + postgame, with all achievements except for 2 numerical grinds + beating the game on Difficult or higher (I played on Normal).

The main combat system is quite robust and fun, which makes the grindy parts enjoyable. The storyline is interesting, exploring a number of interesting themes around time travel and the existence of parallel universes. I found the high school humour detracted a bit from the emotional impact of the story, as did the rough translation, but not to the point where playing the game was not a joy.  The flaws are a consequence of the game being a one man passion project and it's incredible how polished the game actually is.  While the game is linear, some backtracking is required to obtain 100% and additional grinding may be required to overcome some of the more challenging bosses. The main gameplay loop is addictive - that's the key to a great game.

I wanted to play something nostalgic that have the feeling of SNES/PS1/PS2 Era games on the Steamdeck and Astlibra delivers!  This game is surprisingly a very good JRPG side scroller with a mixture of systems from YS/Castlevania/Final Fantasy and other SNES/PS1 Era games. The Steamdeck had no performance issues while handling the game making things enjoyable.\n\nThe story is solid and reminded me a bit of things from Anime with the plot twist and character development with time travel being prominent as the main theme of the game. The story along with the game play made the experience gratifying and now I want to play other classical games from past eras again.\n\nThe big selling point of this game to me is the fast pace combat system which you can fluidly control your character to dodge, block, or out maneuver attacks by positioning. Each weapon type like swords, two handed swords, claws, hammers, magic staves and spears each behavior differently making the game play unique while vanquishing demons.\n\nThe RPG mechanics for character building can be addicting by mixing and matching KARON skills earned from crafting/obtaining weapons and armor from chapters. Each weapon and armor have EXP you can grind out for new skills or magic crystals to invest in skills that are unlocked to customize the main character further. These skills can range from magic, melee, defense, movement, and looting. On top of that, you gain force from kills that can be used for GROW which is like the FFX sphere grid system to unlock stats, possessions (summons), and a few weapons/armors along the way.  Basically you can customize your character to suit your play style after putting in the work.\n\nAnother thing I loved about this game is the guard system by using a shield. It feels epic to block incoming attacks like a boss\u2019s flame breath or claw strikes from hurting your main character from taking major damage. Things are balanced as well with the guard having a stamina gauge that runs out from blocking attacks successfully. While the bar refills, you must rely on dodging or avoiding attacks not to eat dirt or chug a healing item to keep fighting. The boss fights can be modernly challenging with the amount of attacks to dodge and mobs in later chapters making game play really engaging and epic. If things get too rough, a player can always reload a save to grind more skills/stats/weapons to retry the fight again better prepared.\n\nAnyway, the only three cons I can think of for this game are:\n\n1. The story has some janky translation in some places making the story rough to follow.\n\n2. Some of the story is a bit misogynistic in some areas.\n\n3. The puzzles can be tough in the main game for some of the chapters. There are resources online from the JP wiki that can help figure these out.\n\nLastly the soundtrack is really top tier and reminded me of stuff from JDK band from Falcom games and made the grinding really fun. Overall, I really enjoyed my time with Astlibra and highly recommend it, if you want to play an old-school JRPG game with roots of borrowing things from the golden age of SNES/PS1/PS2 era of gaming.

Beyond just that, though, it feels like some gameplay decisions were put in purely to piss off the player. I'm speaking mostly about the level where you are forced to spend the majority of the time underwater, often times using the torch consumable item to only barely see anything, fighting against spongey enemies with access to bleed and paralysis. The bleed enemies blend into the background, so better hope you recognize that they aren't just a prop before it's too late. And after this stage, you then have to fight the first 2 stage boss in the game. The boss summons creeps with ability to paralyze as well as having the ability to poison you herself. Poison gives an instant death timer, which you wouldn't know at this point in the game. So when you almost have her first stage done, and it goes to 0, quite frustrating to see you instantly die. When you restart bosses, your consumables you used on the previous attempts are not refilled unless you do a hard reload, the \"convenience\" option does not do this itself. After this frustrating stage the game looks like it just keeps up the misuse of female cast and frustrating mechanics in the next stage, so I think I'm giving up. For being developed for 15 years, and supposedly being a life's work, I think this dev is a sadistic incel. It seems he also gets off on his own work, since the credits cutscenes (which takes like 15s to skip) has already played at 6 separate points in the game by this point.

When I first saw it and ignored it. When it was brought to my attention again and I\u2019ve decided to play it. Even as I was playing it. It\u2019s not some inventive never before seen mix of genres or anything, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s so constantly full of surprises. And huge. To a fault, really, but still, we\u2019re talking about a game that looks like this lasting 60 hours and still finding ways to introduce some new stuff in the last hours of itself. But it\u2019s also not without many issues.\n\nAstlibra Revision is a hack and slash action RPG action adventure with a side scrolling view. It\u2019s also, apparently, an updated release of a previously free game (hence the Revision in the title) and just thinking about how this could\u2019ve been free makes my head spin. Not since La-Mulana or Cave Story a game like this was released for free, I\u2019m pretty sure. Anyway, if the genre description doesn\u2019t paint the picture for you, I\u2019ll put it differently \u2013 imagine a modern Ys in side-scrolling 2D perspective and you\u2019ll know what to expect from this game, at least in general. And, granted, Ys wasn\u2019t the only series of Japanese action RPGs to have this kind of mix of mechanics, but Astlibra itself isn\u2019t shy about reminding you of Ys in many various ways, so the comparison is only fair.\n\nWhat this means is that you get a story-driven action adventure with lots and lots of monsters to combo to death, equipment and treasures to find, levels to grind, upgrades to be had and fun movement abilities to be experienced. The way the RPG mechanics are done in Astlibra is actually quite fun and borrowing from many other titles. For example, there are many skills that you get from \u201cmastering\u201d equipment by using it which have to be separately enabled or disabled using magic stones, which is very reminiscent of the Final Fantasy IX system. There\u2019s a separate board of passive upgrades, which also contains skills and sometimes items to unlock, that is not entirely unlike the skill grids from FFX, XII or XIII. The amount of equipment is staggeringly huge and they all have separate classes that handle differently with a weight system in place to modify the speed of their usage. There\u2019s a combo system that, just like in some Ys titles, modifies some of the parameters the longer you keep it going\u2026\n\nJeez, there\u2019s so much, really, that listing all of the ideas for item collecting, crafting (it\u2019s more like cooking recipes here and not tedious), lore elements, permanent abilities and all of that stuff will turn this into a wiki page. But most important is that \u2013 all of these mechanics are actually very easy to understand and use and you can always ignore most of it and just focus on what you enjoy most. Or be like me and try to 100% the game which takes a long time\u2026 But a fun long time! And provides an additional bonus, just like in Ys, where you can (again, if you want) just grind to hell and back and have less trouble during harder encounters. Or, if you don\u2019t want to, postpone all of the collecting and grinding til later and focus on smartly using all of the combat mechanics while being at a more reasonable level.\n\nBut yeah \u2013 you\u2019ll have plenty of abilities to get stuff later, because this game is super packed with story chapters that simply don\u2019t end. I don\u2019t want to spoil much (or preferably anything), but I\u2019ll say that there are very few permanently missable things in the game due to how it\u2019s structured, so if you want to mostly follow the main story and ignore all of the optional stuff and do it later, you can do it. Because the story will just keep going\u2026 If I were to just write it down, chronologically, you\u2019ll find it not particularly novel or that special. But I have to admit \u2013 the way it\u2019s gradually revealed makes it extremely fun and interesting and even when I was expecting what would be revealed long before the game did that, those revelations still came at a good time. And you can always be sure that almost immediately after the game will throw a new unexpected thing at you and keep things interesting.\n\nIf only the writing didn\u2019t suck butt\u2026 Ignoring the weird translation issues and odd phrasing at times, 30% of the writing is very solid and delivers the main story in a great way. Unfortunately, the rest of the game dialogues and narration lines are written as if by an extremely horny 13 year old boy still living in the late 80s. I mean, seriously, I\u2019ve not seen such a dense pack of horribly outdated shonen tropes in a game since\u2026 actually ever. Everyone is constantly horny about the main character, every male is a pervert and men in drag is the most hilarious joke mankind ever devised, according to this game. It might sound like I\u2019m exaggerating, but that\u2019s really what the majority of the game dialogues is like, it\u2019s obnoxious. And I fear that this might be the main reason a lot of people will bounce off the title, not wanting to deal with this crap. A lot of the last part of the game is, thankfully, better, but it never goes away and remains dumb til the very end.\n\nA lot of people might just be like me and be able filter out all of that dumb crap just of the sake of how fun the game really is to play. To explore the locations, to run around, to engage in combat, to figure out the puzzles\u2026 Although, the last is another weaker point of the game \u2013 some puzzles are really cool in concept, but done very poorly. One of the early ones, for example, fully ignores the whole concept of crafting that you\u2019ve been constantly using and requires instead to remember a joke cutscene that happened at least an hour ago (and if you were 100%-ing the chapter then several hours ago). Another feels easy to figure out the puzzle itself, but hard to realize the supposedly easy part of it because it\u2019s counter-intuitive. And one is just easier to brute force than figure out. A shame, but I must admit that these are not bad puzzles and the solutions are fun and inventive, it\u2019s just that the game doesn\u2019t nudge the players the right way or at all to the solution when it should.\n\nIf you love playing Ys titles, you\u2019ve probably ran off and bought this game already before even finishing reading my opinion. It\u2019s a really fun and inventive take on that mix of genres and while a bit more primitive (and also more \u201coh my hand hurts from all the mashing\u201d) in some aspects, it\u2019s far more complex in others in ways that are interesting. If you\u2019re just mildly curious about these kinds of Japanese action RPG titles or never tried them before \u2013 Astlibra Revision is a fun example of the genre that\u2019s worth checking out. As long as you can stomach some poor writing, of course.

This game has the most fun single-plane 2D combat since Muramasa released almost 15 years ago; It's fast, fluid, aggressive, and has lots of options. The FFIX-style grind for skills from equipment gives a an addictive \"gotta-collect-em-all\" quality. The art is distinctive, with stand-out enemy designs. The soundtrack is sick. And the narrative is creative with plenty of twists and turns. \n\nThere's some rough edges with the UI design, progression systems, and character writing itself, but don't let that dissuade you. This is the most I've been hooked on a video game in years.

I BEG the developer to implement some sort of NG+ system down the line. I just want a reason to keep playing the game over and over again.\n\nThe combat system starts off very basic, and as you go along it starts to become insanely fast-paced by the end of the game when you\u2019re practically lawn-mowering enemies (unless you\u2019re playing at Hell or higher diff).\n\nThe mechanics of strengthening your character are diverse, yet not confusing at all. You have a few routes to go about it: 1) Leveling up, 2) Karon skills (which are essentially combat mechanic modifiers), and 3) Ability tree (FFX/PoE style grid-like stat tree). Much later on in the game you will unlock additional systems that make progression a bit more refreshing.\n\nAs for the story, I happened to enjoy most of it a lot, although it may be hit-or-miss for people. If you don\u2019t like the stereotypical anime tropes of JRPGs, you won\u2019t like the story or dialogue in this game, either. However, if that\u2019s your thing as it is with me, you might really be intrigued with the story. I found the characters to be quite charming and lively, and the protagonist, although silent, manages to display a broad range of characteristics in spite of it. You really get the sense that the protagonist has his own clear-cut personality and identity despite being silent (though  at that point, why even make him a silent protagonist to begin with?)\n\n9.5/10 gameplay, 7/10 story, 6.5/10 visuals, 8/10 music, and overall a 9/10 experience.

The gameplay is extremely fun, with a good mixture of button mashing while still retaining a need for situational awareness or tactics. The weapon experience system unlocking new abilities was always a treat, even if the weapons more or less played the same and having a shield was almost always better. I really enjoyed the designs despite that and working on a build that felt good for me to play. The summoning skills really add more depth to the gameplay as well, and I always found it fun to mess around with them and figure out which ones I liked or didn't like using for different encounters or areas. Just moving around in the game feels great, and everything is very responsive. That said, puzzles can sometimes be obtuse or confusing, and the EN translation isn't always consistent, but I can give it a pass.\n\nThe overall story was so much better than I expected, even if it does follow many JRPG tropes, which you may love or hate. It continued to surprise me up to the very end. Some things seemed like they were obvious only for the scene to be turned upside down onto its head as the story unfolded. My biggest complaints about the story were the silent and unnamed protagonist, even though multiple times he \"talks\" in a small wordless speech bubble and people say \"this has your name on it\" a few times, and the weirdly perverted moments that can be very typical of Japanese fiction. I was able to look past those moments for the rest of this beautiful gem, however, and I think if you can as well, you'll really like this game.\n\nI would suggest this game to anyone who enjoys side-scrolling Castlevania games, DMC, Chrono Trigger, or the Final Fantasy series. It's not the type of game for everyone, but if you enjoy action RPGs and the JRPG genre I think this is absolutely worth your time and money. It hit almost all of the right buttons for me at the right time, and I basically played this game nonstop from start to finish.

Like I always tell people. I rarely write reviews, and when I do its either for a game that deserves it meaning mostly its positive, or a short one which I will remove later being negative, like I did for RCG2 due to its release state.  Considering I been playing video games longer than most steam users have been alive, I pretty much seen it all.  Well thats enough intro  lets get down to it. \n\nAstlibra, a hidden gem of a game, coming out of nowhere.  Quite honestly in my opinion, could be a Indie nominee for the VGAs *I feel sorry for the VGA host, he almost, almost got to have one go without incident, just right there at the end, poor guy* And I say this due to how well created the game is, harking back to the old era of video games.  I see alot of primary influences in it, particularly the old Y's games, and a little bit of Drakken 2 Dragon View.  \n\nWhat influences you may ask?  Oh I can name quite a few, even seen references to them.  Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Zelda, Chrono Trigger, heck even Metroid for a particular area.  The developers  who seemingly spent 15+ years creating this have obviously been playing video games for a long time, and are all what the Japanese term calls them \"Your everyday Salaryman\"  thus why it took them so long to create this.\n\nThe basic plot of a very, very long story, which, heavily influenced by both Chrono Trigger, and a very, specific game for a twist over midway thru,  is that you are a Silent Protagonist orphan who as a boy was attacked by Demons invading your village and tried to run away with your childhood sweetheart.  You both got surrounded, and then you lost consciousness as you got attacked by a giant powerful demon, only to wake up in a cabin in the middle of absolute nowhere with a talking Raven.  \n\nYou realize you are far, far from human civilization, so far that their are not even any demons around since they tend to stay near human settlements only for some reason.  You and the raven who seems to act as your surrogate father, tries to live life in this cabin, but your urge and desire to go back to your village and find the girl you have feelings for is too much, and you keep attempting to leave, only to realize the forest surrounding your cabin goes on seemingly forever. \n\nThe raven then relents and decides to go with you and guide you.  The two spends eight, entire years, walking thru the frontier with no demons or humans in sight until finally you do come across civilization at last, and you are now a fully grown man.  Thus the adventure truly begins. \n\nThe game uses some very beautiful background images, similar to how the SNES days have done it, with excellent character and monster animations with some enemies looking like they been hand drawn.  Its a action RPG combat system with near infinite stat growth, you can constantly keep getting stronger but to a certain extent.  You can gain levels, get these monster essences called Force, to boost your stats in a sort of stat board placement system similar to what FF 10 uses.  However to keep you from getting too overpowered, their is a maximum you can go on this Placement System which is defined by locks you cannot open until you reach the next chapter.  \n\nYou also have a skill system that uses Magic Crystals that you collect via various means.  You gain these skills by mastering the massive assortments of weapons, shields and armor.  Most of these will have a skill attached that once mastered, you can either use the skill for free long as you use that piece of equipment, or assign Magic Crystals to that skill to have it on permanently for as long as you have crystals assigned.  This allows you to customize your character to your play style.  \n\nAll this allows you to do basically three different types of builds I primarily see.  Want to be fast and defensive? Use a one hand weapon with shield,  with a shield you can block most attacks so long as they dont break your block gauge.   Spec to skills and stats that favors this.  Want to use a two handed weapon or thrusting weapon?  Spec for agility, use skills that boosts the range or speed of these weapons.  Want to use a magic staff and throw out fireballs and lightning like a wizard?  Spec for Magic over ATK and select skills that compliments Staff usage.  \n\nYou also have a summon system called Possession, which uses button inputs to dictate what you summon.  You earn these summons via the Stat board and they are categorized in six different elements. Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Dark and Light.  You can set these summons however your play style or need is and they use a gauge called ST or Stamina which you regain simply from attacking.  Standard play loop is, attack until bar fills up, then use possession, then repeat.   Possessions are a way to cause massive damage all over, or to get yourself out of a bad situation.  I personally like using possession skills where you become the Summon for a fixed period of time allowing me to consume healing items in safety if needed.  \n\nDue to near infinite stat growth, and of two, new mechanics that comes up post game, I wont spoil those, but I do wonder why the developer did not put those at the start.  I highly recommend to play the game on either Hell or Impossible difficulty, since the game seems balanced around those two difficulties.  You can change difficulties at will at any point until chapter 2.  Once you go past chapter 2, you can only go down in difficulty and cannot go up again.  Which is a weird design decision, I played the game on Hell and often wished I could put it up to Impossible since I am a completionist and I often will find ways to circumvent or cheese anything difficult.  I still had quite a challenge on Hell mode, but most bosses just seemed too easy due to the amount of grind I would put in and simply due to collecting all the weapons and armor to gain more skills or Magic Crystals.  \n\nIn short, if you want to be lightly challenged, play it on Hell, otherwise, I recommend Impossible if you want to at least 90 percent the game.  Many enemies and bosses can become bullet hells where dodging or blocking is needed depending on your playstyle.  Difficulty will determine how much you need to grind or simply be patient and dodge and block as much as possible. Just keep in mind the game has Near, infinite, stat growth.  You CAN with enough grinding, be so overpowered that even the true final boss, or the optional final arena boss, will be as weak as kittens to you, even on impossible, but that would take a tremendous amount of grind, and you would have gone and collected and done everything long before then either way, unless you get unlucky collecting....Hearts, at the near end. Wont spoil that. \n\nNow, the soundtrack.  Honestly again, I see influences from past games on this, particularly Y's.  Now most JRPG fans would have played a Y's title or two, and would know the awesome high energy soundtracks that tends to come from that franchise.  They did pretty well with this in Astlibra,  using the same high energy seen in Y's.  The first area, Volcano area, and Demon Castle being very notable.  Sounds fantastic and makes you pumped to play which is what I believe the developers were intending.  \n\nOverall and I will say this, I have over 200+ games in my backlog.  Many on steam, many physical.  I have in my immediate concern to play and finish right now, Harvestella, Dragon Quest Treasures, Star Ocean Divine Force, Made in Abyss Binary star, Strangers of Paradise Final Fantasy Origins, and Sword and Fairy 7.  FF and DQ being in my top 5 franchises to complete start to finish. Yet, I chose to play this over them. \n\nGive it a shot. It well deserves your attention. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1672076855, "timestamp_updated": 1672076855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129329085": {"recommendationid": "129329085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859870458", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5530, "last_played": 1689868008}, "language": "english", "review": "\u5f00\u9501\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u7ee9\uff0c\u5f88\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7231\u6765\u81ea\u74f7\u5668", "timestamp_created": 1672055329, "timestamp_updated": 1672055329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129307695": {"recommendationid": "129307695", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091912509", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3335, "last_played": 1670246743}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game of 2022", "timestamp_created": 1672030406, "timestamp_updated": 1672030406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129307526": {"recommendationid": "129307526", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995352411", "num_games_owned": 575, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4930, "last_played": 1672029610}, "language": "english", "review": "Game of the Year, that simple.", "timestamp_created": 1672030232, "timestamp_updated": 1672030232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129305993": {"recommendationid": "129305993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016649258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2595, "last_played": 1672025667}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes its good", "timestamp_created": 1672028534, "timestamp_updated": 1672028534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129289303": {"recommendationid": "129289303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304171946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3495, "last_played": 1672092985}, "language": "english", "review": "Long and interesting story.

The gameplay is action-based combat with RPG elements in a sidescrolling format. The gameplay is tight and reactive, it's very easy to fumble your movement options if you get sloppy, but the default difficulty is forgiving enough to generally let you recover from mistakes. The difficulty curve is gentle until about Chapter 6, where the game spikes hard and basically tells you to get ready to rumble for the rest of the game. \n\nThe system mechanics are extremely robust, with tons of options to make your numbers go up and to get stronger. And you need all of them, because if you don't you're going to get chewed up and spat out. DO NOT ignore the Grow board, it is a bigger source of stats than actually levelling up and your actual main stat progression method. There are a couple puzzles that are a little frustrating in the way the game signposts the answers, but there are answers to them here and there if you want to look for them and can't get the answers on your own. \n\nThe translation is a little stiff in the beginning, but don't let it put you off. The plot develops steadily and goes from a charming 80s style 7 to 11. I found the plot compelling and interesting, and they eventually wrap up all the core questions of the game.

The Core Gameplay was very fun for me, playing on Hell Difficulty, it was challenging, and figuring out strategies I enjoyed was fun. Certain areas were harder than others, but I was adamant on buying and levelling every new weapon, shield, and armor in each chapter, to stay on top of what new abilities I could use. Genuinely, the gameplay is the Shining Star that is this incredibly unique video game. Notice how I (and probably others) haven't once mentioned that this game looks like a Bitcoin Miner Fever Dream, with all of it's stock photos, fighting PNGs of Flowers and shit. That's because by the 20th hour, you'll be used to it. It's incredible what the human mind can adapt to.\n\nThe negatives for me are: The story is ALMOST good, it's interesting enough to keep me reading it, but good god this game was so clearly written by one person who shoves as much horny, fetishistic, 14 year old humor in it it's insufferable. The first few times I wasn't sure if he was just trying to write some fan fiction or not, by the end of the game, (with a very specific \"If you don't wake up, I'm going to sit on your face and fart\" moment) I knew he wasn't even writing the fan service for the fans, but for himself. Dialogue is basically Horrible to Insufferable whenever you hear that Goofy Music that is always playing right before one of the characters completely ruins the tone and mood that the overarching story has been setting up just to make a \"WOAH SHE'S GOT FAT BOOZOONKOOS\" joke. Now I obviously want to and AM faulting the game for these moments, but I have to give credit where it's due, you can simply press Start and Skip literally ANY dialogue in the game, even if it's one single message box. And it skips Very Fast. Big ups for that, but the story was just interesting enough to make me read it, and also hate the game for ruining what it was setting up.\n\nAnother negative that really depends on your Taste and Preference, the music. Some of the music is good, some of it is laughably out of place. I couldn't help but burst out laughing every single time I heard a Monstercat-esque copyright free dubstep song just start blaring over what would otherwise be a somewhat interesting or important moment. It completely kills the vibe sometimes. You don't get used to it, at least I didn't. An important thing to note about all of these faults is that this was originally a browser game, when you learn that, and learn that it was put online in about 2011, a lot of these choices make much more sense. The dubstep, the horny fanservice, the Stock Photo Trees and Clouds, the RPGMaker lookin Characters, the general way the plot goes in general I've seen like 20 times at least in these types of browser / flash games tbh. Just thought I'd mention that as well.\n\nThe game genuinely adds 3 or 4 new mechanics to the Post Game Chapter (After the Final Chapter), which is awesome, because they're good mechanics that spice up the Core Gameplay, and the Core Gameplay is the only thing that kept me playing, but I wish they had been added in far earlier than Post-Script. Mostly because, in general Post-Script feels like it overstays it's welcome. I got to Post-Script 60 hours in. I have 80 hours now completing the game, and I intentionally didn't do the \"Good Ending\" yet because that would be another 2 hours of grinding (not complaining about the grinding, I was just ready to be Finished with this game 10 hours ago).\n\nI hate giving number ratings because they're arbitrary as hell, I very much enjoyed my time actually playing the game, theorycrafting, doing fake math with the Libra Scale Balancing, optimizing my Berserk Usage, etc. Reading the story and dialogue, horrible, it might be for you, it certainly was NOT for me.

Late game you unlock additional gems that can completely modify the original skills and magic spells. \n\nThe game has a system which allows you to combine items into new items. The ingredients are mostly drops from monsters, which makes for a far better system than endlessly grinding for more money to get better equipment. \n\nThe boss fights are large and enjoyable. Killing one of the major bosses actually feels meaningful here and serves to move the story along. If you want to find every item in the game, some back tracking will be needed but you can do so at any point in the game. Nothing that you can miss and lose out on permanently. \n\nA few minor things aren't translated too well, but its pretty much limited to the skill descriptions and it looks like the developers are patching it.

Not only does it have the \"demo\" mode which lets you try out abilities and feel around the combat AND acts as a tutorial of sorts, but you also get to play the first bit of the game separate from the demo.  Note:  The actual game starts off quite a bit slow, so don't write it off after only an hour or 2.  you've been warned.\n\nI didn't think I would like this game from first impressions.  But seeing as how a demo was offered and others I talked to quite liked it, i tried it.  I like it enough to purchase it.  Even then, i thought \"This game will turn out to be mediocre and i'll probably putter out and stop playing a few hours in after i got some fun out of it...\"\n\nNow here i am, 80 hours later (more like 76 hours of effective playtime excluding times i left the game running), %100 completion, beaten the game on the second hardest difficulty.  This game was just what I needed at this time.  There were times I cursed the game for some jank here and there, but overall, it is a solidly put together game, despite appearances.  The core gameplay feels good with a story constantly pushing you forward (unlike some other RPGs which put you on a hamster-wheel for far too long).\nExpect to grind a bit though due to the nature of this RPG, the general murdering of enemies doesn't change too drasticly, but the game keeps things fresh in a variety of ways throughout the game.

The only other game that I've play similar is Symphony of the Night, which I played until the disc cracked. \n\nAnd even still, I played this game for days straight, got 100%, and am already waiting on the sequel. It brought me back to the younger days, on summer break, pushing Alucard to beat \"luck-mode\" with my younger brother on the sofa beside.\n\nTo start, the game is as hard or as easy as you want it to be, with 6 (I think) different difficulties. I played through on \"hard\" - once I got to about 75% completion though I wish I had selected one difficulty higher. \n\nThe story was solid. It did get somewhat convoluted, but that happens with JRPGS, some of the translations could be better, but the majority of the dialogue was good. \n\nThe combat is fast paced and fun. The skills and magic system are easy to use and critical in your success. Master weapons to learn new skills, unlock new magic through growth. There is a great selection of weapon types and styles, and in the back third or so of the game you can make even your starter gear as strong as the end game stuff. \n\nWhat I miss in the newer RPGs I play is farming - THE GRIND. Astlibra doesn't require you to dump HOURS into powering up your character, but if there's an empty bar that needs to be filled.... I'm gonna fill it. A huge plus for me was the multi-layered leveling system: You earn experience, you earn a spendable growth currency, and even weapon exp. In the back half of the game you can also find supplements to your gear that further enhance your stats and skills. \n\nI will eventually replay this. I will need to be in the mood to invest the time though, like SoTN it is an investment to clear completely.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent on Astlibra Revision.

I am actually baffled that an indie RPG of this depth and quality exists; no matter how much I played, it always had something else up its sleeve to surprise me with. This is nothing short of a passion project with emphasis on the passion; I am actually moved to tears by having played something that is like... this. I haven't felt this way since [u]Undertale[/u]. I feel invigorated and purposeful for playing this game. I am actually angry at having played other indie games that aren't this deep, this full of content, this [i]passionate[/i].\n\nI do have a couple of issues, though. I'm going to forgive the choppy translation and the hideous mishmash of textures and graphics; this is a passion project by someone in their basement, after all, and I expect it would be tremendously rough.\n\nWhat I do take issue with is our hero having no name and no voice. The silent protagonist is a trend that I really wish would die in video games already as technology's evolved past the need to keep text boxes sparse in order to preserve disk space. Same goes for not having a name. It just feels weird and strange for everyone to call you \"dear hero\" or \"this guy\", and it's [b]especially[/b] weird when it is outright stated that your name is written somewhere in game but no one ever refers to you by it.\n\nA character having no name and no voice is meant to allow the player to project onto them but that simply doesn't work here: our hero is indeed a character with driving motivations that characterise him, the search for Anulis. We should be drawn deeply into our hero's passionate and lifelong search for his beloved childhood friend but the lack of actual characterisation on display feels like a wall of jelly that I can't get through. What's more, the hero does talk to other people a lot and express himself but, without words, all you get are people constantly repeating everything you say like Solid Snake. \"What's that, dear hero? You want to buck common sense and leap into danger to save them?\"\n\nA lot of scenes in the story are diminished by the hero's inability to speak but none more so than one specific moment near the very end. The knees of that scene absolutely buckle as it tries to convey what [i]should[/i] be a moment of such heartwarming sincerity and fulfillment but only has one half of it.\n\nI stress that our hero is very much a character and so the typical strengths of a silent protagonist, however meager, do not apply here. If the protagonist spoke, the game would be so much better for it.\n\nBut this most certainly does not impede the quality of [u]ASTLIBRA[/u]. Play it. Play it play it play it play it play it. Play the demo. Be made curious by the demo so that you buy and play the whole thing. If you're a fan of [u]Ys[/u], this game will exceed every expectation you have and more. If you're a fan of any RPG ever, you need to play this because it nails the feeling that every RPG hopes to scratch.

Each weapon, shield, and piece of armor has it's own unique skill that you can learn eventually, allowing you to mix and match different skill sets to fit your playstyle.\n-Great boss battles (barring a couple, screw that volcano boss).\n-The actual designs of the bosses and some of the monsters are really cool.\n-An interesting story about time travel and it's consequences, not just in the story but also in the characters around you.\n-A BANGING soundtrack.\n-Plenty of puzzles that don't have logical, but not immediately obvious solutions.\n-Clever uses of in-game mechanics used in the world. One example I just went through on my playthrough is that in order to pass a blizzard that is constantly pushing you backwards, you have to use the Weight mechanic by putting on your heaviest equipment so that it can't push you back anymore.\n\nThe Mixed:\n-The way you buy weapons and armor is strange. Regular items you can just buy with gold, but anything that has a skill attached to it requires specific monster materials along with the regular cost. This can cause a fair bit of grinding, which isn't too bad since the combat is fun, but it is grinding nonetheless.\n-The artstyle is very hit-or-miss. The game goes for a photorealistic style for the backgrounds, but the character and monster designs are either cartoony or just anime. In practice it looks weird but you get used to it after a while.\n\nThe Bad\n-The first 2-3 chapters of the game are kinda boring plot-wise. I get they're still establishing how the world and the time-travel McGuffin works, but not a lot actually happens. Chapter 4 and onwards though are a rollercoaster though.\n-The translation...needs a few more passes. It's still perfectly readable, but typos and strange phrasings are abundant. I don't have any examples on hand, but in practice it can look something like \"We must go to the mountain over there!Hurry follow me!... ...\" or something like that.

I'd rather fight 3 or 4 things that test my reflexes and keeps me on the edge of my seat rather than just slam head first into a giant swarm where it's literally impossible to read queues or telegraph enemy attacks. Honestly, enemy placement like that only promotes two types of game play -- ranged magic, or turtle shield tanking everything. That is, unless you want to use a lot of healing items. \n\nMoving onto the puzzle design, like mob placement, it seems there is no rhyme or reason as to when a puzzle makes logical sense. Some of them are so easy you can do them blindfolded, while others are so ridiculously cryptic I looked up the solution so I didn't waste my time. What's that? You want an example? Well, without giving any spoilers, there's a puzzle later in the game where you have to use a combination of skills to kind of \"double jump and fly\" to reach something you need to proceed. No, not double jump as in go higher (because that would make sense), you literally have to drop off a ledge and almost kill yourself by falling into an instant death bottomless pit, \"glide\" your head against the underside of said ledge, toss in a few double jumps, pray to Jesus, and suddenly you're there. The game gives zero indication where said item is located, either. To top it off, one of the skills you need to pull off this maneuver is hidden almost as well, and I never would have found it if not for a total accident of trying to double jump to save myself from dying after getting knocked off a ledge. Finally, to make matters worse, once you reach the item, you have to go through a hidden pathway in a wall via a ton of trial and error jumping (because you can't see yourself in the wall) to bypass a blockade. Literally the only way you locate this item is 1.) HOURS of exhausting all possibilities, or 2.) Look it up. This is something that should be hiding some powerful piece of optional gear, not a mandatory item you need to proceed through a door. Terrible design on that one.\n\nAnyway, with my gripes out of the way, the game really does have quite a lot going for it. Trying to balance the scale to get the most out of buffs is oddly addicting, and I have spent a ton of hours just brainstorming different potential combinations. Throughout the game you get more and more slots for your scales, and it's just a lot of fun to try to be as well-rounded as possible without accidentally doubling a buff and not getting credit for one of them. A really cool system in my opinion.\n\nWith all that said, yeah, I still definitely recommend it. An easy 8/10 from me.

I never expected to fall in love with this game, but it was captivating and never lost my interest. I'm a little sad that the adventure is over, but it's an experience I'll remember for a long time.\n\n+ The gameplay is amazing. The combat starts off simple, but as you go through the game it gets way more interesting. The combat has a nice flow to it because you can cancel attacks into nearly anything, including jumps. Magic is performed buy holding the special button and doing a command, while entering the command the screen pauses (this can be disabled, and is always disabled above hard mode), so you can observe your surroundings and pick the right spell. Magic also has invincibility upon activation, but you can't spam magic to stay invincible forever because Stamina (ST) is needed to use magic. You build ST by attacking and if you don't hit an enemy with your weapon for too long, your ST begins to drain, additionally, after a spell is cast there's a cooldown before your attacks can build ST again. In addition to magic, you also have combat items that can be handy for enemy encounters or solving puzzles.\n\n+ There are many customization systems that add to the combat; a skill tree you spend force on to gain stats and learn magic, attribute points you earn from level ups that can be reallocated, abilities you can equip using magic crystals, and the Libra system that allows you to use items to get bonuses. Every weapon, armor and shield gains experience as you use them and when mastered you either learn an ability or get a magic crystal. Mastered equipment also lets you equip the ability they teach for free, and if they don't teach an ability their stats are enhanced. All of these systems work together to create a fluid and fun combat system. The game's combat is constantly evolving thanks to the systems and it always feels fresh.  Once you beat the main story, the game introduces even more systems but i'll leave those as a surprise. Lastly, the game has a lot of great boss fights, so the complex systems aren't wasted. I played on Hard, and felt the game had a nice challenge.\n\n+ The story is very entertaining. The Hero is a semi-silent protagonist; there's no text when he speaks, instead he speaks in the story through ineligible speech bubbles and there's always a lot of context to figure out what he's saying, but you have to use your imagination to see how he communicates. I was a nice change of pace from the standard silent protagonist in RPGs since the Hero still reacts to events around him. There are many twist and revelations that are foreshadowed and push the story in an interesting direction while giving it some complexity. The game has a lot of dialog, but I felt it (usually) paced the cutscenes and gameplay well. I'd go into a deeper dive, but I don't wanna get into spoilers.\n\n+ The music is fantastic. There's over 100 songs and many of them are memorable; from catchy songs on the map to heart pumping boss themes, there's a wide ranges of music that's used effectively.\n\n+ There's tons of content. With Six secret bosses, an arena, a 10-20 hour post game and more, you'll be spending dozens of hours trying to do everything.\n\n+ I  never encountered crashes, so the game was very stable. The game also works great on Steam Deck.\n\n* The visuals are a mixed bag. The art is great, but the enemy animations could use some work.\n\n- The translation is rough. It's good enough to read and understand what's going on but there's grammatical errors, typos some phrases that read awkwardly, etc. They've been improving the translation with patches, so this con could go away.\n\n- The Lich King in Chapter 5 is the worst boss in the game, he shouldn't be allowed to summon the Wyvern (a mini boss you fought earlier in the chapter).\n\n- Fighting [spoiler]Geas Roots[/spoiler] 7 times in the post game was too much. I understand why it happened, but I wish each fight varied more.\n\nHonestly, every issue I had with the game is minor and they didn't affect my enjoyment.\n\nAstlibra Revision is a hidden gem and I don't say that lightly; one of the best games I've played all year and I highly recommend it.

I will also continue to play to the end because the story is serviceable and good for the most part. \n\nI say for the most part because none of the characters are really all that deep, nor do they have a ton of character. When you boil down multiple female characters to fawning over the main character or being in awkward situations with him, or just straight up saying weird fetishy things (\"Wake up now or I'll pull off your pants! Wake up now or I'll put my sweaty feet on your face!\"), it really just feels out of place and weird. Also, playing off a lesbian relationship as goofy and non-serious in the face of demise left a bad taste in my mouth. What feels even more weird and out of place is a weirdly literally romanticized sibling relationship between two characters. It's seems like it's supposed to be serious, which really ruins the impact of any moments between those two characters. It just turns those moments into a weird semi-pedophilic creepy relationship. \n\nI can recommend this game for the gameplay and most of the story, but I feel that those uncomfortable beats in the story so far should be mentioned.

The game is also HUGE, like 50-80 hours huge depending on how much you want to go for all the armors and weapons.

Probably a skill issue on my end? Who knows. It didn't deter me in the slightest however, it's a minor issue.\n\nLastly, the OST is goddamn phenomenal. I will literally be scouring the relevant websites to get all of the songs I want downloaded once I can (I am writing this at 3am after 100% the achievements hahahahahaha), it has a little bit of everything, seriously.

However I downloaded the demo and played it to the end and had to immediately buy it. The gameplay more than makes up for the mediocre but passable graphics, as well as a killer soundtrack that you can play from the title screen with each track you 'unlock' as you play the game.\n\nPROS:\n- JRPG Story base and in depth character development (though it may take a few chapters for this to set in)\n- Metroidvania Goodness, hack and slash -esque combat with a diverse way to customize your character to handle any challenge the game puts forth.\n- Summons! Six different elements you can assign a summon to, and each category has a slew of different summons you can unlock and customize a loadout with\n- Massive and extensive skill web (Reminiscent of FF10 or Path of Exile, Salt & Sanctuary, etc.)\n- Equipment learning system: Mastering Weapons/Shields/Armor will grant you perk points or perk skills allowing you to customize yourself with unique and powerful passive abilities, like double jump, treasure finding, and the like\n- Item Crafting System: Large and extensive crafting recipe system to create items that will help in your progression through the game\n- Item Stat Gains: A system allowing you to set certain items in special slots that give permanent bonuses while equipped and can save multiple different sets allowing for different loadouts, such as farming or debuff resistant builds\n- Free Respec: At any time (at certain locations) you can alter your stats from your level ups, adjusting as necessary to the challenges presented in the game\n- Combat system that is in depth and grows as you learn more skills throughout the game, such as perfect guarding, parrying, shield bashing, etc.\n- Bosses, bosses FEEL like bosses, always an amazing boss battle music accompaniment and amazing artwork for the bosses you encounter, and use of mechanics to win later encounters. You can't just roll face across the keyboard to win depending on the difficulty you play at, but normal and above you can only get away with that for the first one or two 'intro' bosses.\n- Replayability! You always have the option and opportunity to return to locations you've been before even if it doesn't feel like it, so if you've missed something you can always come back, as there are rewards for full completion.\n- Length: The game is long, from start to finish and including the post game (yes there's actually a section the game itself refers to post game that is required to 'finish' the game) As of the time of writing I think I'm within the last two chapters and I've put 40 hours into it. So its well worth the money for a Metroidvania RPG\n\nCONS:\n- Story is very much in JRPG style, so with the pros that brings there are also cons, there are some cringe-y tropes that are associated with that that pop up here and there. If you can get past that, its not really that big of a con but some can take away from the seriousness presented in the story.\n- Puzzles, story progression does require some puzzles to be solved to advance, and while NPC placement allows to offer hints to push you in the right direction some puzzles will make you question your existence, and there's not a huge online support for guides or reference to this game other than youtube playthroughs (at the time of writing this review)\n- After a while the game encourages grinding like a typical JRPG would warrant, but in a metroidvania setting that's not difficult to do, but at the same time monotonous and sometimes tedious, not that grinding in any game is fun or fulfilling but it is a boring point of the game unless you mix things up and use it to try new builds and equipment loadouts or try to master equipment.\n- Arena Missions: There is an arena that poses 5 challenges per chapter of the game and offers almost necessary rewards to progress through the game and most have timed challenges or 'don't get hit' requirements that make them difficult and sometimes grueling. I personally don't like arena type challenges in games unless they are truly optional or the reward is just a really good item that isn't entirely necessary. Not in this case. Thus it is listed as a con for me, but I know some people actually like challenges such as these.\n\nTakeaway:\n\nIf you like having full control over stat and character progression this game gives you that control, and even manipulation over it, as well as passives and active skills alongside actual equipment loadouts. And there's so much progression you don't get to feel like you're capped out or you're done, as there is always more. The game is always kind and gives you a heads up when you'll be going away from the 'hub' and be locked into an area until its completed so that way you can prepare accordingly and even after transitioning there will be shops available for continuing access to supplies so you're not left high and dry. Even with the cons and complaints I have with the game the Pros greatly exceed them, and I would list this in my top 5 metroidvania games.", "timestamp_created": 1669747983, "timestamp_updated": 1669747983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127581943": {"recommendationid": "127581943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212485543", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 6526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 740, "last_played": 1688824720}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say?

I have to preface this saying the dialogue feels like it was written by a teenager going through puberty, it's agonizingly perverted and borders on being offensive to women. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game. I will split this review into two categories: Combat and Story, I'll sprinkle in progression/exploration along the way. Don't worry I will not spoil anything related to the story, although frankly the story is so cliche you wouldn't really be missing out on anything.\n\nCombat:\n\nThe main selling point of this is the combat system. The controls are surprisingly fluid, despite how the game looks in the trailer. How the combat works is you have a variety of different weapon types, these are all pretty basic and uninteresting. Where it gets interesting is the magic system. Magic doesn't use a standard MP pool, rather you get MP by attacking monsters and it degrades over time. What further enhances the system is when you use magic you are invincible temporarily. This makes combat have a nice flow where you attack to gain mana and then quickly use a magic ability to block enemy attacks while continuing the combo. It's very reminiscent of Bloodborne where it emphasizes attacking over defense. The combat isn't always consistent (magic can block damage, but not status effects like petrification or poison), but it's definitely the highlight of the game.\n\nThe world is not interconnected, rather it follows a hub-style system. Your main base of operations leads you to separate areas in the world instead of it being woven into one giant map. Think Demon Souls vs Sekiro. This isn't a negative point towards the game, but is something to note about how it's different from most modern metroidvanias that have interwoven maps like Hollow Knight. Progression is grindy, but pretty basic overall. Each area has a fixed number of special equipment of each type (two weapons, one shield, one armor, one accessory) that you can find via chests. This is separate from each area having its own shop with a large selection of new weapons, armors, and accessories. I must reiterate, there are a wide variety of different weapon types, but they all function the same and only change from a stat perspective. So a spear from chapter one functions the same as a spear from chapter 3 outside of it having upgraded stats and maybe some debuff/elemental damage tied to it. There are a few actual unique weapons in the game, but they're small in number. \n\nStory/Dialogue:\n\nThe main story is about time travel, however it doesn't flow very well. Each chapter ends with a b-roll and credit sequence. This tells me the developers may have released the game in parts rather than everything being a cohesive narrative, and it shows. It comes across as very jarring at times with how flip floppy everything is. Each chapter functions as its own separate story which also slowly progresses the main plot point. Every chapter is one cliche after another. The vast majority of characters function in their own chapter only and you will never see them again. I'm honestly surprised by how many reviews are praising the story. It's filled with plot holes and inconsistencies. The only saving grace is that there are choices with consequences, but even that has no value because the game has a bunch of flags telling you the choice you made could have consequences in the future.\n\nNow comes the worst part... which is the dialogue. It's atrociously bad. It was written with the developers dicks rather than their brains and it shows. Female NPCs are constantly calling your character different shades of attractive. Male NPCs cat call female NPCs and companions constantly and are outright creepy about it (an old man talks about the breasts of a teenage girl????). One of the female companions will threaten to wake up the main character by \"putting their sweaty feet on your face\" while he is sleeping or \"removing their used panties and stuffing it in the main characters mouth\". I kid you not, this is the actual dialogue in the game. I'm not a prude, but the dialogue is like a very bad hentai without the nudity.\n\nOverall, the combat is interesting but is marred by the average story and terrible dialogue.", "timestamp_created": 1669284908, "timestamp_updated": 1669284908, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605583131313323975", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126564414": {"recommendationid": "126564414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042709093", "num_games_owned": 1205, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1692164174}, "language": "english", "review": "This game came out of no where from a developer never heard of, I cannot praise this game enough.

It's a really interesting and slightly complex story but I've been interested the entire time, even enough to read additional in game lore books and the like. \n\nFor a JRPG the grind doesn't feel all too bad, but I also haven't done any end game stuff yet, so I could be very wrong about this soon, so far though resources/money/experience and equipment mastery have been easy to gain and have consistently grown in proportion to the difficulty. \n\nThis game is an action JRPG, and a unique one at that. While the animations look a bit choppy, the game play is quite smooth, and it encourages the use of all skills at your disposal, the controls are very polished in this regard as well, the game feels fun and intuitive to play. \n\nThis game is either a collectathon enjoyer's worst nightmare or dream game. There is a ton of things to collect whether it be magic abilities, weapons and materials, equipment skills, filling out the \"growth\" map., etc. A ton to do, however it's made more rewarding due to the fact that you can easily plan out very efficient farming routes for both enemies and resources all while swapping in and out weapons/shields and armor to max out equipment skills or get an item for 'mastering' the particular weapon or armor all at once. \n\nAlso by equipment skills I mean abilities like passive upgrades to attack speed, or elemental damage, or even item magnet abilities. You can use them for free if you have the weapon or armor equipped, or you also have a growing ability to use unequipped but mastered skills which grows over time. \n\nThe actual combat itself, while it feels nice does get a bit mundane as eventually when you get good at it, it's quite easy at normal difficulty. There is a variety of things you can do combat wise, and it grows over time as you collect combat abilities. Though these you usually get from chests it seems. Blocking is valuable as well, it's great for projectiles and protects against status ailments. You also can utilize the invincibility frames you get when you use the magic in this game, and you use both ranged and melee abilities along with magic as sort of a catch all Gary Stu type. \n\nOn top of this you also have a variety of items you can use to fit any situation, from all enemies in a room being heavily damaged, to throwing an arrow by hand which is surprisingly powerful early on. The game also utilizes a delayed item use system. So you use a healing item, a progress bar appears, and then the item is used. If you are struck/leave that zone etc it will cancel it. It hasn't been difficult to break away from fights to heal/shoot a bow at a distance as well. \n\nNo autosave system, save often, and when you interact with a save point all enemies not in that zone are resurrected. If you leave your zone and come back those enemies do respawn as well.\n\nThere is a lot of depth to this game too. An arena with multiple and varied \"cups\" ranging from platforming  and combat challenges to speed challenges. You are able to backtrack after you've progressed to a certain point in the story, so don't overly stress on leaving things behind. Though the catch is you have to complete the chapter again. Makes the game ideal for speed runners I guess. You even get your own house and back yard. Unknown if any visual or functional customization is possible. \n\nThere is a lot of freedom in character customization as well. You can allocate 5 points to attributes every level, but you can reallocate them as you see fit at specific points scattered throughout the game, and there is some strategy to this, even terrain dependent strategy. You're well served just bumping attack, defense, and health too, at least as far as I've gotten in the game.\n\nThere are many puzzles, and a lot of context clues as you watch cutscenes. This game is cutscene heavy, so for those of you who may remember that boss fight with Riku during the old PS2 KH1 days you can rejoice, for this game features a skip button.\n\nIt's a semi silent protagonist. I think it's deliberate, as the character will talk in game, but you can't see his words. There is always context that let's you know what he's talking about, but let's you sort of fill in the blanks of how he communicates it with your own imagination.\n\nThis game plays excellently on Steam Deck. There's some choppy audio, but I've not been bothered enough to try and fix it, so there may be a workaround for it I just haven't utilized. It's also really good with the battery life. Like you're hitting the top end of the \"possible hours\" of a single charge. Though that may be obvious as its not that graphics intensive. \n\nOverall I definitely recommend this game, there's a lot to do and it's very approachable but if you want to can turn the difficulty up to 11. I haven't tried that yet so I don't know how the challenge is balanced, I would say it's likely a damage sponge method given the health pools of some bosses. This is speculation though, and it could be user error with regards to my damage output, so your milage may vary. \n\nLastly, it's pretty clear a lot of love and care went into this game, and I think the developer nailed something really cool, unique and fun to play here. There's even a demo if you really need to see for yourself. I believe that this game is definitely worth picking up.\n\n\n*Edit: I am incorrect about having to complete whole chapters over if you go back to them.\n\nGame finished edit: I can honestly say this is a must buy for me. Probably if not definitely my GOTY. I literally played non-stop until I finished it, and I didn't feel like any part of it was a chore except one specific thing at the absolute very last part of the game, but even then the methodology is interesting and fun for the most part.

Even on harder difficulties game is rewarding, it does require some farming from time to time but its sure worth it and the progression system is one of the best i've seen so far! It has JRPG & metroidvania elements and its very polished considering its done by only 1 person, the amount of mechanics you get access to at the start is insane. Combat can feel repetitive for sure but it feels weighty and badass at the same time. I strongly suggest going for hard difficulty and below, I think Hell is the sweet spot at the moment because I started from Hard and went to Hell because the felt a bit too easy when you start to utilize the game's mechanics and learn how the enemies work, impossible is a strick NO GO( you get 2 shot, sometimes 1 shot so not really a friendly mechanic i'd say, maybe in the endgame when you've leveled up or something). I know I've only completed the first chapter and its too early for a review but I wanted to share my current love for this game & sincerely hope that my opinion won't change later on. The only thing I have problem with currently is the demo. it doesn't really do the game justice, you just get bombarded with all of the mechanics you must aquire for 5 hours in 1 min and you have no idea whats happening, demo should have been the whole first chapter in my opinion so if you try the demo and you don't like it - don't get discouraged, buy the game and try to get as much from it in the first 2 hours then refund it if you don't like it!  ONE MORE THING - just wanna say that I am 10 times more excited to play this game than GOW Ragnarok( my copy is just collecting dust in the other room at the moment) : PP", "timestamp_created": 1668861708, "timestamp_updated": 1668861981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125740089": {"recommendationid": "125740089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880031540", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1669279755}, "language": "english", "review": "the first few hours of this game are extremely hard to get into buuuuuuuuut afterwards you just stay drawn into the games story that is absolutely wonderful with a good difficulty to keep you into it.\nthe story just keeps going and going and going but you just cant seem to get away from playing because its so fun and good.\nnow the shield rush is incredibly annoying but once you get decent enough it will stop being bad and you learn to use it properly after you gain a few pieces of equipment that doesnt make it work against you a majority of the time.\ni highly recommend this game with it being a long long time since ive played this many hours on a game within a week because i cant seem to stop playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1668849084, "timestamp_updated": 1669200792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125734703": {"recommendationid": "125734703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143552596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4557, "last_played": 1668791194}, "language": "english", "review": "WOW, What a game.\n\nI have a difficult taste in game.

Went through the main game and post game story. TLDR: Good game, alright story, lots of fun mechanics, really fun but challenging in a technical way on Difficult / Hell difficulty. Expanded thoughts below:\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - Plays similarly to some side-scrolling action platformers, thinking Castlevania series. Character has a bit finer motion control, several fun movement and attack abilities, etc. Magic feels varied and presents unique attack / defense opportunities, especially combined with Karon's skills that can totally change mechanics. There are tons of items to collect, lots of mix and match stats, and the different weapon classes feel unique. Bosses are fun, trash mobs have varied looks and basic attacks, and the levels are passable. I did have some frustration on some sections (the hopping enemies that attach to you and make you bleed... I love those @_@). Overall, very fun game.\n\n[b]Visuals[/b] - Decent visuals. Reminiscent of flash gameplay, but it's a little more polished. Most big boss sprites look great. Enemies have decent enough palettes and silhouettes to be recognizable and fun. But yeah, the bug bosses and effects are where the game shines. My only minor complaint, especially in the postgame bosses, is there would be enough going on I would sometimes lose track of my nameless hero. Or the attack particles / sprites would get hidden by flashes and other effects. Not terrible, but playing on Hell with the Berserk skill active... left me ripping a few blue hairs out of my gorgeous locks.\n\n[b]Music and Audio]/b] - The general audio (voice sound, effect sounds, etc) are good. Not great, but good. They are distinct enough you can tie sounds to specific effects, abilities, etc. They also have enough impact to make you feel like you're hitting, taking hits, etc. However, the game really shines with its soundtrack. I noticed a lot of [i]sakuzo[/i] pieces, which I loved. I also loved a lot of the future themes. Really amps up the gameplay. Nothing felt out of place in the game, and all the general / action pieces got my 'engine revving,' he he.\n\n[b]Story[/b] - This is probably the weakest part of the game. I enjoyed it, but the post-game story definitely takes the wind out of the main narrative. Somewhat overstaying its welcome. The characters are all fun, if not a bit tropey (how many times do we have to discuss groping, pervy thoughts, and scandelous things ladies?). But it's all in a PG way that is overall fun. Time-travel stories all get weird anyway. And there's a bit of mixed moralization in some places. Overall, serviceable story, fun tropey characters.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b][u]Final Verdict[/u][/b] - Good game with great gameplay, decent visuals, decent technical combat, a really good soundtrack, and an okay story.

It's a finished and incredibly polished. \n\nAstlibra can easily take its place among the JRPG behemoths of the 16 bit era, and it may well be one of the best -if not THE best- JRPG ever made. The fact that this was created by a single person is simply mind blowing.\n\nAlthough you can still clearly feel the indie jankiness in the game, it has been polished to the degree where it just becomes its art style. At times you feel like you're playing a mid-2000s flash game that has been iterated on a million times until it was effectively a AAA release. It borrows stylistic elements from at least a dozen other successful IPs yet manages to outshine most of them in execution.\n\nWhile I could go on endlessly about the things Astlibra does well, let me critique the few things that it didn't. \n\n- The music is sometimes a bit of off. While overall the soundtrack has been very good, it does have weak points.\n- The translation work is occasionally lacking. It's not nearly as bad as it could be, but you can tell it's a game made primarily for a Japanese audience.\n- There is a strong focus on grinding for power. This is perfectly fine and expected in the genre, but especially towards the level 40-50 areas you are no longer expected to grind where the story takes you. If you fail to figure that out, it can feel like you're running into a brick wall.\n- The hardest challenges in the game effectively turn into bullet hell gameplay. That's also fine, but at times the visual clarity is severely lacking which can make the challenge feel artificially difficult.\n- There are some random pop-ups of out of place sexually suggestive art that can at best be explained by \"Japanese game\". They are very few though.\n- The optional content (i.e. arena challenges) are not very optional at all and yield de-facto required items.\n\n\nTo recapitulate: 10/10, amazing game, would recommend to anyone even remotely into JRPG.", "timestamp_created": 1668096564, "timestamp_updated": 1668096564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125232566": {"recommendationid": "125232566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003951567", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1525, "last_played": 1683356883}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

A 61-hour long obsession later, it\u2019s ridiculous how Astlibra has become hands-down the best game I have played all year.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Astlibra ran fine. I\u2019ve experienced no crashes or other miscellaneous performance issues. However, there have been some minor issues that would appear every now and again, such as the game struggling to initiate dialogue when approaching an NPC from the wrong side, or spawning enemies and chests in odd positions. One achievement did fail to fire during gameplay but was awarded when I next booted the game so it really all just amounts to, at worst, minor annoyances.\n\nThe most blatant issue instead is the translation. I am no stranger to games that aren\u2019t mainly developed in English, and Astlibra has been continuously improving, but currently still features a myriad of typing and punctuation errors \u2013 or at worst thorough mistranslations. As an example, and I fully expect this to be fixed fairly soon, is a skill that reads: \u201cResistance to all abnormalities +10, break damage increased 1.5 times\" \u2013 whereas the actual effect causes you to take 1.5x damage instead. The overall game is coherent, but you're bound to stumble over some oddities in its script, regardless of whether it is item descriptions, skills, or story sequences.\n\nGraphics and Soundtrack are a bit more mixed and I\u2019ve even seen other reviews criticize it as looking \u2018stock\u2019 \u2013 personally, I found it captivating; Almost Madoka Magica-esque which leans quite well into some of the more \u2018out-there\u2019 chapters of the remarkably unique story. Now the issue for some may be less the artstyle, but rather how inconsistent it is sometimes applied \u2013 a criticism that does overlap with both the soundtrack and seeps into the writing every now and again; A scene may be macabre and nightmarish but is also always contrasted by character-designs and writing like Gau, that feels more akin to a regular Shounen Anime. In short: There is a lot of tonal whiplash that touches every aspect of the general atmosphere of the game. Nevertheless, the takeaway should still be that the presentation, music \u2013 and especially the writing is competent: The latter especially is captivating by virtue of the setting alone and presenting a take on an often awfully mishandled genre. \n\nGameplay is an entirely different deal however. As it stands, Astlibra shines through a myriad of different character progression systems \u2013 you have regular stats, physical, magical, defensive, utility \u2013 which can all be enhanced on their own per level up. Naturally gear also carries stats, but where it becomes more interesting is by each piece of weaponry and armor also having an innate skill that can be earned by actively using it. Alternatively, maxing out a piece of equipment may also give you a greater limit in how many of these skills you can use simultaneously. Then a third way to progress is by the Force-Grid; Essentially an experience-like resource that can be spent on an ability-grid which is a bit comparable to Path of Exile, or Final Fantasy 10. The result is that grinding feels extremely rewarding \u2013 and not just rewarding, but also avoids repetition by incentivizing constantly switching your loadout. \n\nAnother system that is thematically interesting and a way to progress your character aside from raw grind is the Libra \u2013 a set of scales that is upgraded throughout the story/exploration and that provides differing benefits on the basis of which items are being placed on them. Basically every item in your inventory that is not equipment is assigned a weight and innate stats (i.e. A bonus to attack power); An item placed on the scales provides its effect if it is countered as much as possible by another item with a differing effect. \n\nSome aspects of the core stats may be a little too ambiguous; Such as Adaptability not mentioning its effect on your resistances, or providing sufficient information on soft-caps and just how exactly the trillionth investment in Speed scales (heh). This may be a positive for some as it, too, encourages experimentation and mixing up your playstyle and at the end of the day is never really that big of an issue regardless, but may also be a symptom of the current translation status.\n\nCombat is fluent, but struggles a little with a proper difficulty curve. Playing on Hard from start to finish, the game felt perfectly fine \u2013 if a little easy during the initial chapters, consistently ramping up to a jump in difficulty around Chapter 6, which is also right around the time I started going after the optional bosses. After a few more chapters and upon unlocking the additional progression systems during late-game, the difficulty not just plateaus, but completely inverts in the favor of the player. At this point, you\u2019re likely to have spent around 40+ hours, but it is still a little disappointing that the game never managed to catch back up to the escalation in player power.\n\nSomething that could have alleviated this may have been the inclusion of multiple peripheral game modes. As it stands, between story progression and grinding, the player only ever has access to an arena mode of different gimmicky fights. Likewise, while it is possible to change your difficulty down; it is not possible to set it higher \u2013 something that I definitely would have appreciated to counteract some of the more dry sections towards the finale of the game.\n\n\n[u]TL;DR[/u]\n+ Expansive 40-60+ hour story that is extremely focused at the cost of not featuring a lot of peripheral content.\n+ Well-developed and deep character progression that properly incentivizes experimenting with the combat system.\n+ Shiro\u2019s wake-up calls.\n\n+/- Competent setting that tackles [spoiler]time-traveling[/spoiler] in a way that I have not seen in any other game, anime, book, or otherwise. However, the writing may suffer due to tonal whiplash and a more general lack of direction within the last chapter(s) of the game.\n+/- Unique art-direction that leads to some of the most memorable enemy designs I\u2019ve seen, but is also often contrasted by a similar tonal whiplash that I have described for the story. \n\n- Balance and Difficulty begins to crumble after the introduction of late-game progression systems and could be easily alleviated by allowing the player to tweak the difficulty freely rather than only to lower it.\n- Currently rather lackluster translation \u2013 While generally coherent, there are very apparent errors that tend to stick out and may be immersion breaking. Likewise mistranslated skills could lead to genuine frustration.\n\nEven reading this back to myself before posting, it\u2019s very apparent that Astlibra is far from flawless \u2013 but that\u2019s not really the point. The developer understands what makes the genre *fun* - regardless of any quirks the game may carry. It is *fun* to grab new weapons and to experiment. It is equally *fun* to progress from chapter to chapter and follow the small tidbits of character stories \u2013 some intentionally or unintentionally humorous, some serious - to anticipate the next big story beats and enjoy the twists and turns along the way. It all works in the end, even if the game is a little janky - that bit of jank makes it all somehow click together.

[/h1]\n\nI grew up playing old-school adventure game / RPG's when they were new. Your Final Fantasys, Secret of Mana, Castlevania, Act raiser, Valkyrie Profile etc. There's been a drought of JRPG's lately, and I sorted Steam by the JRPG tag to see what was up. Most of the games were fine, but nothing really piqued my interest or my eye. Then I saw a game with a funny name, terrible graphics and \"overwhelmingly positive\" for the reviews. I scanned the page, watched the trailer and checked out some images. The old-school progression and side-scrolling combat looked fun, but even an older dude like myself was completely turned off by the graphics.\n\nI am so glad that I gave it a chance despite my first impressions. This is one of the best games I have played in the past decade, perhaps even in my lifetime. I put this game up there with other genre-defining titles such as Final Fantasy VII/IX/X, Nier, Nier Automata, Legend of Dragoon and the likes of Squaresoft/Enix's blockbusters. If you are anything like myself and are interested in this game but turned off by the graphics, please give this game a chance. With this out of the way, I'll get into the review proper, taking the most time with the gameplay systems and tackling graphics last.\n\n[b] GAMEPLAY [/b]: Gameplay is a 2D side scrolling action game like Castlevania is. The thing here is the game has MANY avenues for character progression, with some of the options being incredibly interesting and different from what the industry has done previously. These features heavily influence the aforementioned 2D side scrolling action combat. You have an equipment system where nearly every piece of equipment in the game has a skill which you need to earn enough EXP to unlock (Think Final Fantasy IX). These range from simple stat boosts to straight-up entirely new mechanics that you will weave into your gameplay loop.\n\nYou have a \"scale\" system, where you have to put in items you collect on your adventure (Potions, food items, materials, monster drops, etc) to gain bonus stats. Each item has a weight value attached to it, and your goal is to balance these sets of scales according to the benefits the item in question brings and the weight it has attached to it. This causes a lot of thought based on what stats you value and how to make them work in the confines of the weight attached to them.\n\nAnd finally you have \"possession\" skills that rely on a meter you fill up with active combat attacks. These skills are varied, you can swap them out for other skills, and using them makes you invincible for a short period upon activation. These skills range from buffs, to attacks, to utility and more.\n\nWhat makes this game such a masterpiece is how all of these systems work together to form such a fluid combat system that has an immense amount of depth and fluidity. You learn the basics in the first 5-10 hours of gameplay, and you're constantly having new tools available to the player as you progress but nothing makes anything else obsolete. They just give you more options and more tools to mix up the flow of combat by weaving these options together. Most of these tools have either cool downs/resource bar requirements to work and how you play the game will drastically change depending on how aggressive you want to be in encounters. You COULD run it, hit the boss a few times and run out and block, or you could mix up Possession skills for invincibility to block a huge boss attack, be aggressive, block a few attacks with your shield - but now your block gauge is gone and you have no meter for Posession skills, so you backslide for the iframes THROUGH a boss attack to get enough meter and shield gauge to continue the flow of combat.\n\nI could honestly go on and on about simple things, such as how the hitstop slows combat down enough so that you can see the insane amount of action on the screen at once so you can make a decision that would not be afforded to you if you were playing passive and NOT slowing down the combat with the hitstop. It is so fluid and masterfully executed that I'm beyond impressed that a single guy managed to pull off what I consider to be one of the best combat systems I have ever played in a game. The combat is as intricate as you want it to be. The better you, as the player, will determine how aggressive and relentless you will be.\n\n[b] STORY [/b] - The story is excellent. I wasn't expecting much, but I was honestly really impressed with what I got. It started out as a simple story with some intrigue, light-hearted themes with some melancholy thrown in. As you continue to play the game the world, its characters and its plot opens up and becomes more and more intriguing with the stakes being raised through your action. I can't go too in depth without spoiling the game, but I will say that this game can blend future-dystopian themes with gods, folklore, demons and mechs. What's amazing here is how Mr Keizo has let these themes be disjointing when they need to be to suit the story, and seamless and fluid when that is important to the story. Nothing touched on in this story is pretentious, and the story itself is pretty simple as far as a story involving time travel can go. But it's humbling, it's comforting and while it doesn't reach the insane heights' something like NIER does, it's a competent and compelling story in its own right. You end up caring for the characters, the world and the story. The only issue is some rough translation work that can make some of the script come across as a little \"stiff\" at times, but it's not too intrusive to take away from the experience.\n\n[b] MUSIC [/b] - The music is fantastic. There's your standard fantasy violin tracks, piano pieces and it all is really competent and makes the world feel alive. When the story needs it, it even has modern tracks like some electronic with vocals that honestly sounds wonderful. I felt like each piece fit the location really well, with the exception to a couple tracks that honestly really did not fit their encounters. JRock when fighting a fiery demon god? I can dig it but it just didn't really fit and kind of took me out of that fight.\n\n[b] GRAPHICS [/b] - And here's what I saved for last, and with good reason. Out of all the cons I have for the game (Some area design from a gameplay standpoint, enemy placement, enemy design from a gameplay standpoint) graphics are objectively pretty poor. The developer, Mr Kezio, was virtually a one-man team and did what he could with what he had. The terrain is especially jarring, but when you take into account the fact it was one man working on this I feel like it's forgivable. I would argue that perhaps due to the limitations on the graphics that the other systems were allowed to be so fleshed-out and shine like they do. The graphics ended up appealing to me after a while, perhaps Stockholm syndrome. The quality improved a lot as the game went on, which I have to assume was due to the game being a 14-year passion project by a lone guy. If anybody is going to be turned off from the game, I have to imagine this is where it will be. I hope you will overlook them, as the game itself is a complete masterpiece, but I understand if you cannot.\n\n[b] CONCLUSION[/b] - This is perhaps one of the best, most fluid and cohesive games I have ever played in my life.

Even 30 hours in it keeps the constant feed of new moves/mechanics/gear going.

The game is not a true metroidvania in the traditional sense, so if you are looking for that style of game, this is not it.  There is freedom to backtrack, but really required exactly.\n\nThe story is very well written, and without giving too much away, is based around the theory of time-traveling and the consequences that come along with it.  Think Chrono Trigger on steroids, or the TV show DARK.  The combat systems are great as each piece of equipment can be \"mastered\" if you use it for a bit, unlocking passives for your character.  There is a stat skill tree as well that is staggering in size that is almost a game within the game itself.  Exploring the stat tree leads to hidden items and special abilties.  There is a ton you can grind here and it's an absolute joy to do so as you are constantly unlocking things through the entire 70 hour journey.  There are multiple difficulty options as well to make the game feel the way you want it to,\n\nA staggering amount of content, satisfying combat, deep character building systems, and a great story make this game well worth the small asking price.  Do not dismiss this game based on the visuals and animation, this was a game 15 years in the making and you will be cheating yourself out of one of the best sleeper games of the year.", "timestamp_created": 1666712706, "timestamp_updated": 1666712706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880568802356719971", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124367036": {"recommendationid": "124367036", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993586414", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 3905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3885, "last_played": 1697666210}, "language": "english", "review": "This game might be perfect.", "timestamp_created": 1666701457, "timestamp_updated": 1666701457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124366623": {"recommendationid": "124366623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026229097", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5050, "last_played": 1698037296}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was a pleasant surprise. I tried the demo on a whim, and enjoyed it so much I bought the full game as soon as it released. The game was much lengthier than I expected it to be, and I spent a lot of time playing it; I initially bought it to tide me over until Persona 5 Royal hit Steam, but I ended up wanting to completely finishing the game even after it released. I obtained all of the achievements in around 80 hours, playing in Hard (or Difficult) mode, and even want to go through the game again on Hell mode.\n\nThere are some flaws, and the game could use a touch-up and polishing on the clarity of the translations, but the overall experience is great. The main story is interesting enough and will keep you wanting to progress more. The combat is addicting enough to just blast enemies to level up and/or farm materials and not feel like a chore most of the time. Boss fights can get pretty tense and even some normal enemies will keep you on your toes since there are a few jank hitboxes. There's a wide variety of equipment and skills to extract from said equipment to equip. The music is top-notch in most sections, even if a bit odd sometimes. There's even Vocaloid songs, surprisingly. I wish there was a way to get the OST or listen to it outside of the game somehow.\n\nHighly recommend this game if you are interested in 2D side-scrolling Action RPGs similar to Castlevania and others of the same vein. The current asking price of $25 feels like a great deal, although I got it for 10% off from the launch discount. Heck, just try the demo.

My playthrough was almost 80 hours. This game is DENSE with content.\n\nPROS:\n- Looks and sounds excellent\n- Great story (reminds me in some parts of Chrono Trigger/Cross, Okami)\n- Great characters\n- Mostly stays somewhat challenging (I played on Hard) while being unbalanced enough for you to get insanely powerful and do some broken ass sh!t if you want to. Many aspects to building up the protag's strength. Combat is excessively satisfying.\n- Has a postgame (new story developments included) with even more ways to get stupid powerful\n\nCONS:\n- The volcano area's boss is stupid. There's a couple sh!tty fights in the game but they're very much a minority.\n- The combat can get extremely loud at times with overlapping, repeating sound effects. This isn't necessarily a problem but it really made the game tire me out in longer sessions\n- The other female characters, thanks to how much time you spend with them, ended up being a lot more charming to me than the girl I was supposed to be finding/saving.

Amazing stuff.\n\nIn short, it is a side scroller with lots of different character progression, some focus on story and a lot of combat. The game is tagged as a metroidvania, but I'd consider that to be false. Each chapter is straight forward, yes you unlock stuff like double jump and dash, but it's not used to access previous areas in order to progress. It's mostly used to grab items and QoL.\n\nThe combat and especially the keybinds on controller may take a bit of getting used to. Blocking by pressing \"down\" and dodge backward bound to \"right trigger\" is a bit strange to begin with, but you get used to it. \n\nA couple of notes:\n[list]\n    [*] This is a grinder. On hard you *must* grind a fair bit. but with this combat and so much stuff to unlock i actually just loved this\n    [*] Some of the puzzles use force you to think outside the box, they are not that complicated at all, but the game expects you to know the items you have in your inventory. An example of this is that you will be using a item form chapter one in a late are puzzle\n    [*] The story is good, but also a bit confusing. Lots of time travel and unforseen consequences\n    [*] Hidden \"super\" bosses\n    [*] You can go back to previous chapters whenever you are not in currently in the middle of a new chapter, you won't \"miss\" items or interactions. Some items require you to go back later after obtaining items/skills, but this is mostly just for completionism\n[/list]\n\nThe cons\n[list]\n   [*] I really did NOT like the background music. It is repetitive as all hell. I ended up muting it (I gave it a shot every now and then)\n  [*] The exessive hitstop the game uses actually causes lag in some boss fights. Also if you do not like hitstop, give the demo a go before purchasing it\n  [*] The arena...my god this thing can be annoying. Every time you fail you have to go through loading screens, talk to a guy, select the mission you'd like to try again, another loading screen..\n  [*] Some of the arena challenges are just made to piss you off. \"Dont fall off these tiny platforms when killing enemies\", proceed to fall to your death because your weapon attacks \"charge\" your forward to your death... great stuff\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1666645938, "timestamp_updated": 1666645938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506933748722076416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124340240": {"recommendationid": "124340240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309051312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "playtime_at_review": 3136, "last_played": 1699735562}, "language": "english", "review": "very good", "timestamp_created": 1666643505, "timestamp_updated": 1666643505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124333530": {"recommendationid": "124333530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020930405", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3944, "last_played": 1666725961}, "language": "english", "review": "If you really like old school Ys games specifically the sidescroller RPG Ys III: Wanderers from Ys then you'll probably love Astlibra.\n\nThere are a number of sore spots like the Aguni boss fight in the lava area and a number of really frustrating bosses in the post-game story where they'll throw multiple 150k HP bosses with 1 hit kill lasers but despite all that I ultimately enjoyed the 60+ hours I spent with this game and would highly recommend it to anyone with:\n\n1. Someone who enjoys the difficulty of the Ys series\n2. Someone with a lot of patience\n\nThe post game is excellent btw: it kind of turns into a diablo-like loot game where enemies start to drop Weapon/Armor/Accessory boards which basically makes all equipment viable at the end game by letting you slot in extra bonus stats or skills into everything.\n\nTheres one other thing I should mention: I feel like this game is weirdly balanced around an ability in the game called \"Berserk\" which basically gives you 3x damage but also makes it so if you're hit once you die. Now maybe its because I was playing on Hard Mode but I was dying pretty much in 1 hit anyways without that ability.

Now that it is all said and done I will remember this game fondly. It has given me a sense of a nostalgia for the way games felt when I was younger.\n\nThe story was great, it starts a little slow but picks up steam as you move along. I stayed up much later then I should have several times as I got to key points in the story. Music felt like standard rpg fare at first, but really picks up in the later stages of the game. Combined with later boss fights and elements of the story it was just audible bliss.\n\nCombat seems simple but it comes off as very fluid and the magic system is very straightforward. My only gripe is that during combat there can be so many effects going on that it gets hard to keep track of your character, especially with some of the later skills. It's probably just me though I'm getting old and this in no way took away from my overall enjoyment. I'm glad that there is multiple upgrade systems it really makes the grind feel like it pays off as the character evolves. I particularly enjoyed the Karon system and being able to modify your character on the fly as needed.

It's been a ride which ate into my daily schedules and left me a sleepless wreck at work for a week and I do not regret this one bit. It's been a ride, and a magnificent one at that.\n\nGameplay is a 2D side scrolling brawler, with JRPG-style progression. The whole feel of it feels nostalgic and made me think of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which I really think the developer drew a lot of inspirations from. The best thing about gearing up and character progression is that the whole thing feels super rewarding... It actually made grinding fun for me because it's always very exciting to see what comes next beyond the mountain of grind.\n\nUnderstanding that the base of the game is actually a solo development freeware game made me overlook the animation janks and bugs that came along with it. Over the course of these few days, I've seen the developer putting out multiple patches for bug fixes, translation improvement and etc. Coming from games where developers just left the errors and bugs as is (cough, NIS), made me appreciate Astlibra's developer way more. A dragon sank through the ground one time and killing a God got me stuck in a timeless prison of the arena where I couldn't do anything or progress in another time, but seeing how proactive the developer is, I'm sure the game will be in a much, much more polished state when I'm back for round 2 to get the few remaining achievements.\n\nMusic is generally great BUT the occasional gratuitous English rap tracks do keep me on my toes. I shouldn't discuss this here because this review can very well turn into a thesis submission by the time I'm done.\n\nBottom Line: This game invoked such a nostalgic feel in me even when I've never even heard about Astlibra or the developer KEIZO until 5 days ago. Initially I got the game for the gameplay but the story hit me like a truck and I'm stuck on the ride in front of the windshield. I love this game so much like you wouldn't believe.\n\nAfter all that good stuff, the game leaves me wanting more. Like seriously, the game came out of nowhere and showed me its potential, leaving me slightly depressed knowing that if there's a sequel or any other project of this magnitude from the developer, it'll probably be a year to a few years away.\n\nI just hope it ain't 14 years away.", "timestamp_created": 1666274528, "timestamp_updated": 1666426878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70559161901473999", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124109578": {"recommendationid": "124109578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261877479", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1670834026}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't underestimate the shield \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb", "timestamp_created": 1666266168, "timestamp_updated": 1666266168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596644282341003418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124102828": {"recommendationid": "124102828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040308609", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 636, "last_played": 1689393696}, "language": "english", "review": "This is... my favorite game\n\nEDIT: Sry had to complete it and change my review.

There's a good variety of different progression mechanics that have kept me hooked; maxing out the XP bar for each weapon, shield, and armor piece to either unlock new skills or more capacity to equip skills has been especially compelling. Currently trying to survive while using the tree branch from the beginning of the game because I'm finally getting enough XP from enemies to make good progress on its bar haha. The story hasn't done much to blow me away yet but its mysteries and few core characters have been interesting enough.

While I appreciate the genre, for some reason, games like Hollow Knight or Dust tend to bore me after a few hours. The only other 2D game of this type that I enjoyed till the end was Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, a game that, till the end, I felt I really didn't want to end. Astlibra was the same for me.\n\nThere is much I could say about the very interesting progression mechanics, the fun and challenging combat on higher difficulties, and the unique and interesting art style that fits the game perfectly. Above all, I'd like to compliment the story. While the twists and revelations of many stories across all media became predictable to me after many years, Astlebra kept me guessing until the end. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will keep it short and simple. The characters are great, the backstory is well developed and introduced at a great pace for the player, and the twists and turns are surprising but not in an unbearable way with the related elements of the story already introduced. There are also many side details that you can piece together from clues found around the world through exploration.\n\nIt's not really a complaint; it doesn't bother me, but I know there are people who are bothered by some innuendos and sexualization. I wouldn't say there is a lot of it in the game, and for me, it was in no way a distraction from the story, but it is there. Some of it could be said to fit with the themes of the story, as gods and goddesses of old religions were heavily sexualized. (I think there could be a big debate about what sexual stuff is natural for us since we are beings born of desire, but well, I don't think review is the place for this.) Aside from that, I think it could do without, but it does help to develop the characters' relationship in some ways. Anyway, just be mindful of it if it's something that bothers you.\n\nWell?

The crafting system is intuitive and the leveling/power up system feels immensely rewarding as well. If you love JRPG/Metroidvanias you'll absolutely enjoy the heck out of this game.", "timestamp_created": 1665668411, "timestamp_updated": 1665680666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.412042170763015747", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123768529": {"recommendationid": "123768529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097688083", "num_games_owned": 1754, "num_reviews": 342, "playtime_forever": 3862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1682529350}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728[quote] 10/10 Side-scrolling Cats recommend this game.\n\nFollow my curation for more interesting games and genres.

But putting that aside, I decided to give it a honest try.\n\nIt felt like I was a kid again as silly as that sounds, playing games like Maplestory, running around mindlessly mowing down hoards of monsters for the sake of wanting to level up and farm materials for quests / weapon crafting. The story is pretty predictable, as in if you know something the characters do not you have to force them to do what you know you shouldn't, if that makes sense. \n\nThe story is good regardless, but the desire to want to actually go out and farm materials from monsters and minerals is just as good. I spent 2 hours in the demo area alone just unlocking everything and having fun and another 4+ hours in the lava cave, once again farming. \n\nThe proficiency system as well gives you a lot of reason to want to keep mowing down enemy after enemy along with the very fair growth system which is kind of similar to Final Fantasy XII with it's \"Zodiac\" system. Granting you new skills and bonuses in your overall character stats at the cost of grains from your enemies. If you can't afford lets say 5 green, you can use 15 of another colour to grow without having to search for those specific types of monster drops. \n\nThe issue with Boss HP scaling comes with the difficulty setting. Monsters will gain a lot more damage to you, while also having a lot more health. Easy mode has most bosses and the very first boss you encounter at level 7-9 (unless you power farm) with about 9k health which takes forever, but it's fine cause you take like no damage, however, the harder boss fights have over 20k while being able to one shot you if you haven't been power-leveling or doing proper hit and run tactics.\n\n[h1]My personal opinion?[/h1]\nI rarely get this attached to video games, the last time I was this invested in a story was when I was playing through Divinity Original Sin II. Lost in thought and the world I was exploring. \n\nTry the Demo. \n\nIt's very short and doesn't offer to much, but it will at the very least help you understand what the game is all about. \n\nIt can be a little bit confusing at first, but it's honestly really fun. The combat isn't perfect, but it's a Hack & Slash! Run in, mow down enemies and bosses, farm the materials and get some new gear, unlock new skills and weapons to take on bigger foes and challenges. \n\nThe game was developed by a solo Japanese developer for over 14 years. KEIZO has a daily job and only worked on the game after he got back home. You know it's not easily to develop a video game on your own especially over 14 years of development. However, with the help of prolific artist Shigatake (Dragon\u2019s Crown) and Haku Tatsufuchi (Magic: The Gathering), and Publisher WhisperGames, the game has got a \"Revision\" upgrade, which you see here today. \n\nStay and pay attention to the story, it might have it's translation errors here and there, but outside of that, it's pretty solid. It definitely makes me want to play it, not for any other reason than it's good and nostalgic.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt keeps getting BETTER and BETTER the more I play this game. The time travel, the plot, the story, the characters.
