Unfortunately, the decisions on offer are both highly restrictive and often devoid of meaning. \n\n\nIn my opinion, the game's primary failing is its gaunt strategic horizon. Most of my runs end with a character who battles the boss in the exact same way that they battled the level 1 snowman. If we want to explore why this is the case, we would need to look at how a Dicey Dungeons character evolves over the course of a run. To my knowledge, there are three primary ways in which a character grows in power: max hp increases, max active dice, and item acquisition. \n\nA problem that immediately jumps to mind here is that the first two (hp and die count) are totally passive increases. They come simply from leveling up. So, for two thirds of the character growth in the game, there is no choice. A player cannot exchange these resources for others; they are simply acquired through killing monsters. This leaves players with a single axis along which they can craft their character: items. Don't get me wrong, this can work; but the items in the game would need to be highly varied and offered in substantial quantity. Unfortunately, this is far from the case.\n\nTo give one specific example of my frustration with the itemization, lets look at how items are triggered. Some items require specific die values, some require > or < values, and some require a large sum of dice added together. This is a great system. It sets the items apart and cleverly creates a demand for certain types of die values which are entirely contingent on your chosen items. Wonderful.\n\nTragically, the game fails to fully implement this system when it gives the player almost no control over their own dice economy. This means that if I have many items which require high sums, more dice and high rolls are something which highly favors my game plan. Dicey Dungeons is a game which does not allow me to seeks solutions to the demands of my strategy. And, this just strikes me as true: a game which does not allow me to engineer my own strategies is a game which is not fun.\n\nAs it stands, I have no way of ensuring I receive high rolls or additional dice - and this the game's primary failure: it is simply impossible to flesh out a strategy in the current state of the game. It's very frustrating that I can look at my items and know which types synergies I'd like to add to my pool while also knowing that my chances of being offered even a single synergistic item in the future is very low. I simply cannot meaningfully craft a strategy with so few tools at my disposal. The game, whether intentionally or not, implicitly commands the player to shut-up and roll. Talk of strategy and dice economy is not to be had. Take what you're given and shove it in the slots. A player's job seems to be limited to determining the proper order in which they place their dice and nothing beyond.\n\n\n\nThe game suffers from other significant design flaws like overly-long, trivial fights, deterministic turns (turns which can be played in a single way and in which player decision has no impact), poor item balance, lack of enemy variety, heals which come primarily through leveling, etc; but, make no mistake, the central issue remains the lack of control over your itemization. \n\nThese issues combine to create a game filled with menial turns in which simply finding a use for my dice, rather than agonizing between uses for my dice, is the norm. Moments like, \"Oh, I rolled a 2. That's not ideal. Oh well. I guess I'll just shove it in the slot anyway.\" are extremely common as is having too many dice or too few. There is nothing which the player can do to curtail these frustrating inefficiencies. They are simply a byproduct the inelegant design.\n\nDiffering design approaches found in popular board games might have been better suited to the task of creating a strategically interesting dice-based roguelite. For instance, I could see the addition of different colored dice, a dice draft system, dice-forging (where you remove certain pip values from dice), coupled with a more fleshed out economic progression system adding a lot of intrigue to combat in this game.

Clever planning how to set up your character is very important. There is an enormous amount of possibilites when it comes to strategies because every character (and there are six of them) has a completely different playstyle - it's like playing a different game each time you choose another character. Furthermore there are lots of abilities that can be gained through leveling up, opening chests and buying them at stores (the thief can even steal abilities from enemies which is a lot of fun, especially since stealing one ability transformed my thief into a whole other character that is not one of the six characters eligible in the menu which I found hilarious). To add on top of the already relatively large pool of abilities: every ability can be upgraded so that its effects change.\nAs you can see there is a lot of experimenting involved in this game and because the characters special skills are adjusted to the different scenarios that can be selected after you chose a character there is a constant need for new strategies.\nThe only downsides of this game that are worth mentioning are personal ones: the art style wasn't one of my favorites and for my ears the music was awful...but that's because I have never been into this kind of music as it comes with heavy \"mood-debuffs\" for me :P Maybe there are people out there with a similar taste in music that want to consider that (then again you could always turn off the music and play you own music tracks in the background instead).

That enemy takes away any uniqueness the character has. Is that 'fun'? \n\nScenarios beyond the first usually require save-scumming to avoid having to play the scenario hundreds of times hoping for perfect roles. There's literally no counter-play to some bosses, you just have to hope they roll poorly. Some scenarios give you interesting mechanics but parallel world really shows you how limited in depth the game is when you get *all* new equipment and it feels very much the same as before. \n\nArt style is nice.

Again the rng is so screwed up but I managed to complete all 36 episodes with 24 failure in the Witch elimination stage. I finally started to see a few thing about the game. Here's a few tips for those who are still struggling:\n\n1. Return to title if you started a match with almost full hp but the fight rng is not in your favour\n2. Change your deck or go to a store or something before heading back to the fight. This reset the stage. If you head back to the fight, you will get the same dice rolls and unfavorable rng.\n3. With the reset, you can win the fight after multiple attempt but this method is really testing on your patience too.\n\nAgain, my review does not change and I do not recommend this game unless you have the patience to sit through weeks and months of not clearing a single stage. \n\nTry this game at your own risk.\n\n\n[h2] Review at 29 hours of play [/h2]\nAfter being stuck for 2 whole weeks and spending more than 15 hours trying to clear the Witch & Jester elimination stage, I will not recommend this game anymore. The stages are so unbalanced and the rng is so screwed up. The game will only bring you frustration and make you want to fling your mouse across the room.\n\nBuy this only if you have the patience of a lifetime to clear it. I am giving up on this game at 29 hours of game play.\n\n[h2] Review at 11.5 hours of play [/h2]\nChallenging enough to keep me wanting to moving forward yet some stages are so hard that I spent hours trying to clear it. Currently finished Episode 2 for all dice characters and looking forward to more. \n\nGame is definitely worth the price especially on sale.

All 6 playable characters have distinguishable play-styles that offers you a variety of experiences. Classic tropes such as Warrior, Thief, Wizard (witch) are all here, with a few different classes to shake up your expectations (the inventor, robot, and jester). Like any other rogue-like, seeds are randomly generated upon initiating a game, and you venture through the underworld fighting enemies, opening chests, encountering shops and traders, and upgrades.\n\nCombat is turn based, and your resources are your skills and your number of dice. All characters begin with just 2 dice, but as you level up, you gain additional dice. The dice are randomly drawn at turn start and you must use what Lady Luck gives you to overcome your foes. \n\nThe game ranges from easy to borderline unfair, it can depend on your runs, and of course... your dice rolls. Despite the larger emphasis on Luck in this game than in other games of its ilk, such as Slay the Spire, you can still sort of get to a consistent state of winning more than you lose. I typically win 3-4 for every loss, with the exception of using the Witch and Inventor, who I roughly have a 50-50 win streak with. \n\nIt's a highly addictive game that I recommend people to give a chance. There's little story, but the gameplay loop makes up for it, and I've had a blast with it. \n\nAnd if you run out of things to do, there are bonus levels made by the devs, as well as a modding community to add characters and items.\n\nEstimated Game Length for any%: 10-20 hours (yes it is that wide of a range)\nEstimated Game Length for 100%: 30+ hours\nScore: 8/10\nRecommended Value: $10-15\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1693500268, "timestamp_updated": 1693500268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145357669": {"recommendationid": "145357669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042086509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1695404879}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not the most dedicated player of this game, as my playtime might reflect, but it's a game that's been perfect for me to pick up and play for 30m or so every now and then.

A brief description of gameplay: puzzle-like mechanics in a turn-based dungeon crawler, technically a \"roguelike\" in that you do make individual runs through randomly generated dungeons that can have different layouts/loot each time, and then start over new when/if you die. But there's also a loose story and a lot of fun background detail that flesh it out, as well as lots of different modes to play. Overall very smooth gameplay and graphics (I played it on my Steam Deck with no issues, and it shifted very comfortably between touch screen and controller whenever I needed it to). But most importantly, fun mechanics that are challenging in a \"make you think about this in new ways\" sort of way (rather than \"artificially difficult/grindy for the sake of dragging this out\" kind of way). Two main standouts that make this game amazing, in my opinion:\n\n1. The writing. I expected this type of title to be very tropey and gimmicky which... it is? But it's very self-aware and manages to push right up against the fourth wall without breaking it entirely. Masterful use of running gags, and the best set up/payoff joke I've seen since Community's Beetlejuice stunt. More importantly, it manages to convey a whole lot - story progression, world building, character building - through small clippets of dialogue without any actual cutscenes or animations, and although there is a lot of repeated dialogue, it's mixed in well enough with unique situational/character-based dialogue that even on my last run of the game, I was still seeing new things.\n\n2. The mechanics. A lot of roguelikes or dungeon crawlers will boast \"x different classes to choose from!\" and then you end up using the same strategies or gear combination on all of them because the essential gameplay remains the same. Not so with Dicey Dungeons - you'll find yourself having to shift your strategy even on the same character, depending on the episode you choose or even sometimes in the same episode based on some randomized mechanic factors. Even more amazingly, though, the mechanics manage to be complex and varied (fresh and fun) *without* being overly complicated or unnecessarily difficult. RNG can screw you over but there's almost always a way to prevent it from doing so, if you're paying attention. \n\nIn conclusion, there's a reason I logged 100 hours in this game up to completion / at time of this review, and it's not because the game was grindy, tedious, unnecessarily difficult, or overly idle. It's one of the few games I would genuinely revisit even after completing 100%. Do give it a go - even at full price it would be a bargain but I managed to snag my copy in a Humble Bundle and it's a frequent flyer in sales and bundles so there's really no reason not to pick it up. :)", "timestamp_created": 1693424684, "timestamp_updated": 1693424684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662474095821380615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145296347": {"recommendationid": "145296347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080790944", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 968, "last_played": 1693441717}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite rogue-like!

This unique blend offers a refreshingly innovative experience where even repeated story runs yield significantly diverse outcomes.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some missions within the game can prove astonishingly challenging, occasionally bordering on soul-crushing difficulty. This sentiment comes from someone who boasts a conservative thousand hours spent within the genre. Despite this, I eagerly anticipate the potential for a sequel in the form of Dicey Dungeons 2, should the developer choose to embark on that journey.\n\nThe game's pricing strikes a harmonious balance. With the capacity to provide approximately 30-40 hours of gameplay without significant content repetition, it delivers a satisfying value proposition. Nonetheless, one area where the experience appears to fall short is in the domain of build diversity. This aspect could use some enhancement in order to align more cohesively with the essence of a deckbuilding game.\n\nOn the whole, if you have an inclination for card games or the thrill of games of chance, Dicey Dungeons promises an enjoyable venture. However, due to its formidable difficulty, the game might not serve as the most inviting introduction for newcomers to the genre.\n", "timestamp_created": 1691509512, "timestamp_updated": 1691509512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143643996": {"recommendationid": "143643996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013871293", "num_games_owned": 507, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2948, "last_played": 1691488530}, "language": "english", "review": "I rolled 31 dice at once, the wizard stood no chance.", "timestamp_created": 1691489022, "timestamp_updated": 1691541433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75462043285369873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143620931": {"recommendationid": "143620931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307977685", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1416, "last_played": 1693619286}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun and engaging roguelite!

Boss themes are a bop. \n\nArt style is charming and unique. The enemies designs are memorable and fit the aesthetic very well. Squid baby for life. The characters really have their own identities. The Witch makes my brain hurt. \n\nGameplay is heavy roguelike elements with the fun of dice manipulation. It really feels like you're rolling the dice with every decision you make. It is different enough to stand out amongst the other games I have played. \n\nOverall, this is a game i truly recommend.

There isn't a lot of diversity of enemies or cards, both of which are heavily utilized in runs.\n\n- I'm all for hard and luck-based games, but  lucky runs are few and far between and you need those in order to beat some of the harder challenges.

This is mostly due to the fact that each run does not feel that much different from each other in the grand scheme, let me explain.\n\nThe only truly random thing about this game is the dice aspect, the enemies you will encounter and the gimmick of each character. The dungeon layout, the items you find in chests and shops are mostly the same and have a rather small pool to get from.\n\nA small pool does not automatically mean its boring, it does allow you for better strategesizing in the long run, in theory.\n\nAt the start of a run, in a chest, or when you level up most characters you will get to choose in some way between multiple cards with a different status gimmick in most of the episodes. This however locks you in to only get cards from chests and shops with the same status gimmick that you chose (There are also cards without a status gimmick that can still appear just fine). There is a small chance you will find different status cards, a freeze card even if you chose fire for example, I noticed, but they are usually on the weaker side.\n\nThis creates a problem of instead choosing the card gimmick that you feel like currently using for fun, you are instead choosing to lock into the card gimmick that will help you against a specific enemy in the future.\n\nNo matter how fun poison is, since no enemy has it as its weakness and 3 very annoying enemies even have it as a resistance, choosing to have these cards in battle just makes your run harder for no reason. Fire and Ice help against two very annoying and strong potential enemies lategame and the absence of these items is very noticable. This makes runs feel very repetetive at times if you are looking to maximize your chance at winning.\n\nThis makes the game very hard. You will not be able to prepare for the strong ice enemies if you chose ice cards yourself, which will make feel losing is outside of your control especially with the dice aspect. Prepare to lose a ton without literally being able to do anything against it just because you got unlucky with enemy encounters.\n\nHowever despite these issues the game manages to feel very fresh if you do beat episodes.\n\nEvery character has a very unique gimmick that feels different from each other, and every epsiode from every character manages to keep their gameplay unique with interesting rules, it manages to give it a different take on their playstyle every single time, basically having 36 different ways to play plus 1-6 more if you count the final boss. This is why completionists will have most fun of this game, being \"forced\" to beat every episode will make the next one way more fun, and since this game is very hard you will take quite some time trying to do so.\n\nAll in all its a very fun game and worth your money, but if you are looking for replayability look somewhere else.\n", "timestamp_created": 1689157106, "timestamp_updated": 1689157106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141886958": {"recommendationid": "141886958", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966043696", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1698384089}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun turn based roguelike", "timestamp_created": 1689145140, "timestamp_updated": 1689145140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141879545": {"recommendationid": "141879545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029928832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 480, "playtime_at_review": 480, "last_played": 1700439183}, "language": "english", "review": "Deckbuildy roguelike  with cute art and pretty good writing and fun mechanics with a variety of challenges.", "timestamp_created": 1689133832, "timestamp_updated": 1689133832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141801093": {"recommendationid": "141801093", "author": {"steamid": "76561199129475843", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1696279846}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

HOWEVER, I think there are some important caveats one should know before going in.\n\nFirst off, Dicey Dungeons is NOT a roguelike. Well, not really anyway. It is more like a puzzle game in a roguelike skin. Yes, you get to choose cards and upgrades as you go, but ultimately each scenario will only have one or two \"correct\" builds. This is not a game you can replay infinitely; once you've beaten a challenge, that's pretty much it.\n\nSecond, make sure you don't mind learning new mechanics, because this game has a lot of them. I think the reason it's not a \"real\" roguelike, is the (in my opinion rather questionable) decision to make their ascension mode, rather a mode that adds more difficulty modifier as the ascension level increases, just an entirely new class for each level. This leads to a lot of breadth gameplay wise, but not a lot of depth, as making the classes fleshed out would basically mean doing that a ridiculous number of times since every difficulty level is basically its own class. \n\nThird, some of the challenges are bullshit. Like really dumb. Most of them I beat in 1 or 2 attempts, but a few of them are either really difficult, or straight up require you to get reeeeeally lucky to win.\n\nWith all that said, Dicey Dungeons is an absolute blast to play. As a cardgame and roguelike enthusiast, it offered something I've never seen: incredibly entertaining and deep battling segments. In most roguelike cardbattlers, the battles are actually the the most dull part. In a game like StS, most of the strategy comes into play in the drafting portion. If the enemy is attacking, and you have a shielding card, you play the shielding card. Obviously it goes a bit deeper than that, but the point is, generally, you don't need to put much thought into it. Dicey Dungeons on the other hand has you doing *so* much in a turn, and it always feels like if you spent crunching the numbers just a bit longer, you could've come up with an even better solution. Yeah, it's literally dice rolls, but rolling a bad number in this game never feels nearly as punishing as drawing a bad hand in other roguelikes, where a bad hand can be the difference between life and death. I certainly would have liked a true roguelike with a huge diversity of builds and whatnot, but for what it is, Dicey Dungeons is great.

Somewhere between Yahtzee and Hearthstone - but more fun than both - our plucky, cubic heroes must descend the six levels of the dungeons over and over, until the time finally comes to confront Lady Luck herself - in a cheerfully sadistic game show watched across the world.\n\nThe core gameplay is simple. In the first battle, each turn you have a number of dice; slot a die into your sword to deal the die's number of damage to your opponent. Your other ability, Combat Roll, lets you reroll a die, and can be used three times per turn. So what do you do? Use Combat Roll to reroll until you get a high value - but don't get too greedy! - and deal the most damage you can. As you progress you will find equipment with other effects, like status effects, or chopping your dice into smaller values. That equipment might have conditions, like only accepting dice lower than 4, or a matching pair of dice. You manipulate the dice you are given for the best result each turn. The game is more interested in strategy and dice puzzles than luck, so losing very rarely feels like the game's fault. That simple, solid gameplay foundation means you never feel lost, even as the game departs further and further from what you know.\n\nThe six playable classes all have wildly different gameplay, thanks to their unique equipment and abilities - the Warrior has his Combat Roll, but the Thief can use enemies' equipment, for example. There are six levels per class, lasting around 20 minutes each: level 1 is a simple class introduction; levels 2 and 3 impose a bizarre condition, and you typically win by discovering that level's gimmick equipment; level 4 is level 1 with stronger enemies. Level 5, amazingly, takes place in a parallel universe where all the equipment you are familiar with is thrown out of the window - oh, and all the status effects work differently. Level 6 is more like a typical rogue-lite; it plays like level 1 but each floor, a random new rule is imposed which generally makes the game tougher for you. Level 6 gives the game the most replay value, as it is influenced by the equipment set you choose at the start, including some \"hard mode\" equipment. The final boss is a new kind of strategising you have never had to do previously. Two DLCs of about six levels each were made; Halloween Special is a series of head-scratching puzzles and Reunion is... yet another equipment overhaul! Barring a horrible difficulty spike in Witch level 4, which I navigated by abusing the ability to quit on the game over screen, the game is exceedingly casual and you can expect to breeze through many levels first try. For more challenge, you can go for all achievements, and you'll notice a few things you can attempt just for bragging rights, like the mighty Omnislash. I've completed all main levels and am satisfied for now, but I know that the game is so easy to pick up and play that I'll have no problems coming back and relearning it when I want more.\n\nIf I haven't convinced you how much this game should appeal to casual players, simply look at the presentation. The game loads in seconds and starts almost as quickly. A minimal number of huge UI elements mean everything you need is right in your face when you need it. Bright colours and chunky sprites abound in an art style I think of as Charlie and Lola meets Dungeons and Dragons. Every animation is super-satisfying, from the way your equipment slams into the enemy's face, to the way the wizard magicks his socks off and back on again. Every piece of equipment is explained intuitively in just a few words. You go first and can even see your enemy's equipment and play around it. There's virtually no ambiguity over rules and no chance of making an input error, unless you're rushing. My only criticism is that sometimes you need a lot of dice on screen, and as more and more dice appear they obstruct your input, so how to display many dice could have been rethought. Creator Terry Cavanagh has again joined forces with the mighty Chipzel, who has provided an OST of wall-to-wall earworms bursting with vigour and attitude (even the low-health sound is a good listen). Dialogue is almost always friendly and positive, with a clearly British bent and some good laughs to be had. You might notice a somewhat small roster of enemies, but it's good to get familiar with them, their equipment can vary and the class you play changes how scary they are to play against.\n\nYou can always count on Cavanagh to produce something brilliant, and Dicey Dungeons is one of his best. Exemplary game design, great balancing for casual gaming with some room for challenge, and a vibrant personality. I strongly recommend Dicey Dungeons to anyone after a solid time-killer, especially on Steam Deck or smartphone and even more if you have headphones.", "timestamp_created": 1684694325, "timestamp_updated": 1684694325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138668374": {"recommendationid": "138668374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075194061", "num_games_owned": 481, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1693023594}, "language": "english", "review": "A pretty fun deck building style experience.

Not a joke \"haha bad review because it took my life away\". An actual bad review.\n\nIt's a fun enough game, but so much of the design choices are bafflingly obtuse and don't seem to rear their ugly heads until after you've done a few runs. Difficulty is almost entirely because battles are one sided and enemies have an absolute boatload of HP. Whereas you might be blessed to find an attack that does D+2 damage, or even x2, it almost always comes with a negative (Max 5, or deals damage to you, or requires a big investment of dice, or)\n\nThis by itself is fine. In fact, aside from the HP Sponges that enemies tend to be, it's FUN. But the problem is it relies on the \"The odds are stacked against you\" kind of difficulty, which results in either blowing through encounters, hitting a wall...or breezing through and THEN hitting a wall suddenly. Because some enemies have unfun abilities that counter everyone completely. One enemy, the Loud Bird, is designed so that it can literally ALWAYS do 2 attacks. One weakens you (negatively affects your attacks), one gives it Dodge (allows it to ignore an attack), and another silences you (you cannot use your special power...and in the case of the Wizard, you can't add new spells).

There will, however, be no spoilers. This review was made after completing the main story.\n\nPremise/Story: You play as one of 6 contestants on the titular game-show hosted by the malevolent Lady Luck, the personification of all random chance. By making it through the dungeons on the show, the contestants have a \"chance\" to earn their worldly desires, or be further stuck in the dungeons as a walking dice-person. Find a way out of the show, and if there's a way to best Lady Luck herself. \nEvery character, be it dice, minion, or evil force of rigged rolls, are brimming with personality and charm thanks to the quick & snappy game-show like banter. While it's not the most complex or profound story, it's certainly a fun story to watch unfold.\n\nGameplay: Dicey Dungeons is a mini-roguelike (runs take 20-30 minutes rather than 60+) RPG with a heavy focus on luck-based mechanics. Each contestant has 6 episodes, or levels, culminating in a finale. Each episode consists of making it down through 5 floors of enemies, and beating the boss at the end. Sounds simple, but this game will not make it easy. Each contestant has a different way of playing the game that brings a different flavor of challenge to the table (some flavors are more palatable than others), and each episode can offer a different experience as well. \n\nContestants will always start with the same equipment (unless playing episodes 5 & 6), and also have a Limit Break (Yes that's what it's called), a special ability that recharges upon taking damage. Episodes from each contestant follow this format: \n1: Standard Rules\n2 & 3: A gimmick add-on that slightly changes the gameplay\n4: The Elimination Round, where all enemies have upgraded equipment.\n5: Parallel Universe, where all status effects and equipment function differently.\n6: Bonus Round. You start with some equipment and standard rules, but each new floor adds a new rule to deal with.\nBattles with enemies are turn-based, and involve you and the opponent taking turns rolling dice and matching them to the equipment you have. The diversity of the equipment allows for a lot of different builds to form, as well as a lot of hair-pulling moments when the dice just don't roll in your favor. While this gameplay loop is satisfying for the most part, the biggest negative I have might just be a skill issue on my end: The Witch's mechanics aren't as fun as the rest of the quirky cast. Some enemies play fast and loose with their equipment, and can easily shut down the Witch's mandatory setup time, especially if you don't have their Limit Break ready. However, every other character is stupidly fun, my personal favorite being the Robot. Even if you aren't playing as the distinctly hardest character in the game, it can sometimes be really annoying to have a string of losses when it was going so well (like the bosses suddenly rolling exactly what they need to screw you over after a 20-30 minute run), but if you want to look on the bright side, it does technically play into the story.\n\nVisuals/Music: Not much to say here. The artstyle is perfectly cartoony in all aspects, serving to make characters more expressive and eye-catching. The music is done by Chipzel, and my god is it done well. The battle themes, especially for bosses, have that big-band jazzy feel that's reminiscent of certain gameshow themes like The Price is Right or Family Feud. \"Swing Me Another 6\" and \"Tempting Fate\" are especially bangers.\n\nCompletion: Achievements are mostly unlocked by either playing through the game normally, or by doing some task that only a certain contestant can maybe do in a run. By doing these achievements, you earn bios of the various minions you take on in the dungeons, fleshing out their own personalities with fun little queries like \"Karaoke Go-To\" or \"Greatest Fear\". This also happens in the Halloween Bonus Content with the new enemies that show up in there.\n\nConclusion: This game's surprisingly packed with content for the cheap price tag. I bought this when it was on sale and I definitely feel like I made out with a bargain. If you don't like luck-based games, you will despise this one. However, if you enjoy a bit of risk in your day-to-day gaming life, then buy it, and just roll with it.", "timestamp_created": 1681090594, "timestamp_updated": 1681090682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136435536": {"recommendationid": "136435536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202951084", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1681629755}, "language": "english", "review": "mucho contenido", "timestamp_created": 1681075126, "timestamp_updated": 1681075126, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427960067987442017", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136391808": {"recommendationid": "136391808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206932460", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "playtime_at_review": 482, "last_played": 1700459834}, "language": "english", "review": "all", "timestamp_created": 1681019192, "timestamp_updated": 1681019192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136330015": {"recommendationid": "136330015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067878334", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 3323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3267, "last_played": 1691465673}, "language": "english", "review": "yes very7 highly!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1680949957, "timestamp_updated": 1680949957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136325252": {"recommendationid": "136325252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049830553", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 3794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3794, "last_played": 1680942839}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una maravilla de roguelike de construcci\u00f3n de mazos.

I learnt that you could abuse the game a bit by just hitting back to menu if your in a fight and its going wrong to completely redo said fight.

I love the balancing act between choosing a strong attack vs limiting the inherent randomness of rolling dice when upgrading and choosing skills.\n\nThe pacing of Dicey Dungeons is immaculate. It starts simple and keeps adding more complexity at steady rate. Each character offers a unique puzzle to solve inherent to them. Once I felt like I figured out a character, the next episode adds a fresh new twist on the strategy I just mastered.\n\nThe greatest strength of the game is how quick and easy it is the complete a run. It manages to be fun if I need something to play for 20 to 30 minutes, or I just finished a run and want to play \"just one more\".", "timestamp_created": 1676100403, "timestamp_updated": 1676100403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132578792": {"recommendationid": "132578792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069042874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 806, "last_played": 1675994257}, "language": "english", "review": "The premise of assigning dice in battles as you work your way through an increasingly difficult dungeon was what initially drew me to this game, as I tend to like similar game mechanics and it provides a digital alternative to tabletop games.

While RNG is to be expected in a game involving dice, this particular implementation seemed to be especially punishing, in particular with stronger enemies and bosses. You can have a really great set of equipment, cruise your way through most of the dungeon, only for things to take a sharp turn near the end through no fault of your own. You can only do so much when 75% of your dice are burned because the enemy rolled exactly what they needed several turns in a row, or a bunch of your equipment is weakened via shock every turn, or all your dice are 1's because they all got frozen.

However, I find it to be a rather curious style of game that is perfect for both short and long gaming sessions, which is why this title managed to capture my attention, especially for its charming visual section which I found very attractive from the beginning.\n\nDicey Dungeons is a creative and interesting proposal in the deckbuilding roguelike genre, putting as protagonists the very mechanics of the game and depicting the characters as dice: the RNG itself, right. It\u2019s presented as a peculiar adventure where we must explore the dungeons of the Lady Fortune, challenging her in a series of games and confrontations to find an incredible prize at the end. Having several episodes and different characters to explore, I found it quite promising.\n\nThe story, as I mentioned, is given through episodes that we can unlock as we progress, defeating bosses and completing mazes. All of this unfolds in a \"TV quiz show\" fashion, with voiceovers by the antagonist and other characters such as the jester, prize wheels and so on, which I found quite entertaining and unique. Each character has their own reason for venturing into the dungeon, but the plot is still pretty much the same for everyone: get to the end and claim the reward. However, Lady Fortune will challenge and hinder us at every step we take, and said loot will seem farther and farther away; does it even exist? I can't answer that question, nor do I have much more to share regarding this section, since I haven't finished the game at the moment (after all I'm pretty bad at roguelikes), but I want to make it clear that I find it very curious and enjoyable.\n\nI found the visual section charming and very unique, featuring a very particular artstyle that reminds me of coloring books and some watercolor or crayon, cartoonish so to speak. The \"protagonists\" are designed in a very simple way, as they are dice that differ from each other by some visual characteristics, such as: the thief who wears an eye patch and dual daggers, or the robot who well, is a robot with screws and an antenna on his head. The enemies and bosses are very varied and colorful, and change depending on the area we find ourselves in, with different levels and their own specific attacks. The environments and menus go pretty much hand in hand with the rest of the art, and it's all very pleasing to the eye, in my opinion.\n\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal! I loved the various tunes I heard, and the mixes between techno, chiptune and electronic. This is definitely my favorite aspect of the game so far. It's not every day that a game of this style, turn-based or similar, becomes so exciting to me thanks to its catchy and upbeat music that keeps me much more hooked than I expected; I appreciate the dedication to this section by the developers, as it really captivated me.\n\nOn the gameplay side, it's a fairly simple roguelike to learn, but at the same time a bit difficult and that relies, in my opinion, a bit too much on the RNG aspect. Maybe it's because I'm not very good at these games, but I feel that luck is a very prominent factor in this particular title; although, the game has a \"relaxed\" mode, which I imagine makes the experience more enjoyable, but I'm playing it on normal difficulty so to speak, so yeah! Leaving aside my opinions, I will comment that the game is handled in two parts: exploration, with inventory and resource management, and combat. Exploration is presented to us on a sort of board with linked squares. In some squares you will find enemies (with which you can initiate combat by moving towards them), healing apples, stores or upgrading anvils. \n\nInventory management is based on choosing which \"weapons\" we will use in combat, since we will have a limit at our disposal, and there will be boxes in which we can place our dice to release their effects in the middle of the battle. Some of these tools require specific dice, such as one that can do up to 3 damage and can be reused, but the maximum value of the dice must be 3. Others have altered states, such as freezing the opponent's dice, reducing their level to 1, or burning them so that the opponent suffers collateral damage when using them.\n\nAs we defeat enemies we will level up, increasing the amount of dice we can use in combat, which will help us to better use the characters' abilities. Each character has their own style of play, some being better benefited by high value rolls such as 4 or 6, and some applying the opposite and managing better with amounts between 1 and 3. The Thief, for example, has reusable tools that allow him to double or split dice to make better use of his attacks, which usually do little damage but can be devastating if you manage to form a chain or sequence with them. There is enough versatility with these attacks and tools, being able to buy or obtain different versions in the stores, improving those already obtained, or by defeating enemies, thus generating some customization for each game; this gameplay loop so iconic of a roguelike is what the game bets on the most in my opinion, and I found it a pretty well thought out system, which I really liked its execution, even though the game itself is a bit hard for me in general.\n\nIn conclusion, Dicey Dungeons is a very elaborate and peculiar title, in my opinion, a very entertaining and striking proposal of the deckbuilder and roguelike genre. The very charismatic art and the amazing soundtrack are the icing on the cake, and while I mentioned that I haven't finished the game, I wanted to write a review to recommend it, as I think fans of this type of games should give it a try!\n", "timestamp_created": 1675551666, "timestamp_updated": 1675551666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595206022262573242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132188968": {"recommendationid": "132188968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001543975", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 628, "last_played": 1675877659}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little dice thrower where the dice are thrown right back.", "timestamp_created": 1675518332, "timestamp_updated": 1675518332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132178997": {"recommendationid": "132178997", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980271454", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 589, "last_played": 1679490863}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10", "timestamp_created": 1675506013, "timestamp_updated": 1675506013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132169594": {"recommendationid": "132169594", "author": {"steamid": "76561199109879096", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1694570920}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good roguelike.

Deal lots of low damage attacks, you also steal enemy equipment which creates some funny interactions.\n* The robot. This is where i really start liking the game, the robot starts bringing unique gameplay like choosing which number you want to roll, really fun.\n* The inventor. You remember how i said the robot is the most fun? Here i present you the most frustrating dice. The inventor! the only dice that punishes you for fighting enemies. Forget about having fun, you are now forced to micromanage every single fight because you lose one equipment at the end of every encounter. You will hate her too, specially on later chapters.\n* The Witch. Look, i play a lot of D&D and rollgames so i knew the wizard or any kind of caster would be one of the classes here. The witch has potential to be fun but it's the hardest of them all, not as unfun as the inventor but she will be your last dice to complete.\n* The Jester. Previously your foe in the dungeons, the jester rebels against Lady Luck and gets turned into dice. The jester is a nice breath of fresh air from the two previous dice. Hes fun, random and has the best one-turn kill potential of all dice. Really nice dude.\n\nIn conclusion. Game is fun, a bit frustrating if you go for completionist but i have played worse. I wouldn't recommend getting it at full price tho, wait for a sale or get it on Game Pass.", "timestamp_created": 1673895401, "timestamp_updated": 1673895401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130951268": {"recommendationid": "130951268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058420171", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 376, "last_played": 1673845252}, "language": "english", "review": "It's worth a few bucks but it get's boring fast.", "timestamp_created": 1673845366, "timestamp_updated": 1673845366, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130937268": {"recommendationid": "130937268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797252938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1687875536}, "language": "english", "review": "dice", "timestamp_created": 1673824094, "timestamp_updated": 1673824094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462633430957794189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130923799": {"recommendationid": "130923799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042529383", "num_games_owned": 743, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 506, "last_played": 1673820396}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fascinating how much gameplay mechanics are put in with just some simple dice rolling.

The art is interesting, the music is great and the presentation is fantastic. \nI also really like roguelites (you can see it from my profile), and the main gimmick with this game (ie, every action depends on a dice roll) interests me a lot.\n\nThe reason I cannot recommend this game is because the player has not enough agency to change the outcome of a run in this game. The choices you can make in terms of your \"deck\" in a run are pretty limited, there is no meta progression, there are no artifacts that change the shape of a run. You are basically given a set of equipment, you can find new ones or upgrade the existing ones during a run, and that's it. In each encounter you know perfectly well what you need, but you cannot alter your destiny in any way, shape or form. Sometimes you are lucky, sometimes you are unlucky, and have to restart from the beginning, wasting a good 30 minutes in the worst scenario. This can happen in other roguelites, don't get me wrong, but at least you have learned something, you can try to understand what choices were suboptimal and ultimately led to a failure, and consequently adjust in later playthroughs. Here you can just praise or hate the RNG-god, and be left with a sour aftertaste on both cases.\n\nEach character is unique, and I appreciate the innovations this game was trying for. However I really think it needs some additional system to keep the RNG in check and allow the player some ways to mitigate the consequences of a few bad rolls.\n\nPS: \"50% chanche for an equipment to do nothing this turn\" is not a particularly interesting effect, to put it mildly...", "timestamp_created": 1673266808, "timestamp_updated": 1673266808, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610993623733520508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130475332": {"recommendationid": "130475332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183714617", "num_games_owned": 714, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1580532069}, "language": "english", "review": "really fun but does get tiring at some point.

If you're a person who gets annoyed by unfair punishment and inability to optimize your play on sightread, it is also really annoying.\n\nVisuals/aesthetic are great. This uses a simple almost minimalist art style and still manages to be very cute, clean and nice to look at. It's a lovable atmosphere even if overly innocent/cartoony. Music also matches the flavor of the game perfectly.\n\nIn regards to unfair punishment... the game gives the appreciated ability to change your equipment/build between fights. Obviously you're supposed to move it around based on not just your overall build, but who your opponent is. The problem is you will have no idea what an enemy is like until you start the fight, where it immediately tells you \"enemy is weak against x\" and you can see what their attacks are. Building around your opponent would add enjoyable depth to the game. But the only way to do it is by guessing, looking up the enemies, or already having encountered them before and remembering. Why? Give the information so I can use the game's systems to their fullest, without punishing me simply for not having information you should be supplying in the first place. The only way to play optimally is be punished repeatedly for something that isn't your fault until you memorize the enemies, or look them up constantly. \n\nYou are also regularly forced to make decisions without being able to view your current deck, or check if the current battle will level you up or not. While playing one character, you even have to remember every single spell beacuse you can't see them before choosing. Mid-turn this is a unnecessary disaster. The worst one is being unable to see your current deck when making choices that rely on the rest of your deck.. this is comically stupid, no excuses. You can't even view your deck while you're buying stuff at a store. You have to exit and check a separate screen while making a plan, back and forth. But in some situations you can't check your deck in any way until making the choice.\n\nBut again, the game is pretty fun. It's just really painful to be punished for something that isn't my fault, and deal with endless situations where the game refuses to give proper information for no good reason other than lack of foresight, I guess. They give tools for overcoming adversity, while refusing to tell us what adversity we need to overcome until it's too late.

There isn\u00b4t much deckbuilding and the little deckbuilding left is broken by the aviable cards/items and a limited size of your \"deck\", which feels more like items you equip to a character. Do not buy the game if you desire a classic Deckbuilder. \n\nIn Detail:\nThe game got very boring in the first and only 45min I was willing to play. For a \"Roguelike-Deckbuilder\" the possibilites are very limited: At the beginning I already noticed, that I will need to have the healing crystal, because otherwise I would run out of Healthpoints against the otherwise massivly annoying enemies. They have too many special attacks that will deduct your HP in a form or another (burning or poison). Therefore I kept that card (healingcrystal) always equiped and upgraded it, which let me won the first run in a very uninteresting and boring way. The need for healing crystal took away a slot away, which resulted in less possible combinations. \n\nTogether with the fact, that there aren\u00b4t many slots for cards either I must say, that this game doesn\u00b4t deserve the title \"Roguelike-Deckbuilder\". The cards you equip feel more like the standard items you equip  to a RPG character just spiced up by the factor, which have a RNG based condition (diceroll) to be useable. Imagine a RPG where you can\u00b4t use your cool sword becasue RNG said: Nope. A very boring concept and I expected the game to bring therefore more slots for items/cards, but they didn\u00b4t came. Just more dices (yikes!). There are also too many card in this game with such special conditions. To be fair: You can upgrade most of them to make them use any dice, as far as I saw.

In a proper roguelike, the player can take satisfaction in their choices having meaning, even when resulting in a loss, as there's usually so much to learn and apply to the next run. This game not only lacks these properties, but in many playthroughs, it feels as if there were no meaningful decisions to be made at all. Often, going up against RNG feels like slamming your head against a brick wall--no amount of skill can circumvent running bad in this game. In fact, skill is often a non-factor in the tougher challenges. The game lacks the depth and complexity to make your decisions have weight.\n\nAs one familiarizes themselves with the shallow enemy roster it becomes obviously apparent which strategies might work, but the game rarely gives you the tools to realize them. Your run is generally left up to which random assortment of equipment you happen to get; of which you have few chances to augment. For example, you might run into many enemies weak to fire in your run, but sometimes you just don't get a piece of fire equipment. Or maybe you get a shield synergy payoff, but don't get any shield-generating equipment. Not that you should always get the perfect builds, but it just feels so all or nothing in this game.\n\nMost of my experience is with the warrior, but I have played a decent amount of the other classes.

I highly recommend it to any roguelite or card game fan, and even though I've played many roguelites, this has easily wormed its way into my top 5.\n\nA quick disclaimer though, the roguelite aspect of it in terms of replayability only kicks in for the 6th round for each character. I've seen reviews complaining about the lack of a roguelite aspect in this regard, but many of those reviews only have a few hours in the game. The 6th round is where it ties everything together and offers true replayability. \n\nThe base game is already a fantastic game with beautiful art, banger music, funny dialogue, and importantly great gameplay. \n\nYou have 6 characters to choose from, each of which having 6 different scenarios to play for said character (although some are similar like \"Elimination Round\", which adds 10% hp to each enemy and is everyone's 5th way to play). Each character naturally has several build paths to choose from, allowing for variety in the way you play each character.\n\nThere is a Parallel Universe scenario which completely flips how mechanics work, and makes most of the player's cards completely new, as if it was a DLC on its own. This allows for even more build paths for each character, and the final round combines all the cards and most of the new mechanics while adding special modifiers each floor you go to.\n\nThe game also comes with 2 Bonus Modes for free, which are essentially DLC. The first one is a Halloween mode which lets you play with 3 characters in a new way, as well as adding 3 enemies. The second one is a sort of \"Farewell\" or \"Labour of Love\" update, added 2.5 years into the game for free.\n\nThis second DLC, named Reunion? It's like Dicey Dungeons 2.0. Everything is brand new, all the enemies have new cards that still fit their theme, almost every card is something new, they've added new mechanics, and swapped up how the players are. This has no business being free for such a huge content update, reminding me of Enter The Gungeon which similarly gave huge updates for free. The developer also gave their development thoughts here, if you want to read them: \n\nhttp://distractionware.com/blog/category/dicey-dungeons/\n\nAll in all, it is a fantastic game. It has its flaws, but they are very minor (the trading station has been useless almost every single time I've seen it, and some status effects are super rare and only caused by 1 enemy, although this later one seems to be rectified with the DLC, the system can be broken in your favour with savescumming and hitting the enemies with die before they/the cards get locked out by debuffs).\n\nalso the witch is trash the elimination round brings severe pain don't do it save yourself", "timestamp_created": 1670052381, "timestamp_updated": 1670053128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127720811": {"recommendationid": "127720811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272487466", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1690039108}, "language": "english", "review": "It's very fun and easy to pick up", "timestamp_created": 1669933372, "timestamp_updated": 1669933372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127693701": {"recommendationid": "127693701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198806990369", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 602, "last_played": 1671041989}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1669900904, "timestamp_updated": 1669900904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127683327": {"recommendationid": "127683327", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998448261", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1327, "last_played": 1675856663}, "language": "english", "review": "this game claps like craps", "timestamp_created": 1669886200, "timestamp_updated": 1669886200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127673576": {"recommendationid": "127673576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072723558", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1698812966}, "language": "english", "review": "So it's slay the spire, but with dice!\nBanger music and an addictive gameplay loop that satisfies anyone's gambling tendencies.\n\nVery fun, get it!", "timestamp_created": 1669870069, "timestamp_updated": 1669870069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127652559": {"recommendationid": "127652559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022899584", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1641, "last_played": 1699543786}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome", "timestamp_created": 1669841050, "timestamp_updated": 1669841050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127633726": {"recommendationid": "127633726", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990380710", "num_games_owned": 830, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1669819680}, "language": "english", "review": "Boring", "timestamp_created": 1669819707, "timestamp_updated": 1669819707, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469086021184921265", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127613904": {"recommendationid": "127613904", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997453217", "num_games_owned": 702, "num_reviews": 176, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1669790926}, "language": "english", "review": "I have tried to purchase and enjoy this game three separate times. Terry Cavanagh is one of my favorite game designers of all time, and Super Hexagon/VVVVVV are two of my favorite games. I kept feeling like I was 'missing something', because everyone else enjoys this game so much.\n\nIt seems to me, however, that this game is not a rogue-like in any proper sense. Instead of having a generalized 'run', you pick a character, then pick an 'episode', which structures the entire playstyle of your run by restricting the character you like and have picked, making their abilities different every time thus making it impossible for you to simply jump into a run and enjoy yourself. You always have to pick a different class, a different arbitrary new ability, and there's little to no replayability once you've cleared an 'episode'. I certainly can't see any reason to play this game at all if you're looking for a 'rogue-like' anything... it makes me angry because it's advertised with procedural generation and randomized content, but all the content is restricted to 'boards' that are pre-arranged and simply shuffle the data points within. This would be like if in Dead Cells you could only pick your build before starting your run, and it was limited to one weapon, and that weapon lost the ability you enjoyed losing it for and got some new random and stupid ability every run after.

Rather than simply give enemies more hit points, trials completely change certain mechanics in use giving the game almost a puzzle-like quality rather than straight strategy.\n\nThe basic, consistent mechanic across all characters is to equip certain items that can damage, heal, shield, or apply status effects. Then, each round during combat, you roll dice and use them to activate your gear where only certain rolls can be used or certain rolls will add more effects. Since monsters will have their own gear and effects, if you have enough gear (it is a rogue, so sometimes you do and sometimes...), then you can strategize by swapping to more favourable gear to increase your odds of success.\n\nWhile some runs felt like I could do everything right and fail based on character + gear + rolls vs. specific enemies, more often than not I felt like with cunning and prep I could succeed.

A dice themed dungeon crawler? Woooo. Yeah, pass.\" That's exactly what I thought when I saw this. And that was a sin so grave, that when I got hit by a passing truck and died, I went to hell for it. It's actually not so bad - good company - but I still feel like you shouldn't make the same mistake as I did. \n\nBecause this game isn't just good. As in, yeah, it's fun to play, the characters are cute and interesting, the soundtrack is more fire than hell itself (trust me on this one)... but what's really going on here is that the [b]game design[/b] is black magic levels of intricate and tight. It's elegant, it's very deep, and it's so insanely varied that you can spend an eternity playing this and still have fun. In fact, that's what I am doing - at the time of writing I have 117 hours, and I only died like last week!\n\nAt its core, Dicey Dungeons is a deckbuilder where action points are replaced by dice. You collect items (think cards), which you can put into your \"battle deck\" to use in combat, usually by feeding them one of your dice. Every character has their own set of items - some overlap, but not many - and there's a LOT of them. I have 100% achievement completion and beat all extra content, and when I watch friends play this game I *still* sometimes see cards that I've never seen before - mind, that's not due to missing unlocks, there's no such thing in this game.\n\nStill, that wouldn't matter much if the core gameplay was bad. It's not. Yes, you have to rely on dice rolls, but there are ways to minimise your reliance on the RNG. And that's what this game really is about - constructing a deck that will keep you going in most circumstances, and then cleverly maximising the value of your dice. For example, take the Thief. His default loadout contains a Dagger; it's infinitely reusable, but it only accepts dice with 3 or lower. It's fine if you roll low, but what if you start rolling high? Well, in that case you either need some items that will split your dice into lower values, or something that will actually accept the high rolls. Which will it be? This is one of the most basic decisions you'll be making in this game. \n\nThere are multiple characters to choose from, too, each with their own special skill, a \"limit break\" ability (charged up by taking damage), and a general \"theme\" of items. Warrior is your typical high roller, roll high, bam, raw damage. The aforementioned Thief is the opposite; he wants to roll low (at least initially) and kill with a thousand tiny attacks. But then things get weird. There's the Robot, who doesn't roll all the dice but instead has a... CPU counter which increases with each roll? And it only gets weirder from there. To top it all off, things get heavily remixed in later episodes, and additional content switches things up even further. Like I said, black magic of game design.\n\nSo the game's good. Hellishly good, in fact. I've talked to Natalia, a witch from the 13th century, and she says this stuff would've totally gotten Terry Cavanagh burned at the stake back in her day. But there are a lot of good, yet overlooked games; why missing this one was enough to condemn me to eternal damnation?\n\nBecause on top of all that, the game manages to have a cast of lovable, diverse, unique, and just plain great characters - both your guys as well as the enemies. The game's dialogue is then used to tell a story - and that story is great as well! And it's all wraped in this pleasant, detailed graphical style, mixed with a strange musical concoction by Chipzel. She's always been a chiptune/electro artist, but now she threw some... SWING in? So you get a blend of chiptune, some decently hard bass and samples of saxophone, trumpet and even light vocals. And believe me when I say that the compositions themselves are TIGHT. There's one particular piece that just completely flies off the handle when it comes to (my understanding of) music theory; it's absolutely glorious.\n\nOkay, look, Satan just came and told me that this review is proof enough of my repentance, so they're sending me back. I almost told him \"no thanks\", but then I remembered that this game exists in the mortal realm too, so I guess I'll keep on playing games and writing reviews for a few more decades, hopefully. And you should probably check out this game. It's pretty neat, I'd say.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988/]Curator Page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1667580078, "timestamp_updated": 1667580078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609747827053070068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124930890": {"recommendationid": "124930890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064633079", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1492, "last_played": 1667564397}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun dice builder with lots of scenarios.\nThe soundtrack is 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1667564508, "timestamp_updated": 1667564508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124884613": {"recommendationid": "124884613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051961563", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1667348000}, "language": "english", "review": "Way too linear.", "timestamp_created": 1667487898, "timestamp_updated": 1667487898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124866696": {"recommendationid": "124866696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263399896", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 912, "last_played": 1671604607}, "language": "english", "review": "Dwi ddim wedi chwarae'r g\u00eam i'w chwblhau eto - mae llawer mwy yma - ond mae hi'n llawer o hwyl. \nDych chi chwarae fel un o 6 cystadleuwyd, wel, dis.

But then, this game was always at the back of my mind due to its charming nature and when there was sales a second time, I bought it again xD\n\nThereafter, I read up on strategies and got used to the mechanism. When our special power is charged, we should use them at the appropriate time and not as and when it is available (as it requires hp deduction to charge) . Even eating apples is a strategy; we should not be eating apples blindly and only eat when needed / health is almost half or less.\n\nOnce I understood these concepts, I was able to clear stages after stages. However; a lot of luck and strategy is still needed to clear later stages.\n\nAs of writing, I did clear the 36 normal episodes and defeated Lady Luck.

Whilst it lacks the depth of some other roguelikes both in gameplay mechanics ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/]Slay the Spire[/url], for example) and narrative ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/]Hades[/url], for example), it somewhat makes up for this with it's simplicity and ease-of-access for those new to the genre. \n\nMain pros:\n\n- Gameplay is simple and will be easily understood even for those brand new to the genre. There's an optional easy mode and the ability to straight up skip progression making it even more accessible to newbies / young players. \n- Decent amount of content available with free DLC being added\n\nMain cons:\n\n- Progression system lacks flexibility (why can't I keep playing one character at the start, mastering them before moving onto somebody else?)\n- Characters and dialogue are generally uninteresting\n- Music is hit and miss. Some music is great whilst some is a bit grating\n- Artstyle is alright, but the childlike aesthetic isn't my thing\n\nFor those new to the roguelike genre, this game may be ideal for you. It's simple yet complex enough to be interesting.

That's the crazy new ideas I expected the game to be full of.\nBut even if you play a trick character like the Inventor, Witch or Robot, it is still hard to escape it turning into just being the basic Warrior feel of, have high power attacking gear and some form of rolls manipulation/dice duplication, and just destroy.\nThe Witch's update levels turning into preset puzzle levels particularly stings, yes the levels are very fun, but no, it still leaves the whole set of Witch mechanics with plenty of untapped potential unexplored.\n\nI wouldn't say this game is even that hard for a roguelike, and the most deaths you'll likely going to have will end up being either Elimination Round or Hard Mode Bonus Round.\nWith the enemy equipment being upgraded and them having more HP, it is way too RNG based and it will boil down a lot to \"Well, I made the perfect play for this turn, I just have to hope enemy doesn't roll cartoonishly high and take out 60% of my HP in one turn\" in those modes.\n\nIt's not quite the Extreme difficulty campaigns in 100% Orange Juice where the enemies have literal rigged dice rolls, but those levels get frustrating where you lose to pure RNG, and that's not even the item drop RNG giving you a weak build.\n\nTL:DR Yes, it is a good indie roguelike card battler(yes, I'll stick to calling it a card battler), it has just enough interesting twists to not be an outright rehash of the done to death genre, but it features too much of a scattershot approach to not go anywhere with any of the more original mechanics, so it doesn't redefine, subvert or create anew any genre.\nIt also lacks a fair bit of that mindblowing \"whoa what is this, I've never seen stuff like this\" past Terry Cavanagh games had (pursuing a done to death genre certainly did not help).", "timestamp_created": 1663278888, "timestamp_updated": 1663278888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

[b]More on that (usually) later.[/b]\n\n[h1]Layout[/h1]\nThe game is divided into episodes. Each character has 6 episodes in the base game, 1 episode in the free Reunion DLC, and three of the characters has 1 episode in the free Halloween Special, making for a grand total of 45 episodes. Thanks to the random elements, the episodes have good replayability however, and I'll definitely see myself replaying some of my favourites in the future.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[h3]Overworld[/h3]\nFor each episode you're tasked with making it through a dungeon and defeating a boss at the end. A dungeon normally consists of 5 normal floors and 1 boss floor. The goal on each floor is to reach the hatch leading down to the next floor. In your way are enemies which you need to defeat in battle in order to get past.\n\nYou get experience from defeating enemies, and after getting enough you go up a level.\nBecause of this, even if some enemies are not blocking you from reaching the hatch, you might go and fight them anyway. You need to defeat every single enemy in order to be max level at the boss. This is not a necessity, but (usually) a good idea. [b]More on that (usually) later.[/b]\n\nYou also gain coins from battles which you can use to buy new equipment from shops you find throughout the dungeon. You also encounter chests which contain random new equipment, and anvils which you can use to upgrade a piece of equipment to a more powerful version, amongst some other surprises.\n\n[h3]Battles[/h3]\nEnemies are fought one on one.\nYour turn begins with rolling the number of dice your character has. You then put those dice on your equipment cards to play them. Some equipment need even or odd numbers to be played, some can only use a maximum of 4, a minimum of 3, etc.\n\nAfter you've done everything you want, you give the turn over to the enemy, which then proceeds with the same procedure using their equipment and dice. This goes on until either you or the enemy is dead.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nEach of the characters enter the game show Dicey Dungeons hosted by Lady Luck, the personification of luck and fate, in order to win their heart's desire. If they survive a trip through the dungeons they get to spin a wheel and get a chance at winning their prize!\n\nThings start to become more and more suspicious as you keep playing though. How can the wheel keep landing on the one slice that's a dud? What's with the weird comments from Lady Luck that you'll make a fine minion? I think you see where this is going.\n\nI particularily like how all the enemies you fight are actually previous contestants that gave up on winning and resigned to their fate, and most of them have a bio in the bestiary where you can read what their reason for entering the dungeon was.\n\nAnd yes, I like the underdog stories. Challenging Lady Luck to a game of dice? There's just no way you can win, right?\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nThis game's soundtrack is composed by Chipzel, who has made some bangin' remixes of the Crypt of the Necrodancer soundtrack before this.\n\nThe soundtrack is for the most part a fusion of jazz and chiptune, and really good.\nSome battle music samples: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGL5m0qWzWA]Fighting Chance[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0EwPLS1Gec]Tempting Fate[/url], and a personal favourite, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKUAqS7mFrI]Step Right Up[/url].\nThe Reunion DLC's battle themes are all bangers as well.\n\n[h1]Luck[/h1]\nWith the story setting and deck buildery and random generation dungeonry, a question that always pops up is \"how much luck is too much luck?\"\n\n[url=https://twitter.com/terrycavanagh/status/1183808542484127749]This game is fair[/url]: the rolls for you and the enemy are completely random with the exception of the final boss (I think you can guess who and why).\n\nBut people are not good with probabilities in general. Most also tend to forget the times luck was in their favour. Bad luck is more easily remembered since they can cost you your run on floor 4 or 5, which is far enough into a run to make you say \"Dungeon Crawler? More like Dungeon Crawling in My Skin.\"\n\nThe game allows you to mitigate the luck element for yourself through some dice manipulation equipment however. There's for example Lockpick, which splits a die into two dice, and Spatula, which flips the die upside down, turning a 1 into a 6 for example. Careful use of these equipments can (usually) turn a bad situation into a good one. [b]More on that (usually) later.[/b]\n\nStill, in the words of a certain starfleet captain:\n\"It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose.\"\n\nYou'll have to ask yourself if you can deal with the fact that you'll lose some runs to bad luck.\n\n[h1](usually)[/h1]\nOne of the characters' episodes (Witch's Elimination Round), is brutal and more luck-dependent than most episodes. In the Elimination Rounds, enemies have inflated health and UPGRADED equipment. The Witch has a certain gimmick that needs some setup in order to pay off, but enemies tend to oblitirate you before you can finish if they get have luck on their side. She can also be crippled early on by bad dice rolls. Runs can and will end on floor 1 sometimes.\n\nI think this episode needs more powerful equipment, or more chests early on in order to smooth out the giant spike in difficulty.

All this adds together to make a great game for feeling like you're having fun, but they don't add up to make a great game for feeling like winning is Truly Accomplishing Something.\n\nCute: everything is kind of banal and pleasant, such that you do not get stressed out by tough battles. I find some of the aesthetic to be a bit eye-rolling / my soul is generally dead to some of the cuteness attempts. But it's never particularly objectionable to me, and sometimes I actually am charmed by the cuteness, so on balance, this is a cute and not annoying game.\n\nSufficiently interesting: Good variety in the characters (which give you subsets of the main item deck) and in the makeup of the items, decent variety in the enemies, rougelite format and wide variety of starting modifications to the character/deck/rules means that there will always be something for your brain to engage with...\n\nUncomplicated: ...But not *too* much variety. I scrolled through the reviews to find a few critical ones before starting this review, and the most fair criticism I saw was that the potential for synergy is low. This is absolutely true compared to more complicated deckbuilding games like Slay the Spire or Monster Train. When you want to hyperfocus on an epic deckbuilding game, don't start this one. When you want to chill out, see how a run goes, this is a great game. You will not reach the peaks of thrill granted by combo-whombo-stacks-on-stacks with this game, but it's pretty easy to do pretty good. If you are sometimes or always in the mood for this, for sure buy this game. If you want to engage with a super intellectually stimulating deckbuilding game, maybe try another one.\n\nAnother pleasant benefit of the more-chill, less-hyperfocussy [i](...lol get dat hyperfocussy.......)[/i] nature of the game is that it's way more easy and tempting to pick the game up after a long time of not playing it. While I absolutely love other classic and more intellectual deckbuilding games, I find that I tend to, in certain seasons of life, get totally deep into them, play them often and for long sessions, then eventually lose interest and put them down. (My experience with them is the kind of thing gamers describe as \"addicting\".) Later on, if I remember one of those games fondly, I might try to fire it up again, but realize that I'm not in practice for them anymore and getting into the grove again is hard. (Any deeply skill-based games and hobbies are usually like this for me, not just deckbuilders.) Dicey Dungeons is simple and snackable, so if you like it, expect high replay value.\n\nEnthusiastic recommendation from me!

There is also a Halloween alternate versions of three of the characters and recently (as of July 2022) they released 6 more variants with drastically different mechanics, this time also mixing up the play styles and abilities of all the enemies at the same time.\nOverall, a hilarious and fun game that is great to come back to again and again.", "timestamp_created": 1658249295, "timestamp_updated": 1658249295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119064250": {"recommendationid": "119064250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062886593", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1658257288}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800 I BELIVE IN\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800        \u2800\n\u2800\u2880\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800            \n\u2800\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c7\u2800\u2800                \n\u2880\u28ff\u2803\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28bf\u2844\u2800\n\u2800\u2819\u2837\u28ee\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2818\u28ff\u2840\u2800\u2800   ALEA SUPREMACY\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u28b8\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u28b0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u28b0\u28bf\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2818\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\u2808\u2802\u2800\u2800\u28f4\u28f6\u28f6\u28c0\u2880\u28e0\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28c0\u28c0\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u284f\u2808\u28bb\u28ff\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u283f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28e6\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u2847\u2800\u2818\u28ff\u28c7\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2809\u2809\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2838\u28ff\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2839\u28ff\u2846\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u287f\u2808\u2800\u2808\u2809\u28b9\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b9\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28f7\u2844\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28a0\u28e4\u28fe\u28ff\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28f6\u28f7\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2838\u28f7\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2838\u2839\u28f7\u2864\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2809\u28b9\u28ff\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28c4\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u283b\u2807\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2820\u28a4\u283e\u280f\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800", "timestamp_created": 1658224092, "timestamp_updated": 1658224092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119052316": {"recommendationid": "119052316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141183366", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1672698363}, "language": "english", "review": "A really fun game with a surprising amount of variation to keep things fresh despite a fairly simple rule set.

What makes it so much fun is the turn based moment to moment combat, It's all mainly about managing your health and turns. The core gameplay is going through a randomly generated set of levels which consist of enemies shops and some special events. Entering combat is what the bulk of the content is, you face off from a large selection of enemies with all varied ways of attacking in combat. They all feel quite balanced and well designed. Where the roguelike elements come into the game is the weapon loadouts, you can customise your weapon kit by finding new attacks or buying them from the shops. The big feature in this game is the dice, each turn you use your dice to play your attacks this could be rolling a six onto an attack and also using other dice to play other moves in your loadout. This gameplay is very fun and addictive because of its random nature. On the other hand this game has been criticised for its randomised gameplay design. As for this i'd certainly say if you don't like RNG or random gameplay elements i would outright not play this game however if you can accept this randomness, this game is very enjoyable. Out of the actual game/missions you have a selection of characters to choose from. All having unique starting loadouts and interesting gameplay features to keep your runs interesting. The other core part of the out of game content is the \u201cepisodes\u201d each character has a total of 6 episodes to play which progress the overall story and unlock new gameplay modifiers. Other gameplay features include achievements and other small nice additions. \n\nThe art in the game is solid, I feel this game's visuals speak for themself, it's all extremely well crafted, it looks very charming and it's always great seeing new locations and character designs. The soundtrack for this game is very unique and awesome, it has a line up of all kinds of great songs, nothing really genre focused but they all fit the cartoony and lighthearted tone. As for bugs there were none, I have nothing to say on that front, it played extremely well the whole time and had not a single issue. The performance is also not an issue here; the game was just brought to IOS and Android devices. It requires literally any specs within the last 10 years to play this game, it runs very well. \n\nIn conclusion this game is a solid roguelike which helped define the genre in many ways, the game also has recently added a whole new update called \u201creunion\u201d with a new set of episodes which further adds to its value. The game has a solid amount of content and unique gameplay and I fully recommend it if you like deck builders, roguelikes or turn-based games.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1658145766, "timestamp_updated": 1658145766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618937671184539795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118997797": {"recommendationid": "118997797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094021929", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1658128935}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very cute!\n\nThe player takes the role of an adventurous game die, rolling its way through a kooky dungeon filled with pun-based monsters and collecting various \"equipment\" that can be used to defeat said monsters.

It's a sort of turn-based puzzle deck builder-lite where the strategy elements mostly flow around manipulations of/workarounds to luck (dice rolls, mainly). The majority of runs will also have you managing a small deck of ability cards but there's no sort of meta progression and your decks and available card pool change entirely from challenge to challenge.\n\nThe game itself is structured and linear, there's no perpetual mode or procedural generation - it's absolutely more of a puzzle game than anything resembling a roguelike although failing in a run will reset your progress in that challenge to the beginning. There is no global progression aside from clearing each of the 6 challenges for each of the handful of characters. Challenges typically consist of a run through the dungeon of 5 stages + a boss stage. The character you choose loosely determines their playstyle, with the various challenges all adding a twist to their gimmick to work through.\n\nIf I had to give it demerits, it's really just that you're going to feel like most of the challenges end right when they're just getting going. There's no perpetual mode, no meta progression and a great many of the \"builds\" the game has you work through really only begin to piece together on floor 5 of a given \"run\" and right after that it's over. This is a puzzle game, not something you will perpetually return to. Once you're done with it, it's going on the shelf until DLC comes out. This isn't a bad thing, just don't expect something different. That said, it's still good fun and has its fair share of surprises in store for you so if it sounds at all appealing to you, give it a try.\n\nThat all said, Dicey Dungeons the OST is immaculate. This game has probably the best soundtrack of any game I've played in years, a  top 10 all time for me for sure. Chipzel's work here blending the sort of big band jazzy music you hear in game show intros with thumping, driving, dancing chiptune beats and melodies is just nothing short of genius. And if you weren't certain whether or not it was genius or accident they did it again in the recent DLC update, absolute home run of a soundtrack, just outstanding work.

This game also keep on giving with the free DLCs such as the Halloween and the most recent Reunion update.\n\nThe art style is simple yet charming. The UI is very clean. The voice act is amazing and the music is such a jam I couldn't get it out from my head even if I try. The story also keep the same simplicity and it's very appealing in its way.\n\nEach character in this game have its own gimmick with some is actually trickier to figure out on how to use. Each character have several episodes and each episodes also serves with its own spin that each can be replayed separatedly. Every single time you think you got this game or character figured out, each new episode will always bring out a fresh new spin and you'll have to relearn and restrategize again. The challenge is keep on giving. Sometimes the game can be very luck-based. But the devs obviously knew this that they allow the option to quit and reopening the game at any point.\n\nThe game is very small in size and it's packaged with full of fun.\nHighly recommended for everyone looking for a good strategy roguelike game or into it in general. For those who aren't exactly into this genre this game might hit a bit too hard especially with some characters and episodes, but you can still get a lot of fun even when you're replaying one same episode.\n\nProps to the devs. Very good game and thank you so much for delivering this amazing game to us.

In any case, this game is also eminently moddable, and there's a pretty big library of mods on itch.io for expanding beyond the base experience.\n\nDefinitely recommend playing through casually--I don't know whether this runs on Steam Deck, but if it does it's a perfect candidate for a \"whenever you have a few moments\" game.

Your gear interacts with simple d6s in a variety of ways from the obvious of the higher roll is better, to the lower roll is better, to very interesting minimum and maxium, even and odd, or spliting, flipping, and changing dice. With a variety of status effects. \n\nThe game-play is far to simple for my taste, but that being said it is clean, polished, has plenty of content, and provides challenge.\n\nEnemies have arbitrary immunities and elemental weaknesses and strengths, which generally I find to be one of the worst ways of designing encounters, but that being said you get a collection of gear that you can freely swap out as you need, so as long as you plan ahead the system is actually just fine.\n\nThe story is kind of weird and silly and definitely not to my taste, but that is not a bad thing they pull off exactly what they are trying to do. \n\nThere are very few decisions to make as you can fully explore each dungeon and usually buy everything you want.

Dicey Dungeon came to my attention and I thought it looked quite fun and it can be. This game amazed me with how much variety there is. \n\nEach character plays entirely differently from the others. On top of that, there are different rule sets you can apply to each run that drastically change the way things are played for each character. It took me nearly forty hours just to run through each scenario once, which is a staggering amount of content for variety in runs in a rogue like. \n\nThat being said, I would say that this game isn't for everyone because it isn't always for me. One of the big issues I have with this game is the same I had with Slay the Spire, the frustrating lack of consistency during deck building. Going back to the top of this review, I am a huge fan of magic the gathering, I get that runs in rogue likes are meant to live and die by RNG but that doesn't always mesh well with what makes a card game fun. \n\nCard games have RNG as well but that comes during the games, not during deck construction. While the extent that Dicey Dungeons feels exactly like a card game has some variety depending on the character and you know for sure, with most characters, what cards you'll have in your hand each turn the fact that you can't always get a load out you enjoy makes some runs a real slough. I found myself having to often pick between what would win and what I would find fun. \n\nStill, over all, I greatly enjoyed my time with Dicey Dungeon and I wouldn't actually change anything about it. I can recognise that being able to design the exact load out/deck I want each run would trivialise any challenge that the game can offer since you could just build the best deck. But I felt it was worth noting what might keep others from enjoying this game on top of what was absolutely amazing about it which is everything else. Heck, I didn't even touch on the story or characters both of which were full of life and humour that added just enough to add to experience without becoming overbearing from what, at the end of the day, is a satisfying core game-play loop that balances strategy and chance exceptionally well.", "timestamp_created": 1656374734, "timestamp_updated": 1656374734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117748221": {"recommendationid": "117748221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067467176", "num_games_owned": 633, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 425, "last_played": 1659063655}, "language": "english", "review": "80% yes", "timestamp_created": 1656362395, "timestamp_updated": 1656362395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117734501": {"recommendationid": "117734501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028103514", "num_games_owned": 3251, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1660580691}, "language": "english", "review": "I love how every this game approaches different playthroughs, each of them introducing something subtly modified to make it feel completely fresh every time.", "timestamp_created": 1656348122, "timestamp_updated": 1656353365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117726045": {"recommendationid": "117726045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982783577", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1656345552}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego \"family-friendly\" en el que tienes que ir matando \"enemies\" a base de tirar dados.\n\n Se necesita mucha SUERTE para GANAR.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1656339151, "timestamp_updated": 1656339151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117719465": {"recommendationid": "117719465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044129597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1656565989}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Not recommend\"\n\nNope for me.\nFrom Love to hate...\n\"Not recommend\"\nOnly recommend buy it on sale.\n-Not balance game play\n-So-so art style(too plain)\n-Not truly RNG\n\npros : RNG element\ncons : Fake RNG (Yours & enemy's)\n\nI delete the game for uncomfortable game play experience.\nXxxk..

This game is amazing if you've ever dabbled in dice based board games. You play the role of an adventurer trying to get through a dungeon. Warrior, Thief, and Witch are all present plus a few unusual inclusions. The goal is to go through a semi-random dungeon while gaining levels, getting equipment, and then toppling a boss. It sounds simple enough but the thing that really sets this game apart is the sheer amount of instantly readable dice mechanics. Nearly everything in the game revolves around six sided die. Not just your equipment but the enemy's as well. To go along with this, every character also has six versions of the dungeon to go through. They can be minor differences at first but some go so hard in the other direction that it feels like you're playing an entirely different character against completely different enemies all confined to a single chapter. Strange side rules get tacked on to up the challenge culminating in a steady climb in difficulty.\n\n Some characters are easier to understand than others but I wouldn't necessarily use the game's metrics to measure it. I personally had a very difficult time wrapping my head around the Inventor's mentality while the Witch, most commonly referred to as the most confusing, felt challenging but easy enough to understand. Now, if you don't like RNG in games, you'd be surprised at how enjoyable this one can be. I think the RPG mechanics of picking equipment that suits your own ideas of randomness help curb the effect. You could have crazy builds where you'll be devastating on 6's or have builds that allow you to forge a specific thing to happen nearly every turn. A standard run isn't too lengthy either with a endlessly replayable soundtrack to rise in intensity and catchiness the further you delve. \n\nDespite all my praise, I'll say it did take me a lengthy chunk of time to beat this game. I was very opposed to using any sort of exploit or guide to win and one character in particular felt exceedingly difficult to play if you were missing a specific piece of equipment.

No minutia was overlooked, which you'll truly respect in the final run.\nAll that can only go so far however, and this game is elevated to stardom by its tight and varied gameplay.  You'll play with only two \"standard\" characters before being thrown into runs with those who fundamentally change the rules of the game, and three who will require a completely different strategic perspective from the prior half of the roster.  Fellow players of Magic: the Gathering I think will appreciate the secret final character, who [spoiler]rewards cantripping dice and multiplicity of equipment[/spoiler].  I'd say my preference is, from highest to lowest: [spoiler]Jester...Robot...Witch......Fighter...Inventor......Thief[/spoiler].  Truly highlighting the game's dedication to variety are the entirely different ways to play relegated to a single game mode.\nI cannot recommend this game enough.  My only complaint is that the second and fourth characters can be less fun than the others.  The fourth forces you to take a different approach than the others, which is appreciated but can wear thin at times, while the second character's second mission can be punishingly difficult.

All equipment can be upgraded, either increasing damage, removing dice restrictions, changing a 1x4 equipment into a 1x2 equipment (allowing you to wield more items), or a combination of the above.\n\nHealth is restored through three methods: in-combat, through items; out of combat, by collecting apples in the dungeon or by buying apples that appear in shops; and by leveling up, which gives a full heal. Managing your health is by far the most intricate part of the game, deciding when you'll need to grab an extra apple before a fight, and when it's best to tough it out to save it for later.\n\nThe game features charming graphics and music, going for a lighter dungeon crawling experience.\n\nMy only notable complaint about the game is that the dungeons are arranged so that there are exactly enough monsters so that you can only max out your level if you kill everything. Because the bonuses of leveling up (extra dice and/or equipment, plus the full heal) are so great, you're pretty much obligated to kill everything, even if the monster doesn't block your progress, or you'd rather leave a more difficult enemy alone.\n\nOverall - well worth picking up.", "timestamp_created": 1653602240, "timestamp_updated": 1653602240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561286330223083496", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116029187": {"recommendationid": "116029187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071259746", "num_games_owned": 1336, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 642, "last_played": 1663342014}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good.

I enjoy these types of games, but a major recurring theme for their design is that the RNG can be mitigated through good decisions made throughout the run. It is possible that this game has that, and I am just missing it, but after 12 hours, I am not sure that is the case. It is disappointing because the game is very very close to being exactly what I desire from this whole \"roguelike deckbuilding\" thing that has blown up in the last few years. The elements are all there, but they're not quite to scale, and the randomness tends to ruin the parts that are really good. The maps are small, and there is little variety to the level design (though the art throughout the entire game is pretty damn great). Often, the floor consists of a few battles and a store (which only offers you 3 items to buy).\n\nThe game is structured through \"episodes\", which are increasingly difficult runs with different challenge modifiers added to the run. This was quite enjoyable as I was forced to change how I played in order to consistently win. This stayed true until the third episode (I had this problem with all characters around this episode). The difficulty ramp-up was so stark that it outran the ability to outplay the RNG. The game does not offer much choice variety in what equipment you receive throughout your run, and that makes it particularly difficult to mitigate bad rolls. You get just a few of those, and you've gone from full health to one quarter, in just a single battle. There were many times where I would die to the very first enemy on the second floor, and there was no way to stop it. In a particularly bad instance, I died to the second enemy on the first floor. Up until that battle, there was only one available chest, and it would always have one of two possible pieces of equipment (many times I died on the second floor after only reaching one chest too). Neither of those equipment pieces do anything to help actually win the battle. In this particular instance, I would almost always get one that gave you an extra gold piece at the end of battle. \n\nThere were no decisions being made by me that would affect whether or not I died, and that was a problem for me. More generally, there are only a few variables that you can even change up in regards to pathing and equipment choice. When there were options, and I would die, I would pick the other option on the next try, only to die again due to the RNG of both of our dice, as well as both of our debuffs. When you feel that your agency as a player has been taken away, you tend to not enjoy the experience at all. And I can't recommend an experience that makes me feel like I'm at the whims of randomness.\n\nI would so love to be wrong, so if you are actually really good at the game, please comment and let me know what I'm missing.

Beat more characters, get more dice, and it'll only get more and more rewarding from that baseline. Equipment builds made are on the fly, which totally captures the feeling of dice-building games.\nCons\n=As a dice game, totally rng based in a literal level.

It may not be for everyone as it's inherently less complex and strategic than, say, Slay the Spire, but it has many selling points none the less. The main one is the incredible level of polish. You have a total of six playable characters (5 have to be unlocked) that each play very differently. And each character has six episodes to beat. (seven if you include the hard version of the sixth). And again these different episodes each introduce something that dramatically changes the game. Some of the six episodes are similar to episodes for other characters (like the one that cranks up the difficulty by giving your foes improved equipment) but others are tailor-made for that particular character.\n\nAll this makes for a game that is highly replayable (and you'll need to beat at least five episodes per character if you want to reach the true ending anyway) while rarely being frustrating (if you're struggling against a particular episode, chances are you have at least a couple of others unlocked that you can try instead.).\n\nSome people have complained that the dice make the game too random. This is only partly true. Once you \"get\" the game, you can almost always manage your equipment to mitigate your own luck of the dice. But it's true that occasionally, in the most difficult episodes, a monster may roll a particularly lucky set of dice that will leave you little chance to get out of the battle alive. But each run is short enough that the frustration is kept in check.\n\nYou won't be surprised then that I highly recommend Dicey Dungeons.", "timestamp_created": 1650266215, "timestamp_updated": 1650266215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662977993488311768", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114031111": {"recommendationid": "114031111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284349036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 3746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3597, "last_played": 1657227168}, "language": "english", "review": "The characters are charming, I never get tired of the music (composed by chipzel) and it's fun to figure out the best ways to beat your opponents. \n\nThe RNG though can get frustrating and as the game very heavily relies on it, some situations will be great and others are not... all mostly based on luck.

Choose a character, an episode, then make your way through the dungeon to the boss fight and win. Each character has it's own way of wanting to play, equipment and rules for episodes in a semi-rng way. But whether you have fun or not really depends on, if you enjoy the play style of the characters. Time flies when you're having fun, but you'll feel like in a time vacuum when it's a character you don't. \n\nNow why I can't really recommend the game to everyone, is that 4 out of 6 episodes have the exact same rules set for every character. So there isn't as much variety as it looks like on the surface. But that's not all. Equipment for the large part is also the same within an episode. So if you fail and retry, you'll probably get the exact same equipment at the same/similar point within the dungeon. Which means the main difference maker outside of your decision making, then it's the RNG of the dice rolls. Having a run that's going well? One big RNG swing in one fight can ruin an entire run and that'll be 20 mins down the drain. \n\nOkay, let's quickly more onto what's good. The art style is nice, the music is absolutely great, when you enjoy a character you'll feel like you have flown through it's content and when the game is on sale it's usually quite cheap. If you subscribe to the 1 dollar/pound/euro etc = 1 hour of game length, then you are certainly gonna get more than your money's worth. \n\nIn the end, I would say Dicey Dungeons is a fine game and whether you should buy it or not depends how okay are you with RNG of the dice and that you'll probably won't like the play style of each character.

Rolling dice to use certain cards from your deck is a genius idea and I absolutely love it. What I hated, however, were some very specific parts that just made me hate 20% of my experience.\n\nEach of the six characters have unique mechanics and six \"chapters\" to complete (+6 Hard mode chapters), totaling 42 runs you have to complete to beat the main game. There are also plenty of achievements you can go for, which unlock some trivia for each enemy you encounter in the dungeon. Reading through the monsters' info gives life and meaning to what would otherwise seem like random enemies that mostly don't fit in a dungeon scenario. The art style is probably my favorite part of the game. Each character can seem cutesy and threatening at the same time, and they all make for memorable encounters. Each enemy is so unique that they each have their own move set, trading off balancing and consistency for a really varied experience from run to run.\n\nNow, here comes my biggest problem with the game. It can be unfair at times, killing a 20-30 minute run due to poor RNG. At least this was my experience with it. Certain characters just don't have the consistency necessary to form win streaks, but I guess that isn't a huge deal. The main problem lies in chapter 4 of every character. In it, with any of the characters, enemies get all their equipment upgraded and 10% extra health. That's cool and all until you get to some absolutely insane fights (ie. Sneezy and Cowboy Cat) that are sometimes outright impossible to win. I wish Chapter 4 got a revision where fights were harder and that didn't mean every equipment was simply upgraded.\n\nApart from Chapter 4 I also hated the Witch. That's probably because I'm just bad when playing with her, but also due to the completely different gameplay style. When playing as the Witch, you must to prepare spells before using them instead of just having your hand available each turn, making fights way slower and consequently turning damage mitigation way tougher than with any other character. Half of my playtime (not kidding) is probably just Witch gameplay, which includes hours and hours of failure and resentment.\n\nWith all of that said, this game isn't bad at all. It's hell trying to go for all the achievements and having to deal with insane odds, but the rest of the game (about 80% of content, 50-60% of playtime) is mostly pure joy. Having to decide on the fly what to do with the dice you rolled is really really fun. The constant feeling of winning and losing gambles makes for an exciting and unique experience that I have only experienced with this game. You can always play Poker, but it doesn't have nearly as much personality as this game. I simply love most characters and can easily see myself coming back to do some random runs in the future. For now, however, I'm pretty much done with this game and I can say it was worth playing.\n\nOh, and the soundtrack is amazing by the way.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\nSoundtrack: 9.5/10\nRecommend?

The art style and music is fun enough to have on without getting annoying, while also maintaining a playful atmosphere if you listen to something else while you play. \n\nSome specific points I like:\n[list]\n[*] The enemies keep their same movesets between characters, meaning you only have to figure out the new quirk for each episode\n[*] Each character (and all their episodes) have multiple loadouts that are completely viable, there's never just one method\n[*] The parallel universe episodes are such a blast that it genuinely feels like 6 alternative full versions of the game! an already amazing game!\n[*] I adore the enemies and their personalities, for the first several hours it's very fun to meet them, and I love the family type atmosphere they have together, it feels like we're all friends trapped in hell for eternity\n[*] The random layouts for each floor have enough variety that you can build the same setup 6 times in a row without feeling like you're playing the exact same way 6 times in a row\n[/list]\n\nTL;DR [b]BUY IT[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1646416717, "timestamp_updated": 1646416717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111526213": {"recommendationid": "111526213", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974982853", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1085, "last_played": 1686667562}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple, yet engaging.

Whilst Dicey Dungeons has relatively minimalist presentation like his previous releases, the gameplay is much more complex. It adapts the template of the roguelike deckbuilding genre, which already involves random elements relating to enemies and equipment, and adding an additional layer of RNG on top with dice rolling, creating a game which could be appropriately described as RNGception. However, while luck may not always be in your favour, the game gives you lots of opportunities to turn the tide.\n\nThe goal of each episode/level is to get to the bottom floor of a dungeon and defeat the boss within, whilst building up equipment and dealing with a random selection of enemies along the way. You start by playing as the Warrior, one of six playable characters, who\u2019s first equipment is a sword which deals damage according to the number on the dice used, and you have the option to re-roll your dice up to three times per turn. Defeating an enemy will grant you with exp and coins, the former which awards you with extra dice to use per turn whilst healing you to full health, and the latter allows you to buy extra equipment from the shops randomly placed within each run. On paper, this will sound very simple, but there are so many variables which keeps this game fresh and challenging even when replaying the same levels 40 hours in, and this review will serve to illustrate the substantial variety on offer.\n\nStaring with equipment, some pieces simply benefit from having the highest roll to deal the most damage, but in many cases, this will be detrimental. Some equipment only works with even or odd rolls, some require dice totalling a specific number to be inputted before activation, and so on. One basic synergy involves equipment which is guaranteed to re-roll either an odd or even dice, and then selecting damaging equipment which only works with such rolls. There are also equipment pieces which deal status effect damage that are crucial to help win the most difficult fights. For example, using equipment that induces freeze will change the highest roll of your opponents turn to a one which will significantly slow down the damage output of most enemies.\n\nHowever, freeze damage is not always advisable, as there are specific enemies which will benefit from having frozen dice. The snowman has equipment which deals freeze damage with an odd numbered dice, and so using such equipment on them is guaranteed to backfire. Fire damage would be better here, as this will burn some dice which require a health cost so they can be used that turn, and such enemies will take double damage from this source. To name just one of the remaining effects, \u2018weaken\u2019 makes all affected equipment less powerful for one turn, either temporarily removing certain effects, or changing the dice requirements to be more constricted. Furthermore, each status has an alternate version which results in the effects of these statuses changing; freeze damage will instead decrease all dice in your hand by one value per infliction, and burnt dice will disable any equipment it is used on for the next turn. \n\nFor an even more substantial gameplay change, look no further than the remaining five characters on offer, each of which drastically change how you play the game. For example, the thief starts with equipment which only works with low value dice, so one effective setup would involve using equipment which splits up high value dice, alongside equipment which can be activated by multiple dice per turn. My personal favourite character is the robot which completely changes how you receive dice, requiring you to earn it from a slot machine which will shut down your equipment for the turn if a value limit is surpassed. This is supported best with equipment that decreases the increase rate of that value limit, alongside equipment which deals more damage the more dice you roll that turn. However, if you hit the value limit on the dot, you\u2019ll receive an additional ability for that turn, and there are many supporting pieces of equipment which improve your chances of using it. This is the character which I think most effectively demonstrates this game's greatest achievement, in that its entire concept is centred around multiple layers of randomness, yet has plentiful equipment synergies which allow you to turn even the most unhelpful dice rolls into a good amount of damage per turn. \n\nThe final area which adds variety comes from the per-episode modifiers. You\u2019ll only have one episode per character where the rules remain standard, giving you an opportunity to learn how they work. After that, you\u2019ll have to deal with additional challenges which will really test your ability to create the best out of a bad situation. Each character has six episodes, two of which are specific to that character, for example setting your dice rolls so that you will always roll a 6, then a 5 and so on, or giving you really powerful items whilst dealing with the handicap that all equipment used can fail at random. It\u2019s best to think of these episodes as puzzles, as you will need to create a build that deals with the limitations set by the modifiers. While there is a bit less freedom in terms of effective builds here, they are definitely worthwhile experiences for the first run-through. Each character\u2019s final episode involves receiving four random modifiers per run per floor of the dungeon, which can range from somewhat beneficial to your current build, to absolutely devastating changes that will require you to change up your approach mid-run. There are also episodes solely dedicated to alternate status modifiers, and it is possible that a modifier will show up in the final episode that will switch the statuses to this version.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much more to the game aside from the core episode progression, but that\u2019s definitely not a negative considering its small scope. There is a basic narrative that directs you to complete each episode, and is worth experiencing to its conclusion as there is an excellent final boss sequence which made all the time spent worth it. Completing it on my first attempt was incredibly satisfying, though it did take me 30 hours to get there as you have to complete the final levels for each character. Your mileage will vary depending on your skill, some luck, and how much you decide to essentially save scum the experience. It is possible to exit out of a battle that isn\u2019t going your way, and reload to see if you can get luckier the next time around. I admit I got a bit frustrated near completion of the game; in my first 15 or so hours, I would simply restart the episode from the beginning as opposed to save scumming due to the solid gameplay loop. However, some of my final hours were spent reloading and eventually conceding to what were essential brick walls with some enemies, not having just the right conditions that would allow me to survive.\n\nDespite this later frustration, I can confidently say that Dicey Dungeons is one of the most enjoyable completion experiences I\u2019ve had with an indie game in a long while. I barely grew tired of it even when it felt like the game hated me, and I got more than my money\u2019s worth getting this at a 75% discount. I would definitely recommend this even at full price if you\u2019re open to a unique experience, but only if you are willing to face its requirements and adapt to the RNGception on display here.

It's a surprisingly fun, challenging, and strategic turn-based adventure.  You can expect slightly more variance/rng than the typical game, but that's to be expected anytime dice mechanics are added in.  \n\nWhat's Good:\n-The skill ceiling is quite high, which is great.  Deciding which cards to purchase, which cards to upgrade, when to play cards, and where to use your cards are all extremely important decisions.  Even though the dice plays a role in the game, the choices you make is far more important over the course of many runs.\n-There are 6 different unlockable characters, and each one has a very unique playstyle that really mixes up the game.  This was a brilliant choice b/c every character changes the fabric of the game so much, making it really exciting to unlock a new character.  I unlocked the first 5 characters and found the Inventor to be my favorite character by far.\n-There is so much charm and love in this game!  The story is simple, but adorable and hilarious.  The dev clearly has a good sense of humor, and created a world filled w/ funny characters, interesting philosophical dilemmas, and bright visuals.  \n-The deckbuilding elements of this game are solid.  Every starting dice has a different set of cards and there are a good amount of cards to purchase throughout your run.  The cards give a lot of freedom to different playstyles such as higher dps builds, more defensive builds, or more status effect heavy builds.  You will instantly have full access to all of your cards, as there are no cards to unlock.\n-This is a great game for both casuals and deckbuilder fanatics.  The Warrior is the starting dice and is by far the simplest to learn and become competent.  Mastering this character lays the foundation for future characters.  The Witch is the fifth character and is by far the most complex dice to use.  I'm really looking forward to future runs w/ the witch.\n\nCould Use Some Changes:\n-As to be expected, any time a dice is involved, there will inevitably be some variance or rng.  It's really frustrating when a boss needs to roll a specific number and somehow he rolls that several times in a row.  Of course, we as people tend to overlook when the dice favors us, and only focus on when the dice favors someone else.  Nonetheless, this is still worth mentioning. \n-The lack of meta progression is probably my biggest disappointment.  Unlocking the first 5 dice is really easy and will be done in 3-4 hrs.  As far as I'm aware, the Jester is the last unlockable thing in the game (There is also a secret unlockable Bear dice).  Meta progression is an extremely valuable tool to help motivate players to come back for more, so I would have loved to see more ways to unlock new cards, blueprints, or dice.\n-Dicey Dungeons lacks the depth of the very best of this genre.  I can't imagine that many players will want to play this for hundreds of hrs, where as that is extremely common in top tier deckbuilders.  I'd say this is slightly more casual experience than the typical game in this genre.\n\nConsensus:\n-Solid Game (Tier 3 and makes up 35% of my reviews).  I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this game, b/c I'm not a big fan of dice games.  At least I thought I wasn't.  I guess I am now, but this was a really fun experience.  The silly and fun loving atmosphere was the perfect tone for a game like this.  I will definitely be coming back sometime soon to master a few of the other dice and hopefully unlock the Jester.  If you are itching for a creative and original take on the deckbuilder genre, then Dicey Dungeon may just be for you.", "timestamp_created": 1645378507, "timestamp_updated": 1645380167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110626597": {"recommendationid": "110626597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042093798", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 720, "last_played": 1673831319}, "language": "english", "review": "F*** THE WITCH.

Each character has its own set of deck elements, or equipment, that the player can create countless strategies from.  Enemies also have equipment, however the same enemies always have the same equipment. This makes the encounters more predictable and manageable as the players learns the strategies of each enemy, and how to  survive each encounter. \n\nAlthough the enemies and their decks never change, the episodes never get stale because each episode unlocks more difficult episodes that change a  variety of rules, at times even changing the rules of how enemies may act or effect the player. Some characters are certainly more fun to play than others, though no two characters feel the same to play as. Each character has its own set of episodes and rules/equipment regarding those episodes, but their mechanics never change very drastically. \n\nThe presentation is easy on the eyes and well-animated, all the dialogue is clever and endearing and the music is catchy as all heck. The only time the game disappointed me was when there wasn't a reward for finishing all the challenges; every loss and win felt deserved - even if luck played a major role.

It has very distinct character of its own though, like a mash up of dice-placement + tableau building + roguelike.\n\nA 'run' is much shorter than many similar games, perhaps taking 30 minutes total to reach the end-boss. Each run consists of 6 levels populated by combat encounters, health potions, equipment / upgrade shops and free equipment / upgrade nodes. There are no 'surprises', meaning that all the encounter types can be clearly seen and taken in a planned order.\n\nGame is very puzzle-ley, but in a very open-ended way. Rather than there being a single 'solution' to any one encounter, level or the entire run, there are probably many. \n\n[b] What is awesome?  [/b]\n\nWhilst the core gameplay is consistent, each of the six different characters (dice) play very, very differently, providing very different learning and challenge to enjoy.\n\nFor each of the six characters, there are then six run challenges / varieties, making for 36 total 'runs' to reach the true / end boss. Given strong variety this provides fantastic value for money, assuming you enjoy!\n\nThe big difference between characters and challenge types means that completing all 36 episodes, which took me about 50 hours, never really gets old.\n\nNo spoilers . . . the true end final boss provides a very clever, wonderfully designed combat encounter that rewards you for knowing the different enemy types and making clever, considered choices about how to play. If most combats are complexity 2-3 out of 5, the final fight is something more like a 4, and very satisfying.\n\n[b] Caveats of note  [/b]\n\nLike many similar games, the early parts of each run are very similar to one another, and you begin with a very limited set of options to choose between, which means sometimes you will just be 'administrating' rather than making choices. However, this is limited to the initial levels and given the very quick pacing, did not negatively impact my enjoyment.\n\nSeveral enemies have particular weaknesses, for example to fire, frost, electricity, but it is very rare that you can do anything much to exploit this, since the number of opportunities to add / change equipment is limited. \n\nUnlike some similar games, the type of boss you will face at the end of the run is not known until you reach it, which means you cannot choose to build for it via your equipment and upgrade selections throughout the run, and you may sometimes therefore arrive with a set of very poor abilities for the fight\n\nA consequence of the very different characters and variations is that you may bump up against a combination that feels frustrating / over-difficult. A funky thing is that the combination that does this for you may be one that other people breeze through first pass.

The core gameplay involves building up decks of equipment to use in simple dungeons. On top of that core is vibrant art, funky music and short but clever writing.\nYou've probably heard of this game, it was popular when it came out a few years ago. I'm just here to sing its virtues, given that it recently took 40 hours from my life.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nWhile the gameplay focuses on building a deck of equipment which use dice to attack enemies, that core gameplay varies wildly depending on the character you play, and the scenario you play within.\nFor instance, the Warrior and Thief characters are pretty simple, they generally involve rolling and rerolling dice to hit desired numbers so that you can deal damage to your enemies using your equipment. The Thief has the added mechanic of stealing enemy equipment.\nBut the Inventor, on the other hand, is constantly compulsively destroying her own equipment to make gadgets (which perform a function without the roll of a dice), and the Witch uses dice rolls to both allocate spells to one of four spell slots, and to cast those spells (you have to balance between the two). Most people agree that the Witch is the most difficult to play.\nScenarios can range from changing your character's special ability, to imposing unique constraints on your dice, your health or your equipment. \nEach of the six characters has six scenarios to choose from, and, all told, you have to finish 30 scenarios in order to face the final boss. This is a little too long - the game doesn't really benefit from requiring so much gameplay, and unless you play the more difficult characters the challenge of each run is pretty straightforward. At the same time it was a challenge I committed myself to, and I can't deny that playing a run or two per day was fun.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe general plot for the game is that our main characters have made a deal with Lady Luck (a satan-like figure, in this game) to enter her dungeons for a chance to win a supernatural boon, such as the ability to go without sleep.\nThe story does not get much more complicated than that, and mostly lives in the background. There are occasional cutscenes with dialogue between your character and Lady Luck, and each enemy has a short bio unlocked by completing achievements. That said, in my opinion the writing was excellent, for being in the background. It added a good amount of flavor and basically never fell flat.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe game is defined and saturated with very cute illustrations and animation done by Marlowe Dobbe. All the playable characters and enemies ooze personality with a glance. I could stare at them all day.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2729032633\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe soundtrack by Chipzel slaps. The funky bass was stuck in my head for a week. \nhttps://youtu.be/eKUAqS7mFrI\n\nThe music does get a little stale, considering the overlong playtime, as there are only a few of songs for combat. Occasionally I would lower the music volume and put on another Chipzel album to supplement it. Ultimately this was more due to the game being too long than anything to do with the music itself.\n\n[h1]Technical Performance & Other[/h1]\nI would sometimes have issues with selecting the wrong action when using my controller - it was a little too sensitive. My expectation is that there will be some mix ups if you play with a controller. They were annoying enough that I made sure to use a mouse on the final fight to avoid slip ups.\n\nSince being released, many glitches and inconsistencies in the game have been fixed. yet there still is the occasional mismatch between expectation and reality, such as [spoiler]not being able to undo the choice to switch to another fighter in the final fight, so if you press the button by accident, tough luck. [/spoiler]\n\nFinally, I just want to mention that developing content for the game isn't completely over. There is a mod community for new items and scenarios, and the dev(s) have also announced that there's more dicey dungeons content to come.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nLike a Rubix cube, this game does a lot with mechanics that are simple on their face. The game's other elements, like a funky chiptune soundtrack, and cute punky illustrations,\ncome together to finish the puzzle. If you're willing to sink a lot of time into it (or you're willing to put it down without finishing it), this game shouldn't disappoint.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/]Follow our curator page,[b] OCG-Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1643242581, "timestamp_updated": 1643346536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639333367347717285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108834258": {"recommendationid": "108834258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060647121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 4941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3761, "last_played": 1670533128}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple little game with cute graphics, surprisingly replayable.

It works fine on MacOS, but for some reason Windows can't handle it at times. This is mostly remedied by the nice autosave available, but it can be very demoralizing when your game crashes as your trying to strategize where to place your dice. This is the only game that does this on my Windows computer, so I'm not sure what the problem is. I've talked to the dev, and he said it's a graphics card issue, so uninstalling and reinstalling drivers might help if you run into this issue. However it did not help me.\n\nIf you like roguelite games with some clever rng and a very intuitive ui, this is the game for you. But you may run into some problems with the game crashing on Windows (to be fair: other friends who have played this have had no issues whatsover. Maybe I'm just unlucky).

Personally I've been finding myself playing more indie games as of late due to many AAA games being criminally overpriced, filled with micro transactions, and usually end up unfinished at launch date. \n\nDicey Dungeons are none of these things as you might guess. This game takes the form of dungeon crawler rougelike in which you choose certain cards and delve deeper. Although I haven't played Slay the Spire, many people regard it in a similar light for what I've seen. It's a pretty straightforward game, you basically build as you go along and most levels are relatively short. You have up to six characters available and they each have their own unique ability; each character also has a staggering six stories available which each increase in difficulty as you pillage and plunder. \n\nBut as for my favorite thing about the game, I would definitely have to say is its presentation. It makes use of extremely fun art concept and binds together an addictive soundtrack with it. All the characters are pretty eccentric and has a good splash of humor mixed in. Pairing these elements together, you might even lose track of how long you've been playing once you get in the groove. Really though I think all of these elements just make a really enjoyable experience. For its price point, I would definitely recommend picking it up and giving it a go.

Each dungeon is 6 floors, with harder enemies appearing on later floors, until you reach the 6th, where one of a handful of randomized bosses can appear. The enemies can appear on each floor are random, but third floor enemies generally won't be seen outside of the third floor, with some exceptions.\n\nThe classes of each dice was also really interesting to learn. Each die has a unique \"class\", like warrior or thief, and as a result of their class, they can result in wildly different playstyles on account of the unique mechanics each class has. As someone who has now collected every achievement in this game, the witch related achievements tended to be the hardest to do, since the witch can struggle with late game damage per turn compared to other classes. That being said, every single achievement is 100% within the realm of possibility for anyone to get, its just a matter of understanding which builds work best for certain classes. For instance, the thief is probably the only class with a viable poison build, as I've been able to stack over 50 poison damage on an enemy with the thief. Understanding how to build your dice as well as what changes you need to make to your builds as episodes change the mechanics are both incredibly important if you want to get through the dungeons. On top of all of that, the music in this game is a bop, so if for no other reason, I'd recommend you get it to listen to some tasty jams.

If you die, you have to start that episode over. You have the chance to pick up new abilities, change them out and upgrade them several times throughout each episode. Sometimes you're lucky, sometimes you're not, but you're usually able to find a way to make it work.\nYou don't lose hours if you fail an episode, you lose minutes, maybe 15-20 minutes max if you took your time and you died on the boss.\nThere are 6 different characters that increase in difficulty, and 6 episodes per character that also increase in difficulty.\n\nOver-all the game is quite easy, but it does get more difficult as you advance to more episodes. When you advance to more episodes each run has different rules, basically modifiers for that run that makes it more difficult. Some are gimmicky and others are quite difficult, but it's obviously made to be beaten somehow, you have to get lucky sometimes but you also have to figure out how to beat an episode with certain modifiers, it's not always straight forward RNG, you also have to be smart with what equipment and upgrades you make.\nIf you play an episode with a modifier that reduces your health when you level up instead of increasing it, you have to think about what types of equipment you want to use and upgrade, obviously going full out damage on this episode wont work. Maybe the right mix of damage and healing/shielding and abilities that shock and lock dice of the enemy will tough.\nSo there is strategy involved in terms of basically figuring out what to do, it's not just straight-up RNG.\n\nI would recommend this on sale. I wasn't a die-hard fan of it but I certainly enjoyed it when I was in the mood. My criticisms would be that it is, once you kinda [i]get it[/i], easy and boring in the long run. Nothing new really ever happens, the modifiers for each episode aren't enough to make it feel as fun over the entire period of the game for me.\n\nBut everything taken into account I recommend it on a sale for people who enjoy these games.\nSomething I'm also keeping in mind is that it is a low budget indie game, and for a low budget indie game it is quite impressive. Quite simply I find that it gets easy and boring over the long run, but for what it is, it isn't flat out bad.\n\n[h1]Curator page[/h1]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/29162366/]my Curator page[/url].[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1641239654, "timestamp_updated": 1641285239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551386654376983643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107239731": {"recommendationid": "107239731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297534536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3350, "last_played": 1696958760}, "language": "english", "review": "This game can be tough, especially later on, and the random elements might not be for everyone, but goddamn is it fun to explore and discover everything it has to offer.", "timestamp_created": 1641233676, "timestamp_updated": 1641233676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107230823": {"recommendationid": "107230823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035408865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 547, "last_played": 1641225544}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game to pick up on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1641225604, "timestamp_updated": 1641225604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107229728": {"recommendationid": "107229728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965119575", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 505, "last_played": 1691761237}, "language": "english", "review": "its a fun game but for some weird reason it doesnt save my progress so i have to do everything  again and again", "timestamp_created": 1641224643, "timestamp_updated": 1641224643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107199139": {"recommendationid": "107199139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070629154", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3438, "last_played": 1647396386}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprising amount of depth to the strategy and game play options.

With shorter playthroughs, a simple core ruleset, and strategies that easier to create and maintain... its not for hardcore fans of the genre but the dabblers.\n\nUnlike most of the genre, this isn't a deck building game but tableau builder. You get up to six action cards that are activated by using specific dice values/combinations. These actions are available every turn so there is no deck-thinning mechanics and leads to a more \"consistent\" experience. Each turn, you roll your dice and activate as many of your abilities as you can to defeat the enemy.\n\nThere's a good combination of a abilities that can either deal damage, apply status effects, and modify the dice. It's not overwhelming or particularly deep, but just enough to feel that you have some control. There are even cards that are effective for both high and low rolls allowing for some interesting builds. \n\nObviously, as with any game with dice it is in part luck-based. You can mitigate the risks and boost your chances with good combos and support abilities but the dice can still screw you. But at 15-20 minutes per run it's not all that painful to restart.\n\nThe depth of the game comes from different characters that just the core rules. The Robot is a push-your-luck dice mechanic, the inventor constantly destroys your cards to create powerful \"gadgets\", the witch builds the tableau in-game etc. \n\nThe only thing that really bothered me was the progression of the main game. In order to unlock the second episode for the warrior I needed to play the game as 5 different heroes rather than letting me use the character I'd mastered. I'd just started the game and it wasn't fun to have to play as a 5 star difficulty expert character in order to continue learning the rules.\n\nOnce you get the episodes unlocked, it's at least an interesting enough experience. Each one has slightly modified rulesets that will change the way you play or at least which strategies are effective. While I don't think I'll care enough to beat them all... it's likely to entertain me for a while.\n\nOverall, I do highly recommend Dicey Dungeons to casual fans of the genre.

I thought the first time I beat episode 1 that I'd get to take all my gear and such with me to episode 2 and continue the fun, but no, it's back to square 1 if you want to continue forward. I understand it's a roguelike but come on, resetting every 5 floors no matter what is lame as hell and makes it feel like there's no building at all. The only run variety comes in the different characters.\n\nLater episodes add 'challenge' by just... being mean to you. Nothing interesting mechanically, or anything you can cleverly play around. Episode 2 just slaps you with a 50% chance any given item won't work. That's it. F-- you for even playing, buddy. Oh, you set up really well and haven an intelligent play? Guess it'd be a shame if it just failed for a coin toss. Sure, it's a game about dice and luck, but that still feels cheap as hell. Episode 3 has you *lose* health when you level up.

It's actually quite shocking how many notable titles have been released in the subgenre in such a short period of time: Inscryption, Roguebook, Monster Train, Griftlands, One Step from Eden, the list goes on. Clearly there is interest in this design space, and Dicey Dungeons does a lot of things to set itself apart, though ultimately it falls well short of being a game I can recommend to practically any type of gamer:\n\n-Incredibly easy. Other than the Witch (more on her later), I was damn near perfect with every other character on my first go. This was while I was still reading the cards and learning game mechanics ... eventually I just blazed through the game with my brain turned off. Not a good feeling. I even started listening to podcasts while playing because it was so unengaging. I had a turn here or there that was interesting to its credit (usually with the Jester or Witch), but they're too far and few between. Oh and there's a level up system where you fully heal every few fights. Plus healing items are everywhere. So.... yeah you have a lot of leeway. Obviously this game was intended to be an easier, more approachable experience compared to the more hardcore variants in the subgenre, so maybe mileage might vary depending on your card game skill, but I expect anyone who has played Slay the Spire at all will be bored by the lack of challenge.\n\n-Nearly no player choice. I guess there is technically pathing/nodes but not really; you never really have to deliberate about which way to go. Most turns don't have much agency; you just play the dice that were rolled. There's always only one enemy so you don't have to choose which one to target. Deckbuilding isn't generally presented as a multiple choice between cards, but rather take it or leave it, so you don't really have to do much thinking there either. Oh and most characters have an inventory system so if you mistakenly take a card, you can just unequip it from your deck .. making it even less punishing. Eeeeverything is streamlined, to the point that there's just nothing left. The whole fun of this subgenre is feeling like you control your own destiny, but the truth is in Dicey Dungeons, you just sort of take what the game gives you.\n\n-Bland enemy design. Most enemies just deal damage or set a few status effects. That's it. You don't have to build your deck in certain ways to prepare for certain enemies; they all function the same.\n\n-The individual character classes are unique and interesting but the basic strategy is the same. Just pick efficient cards and burn the enemy down. I found some cute combos but there aren't many deliberate synergies per se. A lot of cards are just deal X + one status effect. Not very compelling. Card balance is entirely out of whack; some cards are insultingly bad, and others are insane.\n\n-The above factors culminate to a startling lack of depth. Which is a crippling problem in a roguelike, because they're naturally very repetitive. I muscled through for completions sake, but truth be told I think I got what I wanted out of the game in like ... 5-6 hours? But then there's another 25-30 if you want to complete everything and face the final boss (which I did). Most of this time you'll be bored, doing the same things. Every run feels the same, even between characters. These games are only fun with depth, but there's just not much here.\n\n-I mentioned the Witch before, and I still can't decide if I love or hate her. She's the only one which had any challenge, but still lacked the agency to make her fun. Her core design is quite frustrating; she's insanely slow compared to the rest of the characters. While the other 5 easily deal 10-15 damage on turn 1 even early in their runs, the Witch can struggle to hit double digits at any point at all. Whereas the other characters spend 1 dice for most actions, the Witch has to spend 2 or more to do anything. And then her level ups make her choose between getting extra dice (which she really needs) and other upgrades (which she also really needs). Again, it's not that she's hard; the whole game is easy -- but moreso that she sticks out like a sore thumb. I think less experienced card gamers would struggle with her clunky mechanics, and experienced card gamers would be frustrated by her deficiencies without much agency to work around them.\n\n-While the game has some charm, and is certainly cute, there are notable problems in the presentation department too. There are numerous UI elements missing so you often have incomplete information. Shops don't show you what the upgrade to a card is. You can't see if you'll level up after the fight from within a battle. You can't view the map while in battle. Lots of frustrating stuff like that. Also weird minor things like the volume lowers when you open up the options menu, but that's where you set your audio levels?? So when you go out of the options menu, it's now louder than you heard it while you were messing with your volume slider? Stuff like that makes me lose faith in the game's attention to detail and quality assurance; this is the easy stuff. Doesn't help that the game re-uses the same few audio clips and music tracks ad nauseum. I had to mute it and play my own music; something I never do. The writing is whatever too; there are a few cute lines, but for the most part it's very hokey and repetitive. Whatever. The art isn't bad at least, but certainly not exceptional.\n\nI had a few cool moments with this game. There were a few standout moments. And hey, the final boss sequence was actually very cool. But most of it was a chore. A couple hours of intrigue doesn't forgive 30 hours of plodding boredom. Sad; I hope their next game is better.

Otherwise, give it a shot.\n\nI don't think this game is worth its price - i got it at 66% off and I feel like that's a much fairer (or close to it) price. It just didn't satisfy me, I didn't feel like I developed any synergies or could even develop much in the way of deckbuilding. In my run I upgraded a couple cards but it didn't seem I could gain anything for them when I found better unupgraded cards, so it just felt like a waste. The trader only offered to trade one card, which felt a bit restrictive.\n\nThis is a good well-developed game, but it just doesn't fulfil what i like about rogue-like/lite games; developing a build for those great synergies rather than just try and try again until you beat the boss without much variation in your build from previous runs. There are no fail-safes in dicey dungeons that I am aware of for cases where you end up in a terrible position with your luck, making it feel pretty unforgiving.\n\nThere were also a couple minor bugs I found, although they weren't game-breaking at all, just confusing. If you hold onto your dice at the end of a battle, they stay visible on-screen until right after where you get your battle loot; this bug was accidental and I was confused as to what was happening for a moment. For the other bug, when you are in your backpack and switch between two items really quickly multiple times, they end up sharing the same spot, however this is only visual and fixes itself when you leave your backpack; this bug was half on purpose, as I just randomly decided to switch between my items really fast because ADHD lol.\n\nTL;DR/Conclusion: Dicey dungeons is a good and well-developed game, however it just doesn't give me the right roguelike/lite fix I like; the deckbuilding element is minimal in terms of developing synergies and thus your separate runs will be fairly similar, and a lack of fail-safes makes getting into an unlucky situation very unforgiving. The bugs I experienced were very minor and purely visual, and not enough to change my opinion of the game much. I give Dicey Dungeons a [b]6.5/10[/b].

Each floor is fairly simple, as are most enemies.  There is NO meta-progression which is a usual hallmark of roguelites.  Every run is self-contained, with the only account progression being unlocking new characters, and unlocking additional episodes for the characters which change the core rules for the run in some way.\n[/list]\n\nThis game is amazing.  The characters are WILDLY unique, and play completely differently from each other.  The different unique abilities and cards of each character are awesome to learn and get used to.\n\nThe difficulty progression as you unlock the characters is very smooth.  Figuring out how to play each character is an absolute blast.\n\nThe strategy is not as deep as the current kings of deckbuilders, Slay the Spire and Monster Train.  Don't expect to sink 500+ hours into this game.  There is no equivalent of Ascension/Covenant difficulty in this game, once you beat every episode for every character the game will probably have extremely low replayability.  But this is fine, I'm ~20 hours in and I've only just unlocked the last character and beaten each character at least once.  I suspect completing all episodes for all characters and trying for 100% achievements will take 80 - 100 hours, maybe more.\n\nHaving said that, there is still a good deal of strategy to this game, especially for some of the more difficult characters.  Building your loadout to be versatile enough to make use of all types of rolls is crucial to winning.\n\nThe soundtrack is really good for this game, the battle theme hypes you up, and if you like the soundtrack to Terry Cavanaugh's other games like Super Hexagon, then the themes will feel very familiar\n\nIf you like deckbuilder games, this is 100% worth it for full price, but if you can get it on sale then it would be criminal to pass this one up.", "timestamp_created": 1638290391, "timestamp_updated": 1638290621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104817116": {"recommendationid": "104817116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362165406", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1667402744}, "language": "english", "review": "I snagged this game while it was on Steam sale and a friend reccomended it to me... five hours in and I'm hooked, the battles have great pacing,it's colourful, fun and just the right level of challenging for a grey November day.

Discovering powerful synergies is always hugely satisfying - and it's just as fun to blow away a boss as it is to scrape through by the skin of your teeth.\n\nThe 'game show' theme is whimsical and unique, just like the wide variety of cute characters/personalities you'll find waiting in the depths. What I really appreciate about [i]Dicey Dungeons[/i], though, is that it isn't afraid to shake up the formula. The Warrior and the Thief, for example, have playstyles that focus on different aspects of dice manipulation - but later characters run wild with their unique gimmicks and concepts, making the game feel completely different. The variation between chapters is also fantastic, with most offering new twists and caveats that force you to approach battles in different ways.\n\nAs a side note - if a fight isn't going your way, you can always try this:\n- Exit to the title screen\n- Reload your game\n- Check your equipment (otherwise, you'll roll the same dice on the first turn)\n- Try again!\n\nSome may see this as cheating, but I enjoyed treating [i]Dungeons[/i] as more of a puzzle game than a strict roguelike... and without phenomenal luck, you'll be hard-pressed to get through some of the later chapters. Health management also plays a huge role: apples are a finite resource, so try to use them as little as possible (remember, you restore all health upon level-up). One spare apple on the map can often make or break a run.\n\nAll in all, I'd heavily recommend this game to anyone who's interested.

This game for me just feels good, it's simplistic, has a feel good story and art style. I'm gonna spoil a lot in this review, but I'm not perfect at explaining certain characters fluently, so don't read my descriptions as a major guide.\n\nThis game has no real meta progression besides unlocking characters but unlocking characters is just an element of the story, this roguelike strangely also has no relic system like 99% of other roguelikes or roguelites too, there is an episode (6) which essentially does a relic system. I can see after reading negative steam reviews why people don't like the lack of relics, which seemingly leads to having no 'true' synergies or gameplay style changes.\n\nThis game is full on deckbuilding, you have cards (equipment), 6 spaces/slots to fit cards in. With two character's episode 1 there doesn't seem to be much 'skill' involved.  Speaking of characters, based on episode 1.\n\nWarrior: You can reroll dice. Hit stuff with sword and sometimes gain a shield. Easy\n\nThief: You randomly take one your opponents equipment for a turn which you can use. Hit shit, with 1-3 rolls, manipulate dice or perhaps poison things to death. Easy but with some finesse \n\nRobot: Has a cpu mechanic which goes up with each time you 'roll' a dice, which you can then use those rolled dice into equipment e.g.\nRoll a 5, cpu counter is 5/9. If you rolled a 4 on top you would gain a jackpot, Jackpot is a choice between 3 abilities. If the cpu meter goes over its number 10/9 for example everything errors out (unless mentioned otherwise) and you cannot use your remaining equipment for that turn. Very calculated character, easy-medium\n\nInventor: Has an inventing mechanic, after each fight you are presented with up to 3 randomly chosen pieces of equipment that you have equipped (won't be chosen if it's in your backpack) after choosing one your equipment to be essentially scrapped you gain a gadget for the next turn (effect being based on what you sacrificed) that you get to use once per turn for the next combat. IF you know how her mechanic works its medium, otherwise hard\n\nWitch: You have spell slots, a cauldron & spells you have out, your equipment are put into spell slots, 1-6. If you put a 6 into your 'cauldron' if you have an equipment assigned to 6, you can choose to put down that equipment to use. Before a fight you can choose what equipment you preemptively have out already (since spells which you have put out don't stay out for the next combat). This character is easily the most complex and at times annoying as fuck to play with but winning feels good as this is the most skilled you get on a per-turn basis. Literally the hardest challenge in this game is beating episode 6 on hard mode with witch, not many have done so (according to achievements stats)\n\n[spoiler]Jester: You have an actual deck of cards, at anytime you have 3 cards to use, as you use or discard them (for the turn) you get more from your deck until you cannot use any cards (dice don't fit, or for other reasons) or until you run out of cards in your deck for that turn, you have the ability to discard duplicates. This character's LIMIT BREAK ability makes it the most satisfying, fun and skilled to play (in terms of building a deck) Easy - medium (if you can't build a good deck[/spoiler]\n\nAlso every character has a limit break which can change from episode to episode. But generally each limit break is powerful and matches that characters playstyle in that episode.\n\nIf you ever feel like enjoying the game from a new perspective play some of the mods, some of the mods add a lot of content and have added plenty of hours for me so far. \n\nI love this game, this review is objectively kinda shit as it's not really telling you the pros or cons but I don't care, it's just a small description of my experience with the game, everything I've mentioned is about like 3-6 hours of the game. There's still 5 more episodes (6 if you count episode 6 hardmode as a new one) for 6 characters, for a total of 30 episodes. (35 if you include hardmode). There's even a big boss battle which nicely completes the story.\n\nDo I recommend this? Fuck yeah, every game in history is repetitive and eventually loses replayability, this game is no Binding of Isaac but damn is it good. 10/10 (for me). Objectively I'd give it an 8/10 (lack of relics and for the witch which I hate and have a tiny itty bit of love for).", "timestamp_created": 1636544876, "timestamp_updated": 1654062680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102506407": {"recommendationid": "102506407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135923634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1679595327}, "language": "english", "review": "While Dicey Dungeons is a nice game to play every once in a while, it also requires you to play often in a way.

You play as a dice, face enemies in a dungeon, roll dices and wield weapons against your enemies using the dices to fulfill the requirement of your equipments.\n[*] Lovable characters, both the dices and the enemies.\n[*] Enough variance between 6 playable characters and their episodes to keep you playing.\n[*] Finding out synergies between equipments is a great pleasure.\n[*] Episodes are independent and short (each takes around 30 minutes), which means even casual players with limited playtime can still enjoy its charm.\n[*] The developer is very active and responsive, and really cares about the game. Two years after its release, this game still gets regular update (and a big free one is coming).\n[*] Many amusing little details awaits you.\n[*] Supports modding, which offers literally an infinity of possible extensions/modifications.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Annoying soundtrack and sound effects.\n[*] Sometimes feels repetitive since you fight the same enemies over and over again.\n[*] This game has a permadeath design. If you lose a fight, you have to begin the episode from scratch. However, unlike in Roguelite games, you get nothing from your previous failure except more experience on the game. You rebegin an episode with the same old weak character as your last run.\n[*] Very serious RNG issues. Although one can make strategic choices (which equipment to equip/buy/upgrade, which dice to use on which weapon, which enemy to fight first, etc) to maximise the chance of survival, RNG factors are still overwhelming, especially for certain characters. On one hand, even if you do nothing wrong, you can still die because you don't get the rolls you need, or one of your enemies is rolling luckily enough to give you a final blow. On the other hand, when you happen to get a set of equipments with good synergy, you will be able to brute force through the whole episode without thinking too much.\n[/list]\n\nThe RNG issues combined with the permadeath design makes the game unbearably frustrating when you play with difficult characters such as [spoiler]the witch[/spoiler], whose power relies heavily on your rolls. When you die a couple of times on the same level, the game becomes grinding and repetitive since each run of the same level only differs in the randomly chosen enemies and equipments.\n\nSure, permadeath can somehow be avoided if you quit the fight before death. The game only saves after each fight or each change of equipment or floor. So when you reload the episode, you can rebegin the same fight, or you can also pick another enemy, buy more equipments/health, or choose another set of equipments. However, when you put yourself into very unfavourable situation in which you can only make through a fight with lucky rolls and/or unlucky rolls from your enemy, then you still to have save scum a lot. To win a run or even the whole game like that, to paraphrase other reviewers, is like gambling on a coin flip: if it is head, you win; otherwise you lose. It still feels good to win, but hollowness follows afterward.\n\nSo, even though I have some fun playing through this game, I cannot recommend it unconditionally to other players. It does not mean this is a bad game. On the contrary, this game is well-made and you can really see how much energy and heart the dev has invested in it. My review serves only as a caveat. If you feel like you can handle/bear the RNG issues, then Dicey Dungeons would surely be a great game for you.\n\nInformation for completionists:\nThis game has in total [spoiler]46[/spoiler] episodes [spoiler](6 regular episode+1 hard mode bonus episode for each of the 6 playable characters, 1 finale, 3 Halloween special episodes)[/spoiler]. You will naturally get most of the achievements playing through all these episodes, which would take around 30 hours if you save scum to avoid death, significantly more if you don't. To get the rest, you have to replay some episodes to build your character with the achievement you want to unlock in mind.

Got me bouncing along to the rhythm, great times! While others really create a dire and panicked mood! Always fitting and always great! Thirdly is the game-play, is the game actually fun to play? It is indeed! The game starts quite basic and is easy to pick up allowing the player to get a steady handle of the different mechanics. As you progress you will find new items that change the combat, upgrade current equipment and battle enemy's with odd but interesting game plans! It's all just super fun to play and learn! Oh also you can unlock new dice that change how you play the game to keep things feeling fresh and different. Always a nice bonus!\n\nAnyway like I said before I haven't put that much time into the game so who know's what else I might find, for good or for bad but as for right now this game is a blast and I can't wait to keep playing and discover all the different chapters, dice, boards, enemy's and more! 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1635781376, "timestamp_updated": 1635781376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102031217": {"recommendationid": "102031217", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989685382", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 260, "last_played": 1635841424}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing depends on you.

The \u201cstory\u201d through which you progress: Lady Luck has you in her dungeon because you are eager to win but she\u2019s eager to tease you into keep playing, never letting you escape from her dungeon, and to laugh at you as she deprives you of the luck you need to win and escape the dungeon with the prize of having what you most desire. No matter what class of \u201chero\u201d you play, what you most desire is quite vapid. In fact, when you embark on your \u201cquest\u201d you are cast in a strange game show / reality TV show. The joke about luck even goes as far as always presenting you with a wheel of fortune spin you can never win at after you win a boss battle.\n\nBasically, to beat the game, you must beat Lady Luck. This means you\u2019re going to have to have to have more luck than luck itself. \u201cLevels of difficulty\u201d in this game mean, really, \u201clevels of being less fortunate\u201d as you progress through the game. This is what we call brutal satire, with a side of sarcasm. The rules of the game change as you progress. \n\nA \u201crun\u201d takes about 20 or 30 minutes to complete, so for me it\u2019s fun when I need to do some casual game playing in a relatively short period of time.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s so cool to have games like this available that don\u2019t require buying packs of cards four times or more a year. This one is unique from the other wonderful Magic and Hearthstone alternatives because it is focused on rolling dice. I love Yahtzee and I see this as Yahtzee game with a narrative, hero powers, dynamic play conditions, and ever-changing rules of play.\n\nIt\u2019s also fun to have to do battle with unusual \u201cmonsters\u201d like a vacuum cleaner, an aurora, a boom box, or a snowman.", "timestamp_created": 1635381334, "timestamp_updated": 1635381334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516460895538330078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101731989": {"recommendationid": "101731989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330820929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1204, "last_played": 1696708641}, "language": "english", "review": "DICE!!!!!

It's cute, addictive and not that hard to learn. You'll clear 5 floors battling a few enemies on each one, find some loot and try to perfect the right combination of equipment to use. At the 6th floor you'll find a boss enemy. Once you defeat it, the game's over. You can complete a succesful run in about 30 minutes.\n\nThe game has great replay value: you have (at least?) 6 different 'classes', and each of these have 6 kind of game modes with (slightly) different rules. After 30 hours of play I'm not even close at completing them all.\n\nYou play a dice, and a lot of dice are rolled each fight, so the RNG is high. Some runs you'll find better equipment than other runs. Sometimes the RNG will screw you over. This might not be for everyone. However, by using the right mix of equipment you can really tone down the dependence of the right dice rolls during a fight. All in all I'd say the RNG adds fun to the game.\n\nIf I have to list any dislikes, it would be the mediocre music (which I usually just turn off anyways, so not really a problem) and the mouse pointer. It would be nice if the game didn't use the regular windows mouse pointer, which often vanishes in the heavily use of the colour white in this game, and instead would use a bigger, more obvious mouse pointer.\n\nIf you're on the fence: go buy this game!

If you like pastel colors and whimsical characters, it's great. I've heard people call it \"tumblr-y,\" though. That's not really a downside for me, but I can see how it would be for other people. Up to personal taste, really.\n\nSound: 10/10, lovely music and the sound effects for attacks are actually really satisfying! I particularly like how the crowd will go \"Ooooh!\" when you land a lot of damage in one hit. The music also f*cking SLAPS.\n\nStory: 7/10, the gimmick is that you're on a game show, each story segment is an \"episode.\" It's not anything ground-breaking, but it's very charming, and the characters are well-written. There's also a couple nice twists, but why would I spoil that for you? Go play the game, ya dingus!\n\nGameplay: 6.5/10 Honestly, I feel like there isn't enough variety in the moves and attacks you can use each run. The cards are unique to each character, which is nice, but it also means that if you play the same character a few times in a row, you'll probably end up seeing the same cards too many times, and just relying on the same gimmicks. It's not [i]BAD[/i] though, I think it's meant to encourage trying out new characters. And I will say that the Robot has a VERY cool gimmick.\n\nOverall: 8/10 Not a very in-depth or hardcore Rogue-like (Rogue-lite? there's no permanent upgrades besides unlocking characters). But if you need a more casual Rogue-whatever game to relax to, it's worth the price. Especially on sale. If Rogue-lites like Slay the Spire and Enter the Gungeon are steak dinners, then Dicey Duneons is a warm, home-cooked meal. Not as expensive or as flashy, but will still make you feel full and warm after trying it. :)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1635026672, "timestamp_updated": 1635026672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452467292547225952", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101488168": {"recommendationid": "101488168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123390869", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2569, "last_played": 1696194539}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game.

All roguelike games include some form of RNG, and it does have a larger effect on games like this where it isn't action based (like Isaac or Hades). But when a game is literally about \"rolling the dice\" I think it isn't too detrimental to the experience, especially with the inclusion of cards that can reroll/change your dice. There are a lot of interesting mechanics going on in this game. The inventory/equipment management and the card upgrades are really cool and I think if this game looks like something you would enjoy, you probably will.

Can't recommend enough. I bought this in the sale for \u00a33 and it surpasses most \u00a320+ games I've gotten. \n\nWas a little hesitant at first because I tend to find rogue deck builder games wear old real quick and get repetitive within a few hours, but this game manages to stay fresh with every new character and episode. For me the thing that sets it apart is the fact that each character isn't just \"kill thing but with slightly different cards\", but instead their special moves change everything about your play style entirely to the extent it nearly feels like a different game each time you start on a new character. Each special ability forces your focus to change on different aspects of the game, so while the warrior character feels like your bog standard deck builder of hit a thing until it dies, you'll get something like the robot who's rolling concept is so different that you're playing black jack while trying to balance what moves to do when without going bust. The inventor's special forces you to constantly rotate through your weapons so you can never get comfortable with one set. Or a later character where you're juggling cards to get matching pairs for strong combos.\n\nI've played through every episode with virtually every character at this point and always find the episodes to be a fun challenge which force you out of your comfort zone and get you thinking of different ways to play the characters. For the negative reviews saying the challenges are too difficult, or that the game is entirely RNG based, I can only assume they haven't quite understood the need for completely changing your playstyle each episode. You can't brute force your way through the challenges, you need to plan ahead and understand what's being asked of you.

I genuinely think that it would feel like you're doing twice as much damage if the enemies actually had proper flinch animations. I don't complain about graphics not being ornate for its own sake, but this is a case where better graphics really would have improved the experience.", "timestamp_created": 1633679787, "timestamp_updated": 1633679787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100628501": {"recommendationid": "100628501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117663418", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "playtime_at_review": 1813, "last_played": 1700612496}, "language": "english", "review": "this is one dicey ass dungeon. would recommend", "timestamp_created": 1633538579, "timestamp_updated": 1633538579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100601662": {"recommendationid": "100601662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069136799", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 658, "last_played": 1655977400}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy to learn, hard to master\n", "timestamp_created": 1633508705, "timestamp_updated": 1633508705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100578003": {"recommendationid": "100578003", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998455758", "num_games_owned": 1517, "num_reviews": 1959, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1612002777}, "language": "english", "review": "Good rogue-like, but too boring and monotonous.", "timestamp_created": 1633466614, "timestamp_updated": 1633466614, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100562420": {"recommendationid": "100562420", "author": {"steamid": "76561199020172488", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 602, "last_played": 1644651893}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful little gem with surprising depth and variety.

You won't lose once you learn the mechanics and which items are good. \nThe later episodes have different rules and some completely change every aspect of the game - this is great.\n\nBut here's the problem:\n-You starting equipment is always the same and it's usually terrible.\n-Equipment drops and shops have the same items every run, only a few drops and shops have random items.\n-The pool of items to pick from is drastically reduced.\n\nSo basically all of your choices and ability to build your character and all of the fun is gone.\nWhat's left? RNG, RNG and more RNG.\n\nThese later episodes are not hard or difficult or require any thinking, just luck.\nI would cruise through 8 episodes without losing and then bam, lose 3 times in a row early on.\nI would play slowly and carefully and every move was perfect, but it did not matter. Once RNG gave me a certain item, boom the episode is easy. \n\nIn other card battlers there are abilities or cards that can get you out of a jam, but in Dicey Dungeons, you sit there and say \"This run is a win unless the enemy gets 3 perfect rolls, then the run is over\".

Making me watch them spin the wheel 36 times was pointless. \n[*] Make no mistake, some of these episodes are really hard. I required a dozen or so tries on some of them. This is particularly the case for the Inventor and the Witch. Often you will straight up lose to RNG, either due to your rolls, enemy rolls, bad equipment pulls, or in the bonus round on bad floor-rules. \n[*] I found the Inventor, who is forced to lose equipment after each turn unfun. It didn't help that this was also one of the hardest characters (aside from the Witch, which I liked the most), thus forcing me to play it the most. The decision to only allow the player to select from three pieces of equipment, was a poor one IMO.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] AFAIK there is no way to check the moves of enemies prior to fighting them, either via right click or hover or a beastiary. This QoL feature is expected in games like this.\n[*] As with all enemies in the dungeon, the final mini-boss is random. If that boss happens to hard-counter your build, you will lose. It would be nice to know who the mini-boss is prior to the final floor.\n[/list]\n\nSummary: My first few runs of DD were uninspired and I was disappointed. However, I stuck with it and was pleasantly surprised with what the devs had in store for me. I probably won't ever play again, having completed all 36 episodes (and the bonus round on hard with all six characters), but I surely got my money's worth. If you can stomach the slightly elevated level of RNG present, then this is a game you should purchase.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1631622979, "timestamp_updated": 1631646472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99329236": {"recommendationid": "99329236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005621993", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 583, "last_played": 1631649375}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomendado.
