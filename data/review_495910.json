I think the mixed reviews are unwarranted and seem mainly tied to issues with the steam version of the game but i personally haven't had any beyond the clunky process of purchasing premium currency.\n[b]The game is good but it's definitely not for everyone.[/b] Some things to keep in mind.\n\n1. It is NOT p2w but rather pay to speed up progress.\n\n2. At the moment, progression at max level is designed around a person being able to solo everything without a group minus a couple of raids but those are optional. You can still play this with friends, it's just not as common as it once was to party up.\n\n3. It revolves around creating multiple characters and have one character to feed all your resources into. After that, you move on to the next. You get rewarded the more alts you have.\n\n4. The real game starts at level 110, this also means that all content released focuses on the max level. Everything up until that point follows the basic formula of (Complete Dungeon -> Level up -> Move to next area). It works though because all the classes are varied and are quite unique in their Playstyles.\n\n5. At Max level, there is a \"Fame\" system which determines how strong your character is and what dungeons you can access. Building up this fame is pretty easy until you reach around 33k-35k, at that point you're time gated for progress. Generally that's when I create another character or progress on another one until the next week when I can do more raids. The game at this point opens up and can become confusing without some sort of guidance so I'd recommend checking out the 80% DFO Discord or dfo.gg\n\n6. The fatigue point system has been criticized but the game is balanced around it. Most importantly farming gold, at end-game, without the FP system you would easily completely ruin the economy with how much people can blitz through dungeons and make money. It keeps that in check and allows newer players to keep up. There is additionally NEO Premium which increases you fatigue limit quite a bit.\n\n7. Inflation hasn't seem to be an issue, generally prices have remained mostly the same from what i can tell. Rare Avatar pieces go for 30m, normal avatar sets go for 10m. Depends on supply and demand.\n\n8. The game has a rather small population and finding guides can be difficult, I'd recommend checking out the \"80% DFO\" discord or dfo.gg for an encyclopedia. \n\nSo, TLDR Key points\n - Fatigue Point System\n - Pay to Progress Faster\n - Small community\n - Engaging Beat-em-up Gameplay\n - Focus on making alts to fund mains", "timestamp_created": 1700337278, "timestamp_updated": 1700337278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150286878": {"recommendationid": "150286878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835316798", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 482, "playtime_at_review": 767, "last_played": 1700550896}, "language": "english", "review": "veriu veri fun  except for pvp", "timestamp_created": 1700237499, "timestamp_updated": 1700237499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150279751": {"recommendationid": "150279751", "author": {"steamid": "76561199375836404", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2386, "playtime_at_review": 2859, "last_played": 1700682250}, "language": "english", "review": "Much cooler then elsword due to  free weapon but game little lag", "timestamp_created": 1700229833, "timestamp_updated": 1700229833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150097507": {"recommendationid": "150097507", "author": {"steamid": "76561199236126105", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 477, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1700030455}, "language": "english", "review": "great game if ur looking for combat and grinding", "timestamp_created": 1699935124, "timestamp_updated": 1699935124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149776103": {"recommendationid": "149776103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040496834", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1699474408}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't played in years and decided to hop back in to see what has changed since the last time i played.

With a staggering array of over 15 characters and 50 diverse subclasses spread across them, you'll traverse a world where the convergence of combat and fantasy offers both moments of exhilaration and doubt. The game's journey, originally orchestrated by Nexon in 2010 for North American players, underwent further evolution under Neople's guidance in 2014, garnering praise and reservations alike. Echoing the echoes of timeless classics such as \"Golden Axe\" and \"Double Dragon,\" DFO attempts to interweave the spirit of vintage side-scrolling action with a contemporary twist, leaving players both enchanted and uncertain. As you unsheathe your blades and conjure your spells, a tale unfolds that challenges you to embrace the essence of a fighter, navigating the depths of the dungeon amidst a sea of mixed opinions.\n\t\n\tThis game effortlessly channels the exhilarating essence of classic beat-em-up games, immersing players in a world of visceral combat and relentless action. Even the mechanics pay homage to the genre's roots, with controls that demand precision and strategy. Yet, as you navigate through the game's stages, an intriguing conflict unfolds. First, we have the gameplay structure that even though it resembles the beat-em-up style, the challenge curve takes a somewhat unexpected turn. Early on, the foes you face seem almost unresponsive and random, that they are often neglecting a focused assault on your character which makes for the lack of punishing difficulty that characterized old-school beat-em-up titles. Then, there are the controls, while reminiscent of their predecessors, exhibit a hint of lag, which can hinder the seamless execution of combos and precise movement. Alongside the controls, it follows with the skills, though imbued with a sense of power, at times feel disjointed, struggling to find a harmonious rhythm when combined.  With these issues combined, it leads to an unchallenged level up system for dungeons to be swept with minimal effort; an absence in a once-familiar difficulty system to meet your combat prowess; a rare fatigue system not seen in more recent games that raises questions in the late-game challenge; and a redundant loot system that leaves dungeons' post victory item bonuses somewhat disconnected from the experience. With this in mind, DFO offers a unique perspective that treads a fine line between nostalgia and modernity, while leaving room for evolution.\n\t\n\tAs DFO masterfully evokes the nostalgia of 90's 2D beat-em-up classics through its pixel art graphics, it weaves a rich tapestry of visuals that pays homage to the genre's golden age with a price. Luckily, the visual style extends beyond mere aesthetics, as each character is brought to life with meticulously crafted illustrations that unveil a unique story and exude distinctive personality and flair. However, while the skills themselves are a visual feast, there's room for growth in terms of character animations, particularly in their death poses and during pivotal story cutscenes. With a slight positive note in design, sound effects (SFX) and soundtrack blends a varied chord, blending seamlessly in some scenes while leaving a jarred dissonance in others. There are also glitches found in the SFX and BGM to either amplify in volume or even echo after boss battles and cutscenes. In essence, the visuals and audial components come together to create an intricate tapestry that charts a mixed course of its own.\n\t\n\tDFO's storyline unfortunately is the highest form of disappointment as it struggles to hold players in its narrative grasp. The tale occasionally stumbles, marked by intermittent breaks, that are particularly evident in the initial stages of the game. These pauses prompt a sense of disconnection, amplified by timeline points that sometimes raise questions. Yet, as the story unfolds, the desire to hit the spacebar and forgo the narrative altogether creeps in. Although the plot eventually weaves its threads into a semblance of coherence, the overarching feeling is one of sidelining and fragmentation. The protagonist's backstory, outlined in the opening, fails to undergo meaningful development, leaving them stagnant throughout the adventure. This leads the character's role within the story to be reduced to a mere errand-runner, devoid of personal purpose or motivation. Alongside, character interactions are punctuated by sporadic lines that, while well-executed, provide only a modest layer to the gameplay experience. It ends up preventing any attachment to the characters or immersion in the plot. Regrettably, the narration lacks emotional resonance, character growth remains stunted, and pacing falters, resulting in an overall narrative experience that falls disappointingly short of its potential.\n\t\n\tDFO is strategically crafted for a diverse audience, catering to teens and adults with a mosaic of opinions who seek a blend of nostalgia and contemporary gameplay. Amidst honest evaluations, echoes of trolling can be found in reviews, underscoring the passionate yet contentious dialogue surrounding the game. Critics recount unfavorable encounters with the Steam edition, recounting instances where false bot flags led to bans and frustrating interactions with Neople's customer service. There have also been tales of bans tied to in-game currency purchases, prompting some to advocate for playing directly from the official site. This also ties with the pay-to-win system to add a layer of complexity, with some arguing this model's prevalence. Yet, positive perspectives remain steadfast, celebrating engaging gameplay, captivating art, and an intriguing storyline.  Be as it may, the community dynamics mirror this diversity, with factions that cater to elite players, offering meticulous guides and guilds for character building and raids, while others feel marginalized. Contrasting these viewpoints, voices hail the welcoming and supportive nature of communities on Discord, Reddit, and Wiki sites. As the game continue to hold what is true, the recent patch, introducing the Muse/Traveler character, complete with novel skills, art, and playstyle, reignites optimism for the game's future, hoping to lure new players into the ever-evolving world of Dungeon Fighter Online.\n\t\n\tIn conclusion, DFO presents itself as a neutral experience, showcasing a spectrum of strengths and weaknesses that shape its gaming identity to cater to a broad audience. The game's visual aesthetics and nostalgic gameplay elements evoke fond memories of classic titles, yet its storyline falls short of captivating players, leaving a void for those who value narrative engagement. While the allure of end-game content is present, the sense of accomplishment it provides could be more pronounced. For enthusiasts of the genre, the active and visually appealing gameplay will resonate, even though the game's overall potential could be further realized through improvements. As a timeless title, Dungeon Fighter Online has a foundation that could be elevated with enhancements, particularly by introducing separate difficulty levels for veterans and elevating its storyline and character development. Until then, while the game offers certain attractions, it may not wholly satisfy those seeking a deeply immersive narrative experience.\n\t\n[h2] Final Score [/h2]\t\n\tMechanics : 7/10\n\tStory : 3/10\n\tGameplay : 6/10\n\tMusic : 4/10\n\tArt : 9/10\n\t\n\t[h3] Overall Score : 6/10 [/h3]\n\nThis is my first review that I took some time to write, so please feel free to give some input.", "timestamp_created": 1699304420, "timestamp_updated": 1699304420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596089661121368408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149330426": {"recommendationid": "149330426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153240950", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 149109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7545, "playtime_at_review": 141563, "last_played": 1700786433}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego es muy entretenido, tiene jefes (la mayor parte del contenido, el cual desbloqueas al final del juego. antes del nivel 99, todo es tutorial) cuyas mec\u00e1nicas realmente los hacen dif\u00edciles y no son el cl\u00e1sico caso de \"dificil por estad\u00edsticas\" o cosas similares, el \u00fanico problema que tengo con este juego es que, si quieres progresar bien, tienes que meterle demasiadas horas para poder conseguir la moneda del juego y comprar paquetes, cuyos muchas veces vienen con t\u00edtulos (un tipo de equipamiento en el juego que te aumenta mucho el da\u00f1o, etc), mascotas y este tipo de cosas, convirti\u00e9ndose en minimax un un tanto excesivo.

The only reason to boot it up would be to test out the 60+ classes that you can check out on youtube for a general gist of the action that you'll never actually get to play, especially with other players. Instead you'll slog through the glorified tutorial that is the ACTUAL GAME until you finally reach level cap a week later, or if there's an event, maybe an hour later. a VERY BORING hour. Then say hello to your first endgame raid where everybody hates your guts, will pester you to make a new character if it ain't viable for the meta, will hate your guts some more, will demand you start abiding to the pay to win guidelines aka the Korean bible, and will likely be grown men playing as a sadistic magical loli or sword waifu, all while flaunting their cash or sad grind obsession throughout.

Now I am 29 and after coming back the game has made massive progress from animated cut-scenes to introducing new classes like the Agent class which is my favourite to re-working the story of the game.  There are still some few miss-translation of story description but other than that the Music, artwork, animation, soundtrack and story has made huge improvement. I would highly recommend this game especially for newcomers who wants to try the Agent class which is very fun to play as.\n\nMy only bad opinion of this game is the miss-translation of some story description not all of them but only few of them needs vocabulary changes. The other is I wish it had more animated cut-scenes that lasted longer. But other than that love the music, artwork, soundtrack and animation and I am also planning to upgrade my PC so I can have a chance to play Dungeon fighter Duel.

The game is also really good at walking through where you need to go next to progress, for late 2000s MMO standards at least. By far the worst part is the download experience; the launcher appears to only be able to download a single file at a time, and there's well over 100,000 files since they're not properly archived, which means you're effectively capping out at 8 MB/s or so. Again, in 2010 that was probably fine because few people had internet much faster than that, but for the love of God Nexon please fix this. Based on the achievement stats where less than 25% of people are getting the achievements that you get within the first 20 minutes of actual gameplay, I imagine a good amount of people who open the launcher are giving up before the download even finishes.\n\nAlso, for some reason the cash shop has very few cosmetic outfits.

The pixel art style is also second-to-none, with very flashy abilities and overall an extremely charming aesthetic. \n\nHowever, it's a Korean MMO; that naturally means that you can expect a grind. However, the grind in DFO is ridiculous. Leveling to max level is a glorified tutorial, which is fine because it only takes a few days, but once you're at max, the *real* grind begins. As a complete noob, you can expect to spend anywhere from 4-6 months of *daily playing* to get a character endgame ready, and that may not even be for the most current content depending on RNG. The grind isn't ridiculous purely because of the fatigue system, which only allows you to enter a certain amount of dungeons per day (this system is in place to encourage creating many alts, which is fine for veteran players, but for a new player it will cause frustration). I have nearly 500 hours in the game and I'm nowhere near being able to do the latest endgame content *on my main,* let alone my alts (granted, I only play 2-3 times a year in big months-long binges, but that seems irrelevant considering the time investment over multiple years). \n\nIf you're looking for an MMO to invest time into, this is absolutely the one, due to its frankly perfect combat and general gameplay loop. However, you're going to struggle for months as a noobie with catching up to the current content, as well as a serious case of system bloat. Seriously, the system bloat can't be understated, it's a nearly 20 year old Korean MMO after all; the number of convoluted systems for improving your gear/damage is absurd.

There are fun challenges like Hell Mode, the towers in Valley of Fallen Souls, and the PVP scene has a lot more to it than meets the eye. \n\nDungeon Fighter Online is one of the least MMO-like MMOs to ever exist because of the meat of its gameplay being so unique and retro.

Id like to say that this game has seen better days first and foremost, currently the community is sparce and they have jumped into this strange NEO worldspace that seems to have changed the overall feeling of the game. The classes are updated leaving plenty to be desired from older classes, specifically classes that utilize multi hits. And progress is consistently streamlined just to push you to the highest level with no difficulty no cares and not a whole lot of fun. I feel at this point the game is old enough that older players have their characters but they push newer players through all of the directed content and throw all of the side content on as an optional point of play as it really isn't necessary to touch for most characters and there is no point on getting involved in the economy of the game at this stage. I don't know the state of the games homeland but im sure its a reflection of interest in its home country but I could be wrong.\n\nIts my hope that after watching this game grow, close, grow, close and then grow again that as it takes its next step into different games and different genres it wont forgets its roots. I have not played DNF Duel yet but i plan too. And im sure everyone has seen project overkill or bbq or whatever its next name is. Truthfully i hope that what they have done with dnf duel will be brought back to its orginal arcade style. Rather than moving on to overkill or bbq and removing the retro arcade style the game is known for. I believe the next course of the games development should instead revisit their original game and reinvigorate the arcade style game genre permanently for it. Allow the next wave of mobile and gacha games to take on that 3D landscape, games like Kurtzpel, Genshin, and Tower Of Fantasy should be allowed to rule in their new home. Please do not try to force DNF into a mold that was made for something elses playground and instead bring back a steady community of arcade fighters. If DNF Duel is a precursor to the next arcade style game of DNF becoming DNF 2. Than i believe alot of the old successes can be brought back while incorporating some of the new mechanics as well. Take the best of Dnf's snapshots. From my beta experience id say in terms of features that I personally like. And anyone can and will disagree would be. The Current state of itemization, hunting items as sets, and the raid system, Remove magic sealed items as i believe its a band aid to a system that only needed increased drop rates. The older pvp system before the Arena System. The games where much easier to find and im sure balance can be made by using a more modern system. The Explore club names are of course a helpful addition to carry over as it helps with managing friends and gaining bonuses for using multiple characters. The exploration area i believe is something brought over from Mabinogi which could probably have stayed there in my opinion as is completely skipped over as raids are the main function for end game. It would be nice for the focus of the game to remain in raids, dungeoning, and pvp. By providing rewards for dungeoning and pvping in the way that modern games do with cosmetic items and non cosmetic rewards or currencies to purchase equipment and item sets, im sure DNF could skip things like exploration zones unless they intend to incorporate a full on exploration type of arcade style by utilizing these zones in between cities and having players travel from zone to zone before getting to safe zones. Similar to other Free to play Sidescrollers. But the features are not as important to be re implented as preserving the core arcade style of DNF and incorporating the Art style, of DNF Duel. By re creating the original DNF format out of DNF Duel I believe that DNF will only secure its ability to move on from its current state. Bringing over what it has learned from DNF. And overall creating a better experience and a fresh start for anyone who has enjoyed the game over the years.\n\n\n\nThat being said. In its current stage. The game is still fun. Fatigue runs out about as quickly as you level. But its great nostalgia for anyone who has already played, and a nice time waster for those who can bring a group along to run few dungeons with. There is much less harshness to the game as there used to be. But enjoying the game as it is now im sure id play it for just as long.

I quit about a year and a half ago, but decided I should go ahead and download it via Steam (which can't be linked to existing accounts) for a quick romp through on a new account.\n\nDFO used to be a game I wholeheartedly enjoyed and would sink hours into, but it doesn't feel the same anymore.\n\nThe current new player (or rather I should say new character) experience is depressingly boring, with most of the leveling process involving going through dungeons in which every single monster (including the bosses) can be killed with a single skill. This is made more annoying due to knowing how many of these bosses functioned prior to this. Many encounters that are hyped up in the story are literal jokes and completely undermines the plot as well as the player's time. If you're bored enough to sit through the leveling process, you do finally somewhat feel like you're playing a beat-em-up rather than a mobile game that can be played with one hand once you get closer to the later caps (I'd say around 90+). However, if you haven't played the game to know that it does get better, I envision the average player simply quitting long before then, but then the majority of the endgame content revolves around raids.\n\nMost classes in the game have become increasingly homogenized as well, with most of the releases in the time since Neople began hosting it themselves just having an arsenal of screenwide nukes, and many of the more unique mechanics and skills of older classes often being phased out and replaced with... more screen-wide nukes. Many classes feel overly similar due to this behavior when that wasn't the case previously, and the game feels like much more of a giant number simulator than a beat-em-up.\n\nThe game has the standard battle-pass fare, constant items to buy in the shops, and continuously aggressive powercreep. All things I wouldn't care about if there was actually a game to play outside of the raid content at endgame, which again, used to not be an issue. This is further exacerbated by the game being designed around having multiple alts, including a stamina system on top of your standard MMO time-gating that prevents playing a single character for too long.

Then leave.\n\nIt's pay to win, first off.  Check the hours I put in - I'm still more or less on the bottom of the food chain after years of meticulous daily grind.  Even after re-farming entire sets of gear just to have the most-optimal epics according to some 3rd party software I had to download just to calculate the stats, I'm still begging just to get in to the actual endgame content next to all the whales with amps and enchants bought by selling Cera items in the auction house.\n\nSecond, the community is pretty toxic.  Decent players or guilds exist but they are outnumbered.  Expect casual racism, sexism, and other bigotry and expect not to speak up about it (or about anything, really) without getting harassed and blocked by the people who lead the endgame raid groups, preventing you from progressing.\n\nAnd what makes those things worse is, this isn't like WoW or something where there was at least a world of stuff to explore and do outside of endgame raids.  This game is pretty much entirely a linear sprint to the one or two current endgame raids which you will then repeat HUNDREDS of times exactly the same way just to farm your gear, only to end up...  still underpowered.  Because you still need hundreds of millions of gold to buy avatars, amps, reinforcements, enchants, emblems, titles, creatures and so on just to pull your own weight.  I like grind.  I came here for some grind to get me through covid isolation but this is not healthy, it is the mind-numbing, repetitive-strain-injury-inducing kind.\n\nI regret the time I spent here the last two years.  It stopped being fun but it was hard to come to terms with everything I'd invested being for nothing.  The only winning move is not to play, because once you play you can't quit without throwing away all that time you invested.\n\nEDIT:  The only thing I wanted to add was how much it pained me to write this review because I really, really used to love this game way back.

I wish there was a better rating system on Steam because DFO falls somewhere in the middle between thumbs up and thumbs down. I gave it a cautious thumbs up but this game has a lot of flaws and caveats.\n\nDFO is one of the most fun games while also one of the most infuriating I have played over the past 6 years or so, with some longer breaks here and there. On the good side, you have some fun and engaging side-scrolling combat reminiscent of the good old arcade games like Final Fight and Streets of Rage. You have a huge range of classes many of which feel unique, not an easy feat to achieve. It starts very easy, too easy in fact, unlike 5 years ago where even from the start you had to at least pay attention, and then very gradually becomes harder and harder though there is a very big spike past 90 that for some classes can be very frustrating.\n\nOn the neutral side, there is a 15 Euro subscription per month that gives you some benefits and you can play more on any given character, increasing the so called fatigue points, FP in short, from 156 to iirc 276. To offset this in case you cannot play that much, 276 will easily take you about 1 1/2 to 2 hours to burn through, you can double the FP cost but also get double experience though you will quickly outlevel dungeons and get reduced experience. You can opt to skip low level main quest content and hop over to the level appropiate main quest area, but you lose quite a bit of gold and potentially gear, which means you might have too low level gear now, so that is a two edged sword. You also get a legendary weapon for leveling giving you a signicant power boost if you so wish it compensating for the faster level process if you go for the increase FP use option. You also get a discount on some dungeon materials and a minor daily reward like extra entry materials for a certain dungeon.\nGear does not change your characters looks apart from the weapon, for your character you need to buy skins. There are events which can give you a free skin on occasion, but usually you have to buy them and they are not cheap, in part because skins are a set of about 12 parts, like hair, face,etc. and each gives a little bonus, some of which are important like giving you a +1 bonus to your main class buff.\n\nOn the bad side, there is the P2W aspect that is quite infuriating because first you have to qualify to be allowed to purchase anything and there are 5 stages of privilige for which you have to pay 150 Euros to qualify for the third, which finally allows you to access the in game cash shop. It has the typical Korean weapon upgrade system that at higher tiers require you to invest hundreds of millions and other material in the thousands to upgrade and it has not only a chance to fail but at the top endcan destroy your weapon. This is exceptionally grating for the average gamer since just getting the best items requires a lot of grind as usual in Korean MMOs.\nNext is the overabundance of crafting and instance access materials. It is overwhelming especially for a new player. While there is at least on the newer materials a description what and where they can be used in many instances you will still be confused what exactly you can upgrade or exchange them for and what is and what is not important. The game itself is not telling you much all in all and you will have to rely on online guides, some of which can be found on YT.\nThe worst aspect is imho the raiding. Now do not get me wrong I have nothing per se against raids. They can be up to 16 players large where you send a group of 4 into different locations in the dungeon, a cool concept. Sadly there are some very grating design flaws. \nFor one each has an individual material requirement you have to either farm or gather through an event which further clutters your inventory and stash, a completely uneccessary hassle since you are already limited to do them once a day and twice a week. \nThen there is the fact that especially when you learn the dungeon in the so called \"Guide mode\" you are not only required to learn the bosses general attack patterns but almost every single one of them has at least one if not two one shot patterns that you have to memorize or get one shot. That in a high stress situation because apart from that the bosses deal high damage just with their normal attacks and they are very spongy so long as you are not vastly out-gearing them will lead to frequent frustrating deaths. You are limited to a certain limit of revives per attempt, ranging usually from 5-10 and they eat up revive coins. These coins once you reach 0 get refilled once a week to 3 and otherwise you either rely on events or have to buy them via hard cash. You can easily burn 30 revives in the initial phase of learning the highest level of current raid, because there are normally around 5 end bosses and 5-10 mid bosses, each with their own patterns and one shot mechanics. \"Guide\" mode has easier variants but the grating part is that they are supposed to help you learn the specifics yet burn through your coins and therefore incentive in the most abusive way to buy more revives. That is for me unacceptable. Yes you can go back to the starting area and wait a short time to \"heal\". \nProblem is though that you have to start the dungeon all over and while you can redo the fights and learn it a little better, you have a time limit of about 30 minutes. There are only so many attempts before you want to just alt-F4 out of the game and take a day or more off from the game.\nLastly customer service. Frankly it is abysmal. I had to give up my Steam account becasue they refused to let me change to my new e-mail adress because I lost access to my old Microsoft one, telling me that I should ask Mircosoft to reinstate it which I told them I had tried mutliple times to no avail.\nA friend of mine who tried the game out and played for about 100 hours STILL has no access to anything, not even the web browser cash shop and frankly gave up playing it, he did not even come back when the current Blitz event came, preferring to level a new alt in WoW instead.\nI am also not sure if it is still a thing but when I started on my second account there were regular annoying captchas popping up in the middle of a dungeon run which did not pause the game, which could lead to your death because you cannot do anything while the enemies are still attacking you. This is, or was, a anti-bot measure but all it does, or did, was infuriate you. The game actually does not tell you this but the only way to get around this is to send a message to support.\n\nTL:DR version: Really fun gameplay and great variety of classes, but horrible scarcely explained systems, bloated amount of crafting, exceedingly punishing raids for beginners and entrance materials and some really infuriating P2W aspects on top of the typical Korean MMO grind.", "timestamp_created": 1653890870, "timestamp_updated": 1653892797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583978891372680664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116177663": {"recommendationid": "116177663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330280108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 113, "last_played": 1653805294}, "language": "english", "review": "Note: You HAVE to follow the instructions in the client for account verification BEFORE you boot up the game for the first time or you'll get kicked or banned within a couple seconds of playing.

Back then it was run by (old) Nexon so my game time on Steam isn't exactly reflective of my actual time in game.**\n\nThis game is great even if it's a little flawed. Lots of people still play, especially endgame content. They update the game frequently and have a new event every month. There is usually one livestream on Twitch every so often so the devs can answer questions and interact with the community. Despite a dip in profits in Q4 2021 this franchise spawned 2 other games: Project BBQ and Overkill. It's far from dead.\n\nMost complaints are based around the Steam version like the captcha and login/account issues. Just play through their launcher. EZ. I will agree the FP system isn't the best, but I found it helps encourage playing your other characters. Since most drops around endgame levels drop both character AND account bound items, you can just play on your alts then funnel everything to your main character. \n\nThe story is fairly interesting but most people I've introduced the game to just mash the skip button and blow through the story bits. The cut scenes are either motion comic styled or a nice fully animated/voiced scene and you can watch them later if you missed/skipped any. There are also missions which exist solely to provide a little extra lore and have no impact on story progression. \n\nProgression is pretty linear until endgame where you're grinding raids for random mythics. Leveling is stupid fast the first 10-20 or even up to 30. Joining a guild that has the 10% exp buff going is a great way to blast through early content. Leveling slows a little between 50-70 or 80 but it's not bad at all. Around 95 is when you'll start the endgame gearing process and looking to min/max your characters.\n\nYou don't need to spend money to get paid avatar items from the cash shop but yes the option does exist. You can buy things from the auction house for in game currency. Most people would complain about the clone avatars or the pets that provide a little extra stats but if somebody wants to spend $ to make their char look cool, support the game, AND help our raid group kill bosses faster.... I'm ok with that. Also, I don't play pvp in this game but if you like the characters, just wait for dnf duel and go play that.\n\nAnyways, if you're on the fence about the game just try it by using their website to download the launcher. If you want help or just to join a guild for free buffs, I run the guild Lechery on Cain server.

New players wanting to play a nice beat em up game with some depth might find this game fun, but if they want to play some of the end game content they'll have to spend a ton of time to get their gear up and interact with the offline community like Reddit. Hopefully the next cap to be released will address these issues so that newer players can play casually and have fun while also remain challenging for older players.\n\nAs for events, I'd say everything has gone down hill over the years. The events were usually just repeats and unfortunately due to the NA server having a small team, we don't see those exclusive events like the Wild Wild West event. I'm sure if there were a larger consistent player base that we'd get more fun and experimental events, but as of now it's pretty much either sit down and get rewards to gear or get gear by grinding.\n\nOverall I'd give this game an honest 6/10. It's good and if you like beat em ups I'd bump it up to 7/10 but it's not very new player friendly, and the customization has been a rollercoaster. Some balancing to open up avenues of character customization would definitely make this game better, as well as content that can be fun for players who just want the challenge of a traditional beat em up would definitely benefit this game a ton.", "timestamp_created": 1641686801, "timestamp_updated": 1641686801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107390679": {"recommendationid": "107390679", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027482853", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1351, "last_played": 1644401953}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly this is one of the best games I've played in a long time!!!", "timestamp_created": 1641404758, "timestamp_updated": 1641404758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107336136": {"recommendationid": "107336136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067642528", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1565558562}, "language": "english", "review": "For those who like non pay to win games : this is not it.\nThe further you go you will not be invited to a party cause you are a max lvl character with no good items.\neverything here does cost money and they even have that ugly ass system which only allows you to play a limited time.\nFor example you get 100 points every day and one dungeon cost you about 3-5 if you use it all you cant play.\nVery nice system aint it?

I was wondering why this game had mixed reviews but after 21 hours of game play there is a reason I'm going to stop playing this game now. No matter what level you get or what class awakenings you achieve you will always look like your base class at level one. The game is very misleading by having all the sub classes have specific skins in the create a character screen and showing you what level they unlock at (even letting you try them in a practice mode with those skins on) but when you reach the level you change classes you will still look like you do at level one. I understand for some people this might not bother them but for me its a deal breaker to look the same at level one as I do at level one hundred. I used to be a big Ragnarok Online fan which had a ton of classes which you changed into when you achieved them so I think its dumb to not change base skins when you class change. The only reason Dungeon Fighter is set up this way is greed, it's so they can resell the skins for a limited time once a year for real money. Which is crazy because we are just talking about the base class skins, I think it would be fine for them to sell skins sure but to not even let the player have the base class skin is just ridiculous to me. The second I realized the game is like this I instantly stopped playing. I highly doubt I will come back, will probably uninstall after writing this review. It's a shame too because I love 2D beat em up games and I was having fun playing the game. Not getting to have my sub classes skin is just too asinine for me to continue playing this game though. Shame for DFO to miss so hard with that, they definitely know what they are doing with that misleading character creation screen.

DFO is an incredibly unique game that no other game can quite scratch the itch of. It's an MMO beat-em-up RPG, and if I had to compare it to another MMO in terms of feel, it'd be Black Desert. If you play, play the version through the DFONeople website, as the Steam client apparently has problems. I quit in early 2021, having played from the relaunch in March 2015. Until I quit I had sold runs of the hardest content on the hands down worst class in the game for several years, so it really is down to how much you're willing to master your character and optimize your gear.\n\nI love this game, but I would describe it as a beautiful little hut underneath of a mountain of trash. If you're an endgame player, you've been cozy while this mountain of trash built up around you. If you're a new player, you must dig through the endless trash to try to find something worthwhile. For example, many new players report being automatically banned after their first day and having to manually appeal it to be able to play again. I really wonder what percentage of new players actually do this. I'd guess less than 10%. This game has a lot of problems, and most target new players for some reason. Also, the game is peer-to-peer so unless you have a good internet connection, don't even try. If you are not in NA, northern South America, are unwilling to find a European guild, or able speak Chinese, you will likely be a solo-only player. Also, because of peer-to-peer, sometimes if one person crashes it'll crash the entire group, potentially losing you your clear. \n\nIf you're wondering about the lore - you don't play this game for the lore, and the answer is always Hilder.\n\nThe combat is some of the best I've played. Skills are responsive, the abilities are flashy, and most classes can pull some really slick combos that are incredibly satisfying. Your skill can carry you through most encounters even with lackluster gear. Except you won't need any skill while leveling until you're at least level 90. This game encourages alts (more below), and as such they've streamlined the leveling, making it way too easy and boring.\n\nYou cannot do relevant group content without having epics, which are gotten by using account-bound materials you primarily get from doing raids. You can farm Legendary gear to be able to do the solo mode of the first raid of the level cap, and the previous level cap's raids (though probably solo only as well, because of elitism). The solo version will reward fewer materials than the group version, but it's better than nothing. If you're a new player who can't get carried, expect to be running solo for several months before becoming a \"real\" character. Groups will just accept somebody with 10x your damage. Raids also drop materials for upgrading your epics. And when I say upgrading your epic, I mean it's the same item but with an extra 12% multiplier on your damage. Per piece. Plus set effects. Because not only does your item have a set, but your upgrades have a set that stacks with your set, so you can set while you set. I'm not joking.\n\nThe wall for new players is obscene. So the easiest way to become an endgame player is to get carried until you're geared enough to stand on your own. If you have a guild that'll do it for free, that's amazing. Usually, you'll be buying carries with gold. These prices are usually low enough to be farmed within 1 FP bar, so it's not too bad, I guess.\n\nBut wait, what's an FP bar? Fatigue points. That's how this game deters bots from leveling to max and grinding a bunch of gold in a day. Dungeons are broken into rooms, and every time you enter a new room it costs 1 FP. If you run out of FP points, you cannot enter a dungeon until they refresh back to full tomorrow. They give new players a bunch of FP recovery potions to supplement this, but it's not enough. Many new players end up frustrated due to wanting to continue playing their character, but unable to until tomorrow. And then find they've been auto-banned if they try to log in the next day! Good job, Neople. Endgame players don't really care about fatigue. Fatigue points are per character, and we only do a few dungeons/character/day. Past that it's weekly dungeons and raids for our upgrades. If you want to farm and run out of FP on one character, you just swap to another, because you have a dozen to choose from. Again, new players are screwed here.\n\nThis game *is* pay-to-win, but it's not that f2p players can't compete. F2P players just have to grind for gold more. Pets/Titles/Auras have stats, but those and almost everything else in the cash shop is tradeable. Buy budget options and use those until you get a character to BiS gear, then buy the BiS ones every 2 years or so. They also sell tickets that stop your items from breaking due to high reinforcement, but reinforcing armor is usually useless and is only useful on weapons above +12. Do not ever go for +13. Do not amp. Do not compete with whales. These are futile efforts. Some of these whales are C-level execs who don't care if they drop millions of dollars as long as they are the best.\n\nAll in all, the gameplay is extremely fun, but the systems around the gameplay are extremely flawed. I hope some day they can fix this game and just let people enjoy the combat instead of having to commit to endless grinds to stay relevant.", "timestamp_created": 1639941494, "timestamp_updated": 1640803490, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709335446357727051", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106114702": {"recommendationid": "106114702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059576754", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1480642848}, "language": "english", "review": "Neople and Steam account link when. i need dam achievements.\nGame has flaws,some strange developer decisions but in fact fun and great even for f2p players as most of things you can obtain in game by trading or doing events.\nClasses provide unique and interesting gameplay,most of classes are hard to master to bring out full potential.\nEndgame content is somewhat hard but actually forces you to learn and play the game as intended (no typical dummy-bosses)\nif someone interested to start now feel free to dm me and i will help with game basics/info Discord:AGGRO?#7221\nRu/Eng", "timestamp_created": 1639931648, "timestamp_updated": 1639931697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519221007823944092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106070561": {"recommendationid": "106070561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002793830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1639866397}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey fighting game fans (SFV, UMVC3, KOF, ect)!

This game was always much funner with at least one more person to run dungeons with. \n\nThere needs to be a dungeon fighter 2 or a complete revamp like WoW did, squishing the level range down, streamlining the areas so that there aren't so many outdated questlines, gear, etc.  \n\nThis game has some very novel ideas that are really unique to it.

I got into it pretty hard, until shortly after reaching the level cap. The endgame progression requires stockpiling epic armor sets. This is an RNG progression nightmare, but not really my main complaint. Naturally, trying to hoard all those pieces fills up your storage pretty quick. I saw the safe upgrade in the shop for $1, so I loaded up on the premium currency CERA and went to buy it, only to realize that you can't even use the in-game shop until you reach \"Steel Tier\". How does one reach \"Steel Tier\", you ask? By spending ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY dollars on their webstore, which doesn't include storage upgrades.\n\nThat's right. In order to store more than the base number of items (practically required for epic progression), you have to spend $150 or wait for 6-12 months for them to sell a buyable safe upgrade for $20 (What a bargain /s).

A Beat-em-up with RPG progression? Yes please!  Suuuuuper smooth & responsive combat, lots of cool mechanics, and many different playstyles.  Witch was always my favorite; I love racking up combos in the 100's of hits.\n\nFolks mentioning endgame here, but if you're a casual you'll have plenty of fun just playing the many classes thru the leveling system.  Some grind here and there in that they pull the old \"one quest at a time in the same dungeon\" trick; so definitely don't go into anything extra because you'll replay the same (slightly randomized) map a few times.  There is this limit where you can only go into so many \"rooms\" total per day; but it was ~150 way back, and for me that was ~3hrs playtime.  In other words, way more than I needed on a given day.  And you can just swap characters if you need a little more fun :)\n\nThe worst thing I experienced (which isn't bad) was that they seemed to have ramped up the XP generation and reduced the dungeon difficulty to make it \"more new player friendly\".

Not to mention the cost of entry for all content is that there is necessarily a need for buffer characters, which in of itself has an insane cost to fund. I wish the endgame content wasn't so formulaic like every other Korean MMO (and to some degree the genre of gacha-style MMOs as a whole). \nOh well, spent like 80 bucks in the nearly 2k hours I've played over 3 years.

It's a beat'em up game in mmo form so you fight in a side scrolling world while having the large amount of skills that you'd have in a mmorpg game. Even ctrl and alt are skill buttons for default.  If you love beat'em games you'll definitely find enjoyment in this, however one major thing considering the country of origin. They love to prevent players for playing long periods of time and or charge you to continue you playing. This game uses a energy meter similar to a mobile game. You run dungeon instances and lose \"Fatigue points\" until you hit zero. once that happens you aren't allowed to play any more dungeons unless you somehow have restore potions that are allowed a few uses daily and reset on daily reset (obviously). People have had many issues with the game but if you download (it takes a long time so be prepared) and don't run into any problem you should be fine to go forward. this Fatigue feature is probably the worst thing ever stopping players from doing everything they want in one game session. If they somehow think about removing it and fix the other issues people have with the game it could easily jump 30% in positive rating.

As of late August/early September, DFO received a new game director who actually plays the game and understood how bad the state of the game was. Most if not everything addressed here in the review was brought up to Neople's internal management and are slowly being fixed over time. Please understand that at the time of this review in late July, things were horrible. I sincerely hope to give this game another try when everything comes, but for now take this review as being slightly outdated.\n\n[h1]What Makes DFO Great[/h1]\n\nGameplay and dungeon mechanics such as making the difficulty single-player based is great. You\u2019ll find plenty to do if all you want to do is figure out which class is for you.\n\n[h1]Neutral Grounds[/h1]\n\n\"The real game begins at endgame\u201d as well as constant FOMO events that prolong your playtime via AFK. Want best rewards? Play 3 hours. Generic schlock.\n\n[h1]The Stupid[/h1]\n\nEndgame content is boring, and I mean it. The level 100 cap makes Genshin Impact\u2019s grind appealing, because if you\u2019re seriously that unlucky you\u2019re gonna be spending an upwards of 1 year to even fully gear yourself out with no alternatives. It\u2019s so mind-numbingly dumb how the most reliable way to get gear is both time and resource locked, with only a 10% chance of dropping one item from a pool of 120+ epics. Fatigue in this game is a joke.\n\nThis game is Pay-to-Win. Call it for what it is. If you want long-term investments, such as pets, auras, avatars, or titles - the latter of which will provide you with very important stat and skill boosts -  and wish to obtain it through in-game money, good luck. The economy of the game is in shambles, where titles and avatars cost millions of dollars, upwards of 200 million for some classes. Do you want to know how much you can earn every day? Supposing you get a routine down, you will gain an upwards of 10 million a day, provided you have 12 - 16 hours of your life to spare, or you can spend 12 - 16 seconds swiping your credit card for 20x the gains.\n\nThe community is their favorite word they love throwing around: Trash. [b]These people are brainlet meta-slaves who only see the top 0.1% and want to follow them to a T, and anything less is \u201ctrash\u201d or \u201cgarbage\u201d to them[/b]. Guilds in this game don\u2019t even alleviate it, sometimes they even purposefully encourage it. They\u2019re a complete joke, to the point where this can\u2019t even be a parody. Wearing great gear but not best-in-slot? Trash. Playing a class not within Top 20 Meta? Trash. Obtain something that\u2019s good but not the best? Trash. Even old content from 5 levels prior needs absolute meta gear to do. For instance, one level 95 raid where the best in slot epics back then are equivalent in power to the level 100 legendary-tier items, they no longer cut it. [b]You now need level 100 epics to even do the hard mode of a level 95 raid.[/b] Remember what I said about the economy a paragraph earlier? It\u2019s mandatory you\u2019re seen with these items, otherwise you\u2019re not getting into a party. The community demands 2 second kills, rather than 20 second kills. At this rate you aren\u2019t even playing the game. You can\u2019t even disable global chat, you\u2019re forced to see this stupidity every day. The block list only has a max capacity of 100 people, and even then you\u2019re still gonna see idiots. At one point, one person was whining like a child about how the game was unfun, their favorite classes were non-meta, and this went on for 30 minutes in guild chat. They refused to take a break or quit, only opting to whine every time something inconvenienced him. They were also toxic, calling everybody who didn\u2019t know about something noobs, and told everybody to suck it. They weren\u2019t kicked because they single-handedly carried the guild in contribution. And this was one of the tamer guilds. [b]TL;DR: This community destroys IQ. They\u2019re all smooth brains.[/b]\n\nThis game\u2019s identity is in an existential crisis. While at base it has beat-em-up DNA, the devs dictated they needed to fit in MMORPG-styled classes. There are 3 classifications. Pure DPS are essentially straightforward damage dealers, Synergy DPS are party supports in which they\u2019ll provide extra damage or benefits to the team while being able to deal damage, and Buffers are as the name implies. The downside of this is that the party system is absolutely curved in such a way that if you want to duo with a friend, one of them must be a Buffer. In solo play, it\u2019s scaled to 1 person. In duo play, it\u2019s scaled 133% harder, rather than 33%, meaning that you need to be overgeared for the dungeon to properly do damage, unless you have a Buffer, because a Buffer enables you to have stats equivalent to 3x your normal. You need to be doing the equivalent of 4x the effort compared to solo. You are also expected to play a Buffer and treat it with as much effort as you would your main, meaning you must gear them equally as much as your main instead of treating it as your alt.\n\nThe game has \u201csell\u201d runs. I\u2019m well aware that certain games have people who sell dungeon runs, but the difference here is that DFO has no queue system to bypass buying dungeon runs. If you want to join a fast party, you must pay them to take you, and even then there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019re taken. Combine that with the prior paragraph, it\u2019s a disaster. If the \u201cseller\u201d doesn\u2019t see you with appropriate gear, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re willing to pay 3x more, they\u2019ll take somebody else. To accentuate how ignorant the community is, how they proceed to sell runs are on the scale of wannabe capitalists. They have a saying too. \u201cIf you are not a seller, you are a customer\u201d. You are just a commodity. A source of money to them. You think being in a guild will give you free carries? Nope, they\u2019ll still ask you pay them for the effort.\n\nClass favoritism exists. Female Slayers get all the attention of the devs, because they are both waifu material and overpowered. While most of my time was spent on them because of the natural flow that I like in classes, even I could tell this is not how I should only be playing. In Korea, the 62nd class is the Blade, which is the 5th subclass of the Female Slayer. [b]Her launch event contained free epics and a free mythic of your choice while the rest of the playerbase, over the course of the 100 cap still struggle with finding epics/mythics of their desires, and don't even get so much as a single scrap to transfer over.[/b] Meanwhile some classes such as the Male Grappler are so underpowered that despite being fun, nobody plays them because they\u2019re suboptimal from a lack of meaningful damage or poor resource management. What madness is this?\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis is a hard skip unless you wanna see how bad the game is, or just want to play for the class fantasies. Look at my time. I spent 1,200 hours and I never interacted with anybody because they\u2019re all stupid. I made it to endgame, did raids solo, and it was the most hollow experience there ever was. Neople\u2019s future projects, including a 2.5D Remake of this game + Project BBQ, the 3rd person Action RPG of DFO, don\u2019t exactly spark hype if they want to run this game so far into the ground it found a home in China.\n\nYou are better off playing Guide/Squad mode difficulty the entire time than dealing with a community this dumb. Better yet, coming full circle, just play Genshin Impact if you want a better experience solo and multiplayer.\n\nI\u2019m only giving this an extended amount of time for the Blade, who is likely not coming until 2022. But after that, it\u2019s straight to the uninstall and remove from account bin.\n\nP.S. If you play on Steam and get unlucky, Neople bans your account under the assumption you're a bot. If you wish to appeal, you're waiting an entire month for a response.

Isn't it just with other players?\"\nWrong.\nYour inventory gets filled up and you can't destroy useless items, because trade restriction also limits your ability to discard \"valuable\" items. \nMany quests require \"cubes\", materials you obtain from disassembling. YOU CAN'T DISASSEMBLE TO DO THOSE QUEST.\nThis includes key quests like unlocking certain equipment slots or, from what I've heard, one of the Anton quest that's required, from a Reddit post 2 years ago?\nYou are literally barred from progression, not just mildly inconvenienced.\nUntil this is resolved, this game is playable, but hilariously insidious in its treatment of you.\n\nWorst part of all this is, if you didn't know and you charged CENA?\nYOU CAN'T SPEND THE MONEY YOU CHARGED THE GAME WITH BECAUSE OF THIS TRADE RESTRICTION.\nIT'S A LITERAL FUCKING SCAM.\n\nGive me my old DFO back.\n\nUpdate after 2 weeks:\nThe trade restriction has been lifted and I played for about 2 weeks or so.\nThe game just isn't very good right now.\nAll those memories I had about various bosses and area are now just filler contents; Nothing below max level matters anymore.

Unlike KDNF, you will have to wait a long time to start a dungeons and raids.\nMostly waiting for a buffer to join. You will see a lot of party titles : ' Looking for a Sader '\nSo i always have something like youtube playing next to dfo.\n\nThis game is pay to win. \nYes, you can do the events and get gears, items, +12weap, rare avas, emblems everything. But those events are only held once a while. \nTo get minimum requirements to do final content, it will take you months. \n\nFatigue system. You can only play your character 150~290+pot fatigue points - (1~2 hours of play time). \nMeaning, you have to create many characters to actually enjoy this game.  Which conflicts with Second statement - this game is pay to win -\nMore characters = more gold you gonna need.\n\nDesync/lag : IDK if the server is unstable or it's individual player's internet connection or both, but there are a LOT of disconnecting issues when you play with people. \nEither screen turns black and someone disappears -making the dungeon harder to finish- or you just can't hit the monster cuz someone is lagging. \n\nTickets - late reply or not solving.\nI have submitted at least 10 tickets and none of them are solved correctly.\nFor example, i was banned for 3 days for using a mechanical keyboard. \nI know for sure, it was the new keyboard i got cuz i Never launch Any program when i play dfo. It's always been DFO / chrome or DFO / audio player. \nWhen  i got this new keyboard, it had some extra buttons like next song, stop song, turn on/off lights on the keyboard. Those were the only buttons i've used. \nFew days after i've used this keyboard, i was banned. \nI did not even install any programs related to the new keyboard and never plugged in 2nd USB port cuz i've never seen a keyboard w/2 usb male ports. \nSo, as conclusion, i was banned for using audio related buttons and light buttons on a new keyboard. \nWhen i submitted a ticket about this, i  explained every single details explaining i was banned for using 3rd program, i did not use any programs, i know for sure it was the new keyboard, can you investigate on this and un-ban me?\nThe reply i got was : \" you were banned for using 3rd program blah blah \"\nYea i already know that lol so can you investigate and help me understand?\n- still waiting on reply. \nWhen you submit a ticket, do not expect to get it solved. \n\nSo i have talked sh1t about this game and warned new incoming players.\nBut this game is fun overall. \n\nI am an old gamer, i started playing this game again cuz i played this game when i was young when nexon was in charge. Neople is doing much much better than nexon. \nIn fact, Nexon did not do anything with their games and eventually gave up. At the end, half of the players were using hacks.\nI still remember that Nexon sold Permanent Silenced TRGs, AKs on Sudden Attack only few weeks before shutting down the game. Shocking.\nNexon was trash.\nNeople on the other hand is doing something they should be doing even thou it's just copy and paste from KDFO and just translating it. I am ok with that. \nWhen you experience the worst, something normal is satisfying. \n\nI will keep playing dfo cuz for me it's still fun and i can manage the issues, \nbut if you are looking for a new game to play, you might wanna consider twice.\n\n\n\n\n\ube44\ucd94\ucc9c\n\uc0ac\ub78c\ub108\ubb34\uc5c6\uc5b4\uc11c \ubc84\ud37c\ub09c \uc2ec\ud568\n\uc11c\ubc84 \u3148\uac19\uc740\uac74\uc9c0 \uac1c\uc778\uc778\ud130\ub137\ubb38\uc81c\uc778\uc9c0 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\uc774\ub77c \uc5ec\uae30\uc800\uae30\uc11c \ud574\uc11c \uadf8\ub7f0\uac74\uc9c0 \ud560\ud2bc \ub809 \uc790\uc8fc\ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568\n\uccad\ucd95?\uac08\ucd95? \ud0a4\ubcf4\ub4dc \ucca8\uc368\ubd24\ub294\ub370 \uba87\uc77c\ud6c4 \ubc34\ub2f9\ud568. \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ubc84\ud2bc \ub20c\ub7ec\uc11c \uadf8\ub7f0\uac70\uac19\uc740\ub370 \uadf8\uac78 \ubd88\ubc95 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ud568.\n\ud55c\uad6d\ub358\ud30c\ub294 1\uc77c\uc548\uc5d0 \ubb38\uc81c \ub123\uc73c\uba74 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc8fc\uc9c0? \u3145\u3142 \uc5ec\uae34 \uba87\uc8fc\uac00 \uae30\ubcf8\uc774\uace0 \uac00\ub054 \ube68\ub9ac\ud574\uc8fc\ub294\ub370 \uadf8\ub0e5 \uc790\ub3d9\ub2f5\ubcc0\uac19\uc74c. \ud574\uacb0\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc560\uae30\ud574\uc90c. \uc5b4\uca4c\ub780\uac74\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\uc74c.\n\u3145\u3142\uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\uc774\ub2c8 \uc544\uc9c1\uc0b4\uc544\uc788\uc9c0 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub530\uc704\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ud588\uc73c\uba74 \uc9c0\uae08 \uba54\uc774\ud50c\uaf34\ub0a8\n\uadf8\ub7f0\ub370\ub3c4 2\ucc9c\uc2dc\uac04\ud55c \ub0b4\uc778\uc0dd \ub808\uc804\ub4dc..", "timestamp_created": 1620153035, "timestamp_updated": 1620154034, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694416821002960205", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91260377": {"recommendationid": "91260377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072602961", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2593, "last_played": 1638052248}, "language": "english", "review": "Never gotten to endgame before.

It's fun and has a lot of customization and beautifully animated skills to use.  There's three simple points I want to give to new players though.\n\n1. Trade bans happens to all new Steam players (for whatever reason) and it usually only lasts a week or so. If you care that much about it, just download the official client instead. \n\n2. There is 50+ classes in this game. Try every single class. They're all incredibly unique, and many have been unexpectedly fun for me. Don't just \"pick a main because he looks cool\" or because you were too lazy to make alts. You might end up hating that characters play-style. Pick a class based on how they play not appearance. You're in for a long ride, so have fun with it. Make alt characters as much as you can so you can mess around with everything.\n\n3. This game is NOT PAY 2 WIN. IT'S PAY FOR CONVENIENCE. Seriously, the amount of idiots that wasted $100 on something they didn't understand, or don't make alt chars is astounding. You can NOT buy gear that is worthwhile directly anyway, you simply use in-game gold to refine/enhance gears. Every single thing in this game can be gotten by simply playing the dungeons. RNG is king, so if you don't get a full set of epic gear in one week, that's normal. Some people are lucky, some are even unluckier than you. It doesn't matter anyway, you aren't meant to stick to one character.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1616305298, "timestamp_updated": 1616305298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687775850296020508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88804216": {"recommendationid": "88804216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061884070", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1487, "last_played": 1483712694}, "language": "english", "review": "Good mmo back then.", "timestamp_created": 1616295525, "timestamp_updated": 1616295525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498945504426956177", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88778488": {"recommendationid": "88778488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872920741", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2589, "last_played": 1630859589}, "language": "english", "review": "super fun", "timestamp_created": 1616260696, "timestamp_updated": 1616260696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498945504426956177", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88721938": {"recommendationid": "88721938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166671772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1618660330}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a well crafted Beat 'Em Up, not a fan of the micro-transactions but the Game-play is SOLID.", "timestamp_created": 1616180129, "timestamp_updated": 1616180129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498945504426956177", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88683134": {"recommendationid": "88683134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130766671", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 2042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2042, "last_played": 1500371833}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Increible mierd\u00f3n", "timestamp_created": 1616121283, "timestamp_updated": 1616121283, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88638218": {"recommendationid": "88638218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280863803", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1616092561}, "language": "english", "review": "4 hours of downloading and BOOM, BANNED ?

This is due to steam having more issues than neople's game client and because of random bans to people.\n\nNow onwards with the review.\n\nDFO is a mmo beat em up in which you go through dungeons killing enemies, picking up loot, leveling classes, and learning poweful skills. The game has over 50 classes, so you can certainly have a class to play. My personal advise: PLAY WHAT YOU THINK IS COOLER. Everything does well on endgame and the only class that you will use sooner or later is Crusader (Female or male), so just take a look at the classes, see which one catches your eye and then go dungeon clearing.\n\nThe graphics are pretty ok and make the game suitable for low spec gamers. I used to play it in a very old laptop so there you have it. Audiowise, music is good and dialogue is in korean since its a korean mmo. Animated scenes have their own volume setting too. Gameplay wise, is like any other mmo. You get skills, you get a skill bar, you got consumables, you got classes. You can customize your skill hotkeys and other things like profession for example. You can also add hotkeys for centering the loot all in one place (only once per dungeon) and to unstuck yourself. \n\nOne thing I don't like that much is that TP (another type of skill points) are tied to a few pvp quests and that can be a huge downer for someone who doesnt like to pvp, Fspit and Ffighter need to do pvp quest to acces higher tier stuff so that was surprising the first time I saw it. Just note that the game is still pretty much alvie because fo the pvp and the upcoming fighting game. However PVP and PVE are not the same. PVP has a lot of technicalities like how to chain proper combos to abuse of aerial on your adversary. So dont stress yourself If you are suffering from the pvp questline or because you pvp and get obliterated by a sword.\n\nOverall, I've played the game on the game client before (a lot actually, used to be a Fspit main and swap to a sader main because I liked the class), and now I'm playing it in the steam client because I changed laptops and just to have it on my steam library as a reminder of the fun times I used to have.

You have not heard of this game mainly because many of its player base is from the East. \n \n\n[h1]On to the review:[/h1]\nI do not recommend this game on steam but [b]I highly suggest checking it out through their official client.[/b] With its newer brothers on the horizon (Project BBQ and DnF Duel) it will be worth to check out and learn the lore before the new games come out. This MMO is very niche, not everyone likes side scrollers or pixelated graphics. Check it out you might like it. \n \nThe game is a lot of fun doing flashy combos in multiple different dungeons with the 16 different classes in the game and 63 different advancements (Not including their 1st, 2nd, and NEO Awakenings which are just upgrades), the game is an eastern MMO meaning of course classes are gender locked but there are male and female equivalents for except 6 classes in the game and some advancements are not duplicated for its male or female equivalent this could be a plus or a negative for some players. There is no character customization upon creating a character which is a bummer, but gear will change your look same with cosmetic cash shop items which are mediocre at best. \n \nThe gameplay in my personal experience gets boring mainly because side scrollers are not entirely my cup of tea what makes up for the boring gameplay is the class you play; flashy skills animations carry this game it looks great with this art style. The lore in DFO is solid I am not a big story person even more in MMO's but DFO did not disappoint me with its lore I suggest trying it when playing the game and search up more about the story it has a lot of potential and hopefully its subsidiary does its justice when it releases. I did not socialize personally in DFO but I have not seen the chat move with conversations like other games I cannot give my opinion but parties, trading, emails, and guilds do exist. \n \nThere is a fatigue system I personally see this as a plus because it gives me reason to take break for the day, early on when your power leveling it will slow you down but once you play the game longer the more it gets brushed off. Early on the game feels a little bit outdate and boring but it starts getting better after you choose your sub class (In most occasions, some classes have extremely difficult or boring early games). The late makes up for the early game the animations are flashy enough to keep my attention as I said before but make sure you learn the game early on or you are going to have a rough time if you rush through, oh and there is a lot of events to help players. \n \n[h1]Is it Pay to Win?[/h1]\nShort Answer: Yes | Long Answer: [b]No[/b] \nThe reason the short answer is yes is mainly because when you pay in DFO, you pay to save time just like in games like BDO its more of a convenience or speed up factor and it also includes luck meaning a lot of it is RNG based (So you could lose money). To the extent that to get a return of \"investment\" you will need to spend thousands (This is regard of getting Epic gear, Legendary and Unique is more than enough to participate in end-game content).

Sin duda \n\u00bfEs un MMOBeat 'em up? Tambi\u00e9n\n\u00bfEs divertido? Mucho\n\nSi no te lo tomas como un segundo trabajo (cosa cl\u00e1sica de estos juegos coreanos) es MUY divertido. Es el MMO en el que m\u00e1s me ha gustado el sistema de clases y subclases: 16 y 59 respectivamente. Grosso modo, puedes jugar entre otras cosas, como boxeador, bruja, mago, inquisidor, caballero, invocador, ingeniero, asesino, francotirador, samurai, luchador de lucha libre e incluso puedes ir de Naruto por la vida (Kunoichi, puedes sacar hasta un sapo gigante) o Goku (Nen Master, con kames y todo). La cantidad de clases es absurda. \n\nEl juego es flashy as fuck, pero literal. Esto quiere decir que si eres fotosensible est\u00e1s jodido (la guinda ser\u00eda que se pudiera rebajar el nivel de destellos). Hay una cantidad abrumadora de habilidades que van escalando en nivel de absurdez hasta el punto en que algunos finishers parecen invocaciones del Final Fantasy. \n\nTiene un modo historia realmente largo, tiene raids y tiene PVP. Como el nivel m\u00e1ximo de personaje es 100 y hay puntos de fatiga que te capan cuanto puedes jugar a diario con un mismo personaje (just korean things), hay juego para rato. \n\nCosas malas:\n\n- Los personajes son cl\u00f3nicos, cambiando solo la apariencia de las armas (y evidentemente seg\u00fan la clase que hayas cogido). Si quieres ir a lo \"fashion DFO\" te toca apoquinar pasta o gastar divisas muy limitadas que obtienes jugando. \n\n- No tiene compatibilidad directa con gamepad. Hay gente que ha hecho algunos apa\u00f1os para poder jugarlo pero es durillo de configurar. Una pena porque le vendr\u00eda como anillo al dedo. Al final te acostumbras al teclado pero que vas a aporrear todas las teclas como un descerebrado cuando empieces a jugar, es un hecho. Todos con artrosis de aqu\u00ed a un tiempo. \n\n- Nunca he tenido problemas de conexi\u00f3n pero solo nos toca (en occidente) dos servidores, ambos en Am\u00e9rica. Podr\u00eda darle problemas a alguien. \n\n- Tiene un sistema anti-hacking dur\u00edsimo hasta el punto en que mucha gente se ha visto baneada o con las capacidades de tradeo/crafting capadas sin raz\u00f3n aparente pero que suele ser fruto de programas de terceros/overlays que dan falsos positivos. Esto quiz\u00e1s sea la peor parte ya que te obliga a abrir un ticket (en ingl\u00e9s) al servicio t\u00e9cnico y esperar a que te respondan. \n\n\nNo es un juego perfecto pero es divertido y es \u00fanico en su clase, no hay un MMO igual. Si te interesa pru\u00e9balo que es gratis. \n", "timestamp_created": 1609229494, "timestamp_updated": 1609229494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597156405448913574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83453919": {"recommendationid": "83453919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799666302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 655, "last_played": 1695338993}, "language": "english", "review": "Great dungeon crawling side scroller wish there where more free customization options that didnt require premium currency", "timestamp_created": 1609221925, "timestamp_updated": 1609221925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83453345": {"recommendationid": "83453345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179985903", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1631566041}, "language": "english", "review": "Lets just get this out of the way... all new people are playing this cuz of the fighting game like i am :)\n\nI expected worse, the graphics are inconsistent and kinda stinky, then combine mmo mechanics with a custom skill based combo system and it seems like alot at first, and the fact that keyboard is mandatory for a beat em up.\n\nBUT once you get used to it its pretty fun gonna vibe here for a while till the new fighting game, which hopefully has alot of these cool mechanics :)", "timestamp_created": 1609221223, "timestamp_updated": 1609221322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575240910053253174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83442213": {"recommendationid": "83442213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242150476", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 853, "last_played": 1609302981}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1609208798, "timestamp_updated": 1609208798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83440302": {"recommendationid": "83440302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408918017", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1639941346}, "language": "english", "review": "Most of my play time has gone like this.

I love the game genre, and I've played this game for many years.  That said, this game is an absolute tragedy.  \n   \n   Some of the good: The diversity of class mechanics are super fun, and awakening usually makes classes even funner.  The graphic, though dated, have particular charm to them for those like myself who like old school Arcade games.  Combat is super sharp and responsive, and overall just feels good.  Unlike the older days a respec for your character no longer cost $18 a pop, and can be done anytime, as many times as you want.  Getting an upgrade on your equipment is super impactful and feels great to be OP for a little while.\n   \n   The rest of the bad: This game definitely has no shortage of short comings, and I don't really feel like I have all day to name them all, so I just go though some of the more glaring ones.  Starting off with the most obvious issue that white knights will defend out of ignorance is the Fatigue point system.  It's basically a game play limiter a kin to many mobile games. Many of my friends stop playing because of this, and so did an imperial crap-ton of players. Imagine if a game like Diablo 3/4 did some shit like that. \"Hey I know your been enjoying the Barbarian class cus it's the only class you really enjoy, but you can either make another one and start over, play a different class you don't like, or just stop playing, sound good?\" I don't think Diablo 3 would even be running if they did that, but since a large portion of DFO players are dumb and irresponsible kids, they actually voted to keep FP when it made a return. \n\n   Next up is the most ridiculous rng, this is the shite that nightmare fuel is made of.  In short, you can play for a year straight and never even come close to completing an epic set, soooo hope you don't like progression THAT much.  Have fun trying to gear out all 10 to 20 or so of your characters for the rest of your life.  \n\n   I'm not even going to get into PVP really cus it's busted AF, and probably always will be.  \n\n   The cash shop is pretty abusable, and a bit predatory.  \n\n   Content feels kinda slow, so instead Neople just releases a new class every couples years or so, and it works like a charm. (kinda like Warframe except slower)  \n\n   And finally the cherry on this turd sundae is the customer service/support.

I guess it flags your account for some reason? Also this is highly enjoyable with a friend, but being a solo player is still fine.\n\nAnyway on to the actual game review.\nPvE\nDFO pre-neople had fun combos that felt very fluid and let you really smack around any mob that wasnt rooted to the floor and Im happy to say that it is still just that. Knowing your skills and getting to infinitely juggle a mob is pretty fun to me. I had well over 1000hrs on this game pre-neople because i loved the combat in it so much and as i already said, they havent really changed it. Instead i got to come back to many new class upgrades along with new skills that just got to make your combos flashy and have some really dope combo ending moves. The equipment is a grind to make sure you get good gear through various methods (hell mode, raids, events, etc . . .), but by doing the MSQ in the game you'll be properly equipped to get through it to max level. Unfortunately I cant comment on if the story itself is great because i beat it a while ago and my 20+ other characters i have were just rushed through it to get their class skills and whatnot. The \"early game\" is rather boring because it feels pretty watered down compared to pre-neople and from what ive seen thats not just my opinion as a pre-neople player. In the beginning a lot of your skills are going to do a ton of damage and you'll wipe rooms of mobs in probably 10-20 seconds (Including the bosses), but once you get past level 40 it starts to pick up and the enemies become sturdier, but they're still not very challenging (I just wanted to mention this because the game does pick up and getting to level 40-50 is very easy by just doing the msq, If an event is going you can accomplish this in a day. If there's no event, but you're burning your FP gauge everyday itd probably take 3 days). After that you'll reach the meat of the game with your awakening for your class giving you your first ULT skill and you'll have plenty of class specific skills to play around with. \n\nSide Note* the game feels like a ghost town in lower level areas. I dont know if the PB is dwindling or if there's a lack of new players in general, but most of the lower levels you'll encounter are just alts for people who already have a stacked level 90-100 character. Please do not let that push you away as i really like the game and would love to have new players running around as i level alts. Helping is always fun.\n\nPvP\nPre-neople the reason i had over 1000 hrs was because of pvp. If any returning player saw this post and actually decided to read it for some reason, they might recognize my OG soul reaper name \"RadiantGhost\". I was constantly in lobbies pvping everyone i could. The reason i bring this up is because this is really my only critique that i have towards the game now. I used to love DFO's pvp, so when i returned on its relaunch day and got my soul reaper back to level 50 i immediately hopped into the pvp channels. got to play a few games and it felt . . . different. It didnt feel as smooth as it was before and honestly it made me angry enough to stop doing it since.

Taking a look it seems all the negative reviews are pointing towards how accounts linked to steam are getting banned due to I think chinese bots? ok... I sent a ticket in, next day I get a reply stating my account was engaged into abnormal activities. I'm thinking whatever must be due to steams issue. My account was only suspended for 1 day. One day past and I'm excited to get back on thinking it was just a steam thing no go. So I'm trying to google and I come across reddit posts stating to go on there discord and talk with \"community advisors\" if your ticket has NOT been FOLLOWED UP. I spoke with one very professional (users name was \"Forte\" at the time) and got back to me with quick replies. I do appreciate you btw thank you. Now it just turns that my account was hacked along time ago possibly due to \"chinese bots\" and is now perm banned instead of one day suspension (which already past). So like I'll accept the ban because on the account I was trying to sign in with I'm pretty sure I didn't put time in that much compared before the pre-neople.

Each time there's a problem and I'm never able to actually start the game. At first the only thing stopping me was creating an account which is easy but the problem about it was when I clicked to check that I made an account, the button I was suppose to press did nothing at all. So I did the alternative log in through steam. Next was that the global support needs to check my account. I don't get why this is a thing but it is very annoying. Maybe it's because I turned of steam guard for 5 seconds and have to turn it back on which is a pain but I guess that's my doing. I waited the next day for a response because it was taking a while to verify that I was real and just a few minutes after this review was posted I got into the launcher cause on an email it said I was allowed to play now.

Erm wait, the \"Play\" button is greyed out. There is a message bellow that a login on the DFO site is required.\nFine, I linked my Steam account to the DFO account, verified the Email and ... Surprise! The \"Play\" button is still greyed out. Another message appears now:  \n\n\"Your account must be reviewed by our support team before you can log in. Please send a ticket by clicking on the link bellow.\"\n\nAllright, I am patient, lets contact the support via ticket and ask for ... support.\nTicket was raised and ... nothing. No reaction from the support, no changes in the launcher after one day. At this point I decided to uninstall the game\n\nSo what do we have so far? \n\nAwesome, already 1.2 hours playtime and I had not the chance to play the game a single time. \nThe login in the launcher does not work automatically. \nI guess, the port between Steam and DFO does not work as intended.\nContacting the Neople support makes me feel there is no support. \nI put some time and effort into this project and the result was ... waste of time. \nAbout the game: I can not really review this game, maybe its good who knows. \nProbably DFO would work, after direct registration on the homepage (without Steam), but I am not in mood for this.

The Fatigue system is basically a time limit on how long you can play that specific character that day, run enough dungeons to drain your fatigue and you can't play that character anymore until daily reset unless you have a hold of a fatigue potion that can restore some points.

They \"deactivate\" the account and assure \"your personal information is safe\".  This is explicitly ILLEGAL in both the USA and S. Korea, according to the e-CFR and PIPA respectively, so they have no excuse.\n\nTwo, subsequently, you won't be able to unlink the account associated with your Steam account.  They refuse to unlink it; they'll just \"deactivate\" it.  So you won't be able to play.\n\nThree, in their Privacy Policy they explicitly state they reserve the right to scan your computer for \"malicious software\".  It still puts up false flags that plague Steam users to this day, obvious privacy concerns aside.\n\nShady, shady company.  Steer clear if you care about privacy.\n\n*~~~~~~~~*\n\nYou cannot use your Neople account on the Steam version.  This means you need to create a fresh account to play on Steam.\n\nNot a problem for me, I wanted a fresh account.  I go on my Neople account, change the main email address on there, and try to use the main email to verify my Steam account.\n\nDoesn't work.  Now both the original email and the new email I swapped my Neople account to cannot be used.\n\nSo I message support to get it fixed.  No response, but a day later my Steam account has been \"Blocked by an administrator.\"  (This issue has been in the Steam version for months.

After playing the tutorial and taking a look at the skills, I learned about the Diva subclass where all you do is grapple enemies. OK.

This is made even better by the fact that most bosses aren't immune to grabs, so you can string together a series of suplexes and slams until you disintegrate your enemies into a mass of indescribable matter.\n\nStory is whatever, translations are trash, voice acting is all Korean, the cash shop is disgusting, nobody likes to talk, but honestly who cares about those things. The controls are solid, there are tons of levels, the graphics are nice, and you can break down your enemies into their base elemental components via piledrivers and guillotine drops.\n\nDo yourself a favor and at least try it.

And depending on your class or goals, you may desperately need cera. Be warned that if you play through Steam, there is a high chance to be banned, trade-locked, or purchase-locked for no reason. Play through the official site if you will be playing. \n2)  The game security requirements are ridiculous. I am sitting here with my phone in my hand because I receive a password on my phone every time I want to log in or unlock item that I want to sell. They don\u2019t discriminate between the Chinese market and US market and apply the same bs rules for purchasing and account security based on all the scams stemming from China.\n3) The game runs heavy and is WAY too big for a 2D game. There is a lot, roughly 1/3rd, of \"dead content\" that is not employed by anyone and serves no purpose because it's outdated. The materials and gear dropped from those dungeons are useless, therefore they should have been removed once they became so outdated instead of allowing the game to be so heavy (and those dungeons also confuse new players and waste your time).\n4)  A large portion of your success depends on relentless grind on mini-games inside the main game. By mini-games, imagine tetris or snake-like games, which reward you gear, pets, avatars, and materials. You are free to pass on those, but you will fall behind significantly compared to other people because those games offer great benefits.\n5)  Updates are too often, every two weeks (religiously), and are mostly dedicated to the aforementioned mini-games, which are changed with a new one with every update (these are so called \"events\"). Those updates sometimes take up to 30 min to finish and if your connection just gets a tiny disturbance - the launcher shuts down on you and you need to start all over.\n6)  New players will mandatory be completely lost. Your only guide in this game is the first 5 min to learn to punch, jump, and move with arrows. Disassembling, extracting, refining, amplifying, enchanting, compounding, alchemy, puppeteering,  avatar dying, gear retexturing, level range for party, at what level bellow you creatures stop giving exp, what are the pros and cons of all those 60 classes \u2013 all things for you to figure out the hard way.\n7)  All female characters\u2019 appearances are bland and technically the same thing \u2013half naked, pale young girls. There is really no armor or even remote resemblance to warriors or toughness in any of them.\n8)   The repair system is merciless. Get hit 3 times and spend 20k gold on repairs, thus ending up the dungeon on a loss. It doesn't make sense that durability fix from 38 to 40 cost like 15k gold.\n\nPositives:\n\n1)\tYou are allowed to create many characters on the same account, so you won\u2019t be limited if you want to try many classes.\n2)\tCommunity on Discord is very helpful.\n3)\tGraphics that will satisfy retro-seeking experience similar to beat them-up arcade games.\n4)\tSome end game boss fights are similar to old Nintendo bosses where you need to figure out their gimmicks and pattern before you can effectively tackle them, which make it a similar and nostalgic experience.\n5)\tI myself have not experienced major bugs or glitches. I lost materials twice, for whatever reason, but I was compensated by the administration.\n6)\tThere is satisfying amount of things to do once you reach max level \u2013 farm materials and gold, beat top level bosses, develop your explorer club, collect max level character classes, level up your profession, grow your guild, level up your rank.\n7)\tSkill reset is free.", "timestamp_created": 1577404066, "timestamp_updated": 1577404378, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571458816528320313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60586086": {"recommendationid": "60586086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015772021", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1577409131}, "language": "english", "review": "so i got banned without having never played the game.", "timestamp_created": 1577357897, "timestamp_updated": 1577357897, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613295495510101318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60580276": {"recommendationid": "60580276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383458252", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1179, "last_played": 1657605980}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, I played the first version of this game when it came out like maybe 8 years ago before the game got shut down, so it's nice to see a newer updated version of a game that I really ended up loving when I was in elementary school. <3 This version of the game is very well done, and the plot just keeps on giving, so I personally would 100% recommend this game to anyone.", "timestamp_created": 1577349510, "timestamp_updated": 1577349510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60540990": {"recommendationid": "60540990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078067187", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 250970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3119, "playtime_at_review": 6877, "last_played": 1700789891}, "language": "english", "review": "Hardcore Pay to Win... \nSome necessary staffs can only be obtained through real money (mostly above 30$)\nalternatively you can try to buy one of these several items through trade with other players using ingame currency.

(Day one) The game is Definitely a RNG Korean style grinding MMO. For those of you who don't know what that is, you will spend weeks into months GRINDING at end game. That is the con of this game. The pro is that there are tons of classes and each has 3-4 subclasses inside that are unique to the class. They definitely is a huge variety for every play style. It is F2P but P2progress/win sort of. It uses a stamina based system which for you MMO junkies means you will have to stop eventually. But I find this game addicting and it helps me limit my time so I can have a real life. Worst case scenario, you make alts (you can have up to like 20+ so if you don't want to stop, you don't have to.) Events are rampant in this game and some (as of currently) super boost a lv 1 character to end game in just 3 days with all end game gear. This saves literal months of grinding. (Kind of a cheap out if you ask me because my main isn't even close to my new characters gear...<_<... BUT HEY, now i can use my \"alt main\" to grind items for my main to gear up faster!) PvP is fun but can be frustrating as it is a P2P connection. PvE to level is mind numbingly easy with end game content being challenging where you do have to learn fights and what to look out for as most bosses will one shot you regardless of gear. Overall, a grindy, unique sidescrolling combat game that has been my serious, and casual MMO that I have enjoyed seeing evolve into an actual good fleshed out game.

(PS: This takes around 30 minutes to complete!)\n\nAfter u got your full Harlem legendary set, u go for Epics, to get epics, u basicly upgrade your Harlem Legendaries into Epics by doing a dungeon called \"Dawning Crevice\", which u can do twice a day.... and you're done.\n\nSo basicly u do your daily dungeons on your main, and boom, you're done for the day! now do that for a couple months and u got full Epics!\n\nWait so you're limited on how much u can play? YES!\nYou can't just keep running dungeons over and over, do different dungeons for different goals? NOPE\n\nYou can however, do a dungeon called \"Operation Hope\" which u can do 3 times a day to get legendary gear pieces which are called \"Swap Set\" gear pieces, u can put these gear pieces in a seperate section of your gear, to buff your buff skill.\n\nSo after running that 3 times, you're basicly done again.\n\nNow the thing is with the Swap Set gear pieces, you equip them in a seperate section, but, they will still stay in your inventory, so u have a reason to purchase inventory slots...\n\n[b] Now on to Neo Premium: [/b]\nBasicly u want more than 156 FP, u can buy Neo Premium to up that number to 273 FP, but watch out, you got 2 different types of Neo Premium!\nOne of them is basicly useless and the other one gives the FP boost and some other decent things.\n\nSo u decide u actually like the game, and want to play more on each character by buying Neo Premium?\nRIP! u can't cous u first need to complete end-game content before your account will be unlocked and u can buy Neo Premium! CYA IN A FEW MONTHS OF PLAYING A COUPLE HOURS A DAY DOING THE SAME SHIT WHICH U COMPLETE IN ABOUT 2 HOURS A DAY!\n\n[b] More shit... [/b]\nDid I mention there's a chance your account gets banned right after u created it? Yep, that's right, your account has a chance of just getting banned right after creation for no reason when u play it on steam, then u gotta contact Neople's support, send in a ticket and wait for their response...\n\nAlso, u use spacebar or your left mouse button to talk to NPC's but apparently the spacebar is bugged sometimes and u gotta use the mouse click (80% of the time for me...), but there's a player in front of the NPC! well rip, go change channel so u can click on the NPC!\n\nHonestly, korean game developers mentallity of creating a game is so fcking unlogically weird to me.\n\nIt feels to me like they actually want to create an insanely good game, and then when the game is done, they are like WAIT!! first we add some insanely annoying mechanics, add a shit ton of limitations to the player, which they gotta pay for to stretch out a bit, and limit them on the amount of dungeons u can do daily not only cous of the FP system but also on the actual amount u can do the dungeons u gotta do to progress....\n\nI can keep going for hours on how much I love koreans games fundamentally, but just completely do NOT understand what goes on in the minds of these people when it comes to implementing these insanely annoying, P2W mechanics.\n\nTL;DR: This game is full of annoying mechanics, limitations and unlogical decisions made by the developer to grab some cash and lock the fun behind stupid P2W shit.\n\nI can actually keep going, but I geus this shit is long enough.... please don't play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1575816355, "timestamp_updated": 1575816355, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66947406530380249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59450303": {"recommendationid": "59450303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261434509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 63042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57606, "last_played": 1677895598}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1575754195, "timestamp_updated": 1575754195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611526072025299072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59415222": {"recommendationid": "59415222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427566874", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 27700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1678590096}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1575721241, "timestamp_updated": 1575721241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59397248": {"recommendationid": "59397248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252199710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1657032702}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Massive multiplayer RPG's with a uniqe Old school beat'em up feel to them, This Game has got you covered.\nFunny enough, I Played the heck out of this game when it was owned by a previous company.

Some stuff will feel dated, especially if you are a younger gamer, but there is a lot of polish to this game, and honestly its pretty painless to climb to max level. Ive been back 8 days and almost hit max level, which is where you will find most people grouping and raiding. Community is helpful (when i was streaming the chat had lots of advice).\n\nPROS:\nFast, Action-Oriented  Fighting/RPG Game Style\nAmazing Music Scores: electronic/rock style with occasional vocals.\nTons of replayability, lots of classes and perks to leveling multiple characters.\nVery Satisfying to pull off a lengthy combo on a boss mob.\n\nCONS:\nNot a big PVP Community if thats your thing, game is not balanced around it, but they did just host a yearly tournament I viewed, fun to watch.\nInitial learning curve can be daunting, ask for help on forums or check youtube.\nClunky UI, needs a major overhaul.\n\nVideo scaling leaves a lot to be desired, graphics desperately need higher resolutions for modern day gaming.\nLow level gameplay is fun to learn on, but no real challenges arise. The game is centered around reaching level 95, so you have time to practice a lot of your abilities and figure out your class while you grind to 95.\n\nPay-To-Win Shop. Honestly this doesn't bother me that much because this game is more about having fun reaching end game and polishing your character.  I haven't spent a dime but already am chomping at the bits to start lvl95 gameplay.\n\nNewer Classes are clearly favored over many older classes. Some are ridiculously overtuned and just dwarf their equivalent(i am still a newb so maybe someone can correct me, dark knight = best traits of all slayer classes?) for example.\n\nOverall I'm giving the game 3.5 out of 5. I think they can definitely make this game greater with all their income from the p2w shop, i know there has to be a lot of addicts forking over a small fortune on this game. Give the people the best possible product in 2019! Tune up older classes, polish up the UI and graphics, and maybe hire a few more folks so your not stuck on a endless cycle of just creating new end game content, classes, and items for your shop.\n\n-Cheers\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1574615887, "timestamp_updated": 1574615887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57727157": {"recommendationid": "57727157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067255407", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1574550256}, "language": "english", "review": "Banned me after one day.

With the latter being more important, but it takes so long to get gear it's almost pointless. Not to mention the needlessly complex the gearing has to be...just to be \"raid-worthy\".

Not to mention enhancements, and avatar emblem slots...easily another 10m. \n\nSo all together you're looking at about 50m+ for possible viable end game. Oh and need min +10 weapon which can cost you another 30m-50m alone. This is just the top of my head so I might be missing a few more things too. \n\nAll of this is for ONE character. The good thing, however, is that the devs have events on and off that helps to facilitate this process--so I'll give them that. Overall though, the community isn't \"elitist\" like most people think. There are just hard cut-offs and if you don't have (at minimum) what I just described, good luck getting into a decent group.\n\nLastly, the game is fairly dead, with scraps of active guilds here and there.

I came back after hearing about new classes and went to download the obscene number of files I needed for the update. After that, I booted the game and it loaded in a strange, off center position; the center of the screen for the game was in the lower right corner of my monitor. I shrugged it off; I had just downloaded a lot of stuff, so I figured it was just because if that. Trying to reboot it caused it to refuse to even load past the launcher; it just instantly shut off.\n\nThen a friend of mine contacted me on Steam and told me the game had become a virus. I went and checked my Malwarebytes and sure enough, it had kicked in just after I had given the go ahead to download the updates. So now the game won't start because the site it's connecting to to run it is registered as malware. Did they really allow this to happen to their game, or was it done on purpose by the company?\n\nI give this game a huge thumbs down. Do NOT try to install this or if you like me are coming back, don't even bother. If it's registering as malware (it didn't used to do this with the same software installed) then something's gone wrong.

The combat is fast-paced with the ability to cancel into attacks, cancel into back dashes to move into other attacks if necessary, great mobility skills on most classes and it's always satisfying to see the numbers fly across the screen and pull off a great combo and absolutely decimate a room or boss.\n\nPvP is very intense as well with great measures taken to level the playing field between all the classes. I can't say more about it than that however as PvP just isn't my cup of tea. \n\nIf you're a fan of \"big-number\" games like Maplestory or WoW (let's be honestly that's what it really is) or a fan of the old 2D pixelized graphics with addicting combat, you're missing out by not giving this game a try.\n\nFyi ~ my \"hours played\" means nothing, this isn't a paid review, I've always played directly through the launcher and never had a single problem with it.

No less than two full story revisions and the return of pre-Neople Arad as the start of the game.  What a ride.  Don't mind my Steam hours - I have to play on Neople's own launcher since the Steam version of the game won't allow me to access my primary account.  My history with the game dates back to 2013.\n\nFor those who aren't familiar with the game, DFO is a side-scrolling, sprite-based anime-themed, fantasy beat-'em-up MMO.  I know that's a mouthful, but bear with me.  If you're familiar with Golden Axe, and Final Fight, you've got a good idea of what the combat plays like.  On top of its, it has the levels, skill-tree-system, and randomly-generated loot of something akin to Diablo 2.  Combat is simple to understand but can be very complex to master.  Mastering the game's combat means understanding some fighting-game-esque terminology, such as invulnerability frames (animations in which you cannot be hit), super armor (an effect that prevents you from flinching due to being hit), knockdown immunity, juggle combos (knocking an enemy into the air and hitting them repeatedly before they can land and stand up again), grappling (grabbing attacks that defeat Super Armor and interrrupt attacks) and grapple immunity (enemies that due to their size, strength, or being rooted to the ground, cannot be grappled).  Most of this will be familiar to anyone who's played an arcade-style beat-'em-up game before or a fighting game, and even if it sounds daunting, it's not that hard to pick up with a little practice.  The game gives you a training ground to do that practice in, too, with a wide variety of customizable training dummies with different behaviors to familiarize yourself on.\n\nThus far, I've been impressed with the additions of the Male Mage, Agent, Knight, Thief, and Demonic Lancer.  In particular, I like that Male Mage avoids the class bias that has afflicted other gendered classes, in that none of his subclasses - with one exception - cleanly mirror his female counterpart.  As a result, it doesn't invite easy comparison between the two.  These easy comparisons are something which has led to long-time stigmas against classes that have clearly-superior versions in one gender or another.\n\nWhat I've not been impressed with is the fact that these gender biases have never been significantly addressed by Neople.  There are a number of classes where you are outright inferior than your counterpart, simply due to choice of gender.  Slayer, Fighter, Priest, and [i]particularly[/i] Gunner all suffer from this.  I really don't want these classes to be homogeneous - that would take away their unique identity.  I would like them to become comparably powerful but in unique ways, so that they don't invite such easy comparisons to one another.\n\nAnother big gripe I have is with the durability and repair system.  If you utilize cube skills heavily, or play a class that has to rapidly spam skills to reach peak effectiveness, your repair bills will be frankly obscene.  The entire end-card reward for a dungeon, as well as much of the gold you picked up during the dungeon or obtained by selling dungeon loot, can be eaten by repair bills, even if you haven't died or been hit much.  This punishes certain classes more than others, and forces them to deliberately play in subpar fashion just to avoid eating up all of their dungeon rewards with repair bills.  If you're on a class that isn't spammy and doesn't rely on cube skills to be effective, you're golden.\n\nIf you're a returning player from earlier in Neople's ownership of the game, chances are you're going to have to replay a lot of side quests that have been rolled into the mission system.  On the bright side, extra quest rewards, including free Halidom weapons (the replacement of old-school Legacy weapons).  On the not so bright side, you might have to retread some ground.  The progress of scenario quests has been kinda heavily abridged and reworked; these days, you'll typically spend less than seven runs in any given dungeon.  That could be good or bad depending on how you look at it - on one hand, the story suffers a bit from moving so fast, on the other hand, a lot of the early-game grind is flat-out gone.\n\nSpeaking of the new storyline, it's probably not important to a lot of people, but aside from its abridging, I like where it goes.  The Four Blademasters, the most common APC helpers you're given during the story, aren't the overpowering supercharacters they were previously - you can realistically expect to keep up with them in a fight if you play well.  It helps present the image that you stand with them as an equal, instead of just being a bystander while they save the day.  The story itself seems to reinforce this a lot too.  There's more exploration of the Metastasis and the Mirror World in this version, and they're a lot more clear on what the Metastasis actually [i]is[/i] this time around.  That said, the writing could use just a bit of polish - or at least a good copy editor.  I don't know if it's a problem with translating Korean pronouns or what, but the game frequently mis-genders minor charactes, and is sometimes inconsistent on character's titles or names.  It's minor, but a little bit irksome to me.\n\nIf you liked old Nexon DFO, but hate that they summarily got rid of old Arad and Hendon Myre, or you played Neople DFO but hated how indecisive they were about the nature of the Metastasis, the Apostles, and the world beyond the Black Nightmare, or you hated the early-game grind of either of the previous versions, you'll probably enjoy the game a lot more now.  If you preferred either of the original stories, or hate it when stories are abridged, or you just can't stand games with gender-class bias and janky durability and repair systems, you might want to give this a pass.  If you're a fan of side-scrolling beat-'em-ups in general, and would like to explore the idea of one as an MMO, DFO is not a bad choice for your first exposure to it.", "timestamp_created": 1562693808, "timestamp_updated": 1562696256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833706796169281006", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53972214": {"recommendationid": "53972214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367405191", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1585874980}, "language": "spanish", "review": "estuviera super bien si estuviera en espa\u00f1ol", "timestamp_created": 1562617748, "timestamp_updated": 1562617748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495867758989334106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53969767": {"recommendationid": "53969767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290883344", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 123, "last_played": 1475346218}, "language": "english", "review": "*Scoffs*", "timestamp_created": 1562611056, "timestamp_updated": 1562611056, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491888314485549927", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53922230": {"recommendationid": "53922230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198848969322", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1562522140}, "language": "english", "review": "dont play this game unless u want lose your time", "timestamp_created": 1562508372, "timestamp_updated": 1562508372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53891530": {"recommendationid": "53891530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015234899", "num_games_owned": 1442, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1180, "last_played": 1562116370}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fairly interesting game, ill be honest.

The new awakenings have breathed new life into the game imo. I see that there are still many issues with the steam version so I would recommend playing it off steam with the official launcher. This game is basically a fighting game-dungeon crawler-mmorpg. There are two reasons why this game is the most popular mmorpg in the world still: low spec requirements and fun combat system. I feel a bit sad that people won't give this game a try because of  how the game looks and how grindy it is but it's really not that bad, especially because people seem to like this kind of old-school graphics in there games. There are tons of classes and playstyles to fit anyone and everyone so I strongly recommend you to try this game.\n\nI am reviewing a non-steam version of the game, since the steam version is absolute shiet. I recently got back into this game and I have have to say that this game is amazing right now. Once you get started and create a few alts, fatigue system shouldn't hinder you from playing all-day. I have 62 characters right now (about 50 of them max level) and with a neo premium plus (which gives 100+ fatigue points) I play 2-3 characters per day and it takes a lot of time to drain all the fatigue points.

Useless content will force you to spend thousands of dollars on microtransactions just to have your gear score equal to other pay to win players.\n5. Game is incredible easy. ALl you need to do is press attack button XXXXX. I get level 30 in two hours and never use any skill. Only XXXXX.\n6. Stats say that 500 000 000 people play this game. It looks like 99,9999% of them are Chinesse and their bots. I did not met even one english speaking player in 2 hours of my gameplay.\n\nI do not recommend. It is pure garbage. Very old game with old graphic, old animation and old solutions. It is popular in China because they do not have money to buy computer for normal games.

Based on what I understand from other people, this happens failry often (!), and is a result of Neople's crappy cheat detection that apparently can be falsely triggered by normal stuff on your computer.  To this day, I don't know which program triggered this ban. Absolutely garbage to have this level of incomeptence when people sink so much time and effort in this style of game only to potentially lose their account.\n\n- Honestly not a big deal but you can only create 2 characters per day.  So forget having the fun of experimenting and messing around with character creation, you better just plan and get it right if you don't want to wait.\n\n- Lots of visual clutter onscreen.  \n\n- Armor upgrades do not change your appearance - naturally, you have to buy skins from the shop with real money.

It's interesting with some choices it make even if some are them are relatively bad choices.\n\nThe story makes no sense and is all over the place and they continue to add to the story I can't even think of a basic summary of it because its so nonsensical, but the story doesn't matter here. Every now and then they add a relatively new starting sequence of the game making it just more complicated. Its gotten to the point where I don't care at all for the story now with how complicated and nonsensical it is.\n\nThe gameplay is fun imo, its fun doing the combos and using the movement keys with the attack keys to activate skills which I enjoy. Though its sometimes wonky and might not even understand what you're trying to do, but that's common with systems lik this. Though the stamina system is stupid and NEVER should be implemented in ANY games whatsoever, I mean there was a QoL change that actually decreased how much stamina you used during a dungeon. This leads to the dungeoneering portion of Dungeon Fighter Online. It's relatively fine and dandy till you start getting to lvl 60+ in which is becomes grindy and sometimes unbalanced. There is a class system in this game which is like Elsword and most games like this, but it doesn't matter much.\n\nThe designing and look of the game is very animey which should be obvious from these type of games, if you're used to that design and look you probably know what to expect. If not, well it's gonna be really flashy and such. The weapons look relatively basic, so don't expect much.\n\nIn the end I do recommend this game, but that's mainly due to the QoL changes they have done.

I enjoy the game still and even more so that its original developers picked it up to release globally. I appreciate the continous updates to which we are within a year behind Korea's content as well. The gameplay has always been the same and the ever growing cast of characters always brings something new to the repetitive, yet addictve grindfest for those sweet epics. Although leveling is much easier than ever before, many can vouch that it is but a beginning to the true game, its endgame content. Nonetheless, the game encourages you to play multiple alternative characters for stat bonuses and side content entries, which supports more gameplay despite the fatigue system ironically hindering your progress on any character you choose to main. Purchasing CERA(in-game cash) through a Steam account not being possible is perhaps the biggest deal breaker that could push potential players from downloading the Steam launcher and using it. \n\nI for one, use the NeoPle account, but launch the game from Steam by logging out in the launcher and logging in with the former. Albeit unorthodox, I still get to see my gaming hours, while being able to broadcast through steam. Achievements will be unavailable however, if those are something you wish to collect. \n\n[u] Pros [/u]\n[list]\n    [*] Storyrich\n    [*] Consisting content updates\n    [*] Published and serviced by original developers\n    [*] Unique gameplay compared to other MMORPGs out there\n    [*] Low-end, 10 year old hardware can run the game surprisingly well\n    [*] Fun with friends and guilds have helpful micro communities\n[/list]\n\n[u] Cons[/u]\n[list]\n    [*] Fatigue system stops you from playing a character for the rest of the day\n    [*] Grinding a repititve mode for drops is to be expected if you even want to breathe in a raid(which is end-game content)\n    [*] Repetitive dungeon design\n    [*] Lore is all over the place\n    [*] Unable to purchase CERA on Steam\n    [*] Forced to see toxic community wars in world chat at least once a day\n[/list]\n\n\n[u] tl;dr:[/u] I enjoy this MMO a lot and believe you should play through NeoPle's website instead of Steam for

I played for a while on the jumping servers which were part of an event to help new, returning, and current players get a level 90 character in full high tier gear within just a few hours.\n\nThe gameplay itself is extremely fun, the classes feel like most of them flow really well, and it's just really satisfying to shred the enemies over and over. Even at high level, if you have a group of friends, or even just party up with random people, the bosses are difficult, but more or less fair.\n\nThe crafting system is interesting, has a lot of options even with only a few professions to choose from and all in all, it's pretty neat.\n\nNow onto why I would never recommend the game to anyone.\n\nOnce you reach a real server you're subject to a trade lock that hinges on three major things. The completion of 2 quests, one of which is easy and can be done in 5 minutes if you have a group. The other however requires you to run 3 raids.\n\nRaids in this game are annoying. You can only run them twice per week, and the quest that's part of removing the trade lock on your account requires you to essentially stop playing for a week to run them a third time\n\nAnd then there's apparently a 1 month long wait even after you've completed the quests in order to have the trade lock removed.\n\nNow you may be thinking. \"Trade lock? that's not so bad, I'll just play by myself. I didn't plan on trading with people anyway.\" and that's where you'd be wrong. because this so called trade lock doesn't just affect trading, but also selling, discarding, or grinding items of a certain rarity for crafting materials and the very item you need in order to use most of your worthwhile abilities later on. Clear cubes.\n\nIf you were playing on a jumping server like I was, you'll be shunted to a real server at level 90 with your full set of epic level raiding gear and your feeling of accomplishment, and likely an inventory full of gear that you didn't realize needed to be discarded before you moved your character. You will also be familliar with just grinding the junk in your inventory for both currency for gear repairs as well as the materials you need and to make room.\n\nThe problem is, if you played on a jumping server. There was no hint that these trade locks were a thing, and all that purple rarity and higher gear cluttering your inventory that you thought you'd just clear out later is now stuck. Like I said, you can't sell it to a vendor, you can't grind it, and you can't even just drag it from your inventory and discard it.\n\nIn addition, when you leave the jump server you are given 1000 clear cubes, which sounds like a lot until you notice that your abilities require them. spending 5 here, 10 there, so on, and so forth, you might wind up using as much as a hundred or more per dungeon run. and as you can't actually grind most of the stuff in your inventory for more.\n\non regular servers you'll occasionally get some gear you can grind, but it's rarely more than 1 or 200 worth, which MIGHT get you through a dungeon or not. but at level 90, most of the stuff you're going to get is going to be at least purple rarity, so have fun looking at this stuff that would ordinarily be useful for crafting and just ignoring it.\n\nSo, all in all, it's a great game run by a company that took measures so extreme to try [and fail] to stop bots that it makes the game virtually unplayable for new players.\n\nALMOST 2 YEARS LATER UPDATE:\n\nSo, I reinstalled the game to see if I could do literally anything about the trade lock. I'm still entirely out of clear cubes, I've tried running low level content for gear I can grind but the only things that are dropping are crafting materials.\n\nI tried contacting support with a ticket to see if they can MAYBE do something to help. Their response was to do the quest that caused me to quit in the first place. The quest that I don't have the clear cubes to do, the quest that you're not going to find a group to help you with, the quest that will take you literal weeks of waiting in order to do.\n\nSo, almost 2 years later still, **** this game.\n\n\n\n2 hour later update: After pressing the matter the trade restriction has finally been removed. So it seems that if you're under a long time trade lock and you press them hard enough, they might MAYBE remove your trade lock.\n\nStill, the trade lock is BS, and if you don't have the time to sink in to get it removed, don't bother with the game.", "timestamp_created": 1544129938, "timestamp_updated": 1596397364, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560359179973602295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47279194": {"recommendationid": "47279194", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979187851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 21997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11074, "last_played": 1630529298}, "language": "english", "review": "I really love this game, and I'd recommend it to anyone who simply wants to have some classic arcade brawler akin to classics such as D&D Shadow over mystara, knights of the round, cadillacs and dinosours, golden axe etc.\nIt is arguably the best in it's genre, making one spend many hours with various characters until you get comfortable with the play style you like best. And even then, you might want to play with a character that is the polar oposite of how you normally play, just to experience the challenge.\n\nIf you can remember, my original review actually dissed Neople heavily for the amount of hoops one needed to jump through just to be able to support Neople.\nIt was ridiculous to the extreme, the requirements that you needed to meet just in order to be able to Purchase Cera AND use it in the store.\nFor your information I absolutely refused to do what I found was an equivalent of ten knuckle push ups (Anton Raid) just so I can spend money on them.\n\nIt has changed to an upvote because despite the amount of time I had to spend fighting Neople support just to throw money at them, they actually pulled through and found a way for me to use my steam wallet to purchase CERA.\nThis obvouisly came about by meeting them halfway, otherwise it seems Neople really struggles to get around their \"policies\" just so you can spend cash on them.\n\nSo how did I meet them halfway?\nFirstly as you can see by hours put in, I've been playing quite a while now, so I mentioned this in the support ticket for good measure. I don't know how long you should be playing at minimum, but I figured I've been playing long enough.\nI added Google Authentication.\nI added a region lock.\nI added the goblin pin.\nI even completed Seria Support Quest 1, which was the \"ten push ups\" I mentioned in my orignal review.\n\nNeople made me wait for quite a while, but they eventually met me the other halfway and made it so I can use my steam wallet to purchase Cera.\nI would advise excersing patience (which I don't have, naturally) when dealing with Neople support, they eventually do get back to you...and even with an apology if they kept you waiting for a while.\n\nAnyway, I'm just glad that after all those hoops, I finally got what I wanted even if it was the long way around.", "timestamp_created": 1543860709, "timestamp_updated": 1544623407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473479956388473511", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47252610": {"recommendationid": "47252610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139824241", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2173, "last_played": 1544052346}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo bro JAJAJAJAJA ahre", "timestamp_created": 1543744939, "timestamp_updated": 1543744939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47154889": {"recommendationid": "47154889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215335092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 67210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 62684, "last_played": 1640040740}, "language": "english", "review": "play it becaus it has cut e anime girl and hot guy", "timestamp_created": 1543356603, "timestamp_updated": 1576151466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47145224": {"recommendationid": "47145224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065596509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1543338731}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot honestly recommend the steam release because it doesn't mesh with their system, like at all.

Each class is gender and race locked but there is a male and female version of almost every class. The classes can also upgrade, giving them a different playstyle. I recommend testing all before making your decision because with dungeon based games, it's less of the power of a class and more about how much you enjoy it.\nI honestly found myself having two male mages (#bestclass) because i loved two of the three advancements so much.\n\nI believe every class is fairly even, with no 1 class being WAY op.\n\nThe graphics are quite nice for a sprite pixel-y game.\nLooks somewhat like Mortal Combat or one of those old games like that with the numbers.\n\nProbably runs well on a potato pc, so don't worry.

So... where? Well first you have to buy a Karma Koin card digital or a real card from your nearest store that may or may not have them. Next you have to go to their website to redeem the card. But wait! There's more! You now have to verify your account on their website. Next you are FORCED to download the Google authenticator app. The best part about this app is it requires you to download it on an Android phone. There isn't a pc version of the app. Now you are ready for step 3 which is applying for the right to make a purchase from Neople.\n\nSeriously, how do they expect to recieve an income when they set so many barriers to just buy stuff?

According to many people, the Steam Client has a lot of issues, so if you want to try the game, might as well download the Stand alone client, which is what I did. I logged in probably more than 80-90 hours.\n\nI played for around a month or so and I had a blast. I stopped playing because none of my friends were playing the game and well, as such, I tend to get bored after that.\n\nAnyways. There are a lot of classes to play with, and some offers quite an interresting playstyle. If you're into beat them up games and action RPG, it's worth a try, even if the game itself is quite old. Don't let you get influenced by the Stamina/Energy system: Except in the earlier levels where you can run out of energy pretty fast, it's not that important. If you really want to play, you can create another character and keep doing so.\n\nUnless you want to be strong faster than you should, or unless you want every cosmetic item there is, you're not forced to pay and except in rare cases (maybe PvP, but I didn't try), it won't even matter if you do or don't.

It\u2019s up to the hero, a.k.a. the player, to protect the citizens, eliminate the root of the problem, and bring back peace to the kingdom.\n\nDFO features persistent worlds with instanced dungeons and is one of the first MMORPGs to do so. This was then followed by Dragon Nest, Lunia, and Vindictus. Everything about this game feels retro, which might not appeal to some players. The game features retro-arcade style graphics reminiscent of old side-scrolling beat \u2018em up arcade games from the SNES and SEGA Genesis era. The sound also has a classical RPG feel to it and fits the overall theme of the game quite nicely. The game has over 400 million registered users, so they must be doing something right.\n\nDFO offers players a mix of beat \u2018em up action with classical MMORPG elements, and like typical MMORPGs, quests are the player\u2019s main source of money, equipment, and experience points. Quests can be acquired from NPCs in town and come in the form of dungeon-runs that players must successfully complete to the end. Like classic beat \u2018em ups, players must first eliminate all enemies in a zone before they can proceed to the next one, usually culminating in a boss fight. Aside from the quest rewards, players can also loot items from mobs and bosses. Basically, the whole game involves visiting an NPC to start a quest, hitting the dungeon, then returning to the quest-giver to collect rewards. Rinse and repeat. This tends to get boring after a while. Good thing that the bosses pose a bit of a challenge and will definitely keep players occupied, even if it\u2019s just for a few hours. The dungeons will seem a bit easy at first, but once you start hitting level 16+ dungeons, you\u2019ll know what frustration is. Some bosses literally take hours to take down, and it\u2019s not uncommon to be close to dying after just one hit. Fortunately, the game allows players to team up with four other players to complete a certain dungeon. Not sure if the game difficulty increases, since I\u2019m more of a solo guy.\n\nCombat and movement in DFO uses the arrow keys to move around and keyboard keys to launch attacks and trigger abilities or items in the hotbar. The game is set up so that players can easily swap their keyboards for a gamepad or even an arcade controller. I definitely recommend using a gamepad instead, simply because they\u2019re a lot less awkward to use than keyboards for these kind of games. Anyone who's ever appreciated classic arcade beat'em ups like Double Dragon or Golden Axe will love the retro-graphics and action-oriented gameplay in Dungeon Fighter Online.\n\nBeing an MMORPG, DFO also features PvP options that players have come to expect from other MMORPGs. To access the PvP channel, players must be Level 35 and above. To even out the playing field, player stats are automatically balanced once they enter a PvP Game Room. Depending on the type of game mode selected, a typical PvP match requires at least 2 players to compete (up to a maximum of 8 players). DFO offers 5 arena-style game modes: Brawl, Deathmatch, Team, Team Deathmatch, and Elimination. Brawls are free-for-all matches where the last man standing wins. Deathmatch is similar to Brawl matches, but players are given two lives to work with. Team matches pit one team against another using Brawl match rules. Team Deathmatches features the same rules as Team matches but gives players a set number of lives to be shared by all members of the team. Lastly, Elimination matches have two teams going up against each other in one-on-one matches, where the winner of the match moves on to fight the next player of the opposing team. The last team standing wins the match.\nJoining PvP matches rewards players with PvP experience, which determines their rankings on the leaderboard. Losers don\u2019t gain any experience. Players also gain Victory Points, regardless of whether they win or lose. These Victory Points can be used to purchase special potions and high quality weapons.\n\nLike all free-to-play MMOs, DFO features a premium item shop that lets players purchase items using Cera, which can be bought using real money. The game is still in its early stages under Neople and so far, the premium shop contains the usual fanfare of items, but nothing game-breaking. Let\u2019s just hope that Neople doesn\u2019t get all greedy and start implementing OP premium weapons in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1535331813, "timestamp_updated": 1535331858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682994246482849121", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44382100": {"recommendationid": "44382100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085111810", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 363, "last_played": 1535347854}, "language": "english", "review": "I have quite enjoyed the game since i began playing, i normally dislike side scrollers but this one seems to do well at holding my attention, my only complaint would be the fatigue system, i don't like being stopped in the middle of a series of story missions because i'm out of fatigue and i have to wait for it to regenerate. other than that, amazing game and i will put up with the fatigue.", "timestamp_created": 1535261054, "timestamp_updated": 1535261054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44359793": {"recommendationid": "44359793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051383438", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1558487473}, "language": "english", "review": "Doesn't even play", "timestamp_created": 1535156205, "timestamp_updated": 1535156205, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.403846144676208496", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44351531": {"recommendationid": "44351531", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993793563", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1231, "last_played": 1535208532}, "language": "english", "review": "waiting 10 hours for dowload the game\nOh...it is on a event, Oh it is miku! i should play this game for my weekend\n(leveling after 15 hours ) i should take a break for meal \n(back for 15min)\n\"blocked by administrator\"\nWTF?", "timestamp_created": 1535121505, "timestamp_updated": 1535121505, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52349543571472168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44336671": {"recommendationid": "44336671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039400420", "num_games_owned": 488, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4064, "last_played": 1583742578}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the hell out of the game during the Dreadful NEXON NA Days. I still love this game and the devs love the players!  With active streams and funny ass videos they do for the community. Even though you cant link steam to neople account(yet) It is still worth playing on steam! You can see the love they are trying to spread from the korean version to the rest of the world. The classes are diverse and well balanced(mostly....fuck Priests..)\nThe new story update allows me to actually participate in a campaign that makes you a major part of the story unlike most mmo's that just have you participating with a mass of other players to fight under one leader blah blah blah stuff.. You meet legends of past, THEN fight with them to make your legend even greater than theirs! \nThe combat system is fun as fuck and harkens back to old arcade style fighting we all grew up with(unless you are born past the 2000's). Each class has 4 or more subclasses you lock into after reaching a certain level at the beginning of a new journey(with the exception of Dark Knight and Creator who are lore based classes that do not have subclasses, those classes are unlocked after level 70-75 for any character you raised to that level.) Each subclass can go under an upgrade called AWAKENING which basically fucks everything over with even more over the top skills to offer than you had before(go through the scenario quests to easily unlock the first awakening)\nWant to be an edglord shadow man BOOM Avenger Subclass, want to be a wicked blood thirsty monster BOOM Berserker Subclass, Want to nuke a fucker that did nothing wrong BOOM Launcher subclasses. Want the FBI to knock the fuck out of your doors and windows BOOM Mage class.\nAnother amazing part of the game is the soundtrack, can be smooth and calm, to wicked and heart pounding. Even the character creation screen welcomes you with an amazing song!\n\n You dont have to worry about play to win, Its pay to look fucking fabulous. You can buy cosmetics via the cash shop OR the Community market place with gold you earn from doing almost anything. The prices can be rather high, but play through normally and you are bound to make hundreds of thousands of gold within hours. You can also sell alot of items you pick up, you might get lucky and pick up something worth loads of gold on Auction hall, so check items value there often.\nThe devs also make sure to keep thing exciting with CONSTANT EVENTS. It is almost rare to not have more than 2 events going on during any play session.\n\nSome cons that come to mind is:\n -The Fatigue system, which is a bar that counts down to how many dungeon rooms you go through, once that bar is depleted your hero will be to exhausted to continue onwards until the next daily login. You can delay this with FP potions to restore some Fatigue so you can continue on playing with that character. Early on can be tiring but you can buy these with using milage points you get for completing optimal dungeons, they build up rather fast the more characters your play with in a day. \n-Player chest storage- Needs premium currency (cera) to upgrade. But this can be countered at level 60+ when you buy the account vault which is a universal storage for all characters. The upgrade components can be bought on the auction hall for gold rather easy!\n-Occasional crashing, They are working on it, just can be a fucking pain when it happens, only happened twice so far in my steam and neople play times.\n-Cannot purchase premium currency through steam...UNLESS you hit level 85 and do second awakening class, sometimes that might not even unlock it and might have to register a goblin security tab and google authenticator. So even if you want to buy something you got to work towards it for quite a bit.\n-Lost treasures...fuck em....but been here since nexon days and it is a risky way to make tens of millions of gold on auction hall. You can earn keys through dungeons normally, but good lucky getting rng to have them drop. But hey...they are free keys and might get lucky opening a LT..\n\n-Tokens...tokens are what you use to revive when you go down in a dungeon. They are a premium aqquired items (occasionally aquired through events or LT) IF you use what you have its going to be a hard fought battle against what is beating you into the dirt.\n\nLastly - Kiri.....The Destroyer of all your Shit... Using her is kinda madatory for good gear and damage output for items...but beware....The higher you go...the higher the chance you aint gonna get that item back...\n\nThere are many other things I may have forgotten to mention but I am to busy Summoning a dragon to do a fucking orbital beam cannon on a boss that talked shit to me..\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1535049308, "timestamp_updated": 1535049308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749081611633301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44305731": {"recommendationid": "44305731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046135610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 100843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80900, "last_played": 1598122689}, "language": "english", "review": "This game have ligma", "timestamp_created": 1534912666, "timestamp_updated": 1534912666, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.335579097270965576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44302391": {"recommendationid": "44302391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193774959", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 946, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 864, "last_played": 1535081268}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Extreme anime tiddies <3", "timestamp_created": 1534893369, "timestamp_updated": 1534893369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44299239": {"recommendationid": "44299239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121185234", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 89693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59539, "last_played": 1648325368}, "language": "english", "review": "What a Great Game!
