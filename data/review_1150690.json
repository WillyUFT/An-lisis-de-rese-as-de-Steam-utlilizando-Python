The media surrounding it and the content itself is just phenomenal, with an amazing and gripping story to it. The simplicity of the art-style is eye candy, and the contrast of the psychological horror elements to it is just masterfully done. The RPG section of the game is lacking a bit in my opinion, basically being just rock-paper-scissors but I've had loads of fun with it nonetheless. Exploring Headspace is a treat within itself, looking through every nook and cranny for a new item, interaction or secret. The characters feel like real people with real human emotion.

I am very glad I went in blindly playing the game otherwise it would've ruined it for me and blind made the experience all the worthwhile. Despite the fact I hardly ever play horror games, the gameplay is very unique and emotion based. Undertale did not make me cry although I love Undertale and Deltarune this game however made me bawl my eyes out like a fucking baby and made me feel things I did not want to feel. What's also great about this game is just like Undertale the choices you make throughout a specific route really affect the consequences. It really makes you feel for these characters and makes you care about them. I know Omori may not be a game for everyone but I was recommended by one of my best friends to play it and my boyfriend bought the game for me and I bought it for him lol.

The main thing to note about this game is the sense of nostalgia, especially with the headspace area, that definitely shows strokes of Earthbound and honestly the entire 90s decade. This is furthered by the Faraway Town portion of the game, which is basically like a 90s hangout with your friends made into a game. This is balanced superbly with horror, as the games more intense imagery (i.e. blackspace) could have been too much if not for the happier headspace areas. The battle system is great too, though I think the emotions mechanic could have been utilized more than it was.\n\nOverall, an amazing experience that hits you right in the gut. 10/10",

Este chico se llama Sunny.\n\nEn este juego divagamos entre dos mundos: el \theadspace (nuestros sue\u00f1os) y el mundo real, concretamente en la ciudad de FARAWAY. En este mundo ficticio todo parece ser perfecto: est\u00e1s rodeado de tus amigos de toda la vida, te diviertes, recreas momentos que han sido inolvidables, todos te quieren y b\u00e1sicamente puedes hacer todo lo que quieras. Eres el \"Dios\" de ese mundo, el so\u00f1ador. Aqu\u00ed eres OMORI, un alter ego que representa al personaje principal del juego (Sunny) en este maravilloso mundo. \n\nOMORI no est\u00e1 solo. Sus amigos Kel, Aubrey, Hero, Basil y su hermana Mari siempre est\u00e1n ah\u00ed y lo conocen a la perfecci\u00f3n. A OMORI no le gusta estar solo, le da miedo el auga, las alturas, las ara\u00f1as y... otras cosas correspondientes con los miedos reales de Sunny. Aclarar tambi\u00e9n que estos amigos \"imaginarios\" representan a los amigos reales del protagonista, aunque como se ver\u00e1 en el juego, no todos vuelven a ser lo mismos tras la ocurrencia de un evento que los marcar\u00e1 durante toda su vida. Pero bueno, pase lo que pase, en el mundo de los sue\u00f1os eres feliz ya que puedes modificarlo a tu gusto y borrar aquello que no te agrade... \u00bfpero ser\u00e1 suficiente?\n\nKel es un chiquillo muy energ\u00e9tico y risue\u00f1o, siempre est\u00e1 feliz y le gustar chinchar mucho a Aubrey, una chica muy agradable y alegre que siempre anima a los dem\u00e1s y tambi\u00e9n se queja cuando encuentra alguna injusticia o algo que no es correcto. A lo largo del tiempo se ver\u00e1 como Aubrey cambia, no siendo la persona que era, y descubrir\u00e1s la triste realidad de la verdad. Nadie sabe si Kel est\u00e1 mal, ya que lo oculta muy bien. De hecho, ser\u00e1 tu primera compa\u00f1\u00eda despu\u00e9s de 4 a\u00f1os en la vida real.\n\nHero es mucho m\u00e1s tranquilo que su hermano Kel y es mayor, junto a Mari, que el resto del grupo. Podr\u00edamos decir que representa la figura de Padre dentro de \u00e9l y siempre est\u00e1 al cuidado de los peque\u00f1os. Adem\u00e1s es muy educado y considerado, usa un lenguaje cort\u00e9s y puede convencer a cualquiera con su picaresca sonrisa. Quiere mucho a Mari y pasa rato junto a ella cuando puede, la cual toma la figura de Madre organizando sus picnics y velando por la seguridad de todos y, sobre todo, de su hermano. \n\nBasil es el mejor amigo de OMORI. Es un chico t\u00edmido apasionado por la bot\u00e1nica, no suele hablar de su vida ni contar sus inquietudes con todo el mundo y le gusta fotografiar a sus amigos en momentos espor\u00e1dicos, para conservar la naturalidad del momento y la belleza pura de cada persona. Solo suele hablar con OMORI de estas cosas ya que seg\u00fan \u00e9l es un \"buen escuchador\" y se siente seguro cont\u00e1ndole todo ello. Siempre que pasa alg\u00fan problema conf\u00eda en que todo se solucionar\u00e1 y que estar\u00e1n (\u00e9l y sus amigos) bien, crey\u00e9ndo que no hay ning\u00fan problema... aunque esto no servir\u00e1 esta vez.\n\nA lo largo del juego podr\u00e1s explorar como cada uno de estos personajes ha vivido c\u00f3mo afrontar las consecuencias del evento que los marc\u00f3 de por vida. Sobre todo desde el punto de vista de Sunny, destrozado por dentro, el cual no ha superado todav\u00eda los sucesos ocurridos y tendr\u00e1 que zanjar varios asuntos pendientes antes de que se le acabe el tiempo, ya que tiene que mudarse en cuatro d\u00edas de su ciudad natal. El juego aprovecha muy bien una herramienta que todos usamos a menudo: el recuerdo y el olvido, algo que es tan obvio que existe pero que a la misma vez aterrador desde c\u00f3mo se nos presenta en la historia.\n\nNo recomiendo jugar este juego si no tienes la suficiente madurez para identificar que al final es una historia de ficci\u00f3n y, sobre todo, entender las sensaciones y sentimientos que se tratan en \u00e9l. Yo he llorado, me he frustado, me he visto proyectado en el juego y me he incluso bloqueado en su final a la misma vez que me he alegrado cuando estaba en el mundo id\u00edlico de Sunny y viviendo tal y como a \u00e9l le gustar\u00eda. La banda sonora es brutal, ya ver\u00e9is. Si ascaso, el juego puede ser un poco largo, pero no requiere visitar todas las zonas ni realizar ninguna misi\u00f3n alternativa para conseguir avanzar en la historia principal.", "timestamp_created": 1699469680, "timestamp_updated": 1699995644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149765254": {"recommendationid": "149765254", "author": {"steamid": "76561199132132562", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 321, "last_played": 1699480747}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it :3", "timestamp_created": 1699460650, "timestamp_updated": 1699460650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149763857": {"recommendationid": "149763857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021993598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1985, "last_played": 1699421325}, "language": "english", "review": "Omori is a special game.\n\nIt's rare for games to hold so much meaning while also being... just a really damn good game.

The first few hours were something I've never experienced in a game before, little things like the title screen, the music, and the recurring themes of familiarity of this dream world through its fantastic soundtrack, The music seriously enriches the player's understanding of this overall plot-rich/traumatic experience.\n\nOMORI\u2019s gameplay is in the form of a turn-based RPG, with a lot of exploration on the side, really simple and easy to understand, and can also be very rewarding in a very satisfying way, A lot of what you do in this game is explore with your friends and relive old memories together, while also making new ones which I found to enjoy a lot personally. especially with its story that heavily revolves around its lovable cast of characters, They all have their unique personalities, and their own lives which isn't dived into too much, but a lot of it is hinted at in a way that's realistic during the story.\n\nthe only criticism I would have for this masterpiece is its pacing, There are quite a few areas that drag on a bit too long for my liking especially when trying to interact with everything in the game. I find this game to be very hard to be able to replay with that in mind, especially for the many different endings it has to offer.\n\nI really enjoyed OMORI and its wonderful art style, It's a game I will remember for years to come, It's had such a massive impact on me as a person through the story and tells a really important message that I think I needed to hear during the release of the game when I played it, which it delivers greatly on. definitely will be a steamroller of emotions and bangers once you launch this game.

The excessively large amount of dungeons bloats the game (especially in the final dungeon) and overall dampens the otherwise enjoyable story the game carries. The game feels as though it was not confident enough in its story to simply allow it to progress naturally without massive multi-hour sections of minor, one-note character moments, relatively boring rock-paper-scissors gameplay that tows the line of being mildly fun, so easy its boring, or so damage-spongy it's unbearable (looking at you, Humphrey), and slog-filled dungeons that only serve to meet Kickstarter goals and distract from the gripping story of the Real World sections of the game. Though this is likely intentional, showing how Sunny uses his Headspace as an escape from the stresses of the Real World and the trauma he has experienced, it does not translate well into the pacing of the game and after Pyrefly Forest, I was just wishing I could get back to the story and learn more about the real characters, not their watered-down, idealized Headspace counterparts.\n\nI suppose this is all to say that the story of the Real World was so enjoyable and intriguing that the game left me actively wishing for more. Unfortunately, it only takes up around 5 hours of gameplay. Kel, Aubrey, Hero, and Basil are enjoyable characters and feel almost real, making their plights more interesting and making you feel for their characters. Watching the characters process and attempt to grow from their past is enjoyable and the overall message of moving forward from past actions and trauma is one that should be seen more in media and I am glad this game went to the effort to flesh out its messaging.\n\nI'd recommend watching a let's play over playing the game yourself, since that way you can trim the fat of the game if you want to avoid the overly long Headspace sections. There's one section towards the very end I'd say is worth playing, but it's so late in the game I can't justify telling someone to spend $20 just to experience a 30 minute to 1 hour long section when you could get the same experience as it from Yume Nikki or its various fan sequels or clones for free with the added bonus of a better atmosphere.", "timestamp_created": 1699200896, "timestamp_updated": 1699200896, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474798023700714111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149596059": {"recommendationid": "149596059", "author": {"steamid": "76561199246190498", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "playtime_at_review": 1223, "last_played": 1700009027}, "language": "english", "review": "I am scared yet happy, but not in the same time.", "timestamp_created": 1699199538, "timestamp_updated": 1699199538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149595706": {"recommendationid": "149595706", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125174614", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1728, "last_played": 1694208515}, "language": "english", "review": "This is quite possibly my new favorite game.

The pacing was way too slow.\nI don't mind when games are supposed to be slow and omori is a game that takes time to complete, but this one felt a bit too much.\nThat kind of hurts some moments of the game where sometimes i felt kind of bored and wanted something to happen, and this is not a game where I wanted to get bored at times, rather intrigued due to the story.\n2. The game was a bit too easy.\nNow, don't get me wrong, I get why this game was super hard, and hey, I am not saying games being easy makes the game overall worse, but I have to admit that it can hurt when replaying. At least for me.\n3. Game was a bit too long.\nI am not including extra content or other things to do here.\nSometimes it dragged way too long about things or certain sections just took an unnecessary amount of time to move on to another thing.\nAgain, I get why it's this way, but there was sometimes too much dialog, or some events could have been faster, yada yada.\n\nThese 3 things also can hurt the gameplay a bit, and gameplay is quite important for a game.\nI also do not feel like the RPG part was something special, it's not bad tho, it works very well specially with the emotion system, but it's not amazing.\nI would have liked if the side-quests also gave you \"better rewards\". Because sometimes they take the longest to complete, and is return sometimes they give you some clams that you could have gotten elsewhere or in a faster way. I am not saying I don't like them, they are a cool addition and a little extra, but they don't feel rewarding.\n\nGameplay and replayability is something I really care about, but that's pretty much the things I have against this game.\nThe rest of the game tho? It's amazing!\n\nThe story is perfect and original, there aren't a lot of games that speak about topics like phobia or depression in the way that Omori does, it's pretty unique in that department.\nThe characters are also perfect, there is absolutely nothing wrong with them, they are charmy, they are iconic and their designs are really cool.\nThe music is also insane! I see nobody talking about Omori's soundtrack but it fits both the RPG part and the topic that is covering, music is super important too and honestly, I wouldn't change a single track.\nThe style of the game is also really well done, mixing pixel-art with some realistic images and some anime-style drawings and characters was executed surprisingly well, specially for an RPG.\nThere is also quite a lot of stuff to do in this game, between side-quests, or secrets, or leveling up your party members, or getting some achievements. RPGs have a common flaw that is not having anything aside from the main story, so Omori doing this is a blast and I can see why 100% completing this game can be quite fun.\n\nOverall, this was an incredible game and a great experience, specially the experience part that I would recommend.\nIt does suck that the bad things about it are kinda big for me, but if you do not mind them, you will think this game is amazing, and it is.\nAnd for those saying this game is mid, no it's not mid.\n\nRECOMMENDED!\n8.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1699187278, "timestamp_updated": 1699187278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149581646": {"recommendationid": "149581646", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095125811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2895, "last_played": 1676820635}, "language": "english", "review": " Be ready to cry your eyes out.

Many features of the story felt very unbelievable (I don't mean the fantasy aspects, obviously). The characters don't act their ages and they don't have convincing reactions to the events they've gone through. They talk like characters in a children's cartoon, which is jarring for a game that deals with themes like suicide, mental illness and [spoiler]murder[/spoiler]. The different pieces of the game also didn't seem to add up to anything -- the whole thing felt like a collection of disparate elements that had nothing to do with each other. For how much story you actually get, there was a disproportionate amount of silly filler that wasn't entertaining (a lot of lame, forced humor) and didn't connect in any way to the real plot. All the side quests/plots are tedious and unrewarding.\n\nI kept going because of the driving mystery (eventually skipping everything but the main plot actions), but in the end, the final reveal [spoiler]that Sunny killed his sister and he and Basil framed it as a suicide[/spoiler] made even less sense than the rest of the game. [spoiler]Why would Sunny, who never had any violent tendencies, suddenly do something like that? How and why did two twelve year olds come up with such a morbid deception? If it really was just an accident, why did they feel the need to present it as a suicide? How did anyone not notice that Mari's death was caused by blunt force trauma, not hanging? How did Basil manage to keep this a secret for four years?[/spoiler] The [i]reason[/i] for these events is largely left up to implication and only explained in some game data. [spoiler]But even given the explanation that Mari was putting too much pressure on Sunny before the recital, it was never shown that Mari's perfectionism had led to harsh treatment of anyone else.[/spoiler] \n\nIt also feels like a major piece of the payoff is missing, since [spoiler]you don't get to see Aubrey, Kel and Hero's reactions to Sunny's revelation[/spoiler]. It's implied that [spoiler]they simply forgive him[/spoiler], which also rings hollow -- [spoiler]as sensitive, traumatized teenagers who have just been through serious emotional turmoil, it's likely that it would not be easy at all for them to adjust to this new understanding of events, even if they choose not to blame Sunny[/spoiler].\n\nI'd been looking for a game to fill the Deltarune-shaped

This game is indeed quite good. Not as insanely good as some say it is but still very good. Great soundtrack, decent gameplay (emotion system was neat but nothing that blew me away), and of course, the story. The disturbing underlying secret beneath the whole cutesy facade is what ACTUALLY makes me like the game as it has my favourite kind of horror.  A creeping horror that inexorably crawls up on you until the truth is slowly laid bare. My biggest complaint is the games pacing. It basically boils down to wandering around the dream world, something creepy happens, real life event, wandering around the dream world, something creepy happens, real life event, etc. At times it feels like some wacky thing happens for the sake of just giving you more game before you can have the next creepy bit revealed.\nAll in all, quite good and an easy recommendation. 8.7/10 I admit I shed a tear at the end but didn't full on cry like I did with mother 3.", "timestamp_created": 1699044794, "timestamp_updated": 1699044794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149465422": {"recommendationid": "149465422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198964073643", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1699373851}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no words.

I came back with a friend after a few months and we both thought it had a lot of great style, but leaned too far into absurdism (one of the supposed jokes in the beginning was about a nose talking to a leaf about a bunny...no punchline or context to pull it together, just random words together in a sentence), visuals for the sake of visuals, uneven pacing and definitely tonally uneven. The gameplay also seemed disjointed. There are no horror elements in the beginning. Instead, after 30 minutes of slice of life, absurdist, fluffy walking and reading text, the game then introduces battles. After 10 minutes the gameplay then shifts to that of an RPG Maker horror game, complete with a very telegraphed jump shock. I was having a very hard time holding interest both times I played, and by the time the turn based battles and horror aspects were introduced, I had a hard time being invested.\n\nI did think the game had great style, especially with all of the hand drawn elements. I didn't think it all fit with the pixel style of the graphics however. I also thought there was some inventiveness in the combat with the different statuses, the positive and negative buffs in each, and how the statuses form a rock paper scissors weakness system. I also enjoyed all the tracks I heard.\n\nThis game has an overwhelming positive score and quite frankly I am very surprised. However it seems some thematic elements such as depression and suicide, as well as the art really resonated with most people who played it.

99% of the game is brilliant. It's thoughtful, well made, visually gorgeous... but the ending [spoiler] felt like it was made that way for no real purpose other than to be edgy edgelords. It ruined my outlook on the game quite significantly as it sort of shit all over the character development that happens throughout the game [/spoiler].\n\nIt took me about 23hrs to clear with a few side quests completed, so I feel the pricing on it is fair and tbh this is my sweet spot for game length. I didn't feel like it dragged on at all, and it was long enough to explore things nicely. The music is a 10/10, art is 10/10, gameplay is a solid 8/10 and I'll recommend the game, but I have conflicted feelings about just how genuinely my recommendation is given how cheated I felt by it.\n\nPlease be aware of the content warnings for this game.

scenes, and you slowly piece together the story before the ending hits you with the biggest blow to the chest I have ever felt, I've honestly never had a plot twist that's affected me that much in my life and its honestly such a shame that all my friends got it spoiled for them, because this game is best played blind, if there was one thing I could change, it would be to change ever having my

"language": "english", "review": "Bought this game based on the 55k positive reviews. For the first 2/3rds of the game I would agree. Music, art direction, gameplay, dialogue, and story are all amazing. Here I need to break my gripes into 2 sections, story and game gripes. For those avoiding spoilers, ill save you the time and say I got this at like a 5/10 for me personally. The final 3rd of the game just really ruined it for me. Wouldnt recommend it to anyone I personally know, but if you want a Horror JRPG with some badass music and dope combat give it a shot.\n\nGameplay: *Possible Spoils* The gameplay loop is Dream World (Bulk of the gameplay) into the Real World (Bulk of the Story). When I got to the 3rd Dream World section, the pacing really fell off for me personally. Its the longest of the DW segments and the back to back bosses was unnecessary. Everything else was fine and unique. \n\nSTORY: *ABSOLUTELY SPOILERS DO NOT READ* \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n,\n,\nOk so I know this will get hated, but what was that ending? Regardless of what Sunny did being on purpose or accident, why am I to feel bad for him. It really feels like the game wants me to justify his redemption due to all the \"trauma\" hes been dealing with. But what about the pain and suffering he inflicted upon basil? Not only did he put basil through the \"accident\", he hung his \"best friend' out to dry. What about the pain he caused to all of his friends? WHAT ABOUT THE FUCKING CAT? Most killers start off by killing helpless animals. Also makes sense because what is the most common enemy in SUNNY'S Dream...........bunnies. Completing this game gave me a heavy SH2, except trying to get me to justify James is a good guy.\n\nTHIS COULD ALL JUST BE HOW I INTERPRETED THE STORY! I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE DEEPS DIVES EVERYWHERE!

I have alot of things to say about this funny little game. [b]Spoiler warning, of course.[/b]\n\nI first played this game at around october of last year, I've heard of Omori beforehand but I never had a chance to play it or even know the plot, story, or that it would be an RPG. but I knew I had to play it someday.\nThis is easily, my 3rd favorite game of all time, and it is hard to top that. So why is it in the top 3? well.\n\nIn Omori, you play as Omori (Shocking). which also means KILL in romanian. But you also play as Sunny, (Or Sar as I named him at the start.). You begin in a white void, a white space if you may. With nothing but a computer, sketchbook, tissue paper, your lovely cat MEWO, a knife that drops out of knowhere, a lightbulb that is pitch black, and a white door. entering such door brings you to a very fun and pretty world called WHITESPACE! a fun little place with many activies and people which are totally not designed by your alter ego to hide a horrifying truth! :D\n\nHere lies your friends Kel, Aubrey, Hero, and Basil (I thought Basil was a girl at first, turns out he's gay in headcanon). aswell as your lovely big sister MARI. MARI is kind of like the mother of the friend groud and helping hand, which explains why she is always next to a save point with a basket of food that heals your team physically (But not emotionally...)\n\nAfter getting to meet all the main chararcters and looking at Basils PHOTO ALBUM, you play Hide & Seek with them and some other people, Beat up a bully which had Basil captive, and go to Basils house around 300 feet away, learning more about the FIGHT system in this game, which consist of turn based combat with your friends and enemies, aswell as moods that affect your stats and an energy bar that fills up as your team takes damage which lets  you do team attacks and an ultimate attack once its filled.\n\nRemember that PHOTO ALBUM? well, Basil decides to take a photo before entering the house, but due to Aubrey and Kel's  fighting to see the photo first, Basil falls over and all the photos fall on the ground, Basil and hero pick them up and then we arrange them back into place in his house.\nBut then, one more photo slips out, and Basil makes the fatal mistake of picking it up...\n\n[i] \"Huh? Whats this? Did I take this photo?\" [/i]\n\n[i] \"Something about it seems... So familiar.\" [/i]\n\n[i] \"N-No... That can't be...\" [/i]\n\n[i] Dark roots begin forming at Basil's feet [/i]\n\n[b] \"MARI... She's...\"- [/b]\n\nThe screen cuts to black. Flashing the photo for a single frame of video.\n\nYou cut back to whitespace, with no way of getting out, until you check your menu\n\n-ESC\n- [b] STAB [/b] EQUIP POCKET SKILLS OPTIONS\n-STAB\n- STAB WHO?\n- OMORI\n\nOmori pulls out a knife, with seemingly only a moment of hesitation. He stabs himself, killing him for the time being...\n\nafterwards theres a monolouge between Sunny and Basil. about old pictures, and how it makes them feel now.\n\nI wont spoil anything else, I just wanna say. Thank you OMOCAT. Thank you for making such a great game, From the bottom of my heart, Thank you Edith for buying me this game.

Especially not being able to skip some bits that can drag, and the game structure that is quite punishing for some achievements if you didn't plan for it.\n\nWhat I really loved on the other hand, and that were still fun on the third/fourth time, were the bosses. It all meshes really well, the emotions mechanic merging with the character of the bosses, their banger theme, and their moves. It wasn't just battles, but experiencing them.\n\nDuring most of the story, I had a small fear that I would be disappointed by the resolution somehow, but when reaching it I was conquered.\n\nThe gameplay might be simple, but the battles are fun in their way of using a sort of stance dynamic through emotions. It's deeper than expected, although making it tend on the easy side but I don't mind that at all.\n\nThe art style is also something I really enjoy, something with childish substance made with skill. This game is quite clever with a good amount of fun and integrated references.\n\nThe game was endearing and the combat worked well for me, it was worth experiencing.\nAll I have to say in the end is

Lately (for a couple of years) I have been neglecting my life engaging in too much escapism doing stuff like playing video games all day (including OMORI) to ignore my mental issues after/while going through *heavy* grief but this beautiful ending [i](the good one!)[/i] made me realize that, even though it's not easy at all and it requires a lot of strength, it's better to try to face your traumas head on rather than pretending they don't exist and everything is fine. Well, it's not like I was stupid enough to not realize that before, but it's hard to get out of that loop and ask for help. Yet OMORI managed to slap me so hard that I thought \"okay that's it I'm getting help I can't keep going at it like Sunny\" because I saw too much of my own behavior in the main character's story/decisions/relationships [i](hell, a couple of times I also haven't gotten out of my house for several months \ud83d\udc80)[/i]and it did NOT look good from an outsider perspective! that was quite uncomfortable for me!! [spoiler]I, too, accidentally damaged my friendships because I had fallen too deep into my own sulking and isolated myself, without realizing that the extent of my self hatred ended up affecting my friends too and they didn't deserve that. But I guess it's not easy to be a good friend when your mind is too busy creating a parallel reality where time doesn't pass and also trying to convince you to end your life.[/spoiler] Hopefully this time with the help of my therapist, my life might get better :3\nok enough venting on steam wtf what a loser sorry but this game is important to me, now here's an actual review: \n\n[b]pros: BEAUTIFUL artstyle, compelling story, lovely characters (some better than others...) fun gameplay (well I'm a rpg fan so I might be biased) \n\ncons: omocat didn't milk her beautiful artstyle in this platform by adding trading cards/points shop items, so I can't buy and wear an animated Kel avatar like god intended me to. That sucks...

It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, close to Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, which are horses that never have been domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.\n\nHorses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.\n\nHorse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited \"hot bloods\" with speed and endurance; \"cold bloods\", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and \"warmbloods\", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.\n\nHorses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares.

In every sense.\n\nI mean, the game is quite long and it feels like it shouldn't be that way. And there's a lot to keep in mind, which is kinda hard since the game switches between two worlds, with every turn taking enough time to forget what you did before you switched. And also, there's a lot of emotions to deal with, a whole spectrum of them, starting with happy (also sad and angry if yk what I mean) moments, finishing with uncertainty and confusion about some of the characters' stories.\n\nAll these points are kinda controversial, I know, and I totally wouldn't recommend this game for everyone. The thing I liked the most was digging through the stories of characters, their motifs (are there any motifs for something you didn't mean to do?), feelings , thoughts and I could keep this list going. This game gave me space for thinking, which is why I liked it. It just feels good to do some thinking from time to time, you know. Like, would I act the same way? Would I feel the same? Why did it happen like that? What could it mean? Stuff like that. I also enjoyed finding little secrets (it implies backtracking, which I enjoyed too, it had its little details), thinking through battle tactics and hoarding. Plus, I don't mind some grind, so there's that.\n\nArt and soundtrack are judged subjectively, but I liked those a lot, it's simple yet it fits so perfectly. I'm into this kind of aesthetic, so yeah, that counts too.\n\nAnd I know the line of thought in my review is scattered all over the place, so as my thoughts about this game. I started playing it 3 times, 2 of them I quickly lost interest, the 3rd time I'm finally close to finishing it. At least I think so. Would've I lost a lot, if I hadn't played it? I don't think so. Would I recommend it? Yes, somewhat as a piece of culture, if I may say so. It's something that you should play and think through for yourself. The story was quite controversial for me, I don't agree on some things, I don't believe some things, but it made me think a lot. Give it a try, maybe you'll like it.\n\nAnd here could be my staircase joke, but idk, just imagine there is one.", "timestamp_created": 1696528647, "timestamp_updated": 1696528647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522727251052856445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147684715": {"recommendationid": "147684715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273636772", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4155, "last_played": 1699319474}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything about this game is great", "timestamp_created": 1696516274, "timestamp_updated": 1696516274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147683098": {"recommendationid": "147683098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132449920", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1145, "last_played": 1672700441}, "language": "english", "review": "Bruh", "timestamp_created": 1696514416, "timestamp_updated": 1696514416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147682428": {"recommendationid": "147682428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411590344", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1728, "last_played": 1697046723}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent story, excellent game.\nA lot of memories after first walkthrough.

This game will unveil truths and thoughts about yourself that you might've never even known existed, and you can never forget. There is no turning back after you play this game. \n\nBy this point, I've played a fair share of games dealing with mental illnesses/psychological horror, but I don't think any game is able to grasp it as well as Omori. It steadily and subtly introduces new horrors to the player, but most of the time, not in a way that feels forced or \"jumpscare-y\".\n\nThis is probably the best game I've played in the past 5 years. The art style is one of the most creative and recognizable art style's I've seen (I'm also a bit of biased in the form of pixel art, so I understand if not everyone likes that). In addition, I don't think most of the horror/emotional parts of this game would hit so hard if it wasn't for the music. The entire soundtrack has a mix of action/happy/nostalgic/depressing songs, with some songs in particular managing to achieve multiple emotions at once (something I find quite rare in music). The gameplay, for the most part, is pretty standard for a turn-based RPG. Furthermore, I never really found it too difficult (I never got a game over in my first run). That being said, Omori has it's own unique elements that make fighting enemies a lot more fun and creative.\n\nThe theme and writing of this game is unlike anything I've seen before, but I want to leave this mostly spoiler free (and trust me this is way better when you know little about it going into it), so I wont be diving deep into that.

To enjoy the game you have to basically treat the story about the protagonist's trauma as an unimportant C-plot happening in the background.\n\nYou need to be thoroughly focused on what's happening in the otherworld, which is not much: You're searching for this character named Basil. You explore an area, sit through goofy Undertale-style comedy stalling antics, do some very easy RPG combat, and the characters say \"welp, Basil's not here, let's go check the next area\". That's the otherworld plot and you'll be spending 95% of the game doing that.\n\nThe otherworld plot tries to mimic Undertale, but the devs don't seem to understand what made Undertale work. Undertale antagonists have a personal reason why they're trying to stop the protagonist, and the touching moments involve the protagonist in some way. Omori antagonists are just random characters who show up to harass the protagonist for no reason in particular. I do some unimportant quest for a few hours, this character just suddenly attacks me, and then says \"Yeah I have no idea where Basil is. Okay bye.\" Several grueling hours later I'm still looking for Basil, have gained no new information, and the antagonist maybe had a nice moment with their own friends that had nothing to do with the protagonist at all. This is just stalling the plot for nothing.\n\nIt isn't doing something subtextual, and while things in the otherworld are certainly modeled after the real world, they don't really symbolize anything. I.E., a place in the otherworld is named after a place in the real world, that's all. The otherworld segments are not saying anything deeper than that. The game has some interesting ideas with the emotion mechanics and follow-up attacks, but it's pretty basic, you don't have to be trying much at all.\n\nAs for the real-world story about the protagonist, it's more stalling. The prologue gives you almost nothing. After several grueling hours, the end of chapter 1 finally reveals some things about what's happening with the protagonist and his relationships to the other characters, but it features even more characters showing up to attack you for no reason and speaking but giving no info before leaving, just to pad the game time. While it does finally tell you something at that point, it's hard to even be invested in what's happening with Basil in the real world. The times you \"save\" him from the bullies... he was actually just harassing them in the park and they were yelling at him to leave them alone... then I guess to show that they're bad people, they attack you for no reason when you show up. And then after four more hours, the end of chapter 2 gives you literally nothing - it just repeats the same plot points it showed you after chapter 1. No new information has been introduced, and it totally skips whitespace in a cutscene. Four hours of gameplay and nothing about the plot has changed whatsoever. \n\nThe game is basically just wasting your time for nothing. The old \"stall the journey as long as possible to make the destination feel more impactful than it really is\" trick. I definitely can't recommend it to anyone. If it has some compelling story or message to tell, well that's too bad the author chose to stall so much for such superficial reasons, because I won't be finishing it.", "timestamp_created": 1696227376, "timestamp_updated": 1696260350, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462433516979217529", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147484683": {"recommendationid": "147484683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198877458628", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1695759380}, "language": "english", "review": "yas", "timestamp_created": 1696224216, "timestamp_updated": 1696224216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147483445": {"recommendationid": "147483445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048899524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1439, "last_played": 1696566014}, "language": "english", "review": "I know the game is about forgiving yourself and all but I don't know if I can ever forgive myself for picking up this game", "timestamp_created": 1696221965, "timestamp_updated": 1696221965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781227946281433105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147483288": {"recommendationid": "147483288", "author": {"steamid": "76561199517899555", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 2262, "last_played": 1700618044}, "language": "english", "review": "ok this looks like a normal 2d game right?

The game's story is truly something else, I'm speechless. The narrative had a lot of twist and turns and fooled me multiple times. Although i recommend this game for its narrative, the game play loop gets really stale after a while, especially in the middle of the game. In the dream world, the story is all over the place and dialogue felt like it was written by a middle schooler, which might be what they were going for, but i just found myself dragging through story and characters i just didn't care about, like the shark guy and the pink princess. The real world segment was incredibly enjoyable though, and i found the contrast between the dream world and the real world really appealing. The story touches on some dark topics like depression, regret, fear and self hatred and the game managed to pull it together really well. Overall 9/10, the story is incredible, although the repetitive gameplay loop stops the game from being a 10/10 in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1695795647, "timestamp_updated": 1695795647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493421047925949097", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147108789": {"recommendationid": "147108789", "author": {"steamid": "76561199383191640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "playtime_at_review": 2009, "last_played": 1700278788}, "language": "english", "review": "mentally ill little children yes", "timestamp_created": 1695791943, "timestamp_updated": 1695791943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511945366859436035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147103621": {"recommendationid": "147103621", "author": {"steamid": "76561199097618862", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3063, "last_played": 1691810861}, "language": "english", "review": "I just want to thank the devs,\n\nOMORI came into my life at the perfect moment, and I am beyond glad to have had this experience with my during such a rough point in my life.

Like doing side quests, seeing how many npcs you can talk with, and getting cool rewards. There's also tense moments in the game that actually made me jump and panic a bit. Like wow, havent played a game like this since UnderTale. and Im like right in the middle of the game. I still dont know much about the game yet.

[/h1] \n[u] I just wanted to say that I am not a game critic. Everything that I'm about to say is entirely my opinion. [/u]\n\n\nI am not a big fan of RPGs. I find turn-based combat to be tedious and annoying, because it feels like you barely have any control over what's happening. I was hesitant to play this game at first, but my friend convinced me into playing it somehow. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, this game would be different. And after about 20 hours of playing the game, I can safely say, without a doubt, that Omori is not a good game. It is almost exactly like I thought it would be. It would be harsh of me to say that it's bad, but it does have a few problems that weigh it down. This might seem very petty, but I'll get back to this later. For now, I want to talk about the things I like about the game, because it does offer some neat stuff.\n\n\n\nPros: \n\nI want to start off by getting the obvious out of the way. The story (From what I've played) is good. Most of the characters, even though they are quite simple, are pretty like-able. I've never really felt emotional during the game however. though I guess that's not something I should be saying since I'm a heartless bastard, and I barely get emotional towards anything. I really don't have any gripes with the story that I can think of [spoiler] although I find it kinda weird that the game lets you choose your own name later on, when his \"Canonical\" (which is a word that I hate) is Sunny. It gets a little weird later on when the characters say something like \"Your sister passed away, Poo\" during what's supposed to be emotional moments. Again, this is nit-picky, and also kinda your own choice, so I won't count this as a negative. [/spoiler] Oh yeah there is one problem that I have with the story, but we'll get there later on, as it sort of ties into something else I will be talking about later in the review. But over-all, I really can't say that the story is bad. Maybe the best part of the game, though to be fair, I'm only about halfway through. \n\nThe artstyle and animations are very good and well-made. Especially the hand-drawn stuff. It almost makes me wish that the entire game was hand-drawn and that there wasn't any pixel-art. [spoiler] Except for the clay monsters, they're pretty cool and stand out since they are made from clay. [/spoiler]\n\nThe music is decent, though probably nothing I'd listen to in my free time.\n\nThe gameplay is both part of the good and the bad of the game. For now, let's talk about what's good about the gameplay: The side-quests are pretty fun. Nothing ground-breaking, and they don't give you much for doing them, but they're service-able. Most of the time they're just fetch-quests, but the places are usually pretty fun to explore. Another thing I'd like to mention is the combat. Now, even as someone who isn't a big fan of turn-based combat, Omori has some pretty cool ideas. It's pretty interesting and it has a few things going for it. There are 3 emotions; [spoiler] (technically 4) [/spoiler] Anger, happiness and sadness. [spoiler] there's also fear, which is a pretty interesting addition. It adds both to the gameplay and story, but mostly the story. Fear is the worst out of all the emotions, making you practically useless. It's also the rarest out of all the emotions, because none of your team-mates have any skills to make you afraid. [/spoiler] The combat is basically a more complicated version of rock-paper-scissors, with RPG turn-based combat fused together with it. Anger deals more damage to sadness, happiness deals more damage to anger, and sadness deals more damage to happiness. There's also neutral, which is basically in between it all. Everyone in your group have different skills, Omori having the ability to make people sad, Aubrey having the ability to make people happy, Kel having the ability to make people angry, and Hero, who... Well... He just cooks. There's a bit more to the combat than that, but these are just the basics. It can be pretty fun, however, there are at least two problems with the combat that ruin it all.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n[spoiler] first off, let's talk about my one gripe with the story: spoiler At one point in the game, you're in the real world, and Kel knocks on the door. You get the option to either open the door, or to not answer. Depending on which answer you choose, you get one out of two routes. If you choose to not answer the door, you apparently get a more gameplay-focused route. If you do choose to open the door, you get a more story-focused route. This is fine on paper, but in execution, it's not handled well. You see, this choice changes the story, meaning that this is a very big decision. Luckily, I happened to know about this, due to my friend telling me. But still. There should be at least SOME indication that this choice will cause big changes to the story. I get that you can just reload to your last save or whatever, but what if you haven't saved in a while? Or you didn't think this would change much, so you decide to overwrite your last save? What's worse is that this is basically the ONE choice in the ENTIRE GAME that matters this much. So you have basically no reason to think that this will change the story much. I think they could have handled this a bit better. [/spoiler]\n\nThe difficulty: Oh my god is the difficulty balance absolutely horrible. After the first hour or so, the game throws you right in, expecting you to understand everything, because the game wants you to do a bunch of endless grinding, when the combat isn't even that fun. I may like some of the ideas the combat has, but it's not fun enough for you to fight a million enemies just so that you can beat the next boss. The game has an identity crisis. It tries to have a compelling story, and at the same time be a pok\u00e9mon game or something. People might say something along the lines of \"Well, the game isn't supposed to have great gameplay, it focuses more on story\", except that isn't even fucking true, because the game DOES focus on gameplay. It wants you to do a bunch of endless stupid fucking grinding, because if you don't do a bunch of endless stupid fucking grinding, you can't even BEAT THE STUPID FUCKING BOSSES AND MAKE ANY PROGRESS, NO MATTER WHAT ROUTE YOU CHOOSE! It's dumb. It's really dumb. But I'm not done yet. Because you know what? I could forgive the last two things I just pointed out, if it wasn't for one more flaw, which we'll talk about right now. The flaw that ruins the entire flow of the combat.\n\nThe one flaw that ruins the entire flow of the combat:\nYou see, during combat, the enemy can sometimes attack you in the middle of your turn. Now, at first, you might not think much of it, but when you really think about it, this addition doesn't make sense or work at all. And trust me, it gets VERY annoying later in the game. You might be thinking \"What's wrong with this? It adds more challenge to the combat. Isn't that a good thing?\" and you might be right for thinking that. But the truth is, doesn't it kinda ruin the point of turn-based combat? Isn't the point of turn-based combat for there to be... You know... TURNS!? For you to plan your next move based on the enemy's attacks? Here, you can't even do that, because the enemy is so unpredictable. It ends up with the enemy killing someone part of your team, and then making you waste a healing item, because yes, if you were planning on using a healing item on someone with low health and they die during a turn, you will waste the healing item, and it will instead go to Omori. Who the hell thought this was a good idea? I completely disagree with this addition to the turn-based combat.\n\nOver-all, I'm giving Omori a 6/10. If you're really into turn-based combat, or you wanna support the devs, then maybe I'd recommend. Otherwise, you're better off watching a 5 hour long youtube analysis.", "timestamp_created": 1695303811, "timestamp_updated": 1695304496, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146706321": {"recommendationid": "146706321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408793050", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1544, "last_played": 1695544105}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely wonderful! <3 <3 <3\nThough I wish there's a steam cloud cuz I accidentally lost my save files once OTL", "timestamp_created": 1695301965, "timestamp_updated": 1695301965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146705739": {"recommendationid": "146705739", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076023382", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1570, "last_played": 1695806570}, "language": "english", "review": "A Masterpiece, Its so amazing, depressing yet just, wow.", "timestamp_created": 1695301263, "timestamp_updated": 1695301263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146695710": {"recommendationid": "146695710", "author": {"steamid": "76561199206564122", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 792, "last_played": 1695287612}, "language": "english", "review": "this game cured my depression and game it back to me in the span of 5 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1695285485, "timestamp_updated": 1695285485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146693470": {"recommendationid": "146693470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045815182", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2779, "last_played": 1695280790}, "language": "english", "review": "for the intended experience, do not play this game on antidepressants", "timestamp_created": 1695281096, "timestamp_updated": 1695281096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146692112": {"recommendationid": "146692112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150818803", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1436, "last_played": 1695351889}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a 10/10\nSince a finished it I haven't been able to stop thinking about it! \nIt's slow at points that feel sorta like a drag, but I think it adds to the story in a way.

I already did everything there is to do on the console release and I certainly plan to 100% this version of the game as well.\nThis is one of the greatest games ever made. Genuinely, the only story in any video game to genuinely bring me to tears. It is absolutely beautiful and it's depictions of trauma and grief are absolutely incredible, as you get to see more than 1 side of both. You get to understand how all the characters grieve for their lost friend and you get to see the differences between how SUNNY and BASIL handled their traumatic experience. The only thing I can even slightly complain about is the gameplay, which is boring and repetitive once you've figured it out. I highly recommend installing mods to increase the difficulty/add more diversity in how you play the game.\n100/10. Amazing game. If only another game could come even close to it.

The story is amazing, and is only further perfected by the emotional music and the incredible characters who you can easily get attached to. The game is $20, but it is absolutely worth every dollar. I highly recommend playing this game without looking anything up as to avoid spoilers because nothing beats that first playthrough where you don't know what's coming next.

Definitivamente, donde m\u00e1s relucen las mec\u00e1nicas como los sentimientos es con los jefes. La variedad de ataques que hay por cada personaje evita que las batallas sean s\u00f3lo spammear un bot\u00f3n, sino que te hace pensar en alguna estrategia y as\u00ed cada personaje toma un rol.\n\nEn cuanto a la historia, es lo que m\u00e1s destaca de este juego. Sabes que hay algo que est\u00e1 muy mal, el juego te confunde a prop\u00f3sito y luego empiezas a conectar todas las piezas. Paulatinamente, se te va desvelando la historia a un ritmo adecuado. Es cierto que algunas zonas se sent\u00edan de relleno (en especial la parte de Humphrey o la mazmorra de Sweetheart), pero se puede justificar con lo que se supone que es Omori para Sunny. La simbolog\u00eda que maneja OMORI es excepcional, todas las zonas tienen su porqu\u00e9, su significado; las met\u00e1foras y la manipulaci\u00f3n de las acciones del jugador est\u00e1n muy bien llevadas.\n\nA pesar de que no me ha ocurrido ni de cerca lo mismo que en el juego, puedo llegar a comprender f\u00e1cilmente lo que se siente el sufrir en soledad y hasta puedo empatizar con algunos momentos clave. Este juego da miedo por lo absurdamente crudo que es, te hace consciente de que en cualquier momento tu vida puede cambiar por completo, consecuencia de cualquier m\u00ednima acci\u00f3n. Nunca se est\u00e1 preparado para la impredecibilidad de la existencia misma y la consciencia es el peor enemigo de la sanidad mental.\n\nOMORI plasma la natural incapacidad humana de enga\u00f1arse a s\u00ed mismo al ir deteriorando progresivamente la estabilidad mental de alguien que intenta vivir una realidad autosaboteada.", "timestamp_created": 1694453731, "timestamp_updated": 1694621689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146124799": {"recommendationid": "146124799", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072479189", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1634, "last_played": 1694249566}, "language": "english", "review": "I was pretty skeptical going in, but this game did a great job keeping me engaged with it's story and characters, and making me truly feel immersed and caring about what was at stake.

This is one of the best games I've played, and already I can tell it will be the closest to my heart. Where do I even begin? The headspace portions of the game are absolutely wonderful, they're full of vibrant locations and striking scenery. It all looks so cute. Whenever I played through them, I had a big smile on my face and that is RARE. It has a dreamlike and childish quality in the best sense possible, I'm not exaggerating at all when I say that playing this game made me feel like a kid again. Maybe a little too much, actually, since I actually got a bit depressed from reminiscing :,) It's sense of humor was amazing, I don't think I can count how many times I chuckled from it's situational comedy or silliness. The portions in Faraway town are completely different, but in a good way. It has a more grounded tone and things are taken more seriously in these portions. Not to say it's all moody or devoid of humor, but it's just different. And they're absolutely perfect too. Seeing all of these characters interact was amazing, and seeing them work through their problems was even better. I actually caught myself wanting to go back to these portions whenever I started a headspace portion, though those thoughts were quickly silenced by how amazing they were, lol. And that's the thing, every single portion is absolutely lovely and perfect. One aspect is the clear winner though, and that's the psychological horror aspect of the game. It crops up whenever you least expect it, taking you by surprise. They never last too long throughout the game, just being as long as they need to. They're sprinkled throughout the game, up until the ending, where the horror finally takes front and center. And while this game may be silly and fun at times, what it really is in it's core is about trauma, and how the characters react to and deal with it. Loss is a central theme in this game, it hangs over the entirety of the real world sections, and it warps and distorts the black space section. The aesthetics of it all really take it up, looking like something a traumatized child would imagine. And that's because it is. The game confronts its protagonist for his sins, and every second of it is a horrific portrayal of trauma and depression. (MAJOR SPOILERS)\n\n\n Some visuals really stick out, as really, really, horrifying, like the image of Mari's lifeless body hanging from the tree. It really picks Sunny's brain and delves into all of his trauma due to Mari's death. But once you get through it all, you're met with this powerful, beautiful part where Sunny remembers his most treasured memories and decides to meet with the truth, and rises above his trauma. The final boss fight is so empowering that you almost get choked up, and the scene where Sunny and Mari finally get to do their duet and perform after never getting the chance to almost. made me bawl my eyes out. I don't ever cry when consuming media, but this is the closest i've ever gotten to it, I wish I could have to. be honest and let out all that emotion because that performance is the most emotional scene I have ever seen in a game. At the end of it all, Sunny learns to keep moving forward, and to forgive himself and accept the truth. It's an empowering and emotional ending to a game that i'll come to cherish. Omori is a game with no counterpart. I have no reservations calling it one of the greatest games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1694407361, "timestamp_updated": 1694407361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146096346": {"recommendationid": "146096346", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961823426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1226, "last_played": 1698371099}, "language": "english", "review": "Please stop scrolling and just buy the game to avoid spoilers.

The game play at first comes across like a typical 2013 rpg maker game but the level of detail and exploration available grant it much more praise. The combat is refreshing with an emotion system that affects the stats of your party along with enemies and there is a  follow-up system used during combat so the turn based mechanics have a bit more interaction. The graphics are simple and appealing to the eye, cute and at times disturbing. What I appreciate most visually are the hand drawn cut scenes and images you encounter throughout the story, as well as hidden easter eggs. Sound design is spot on for the story and game play, it can go from something reminiscent to 90s SNES rpg battle music to foreboding and uncomfortable tones and it all fits well. The story took me by surprise, themes of isolation, childhood trauma and suppressed thoughts are commonplace and done tastefully and creatively but there was much more I did not expect. As I carried on playing I would lose track of time, eager to see what would happen next as I became quite invested in the characters. Not many games have a story that keeps me wanting more, like a book I can't put down, but Omori is certainly near the top of the list. I would implore anyone that enjoys dark psychological stories and rpgs to give this game a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1694384268, "timestamp_updated": 1694384268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3,

If you have played the game, and you like it for the emotional support it gave you, then please do not read the rest of this because it will just upset you.\n\nThe gameplay is uninspired and not rewarding, however, no one talks about this game in that regard as it is the story of Omori that seems to really hook others. If you are looking for RPG maker games with an interesting combat system alone, look elsewhere.\n\nI'm going to try to voice what didn't work for me about Omori's story with minimal spoilers:\n\nFans of Omori's story often attribute the story to being a deep dive into depression and struggles with self harm. However, the ending of the game opts to instead discard any notion of this. This game's story is better understood through the lens of selfishness and guilt. A selfishness that a keen player will notice does not dissipate even once the game comes to a close. Sunny (the main character) is seen in the eyes of the narrative as a victim when he provides nothing for his friends and asks for everything in return. It is laughable to believe the story when it says that group of kids were friends as there is absolutely no reason for Sunny to be anything more than tolerated by them. \n\nWithout detail, but still some might consider this a spoiler, the story ends with a conclusion that sees Sunny persuaded to do the right thing about his past actions not because of a moral obligation or duty to a higher virtue, but is instead convinced by the thought that his friends will certainly forgive him. His actions are a poor model for others, and the fact that the creator seems to endorse the mindset and behavior of Sunny is worrying and appalling. \n\nThis game could retain large sweeps of its story and be great if the message wasn't so twisted by a need to make this poor behavior seem noble or correct. I played through Omori with the hope that I could see what others were seeing in this game. I absolutely adore stories that speak on dark themes or have complicated characters, but this story is not thought out and displays a dangerous selfishness without labeling it as such. I believe that most people who enjoy the game's story are good people, and most likely, they just ignore or have written off where this story has failed them as players. The aesthetic of Omori helps in enthralling some players to overlook these things, but if you are someone who has yet to play this game, I am telling you that it is not worth your time. If you decide to play it anyway, and you like it, then great, don't let anyone take that away from you, but please at least take the time to consider what the story might really be saying and how you inform or respond to it.", "timestamp_created": 1694372148, "timestamp_updated": 1694372148, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146074022": {"recommendationid": "146074022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198796377187", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 683, "last_played": 1695408328}, "language": "english", "review": "very touching and beautiful game", "timestamp_created": 1694371168, "timestamp_updated": 1694371168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146073554": {"recommendationid": "146073554", "author": {"steamid": "76561199233656063", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1700777430}, "language": "english", "review": "overall pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1694370727, "timestamp_updated": 1694370727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146065358": {"recommendationid": "146065358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398823761", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1211, "last_played": 1694362532}, "language": "english", "review": "The game feels like a nice tale about how someone overcomes their depression, anxiety and mental issues through the power of friendship and self-love and love for others.

The battle mechanics are engaging, the boss battles are exciting, and the music is fantastic.

On top of all that, the story is full of mystery and intrigue that only give you more questions the farther you get into it. This drip feed of vague information Omori constantly gives you, pushes the player forward until its ultimate climax. Out of all the games out there, this one is a cut above the rest. It deserves to be experienced and rewards those who complete it. To those of you who read this and decide to check it out, just remember to water Basil's plants. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1694300634, "timestamp_updated": 1694300634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146012185": {"recommendationid": "146012185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198846356072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2129, "last_played": 1694280095}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a good game i had to write my own review for the first time! (a lengthy one for anyone interested in the opinion of strangers)\n\n->P L O T\nThe player assumes the role of Omori, the alter ego of a teenager. The world is split in two sides: Faraway Town represents reality, while HeadSpace (as the name suggests) is an imaginary place, Omori's escape from reality. The story follows Omori and his friends on their journey to find someone missing, oscillating back to the teenager's reality and so forth. The main themes and motives include friendship, family, grief, redemption, anxiety, depression, suicide ( and many others ofc). \n\nAs a depressed fellow myself, there were many aspects of the story I related to on a deeply personal level. Regardless, I find that the story can be appealing to just about anyone, as it is a wonderful mix between wholesome and disturbing( on a psychological level). OMORI combines joy and sorrow, tangling these two polar concepts successfully!\n\n( TLDR: This game will heal your poor little heart and then stomp on it with no hesitation. Then heal it again and repeat the process. You will ugly cry for hours)\n\n-> G A M E P L A Y\nThe lengthyyyyyyyyyyyy duration of the game is no worry as it keeps the player entertained with lots of fun and exciting mini side quests (optional) , as well as diverse foes (some cuter than others) to challenge using your own skills, weapons, charms and so on. Grinding is possible but definitely not necessary to advance. Difficulty is easy to medium, any foe can be defeated with a bit of planning and strategy, if none at all,  in this humble stranger's opinion. Even after finishing the game, I intend to play again knowing there are still loooooooooots of things to do and discover.\n\n(TLDR: Very fun, will keep u constantly entertained. Friendly for noobs like myself)\n\n->G R A P H I C S\nStunning. Fantastic. Amazing. Spectacular. Marvelous. Splendid. Excellent.\nI was captivated by the charming 8 bit pixel style, as well as the hand drawn sketchbook visuals. Wonderful use of colors (or lack of when necessary). \n\n(TLDR: Pretty af)\n\n-> M U S I C\nThe soundtrack of OMORI has become my favorite after finishing the game. It has everything from catchy playful tunes to heartbreaking sounds of piano and violin. I find it hard to describe music with words, but in terms of feelings the soundtracks adjusted to them accordingly. I have never felt so disturbed by ominous and eerie music before. It makes you feel....the sound of emptiness. Of course, heartwarming joy, happiness, or relief is also present when needed.\n\n(TLDR: It's like a shawarma with everything. That everything being every emotion on the spectrum)\n\n-> P R I C E \nMaybe not the most student friendly at first, but after playing, I can proudly say that i would use my entire life savings on this game if I could. Omocat, please take all my peasant money.\n\n->C O N C L U S I O N S\nOverall, this game was a 10/10 for me, I have nothing but praise for the work put into it. \nIt is heavy mentally, so I advise being careful before playing. It triggered unpleasant memories in me, but even so, OMORI has a special place in my heart after such an impact. It was really wholesome and funny, bringing a smile to my face while playing. There is a high probability that the game will change your perspective in life. Thank you, OMORI, for showing such raw, pure, nostalgic and infantile emotions to me, taking me back to an uncensored past and back again in the reality where my life goes on, but grows from every memory I have created. \n\nAnd THANK YOU, kind reader, for reaching the end of my review. I wish I could re experience OMORI, but I hope you have/had as much of a special experience with this game as I did :) .\n\nP.S. I strongly advise you to have a couple packs of tissues prepared before playing.

As a matter of fact, they are a necessity to remind individuals such as myself to forgive ourselves, trust ourselves, love ourselves and simply remember that our mistakes, imperfections and scars don't define the rest of our lives and who we are. To be able to deliver such strong messages is no easy task, but Omori just nails it splendidly; Although this game starts its storytelling process with a bang and there's lots of tension, mystery and suspension there right from the beginning, Omori takes it time beautifully to build everything up and prepare you for one of the most gut-wrenching endings in video games history. The shift between the tones of the more lighthearted parts of the game and the bleak and scary parts is the magic of the storytelling of Omori. Yes, all the sweet details here and there and the metaphorical and environmental storytelling is great, but what makes Omori unforgettable is the hard hitting dose of protagonist's real life in contrast of all the cute moments in Omori's universe or all the funny interactions between the gang... It just gets you.\nNot wanting to give away much about the story, let's move on to the gameplay! There's a lot to unpack here! There's this unique and interesting take on jrpg's turned based combat style in which offers you some new mechanics that are really fun to play around with. At the beginning of the game, the combat might seem a little confusing to the players who are not that familiar with turned based combat systems, but there's no need to worry cause the game does a great job at explaining the mechanics to the player. Just remember that if you want the combat to remains challenging. avoid grinding... Specially at Orange Oasis' Pyramid; You can just fly to the maximum level there. Aside from the combat there are many of puzzles and some mini games to keep things fresh and more fun, but not all of them are right there in front of you; Keep an eye open for these rewarding experiences.\nAND what can I say about the gorgeous eye candy art-style and character design of Omori that hasn't been said thousands of times before? The visuals are one of the two most important selling points of this game. You just gotta see everything for yourself. \nOverall, Yeah, I totally recommend this game. It's truly one of the best gaming experiences I ever had.

There are a lot of details in this game, everytime I replay Omori, I always notice things I haven't previously noticed.\n\n5 stars, 10000000000000000000000/10.", "timestamp_created": 1693946332, "timestamp_updated": 1693946332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145724045": {"recommendationid": "145724045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183327821", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7150, "last_played": 1658086560}, "language": "english", "review": "god damn this game didn't help with my depression fuck this game buy it now this game sucks so much ass you gotta buy it NOW i hate this game so much im buying merch right now to show how much i dislike this game", "timestamp_created": 1693940276, "timestamp_updated": 1693940276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145721521": {"recommendationid": "145721521", "author": {"steamid": "76561199231085129", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1694969868}, "language": "english", "review": "omroi1!!!1!", "timestamp_created": 1693937027, "timestamp_updated": 1693937027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145718342": {"recommendationid": "145718342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198960008118", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1492, "last_played": 1698861263}, "language": "english", "review": "This is special.

It's difficult to explain the wide range of emotions I experienced throughout my playthrough, because it made me think and reminisce about everything that has ever been in my life thus far. I consider myself a person that is never truthful about how he truly feels and someone who never shares their feelings and thoughts, I am someone who doesn't cry in front of others and never complains about how bad it is, and that's fine because that's just the way I had to grow up to survive.\n\nI've never played a video game that has made me just sit back and [b] really [/b] think about everything that has led me up to this point in time. Many memories resurfaced again, it made me think about the childhood that I never had, friends that I could never get, things I never got to experience, about someone that was special to me, and about people that have long left the world. \n\nIt all made me realize how truly miserable I feel, because I've always believed that I was numb to everything, but the reality is that I was feeling so much to the point where I've had to subconsciously numb myself to run away from it. I think the reason the game resonated so much with me is because I saw myself in Sunny, because we aren't really that different, we both locked ourselves away and shut out the whole world in order to protect ourselves and cope with the pain.\n\nThroughout the game while playing as Sunny, I was trying to right his wrongs and guide him down a better path, because in a way it felt like I was trying to fix my younger self while also making sure that Sunny doesn't end up the way I did. I've felt constant anguish ever since finishing the game and even now while writing this wall of text I still feel the same. I cannot help but think about the past that could've been and wishing that things could've gone differently. \n\nPeople always talk about seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and how things get better, but my approach to life has always been to just try and be comfortable living in the dark, because it doesn't get better. But if there was a way to start life all over again then I would gladly take that chance, the things I would give just to be able to go back and have the things that I never got, like being a kid and have a chance at a normal life while being surrounded with love and having tons of friends to hangout with without having a single care in the world. \n\nBut it's too late for that.\n\n\n\nNo other game comes close to what this one made me feel, it's easily deserving of a 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1693625875, "timestamp_updated": 1693641055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534883737564086914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145495145": {"recommendationid": "145495145", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086838466", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1340, "last_played": 1693548615}, "language": "english", "review": "Soul Draining but a great game on mental illness and friendship", "timestamp_created": 1693625188, "timestamp_updated": 1693625188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145493978": {"recommendationid": "145493978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116328634", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2310, "last_played": 1693547113}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah, its pretty fun.", "timestamp_created": 1693623537, "timestamp_updated": 1693623537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145488454": {"recommendationid": "145488454", "author": {"steamid": "76561199053019841", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3581, "last_played": 1693856232}, "language": "english", "review": "[spoiler] what the fuck [/spoiler]\n[spoiler] did i play?

There is additional content to do after you initially beat the game, but at the time of this review I have not done any of it.\n\nMy positive points, it most excels with its excellent story. The OST is well done and unique, and stands out from other games, enough to make it easily recognizable. The bosses of the game are fairly memorable, and stand out quite well. When I flex, I feel my best. There is the right amount of comedy, mixed in with drama inside Omori, the overall flow of the game is very good. As a result, this game is an emotional rollercoaster and does an incredible job at it. \n\nMy negative points, the \"Quest Log\" isn't all that helpful, and doesn't seem to provide much insight into finishing any quests. Combat has an interesting mechanic to start, but slowly grows dull. By the 10 hour mark, you'll be bored against regular enemies as the same cycle continues to repeat itself. Some of the MSQ doesn't make any sense, its like the writers had an idea and just squeezed it in randomly because it seemed interesting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for an easier to play game that

[/b]\n[b] In the language of flowers, it symbolizes the phrase\u2026 [/b]\n[b] \"My thoughts will follow you into your dreams.\u201d [/b]\n[hr][/hr]\nAugust 26, 2023, a night of indelible memories and a dawn that shall forever remain unexpunged from the corridors of my mind, accentuated by the mellifluous serenade of birdsong outside my window, juxtaposed against the ineffable tears tracing their paths down my visage. On this date, I completed [b] OMORI [/b] for the first time.\n\n[b] This game, profoundly, embraced my soul. [/b]\n\nI pen down these words while reflecting upon each nook and cranny of my soul that [b] OMORI [/b] has touched, gently yet unabashedly. The fingers that grace my keyboard now are the very ones that aspire to caress the melodies of \"Duet\" on the most delicate of pianos and violins. Even though my vision is blurred by tears that could form rivers, never before have I perceived with greater clarity the message this game aims to convey, in the most exquisite manner I have ever witnessed.\n\nThe beauty intrinsic to this game is a concept that eludes my capacity for expression, given the deeply personal and intricate impact it has evoked within me. The most intriguing fact is that, on a personal note, I've always been passionate about writing. However, [b] OMORI [/b] has proven to me that words often fall short in capturing such significant moments. In addition, an enduring passion of mine has perpetually been photography, owing to the profound ability it confers upon us to encapsulate moments within the unfathomable expanse of time. In the pulchritudinous universe of [b] OMORI, [/b] however, the art of photography beckoned me into a cycle of unbroken introspection before my mirror, compelling me to inquire into the very essence of my emotions and thoughts.\n\n[b] OMORI [/b] prompted me to revisit a vital query pertaining to the continuity of our existence concerning what we can express, in its raw and unadulterated form, as human beings: \n\n[b] What constitutes art? [/b]\n\nArt, that effervescent alchemy of the human spirit, stands as the purest manifestation of our pursuit of transcendence. It does not merely interlace pigments or sculpt forms; rather, it is the language of the soul, unveiling the concealed mysteries of our inner world.\n\nIn [b] OMORI, [/b] as exemplified by the duality between Headspace and Faraway Town, art in the form of expression confronts us with reality and dreams, often concurrently. It presents the hues of the heart and the nuances of our deepest aspirations. Every brushstroke, every note, every line traced is a glimpse of our being, an invitation to delve into the mosaic of human emotions.\n\nThrough this art, we embark upon realms that elude the grasp of time. The creations are not mere artifacts; rather, they are gateways ushering us into realms of contemplation and connection. The dance of colors on a canvas, the evocative melody of a song (The notes of [b] OMORI's [/b] soundtrack reside eternally in my heart as evidence of immortality), the silent narrative of a sculpture \u2014 all these are intimate dialogues, resonating with the echoes of our innermost thoughts.\n\nIn the most profoundly personal sense, [b] OMORI [/b] has been, is, and will continue to be a journey of self-discovery, an introspection that surpasses the superficial and delves into the depths. Art unveils layers of our psyche that often lie unexplored. It challenges us to confront our fears, our hopes, our emotional scars. And, in doing so, it aids us in embracing and comprehending our very [i] humanity. [/i]\n\n[b] OMORI [/b] has taught me that art is the poetry of our existence, translating the nuances of life into forms that elude the limitations of language. It enables us to scream in silence, to smile with tears in our eyes, and to dance on the wings of imagination. In every stroke, there is a sigh; in every hue, an echo of the heart. It is the dance of life and soul intertwined, a testament that we are more than flesh and bone - we are the very essence of expression.\n\nThis game has not solely imparted to me insights into the resplendent concept of art through my personal interpretation and experience, but has also become a haven for an inquiry that arises as a contemplative quandary for all individuals who dare to cast a fleeting glance upon that which, in its profound essence, finds refuge within our souls: \n\n[b] What truly defines love? [/b]\n\nThe response pertaining to the aforementioned subject guides us towards an answer that intertwines with a question: \n\nCan [b] art [/b] truly encapsulate the essence of [b] love [/b] within its definition?\n\n[b] Love [/b] embodies [i] forgiveness. [/i]\n[b] Love [/b] embodies [i] hope. [/i]\n\nIf, by means of simple words, we are able to encapsulate the expansiveness of this concept, then in culmination, I write:\n\n[b] OMORI [/b] is an art form.\n[b] OMORI [/b] is a manifestation of love (hope).\n[b] OMORI [/b] is the embodiment of the artistry of learning to love and forgive oneself.\n\nThis game is a fragment of my love.\nIf you, specifically you who knows that you are you, are reading this, I hope you always find the significance beyond the lexicality of \"less than\" to \"hash\".\n\nIf you, reader, have perused this review, which has functioned as an endeavor to articulate an array of ruminations and sentiments dwelling within my soul through the conduit of writing, until its ultimate culmination, my aspiration is that it has stirred a resonance within you.\n\nIf you find yourself adequately poised for this, play [b] OMORI. [/b]\n[b] P.S. [/b] However, I want it to be clear that this game is [b] not [/b] for everyone; it is exceptionally unique in how it addresses sensitive subjects.\n\nIn the event that your decision leads you to embark upon this experience:\nI sincerely hope you uncover the depth of conceptualizing your own unique [i] humanity [/i] throughout this game, one that has reached the depths of my soul in a manner beyond adequate articulation, I aspire for it to similarly resonate with your own being.\n\nThe technical lexicon of a meticulous analysis of this game can never truly equate to its abstraction. \nWords would never suffice, regardless of the allowed character limit.\n\nNo game has been, is or ever will be like [b] OMORI.

The writing I did has only one goal: to make a conclusion of my own thoughts and emotions that came up in my mind throughout playing this game.\n\nI came to Omori as a normal, mentally stable fellow, without that many sad and depressing thoughts before playing. I consider myself a person who will never complain to somebody about my emotions and thoughts. I'll never cry to anyone and will never say how bad I'm feeling; that's okay for me. I never had depression and expected nothing from this game. A month ago, I decided to finally quit video games because of the intensive studies that are going to begin this September. I'll have to move to a completely new country for me, alone. I will work hard, and there is no way I could spend my free time in front of a computer. I considered Omori as my last single-player video game of my teenage years and for the foreseeable future.\n\nMy first play was at night. Being completely alone helped me understand this game correctly. My first session lasted for six non-stop hours, and I've never felt what I felt during this play. There is no other video game that is able to make you feel that blank post-gaming syndrome constantly, like Omori did. I felt it from the beginning until the end, whether I was in front of a computer or not. I'm still wondering if this \"hollow\" feeling will ever fully leave me. When I decided that this is enough for today, I went to the bathroom and spent almost an hour there, thinking. The main subject was my childhood.\n\nThe thoughts of my childhood became a sad ghost that follows me every night and day. I think about it every time I have to solve some task about my university admission or studies, every time I walk through a place that was special only for you and a few people you knew back then. Do they still remember it as I do? Do they still cherish it as I do? Will they ever come back here with a desperate hope of seeing some of us or just to see it again?\n\nThat night, I felt completely miserable. There is no way to get back there. There is no way I could ever talk to all my good old friends again, no way we could gather again and do the things that kids like us usually did. Some part of them is lost in a big city with their own troubles. I'm sure that they have forgotten how great it was together. Some have left the country forever, and some are even dead. Money wasn't a concern in my childhood. There was no war, and I wasn't afraid that I'd never see my parents again due to a Russian rocket attack. When I was 12, my only worry was spending another summer with my friends, with a stash of snacks prohibited by my mother, and that limited version of Coca-Cola that is no longer produced. I never thought about all of this before playing OMORI. I never missed my childhood times and never dreamed about those times. Omori's headspace is a mirror of our infantile times we all had and miss.\n\nThis masterpiece is not about gameplay, graphics, or storyline. There is no way you can rate it separately from your own mind and the changes that occur in it during the play. This game is about nostalgic, infantile, pure emotions that emerge from the hidden part of your soul and will never leave you until your death.\n\nThere is a theory of the \"last dream,\" which means that when you die, your brain will produce a last, long dream\u2014some even call it heaven. I am sure that this \"heaven\" will be some kind of headspace, but with your own friends, games, and troubles. I hope that I'll be able to feel these emotions of a little kid who just minds his own business, playing games with friends and dreaming again. Wait for me, my friends. I'll play with you once again, someday. Even if I have to die for this, it'll be a worthy reward. 10/10, the best game I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1693011172, "timestamp_updated": 1693011596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 101, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.882108628749847412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 47558, "total_negative": 1049, "total_reviews": 48607}, "cursors": {"AoJwqovVl4oDf8KcqQQ=": "Thu Nov 23 22:41:45 2023"}}
