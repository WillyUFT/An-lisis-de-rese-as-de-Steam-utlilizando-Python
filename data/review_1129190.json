MC's appearance, gender, sexuality, personality, skin-tone are all customizable but it's not a throwaway thing where it has no bearing on the game. Like if your character wears a lot of accessories, it might be something other characters comment on (as an example). They are also things that can change as the player grows up and develops more.

This is also the first time I've felt moved enough to post a review about something. First of all: if you're an I Was A Teenage Exocolonist fan you're going to LOVE this. That game is a huge comfort game to me and this one is definitely going into that list after this. It's so nice. The vibes? Immaculate? The story? Amazing.\n\nI think ultimately my favorite part of this game is the fact that you're character is just. Allowed to not be okay? You don't get to see that a lot in dating sims, even in Exocolonist. Like you're always comforting the Love Interest but never getting anything back from them. You're allowed to be insecure about stuff, to get upset when bad things happen, you're allowed to feel however you want and the Love Interest and supporting characters are there for you if you've been there for them. I know it's a silly thing to be happy about and to enjoy but as someone who's been having a rough go of it recently its just wonderful to see something like this implemented. It's all so realistic and human to me, and captures it all really well. It's grounded and amazing.\n\nFrankly enough there's enough content in this game that I think it deserves to be a paid game, but I love the fact that there is so much in this free dating sim, and that you have the option to add more if you want to. You can definitely get a full experience without purchasing the DLC. I'm planning on buying the step 1-3 dlc's once I get my paycheck since I already bought the wedding DLC and that was AMAZING as well.

It makes me so happy while playing it and so lonely after it was over. The writer of Our Life writes story lines and characters in a way that makes me feel seen. It gives me hope that there are kind people out there that are worth getting to know and who are understanding of the way I am. The game also made me reflect more about myself and motivate me to be a better person. I would love to have such positive bonds with others in real life the way the characters do in the game and to do so I must do the best I can to better myself so I can find and forge these types of relationships. This game inspires me to work harder to make my little piece in the world better. \n\n(Also can you tell I just finished Baxter's route and felt so sentimental I wrote this post because his issues, fears, and ways of handling his problems are scarily identical to mine? The route gave me enough hope to motivate me to start making some changes to my life so I can reach for what makes me happy too.)\n\nI'm so grateful to the creator and everyone who worked on this game for their hard work and courage in putting their work out there for others to see. I've always felt it takes some serious determination and bravery to put your art out there where others can judge it. But I think they did an amazing job and I wish them luck in their future endeavors! So thank you for creating this game! It's my favorite!\n\nOn that note - yes, I do recommend this game! The base game is free so what do you have to lose by trying it out? I definitely recommend the dlcs too if you end up liking the game!

I love feel-good stuff, too, so this game feels absolutely Made for me\n\non the negative side, some of the options i personally felt uncomfortable answering- the body type related questions in the middle of the story- it doesn't come up in the story as far as i know and i would've much preferred a skip option, but the question comes up Twice and is brief, it's a preference thing. there's also no gender option- you can choose your pronouns and the game assumes your gender based on that alone, which is a little rough.\npreference wise, it's simple, overall without drama, and is a pretty long game! like i said, roughly 16 hours! it's definitely not everyone's thing!! \n\nfinishing up, i absolutely recommend this game. the grip it has on me is fucking wild, if it seems like something you'd like i ABSOLUTELY suggest you play it. i can't wait for the next one, it'll be even better :)) \nthis review is a super silly tone- the first half is, at least, but i do wholeheartedly recommend the game- the pros and cons are fr! i could go on and on about how much i adore this game- i LITERALLY DID this is a LONG ASS REVIEW \ud83d\udc80", "timestamp_created": 1697894002, "timestamp_updated": 1697894002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148574441": {"recommendationid": "148574441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335342914", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1033, "last_played": 1697852202}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing, very cute.", "timestamp_created": 1697852709, "timestamp_updated": 1697852709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148569810": {"recommendationid": "148569810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298673722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1015, "playtime_at_review": 266, "last_played": 1700729496}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1697844929, "timestamp_updated": 1697844929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148544097": {"recommendationid": "148544097", "author": {"steamid": "76561199250248699", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 193, "playtime_at_review": 1461, "last_played": 1700640108}, "language": "english", "review": "this game make me go oonga boonga", "timestamp_created": 1697812978, "timestamp_updated": 1697812978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148530446": {"recommendationid": "148530446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284167146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8547, "last_played": 1698307064}, "language": "english", "review": "literally the best vn I've ever played (and that's saying a lot)\n\n(Baxter my beloved)", "timestamp_created": 1697793693, "timestamp_updated": 1697843166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148515514": {"recommendationid": "148515514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141434433", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2243, "last_played": 1698441976}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a delightful game, I played through it three times already, and because of how customizable it is, every playthrough has been different.", "timestamp_created": 1697762805, "timestamp_updated": 1697762805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148430175": {"recommendationid": "148430175", "author": {"steamid": "76561199534466565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 481, "last_played": 1699155354}, "language": "english", "review": "Super amazing game.

I found Our Life at a very rough time in my life. Playing it brought me comfort and an escape. It made me attached in a way where I wasn't obsessive like other visual novels usually encourage.\nRecently I replayed and it's timeless. I wish I could experience this game for the first time again.\nThe relationships and memories you make in this visual novel made me laugh, cry, and blush. TL;DR: EMOTIONAL!!!\nIt gives you so many options and there are so many ways to interact with the main interest. I promise you won't be bored because it has something for everyone. Plus it isn't over-ally sexual which is hard to find with visual novels. \nThe characters are beautifully written. There's diversity but it doesn't feel forced or over-explained for the sake of being unique. The family dynamics gave me the comfort that I've longed for in games. I liked that they weren't afraid, to be honest and talk about how they felt about the other's actions. Cove was the best companion anyone could ask for. His backstory was masterfully crafted without being over the top. Plus he's a cutie! \nThe visuals and soundtrack are to die for. The music sets the tone for the various situations you get into. The special moment visuals will forever be ingrained in my head. The backgrounds give so much personality to the small CA town that the game is set in. You can tell there was a ton of love put into this project. \nI've never seen a game so charming while tackling so many topics in such a graceful manner that will remain with me for years to come.

So sweet you will get diabetes by the end of the second chapter. I normally dislike the \"boy next door\" trope for an otome because it starts off when you're adults and it's a cheap way to force emotional investment by assuming the past between characters- but this game actually starts off in younger years so you can have the cute meet and form a history with one another. It's an earned attachment, rather than a told one. And the early stages keep things innocent and clean; no weird stuff with kids like some negative reviews insinuate. Those phases are adorable world building with the friends/family, not relationship stuff.\n\nAll the customization is awesome for those who want choice in how your character is presented and what sort of play through you're wanting. It felt weird to try having a crush start before they hit young adults, and I think letting them just be relaxed friends for the first two stages worked awesome for building a rapport with one another and helping each other pursue interests. I've seen different comments about how Cove can turn out, and in my playthrough he steadily developed into a semi-introverted to the larger world but self-assured and happy man who was openly affectionate and supportive of his close circle of friends and girlfriend. A massive growth arc that was sweet to see. Ends with them having a place together, and a home full of pets they couldn't have as kids; they own a business together (I head canon their \"hospitality\" business is them having an oceanside B&B their parents helped them navigate opening that's not far from their home town) while doing nature conservation stuff in their free time because they both love the ocean they grew up with. Very cute \"doing the adulting thing\" for these two and their interests. \n\nI was rooting for Miranda and Terry to be a thing in stage 3, and cheered when they stuck around and it happened in stage 4, instead of them quietly dipping out and never heard from again like some other characters were. Those two were also cute AF and made a sweet couple. Relationships in general are depicted in healthy and sweet ways- from the moms in their long-lasting marriage to Cole's parents getting their much needed divorce and becoming much better people and co-parents who can now chill out with one another for weeks on end and act like a real family during that time. Derek was a sweetheart of a kid and I was glad to see him make a return in the fourth chapter and rocking his glow up and great life. I can see why he eventually got an option in a DLC to be an alt love interest to Cove. The other guy in stage 3, though, blew in like a hurricane of sleaze and felt so shoehorned into the story. He screams try hard, bad news f*ck boy. It was easy to ignore him and continue on with the day/stage; and I kinda wish you could later  have an option to convince your friends to not get in his car and/or go off with him, but my attempts to find that option failed to make it happen. *shrug* Is what it is, I guess. Some people obviously liked him, to get his own DLC eventually, but he wasn't my cup of tea.\n\nI also appreciate how, most of the time, the game acknowledges various little choices in earlier stages. Or, if you do \"moments\" outside the sequential order presented on the menu, later choices will still sometimes acknowledge events of the previous moments that just happened- like relationship status changing or that a memorable thing happened in the little story. There's also a nice attention to detail by changing up sprites for each stage, having clothes or hairstyles altered even for the parents who don't have the more drastic growth/aging differences to account for. \n\nThe main critiques- I only played the main game, haven't gotten the DLCs at the time of the review. I don't know what the DLCs contain for content. But I was somewhat confused by some things in later stages- such as the parents teasing Cove for being a \"trouble maker\"... When he literally never did anything I'd consider \"trouble\"? He's a super well behaved kid, even once he opens up more. Unless you consider completely innocent snuggle sleep in an RV loft for a roadtrip \"trouble\"? If so, that's a stretch for all the teasing he gets. Maybe that was written because of stuff in DLCs they knew would be later coming and perhaps show another facet of Cove? I don't know because I don't have the DLC, but as this was a direct playthrough of the main game, it seemed out of place.\n\nAlso, as kids, Cove and friends would wander the town, go do little treat shopping on the main drag, etc. Parents never seemed bothered by it because it's a small town and they're not leaving it. But then, suddenly, in stage 3 the parents took on weird tones of helicopter parents who were simultaneously infantilizing these 18ish year old kids who are done high school and already semi-independent. Getting all up in their business and pushing for more family moments than in previous chapters, rather than letting them do their own things; and pulling a weird stunt at the farmer's market to \"push\" the couple into splitting off for the morning, and finding out what it's like to shop on their own without parents around. Huh??? It's a really weird trait/event from all the parents given the previously established dynamics. Why would the grown teens have an issue with it? Do the devs forget that teens, especially legally adult teens, LIKE their independence and usually know how to do those basic things already? Things THESE young adults had already been kinda doing since childhood? Why treat them like they've never so much as left their backyard all of a sudden? And if your character shrugs it off and isn't bothered, like the grown adult she is, then COVE will get upset on your behalf for your mothers orchestrating you being \"abandoned\" without warning in the market and say you're just too nice to express how messed up that was to your own moms. What?! No, my character was happy to get away from the suddenly odd acting moms to do her thing and browse with her kinda-almost-boyfriend for tasty treats and produce. No upset what so ever was ever expressed/thought/felt. That \"moment\" was just so weird to include and force into happening.\n\nAlso, there seems to be some small bugs with the game logging different choices, or maybe the devs not fully accounting for some choices. This was a blind playthrough, no foreknowledge of plot going in. So I had my character not take the $20 from Mr Holden at the very beginning because he seemed like an odd man and you shouldn't take money from strangers, but she agreed to meet his son if her moms said okay to her playing with the supposed new neighbor's son. The money is a non-issue and her hanging out with Cove was her own choice after meeting him and thinking he was a nice, if sad, kid who needed a friend. But then, for the rest of the game, every stage had moments of bringing up the initial $20 incident, acting like it was this big secret that might upset Cove because my character had been initially bribed to be his friend, and asking all the way up to stage four if I wanted to finally tell him.

It has trans, gay, straight, demisexual, autistic, neurotypical, neurodivergent, married, divorced, dating, adopted, introverted, extroverted, etc. They fit so many different types of people in without it feeling forced or unnatural which is awesome.\n\nAnd the player character/story options are incredibly customizable. From appearance to sexuality and gender identity to how you feel about your body to how interested or not you are into romance and physical affection. You truly can customize the experience to be how you want.\n\nThe story is amazing. It's so pure and real and doesn't feel forced or unnatural.

You can try to close yourself, that wont work. It'll hit you, as hard as life.\n\nNot too much, not too less. It's like a perfectly refined needle who's only job is to pierce through your heart.\n\nI'm pretty tough in terms of mental stability, i can handle most things without much difficulties, but sometimes, its just too well done and thats exactly what i was searching and what i needed.\n\nThis game have the perfect title : Its Life. Everything in the actual life of a young boy and teenage boy is here, the fears, the discoveries, the fun parts, family, love, etc ...\n\nAt the same time, i say to yourself \"They have a beautiful life\"\n\nWhat is mine in comparrison ? And that's what hit the hardest ! In the actual society, nobody will probably be able to have this kind of life, todays kids, todays parents, it is just not possible. And that just forces you to face it : This actual world is very grim. Our society is grim, what went wrong ? \n\nHow can we be in this state while i'm sure, everyone wanna have the kind of life your character and Cove are having ? I went for the default name Jamie, wich is enough for me (He's not me, just a character, i'm not much relating to it much).\n\nAnyway. This have a big thumbs up. It recalls me of another FREE Visual Novel. Narcissu. This one will also break your legs. I don't know if its on Steam, or if it even exist anymore. Good luck if you decide to throw yourself at it.\n\nBut be warned ... It'll break your knees. Can't say i didn't tell you.\n\nEDIT (After finishing the game for good) : I though there would be some part of your adult life with Cove being together in the same place with you, but na ... \n\nWell.

I picked it up for free on a whim one day, and now... I think my play time speaks for itself.\n\nThis also happens to be one of the most difficult games to review because of how much it and the characters have come to mean to me. As a young man who has recently been coming to terms with his sexuality, I found some much-needed catharsis in Our Life. The art is gorgeous, the music is surprisingly moving, and the writing is sweet in its simplicity. But most importantly, it allowed me to reclaim some of the fun, scary, touching, difficult, exciting, and even mundane moments that I missed out on while growing up: The moments that bring about discussions of life and love and happiness and purpose and future. The moments of silence where a hug or a kiss speaks volumes all on its own.\n\nI'm not afraid to admit that this game had me in tears, multiple times. The nostalgia that comes with passing time is used to maximum effect. It was so special to see my MC grow up, develop a crush, and then fall in love with Cove. When you step into the world of Our Life, every insecurity melts away with the support of your neighbors, your sister, your two moms, and a very caring (boy)friend. Sunset Bird is the perfect place to escape, if only for a little while.\n\nThe amount of content you get from this free visual novel is unreal. It's fully complete and playable without having to spend a cent. If you're still on the fence, you have absolutely nothing to lose by trying. But if (like me) you can't get enough of our lovable seafoam-green cinnamon roll with a heart of gold, Cove James Holden, the DLCs add hours upon hours of content for dirt cheap. I've bought every DLC to date, and I can honestly say that they are far and away the best Steam purchases I've ever made.\n\nThis game has given me some wonderful memories. But my time isn't over. I have a feeling I'll be coming home to visit Sunset Bird often.\n\n11/10 HIGHLY recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1693277596, "timestamp_updated": 1693277596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145222263": {"recommendationid": "145222263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880241312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2736, "last_played": 1694173537}, "language": "english", "review": "there are many benefits to being a marine biologist", "timestamp_created": 1693257732, "timestamp_updated": 1693257732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145218180": {"recommendationid": "145218180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060357009", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 633, "last_played": 1692649479}, "language": "english", "review": "I love how you can choose the level of interactions with the love interests.

No joke, this is the best visual novel I've EVER played. I think I've seen all the content the game has to offer and I still want to play more. \n\nCove is one of my favorite characters ever. Throughout the entire game he got me giggling and kicking my feet, it's actually crazy how much I was crushing on him. he's never too annoying or repetitive like other love interests in visual novels. He's like an actual person with thoughts and feelings and not just a husk of a character. It was a nice change of pace being able to grow up with Cove and learn about him that way instead of him just listing off everything that happened to him in his life. it made finally getting together with him so much more impactful and rewarding because you two grew up together and know eachother on a personal level. Even now after all this time played, I can't get enough of him and how well he's written.\n\nThe sprites and artwork are really well made and nice to look at, but sometimes it can be a little goofy.

I kept telling myself \"I'll play it one of these days, it seems cute\", but life got busy and I kept putting it off. Eventually, as I was scrolling through Steam, I saw Our Life in my recommended games. I was pretty board that day, so I thought \"I'll just play it for an hour\", then suddenly, 6 hours passed and I was hooked. \n\nOur Life is unlike any dating sim I have ever played. It made me feel real emotions, from sadness and anger, to love and admiration. My character felt like an extension of myself, and the response options felt like real responses I would give IRL. \n\nI genuinely felt loved and cared about by the characters just for being myself, unlike other dating sims where I would have to follow a guide in order to make a certain character love me. That's the added benefit of this game not having any bad endings, you get to choose whichever options you want, and you won't get penalized for it.\n\nOverall, I am so glad I discovered this game, because I truly feel like it has changed me in ways I can't describe, and for that I couldn't be more grateful. This game now holds a very special place in my heart, and you better believe I'll be buying all of the DLC and playing multiple playthroughs in the future.\n\nIf you're even slightly interested in this game, please check it out.

This game is of the highest quality, from the breathtaking artwork to the groovy, unforgettable soundtrack. I fell in love with Cove's personality, his unique look and gorgeous aesthetic, the cast of quirky and very relatable supporting characters... I won't lie that towards the end, I found myself reading along with a growing lump in my throat, truthfully emotionally invested in the story.

But GB Patch has practically stolen my heart with this Visual Novel.\n\nAs shown with my hours at the time of this review, I enjoy this... A LOT. Cove Holden has been a sincere effect on my life that I can't ultimately shake. He's there every time you need him.\n\nI always resort to OL: B&A when I'm in a rut, be it depressive, anxious, or just when I need some creative inspiration, because this man with seafoam green hair practically boosts my mood in any way possible. And let me tell you when I say I'm now envious of the world GB has created, as even my own comfort characters cannot exercise enough TLC to help me through trying times.\n\nThe artwork is amazing, the storyline is lax. Nothing is ever rushed. It makes you feel like you're living through it in real time, and gives you a way to express whatever your MC wants to go through. I swear the amount of times I've paused on sentimental moments with Cove's adorable yet warm expressions and just letting it soak in has never better fixed my self-esteem. Although better to hear it from someone in real life, Cove gives me that start.\n\nIn relation, to support the endeavors of such a great VN, I've had ALL the DLCs (even including the soundtrack, which is such a nice vibe to listen to when moments get stressful; they convey such great emotion that really sets in the story's mood alongside keeping it calm enough for players to not get sent into angst spiral) and have enjoyed each and every aspect of them as well. There is literally no fault in this. If anything, it made me aware of my own faults, which made me burst into tears of roughly 5 hours of the 200 at review. May not be much, but damn those tears ran hard. [spoiler]Especially during Step 3's epilogue in the car. My god that has me crying EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.[/spoiler]\n\nI started this journey with Cove roughly a year and a half ago, and I don't regret my decision one bit. This gave me a rebirth of my childhood and what I didn't experience, made me remember all the goofy times I'd awkwardly crush on my friends in my teenage years, and reminds me that life is everchanging as an adult with outcomes fluctuating so heavily and slowly that all we can really say it that tomorrow's going to be better.\n\nTo those reading this, although Cove may do it better than I: [b] You are valid, you are loved, you are you. [/b] Don't let the world change who you are just because it's not the norm. Show that uniqueness and who you are are what makes the world go round, what keeps us on that everchanging flow. Sadness, guilt, and regret are only temporary, and that all will be better if you make the effort. [i] Love yourself, simple as that. [/i]\n\nI will once again express my thanks to GB Patch for making such a life-changing VN for myself and many others. After playing this, I've gained my creative writing rut after many years, and it takes a lot for my bouncy little brain to sit down, focus, and really let my creative juices flow.\n\n1,000% would recommend this.", "timestamp_created": 1691975342, "timestamp_updated": 1691975342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706679761409759521", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144134183": {"recommendationid": "144134183", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199901706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1444, "last_played": 1699245636}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games!

I picked it up because it looked cute and I liked the concept from the short summary I read, and it was free, so why not? I basically binged my way through the game for like 5 days straight before reaching the end, and every single second of it was amazing. The characters are all very unique and have depth, and they grow and change over the course of the story. They all felt very real, and it definitely was not hard to fall in love with each of them. On top of that, the story also contained completely custom (and very well-made) soundtracks, character CGs, backgrounds, and sprites, and it showed that the entire story & dialogue were well-thought out and overall amazing. \nThe experience was very unique as well, I've never seen anything like it. There is a wide variety of choices and customization options you can make, including the main character's race, gender, sexuality / romantic orientation, personality, interests, body type, preferences, and, to a degree, relationships. You can progress the romantic side of the story at your own pace, and, on top of that, the game won't force you to even date or show romantic interest in the main love interest; you can simply choose to stay friends with him the entire game if you'd rather. If all of that wasn't already enough, the choices you make actually do matter in this game, unlike many others I've seen of the same genre/style. It isn't very easy to predict how exactly your choices will influence the main love interest and your experiences with him, too. It's sort of a giant guessing game, but it was worth every second of it. If I'm being honest, the closer I got to the end of the game, the more bittersweet it felt. Despite having completely different experiences than the MC, the game still managed to get across a very nostalgic feel, making me both mourn and cherish a childhood that I never lived. I definitely cried more than once near the end. Aside from that, the game even had a sort of restorative/healing aspect to it; I feel way more at ease/reassured after playing through the game than I did before starting it up for the first time. As soon as I'm able, I'm hoping I can go back and replay the game to try and discover all the other experiences I missed that it has to offer.\nNeedless to say I've already bought all of the DLCs, because it is actually criminal for this to be a free game. I haven't had a chance to try all of them yet, as I'd rather savor them than binge through it again, but I already know I won't regret it; the ones I've gotten to experience so far are further proof of that. If you still aren't sure, please, at least try the game out!

This is in many ways a masterpiece. It is more than just a dating sim. It is an exploration of various types of life relationships and choices. I recommend it not only to anyone who enjoys romance, but also the slice of life genre in general. It follows the journey of the MC (you) and the male lead from being 8 year olds to adults that have moved out of your parents' homes.\n\nPros:\n- It is diverse in its inclusion of various races, body types, genders, and sexualities. MC can chose he, she, or they pronouns. The male lead is pan and demisexual.\n- Different family dynamics are explored. MC has two moms and the male lead's parents are separated. MC and their sister are adopted.\n- The novel doesn't only focus on the male lead. The MC also spends time with friends, siblings,  parents, and their cousin. \n- MC doesn't actually need to be romantically involved with the male lead. They can choose to just stay friends throughout the novel and nothing more.\n- The novel portrays the bittersweet experience of growing up beautifully. I cried quite a few times. \n\nCons:\n- I know it's free and I can't really complain, but I do wish there was just a little bit more art for some of the unique scenes. A lot of the art is reused. SPOILERS AHEAD. For example, there is a scene where the MC, Cove, Terry, and Miranda are eating out together. I would have loved a little illustration of their food choices and them eating together. There is also a scene where everyone is making jewelry and playing volleyball at the beach.

The game centers around the MC, who you can customize how you like, and their new next door neighbor, Cove, and the summers they spend together.  Every chapter is broken up into what the game calls Steps, documenting little slices of life every 5 years.  The game starts you at 8, going from young teen, to older teen, and then adulthood.\n\nThere's so many different little scenes depending on your choices.  You can decide how you feel towards your neighbor, Cove, and how you approach it.  Want to go a slow burn romance route?  Or do you want to be the one to confess your feelings and take charge?  Or would you rather be confessed to?  Or would you rather declare loud and proud your feelings?  Or perhaps, you rather not bother with romance and just stay close friends?  Or maybe you want to woo another guy?  The choice is up to you!\n\nThere's so many different ways to go about your summers, and the game will know what decisions you made or what scenarios you played may come up later, or heck, if you played a scenario before another, the game will point it out!  An example of this is I remember ordering a specific drink way at the beginning of Step 2 and later on in Step 3, Cove bought me the exact same drink from back then.  Or I did one of Derek's stories and played a Cove chapter, and a character will mention the story you just played.  Your parents will bring up the troubles that you and Cove got into from Step 1.   And depending on how you play, you may meet characters much sooner than you would originally. \n\nSeriously, there's so many different ways to approach things that I would run out of space for it all.  I'm absolutely floored every time I play this game and make one or two different choices and the game reflects that and comes back to me somehow.  Or I still discover a piece of dialogue that I've never read.\n\nThe game can be played for free, but I'd highly recommend getting the DLC if you like the free version, it's worth it, just to see more shared moments of Cove.  Or if you decide you just want to be friends with Cove and go after the other two popular characters, Derek and Baxter.\n\nThe one thing I'd say is don't go into here expecting deep drama or angst.  While the game does cover some issues, this is more light hearted and a 'feels good' type of game.  There's also no right or wrong way to play it, it's all about what you choose and how you choose to spend your summer days.\n\nTry out the free version, and if you like it, go after whatever DLC you want.

It even seems like marriage and kids isn't a bad idea either, maybe it's possible to balance our dreams with work still.

Technically, given the incredible amount of customization and options, there's be a lot of ways to roleplay and make whatever Jamie/PC you want, but this is a game that is both very, VERY good at hitting you on the feels and knows how to comfort you no matter what kind of person you are. Most of the choices seem like they're asking you personally anyways\n\nI can't count the times i ended choking up, when things changed or when Cove expressed his fears, having friends drift away from your life, the ways everything changes as time goes on... \n\nI can't begin to describe how i felt with both the step 3 and step 4 endings. They were both so perfect and tied so well to the main theme and framing device of the story.\n\nThis was such a wild bittersweet journey of self-discovery, and I'm so glad that I got to experience it. Even though I'll never be able to replicate the feelings of my first time playing, I'll still hold the memories close to me. Maybe someday ill play completely differently to before hehe\n\n---ESPA\u00d1OL----\n\nGuao\n\nLa verdad no recuerdo si el juego este disponible en Espa\u00f1ol o no. Me encantaria poder contribuir a una traducci\u00f3n, pero considerando todas las elecciones y como interactuan entre si, seria una tarea tremenda jajajaj.\n\nOur Life es una novela visual MUY customizable y personal. Juegas como Jamie Last (O lo que quieras ponerle de nombre y apellido) comenzando en tu ni\u00f1ez (como a los 6-9 a\u00f1os, si mi memoria me sirve) cuando conoces por primera vez a tu nuevo vecino Cove Holden, y pasas por varias aventuras y momentos de tu vida interactuando con el.\n\nEl juego se divide en 4 pasos: Los primeros tres (ni\u00f1ez, adolescencia y adultez temprana) inician con un segmento de \"introduccion\" obligatoria, en la que sientas las bases de la clase de persona que eres. Luego vienen los \"momentos\", basicamente escenarios que puedes jugar en cualquier orden que gustes o incluso ignorar completamente. Mientras no estes jugando ningun momento, puedes elegir pasar a la siguiente fase, donde recibes un mini epilogo de tu ultimo dia de verano, luego del que puedes cambiar tu personaje nuevamente para el siguiente paso.\n\nNo miento cuando digo que este *tecnicamente* es un juego muy ligero, nada de violencia o muchas cosas que te harian sonrojar. Esto no significa que no tenga emocion o que te diabetes por el exceso de dulzura. La historia te hace querer a los personajes y sentir por lo que pasan. Aunque el cambio asuste y sea triste, aun hay posibilidades de tener mas momentos felices en tu vida.\n\nTe recomendo mucho jugar si te es posible", "timestamp_created": 1690080636, "timestamp_updated": 1690080636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142598307": {"recommendationid": "142598307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970499950", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1170, "last_played": 1696547091}, "language": "english", "review": "this mf is always gonna have a place in my heart", "timestamp_created": 1690050244, "timestamp_updated": 1691120166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142591560": {"recommendationid": "142591560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235455068", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 524, "last_played": 1690055264}, "language": "english", "review": "100% One of the best visual novels I've played, growing up with the characters makes it all the more heart warming.

Thus, I ran a search for \"best visual novels,\" hoping to find something that would scratch the particular itch I was feeling that wasn't already in my game library. Upon finding several recommendations for Our Life, I decided it was worth a shot,. It had a cute premise with a timeskip feature I was looking for, and the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam--not to mention the fact that the base-game was free to play--tipped the scale even more. I went out on a limb and decided to buy all the DLC at once, wanting to experience all the game had to offer (at present) in one sitting rather than going back to cherry-pick DLC afterwards. Boy, was it worth every penny. The art style is lovely, the music is perfect (considering the small selection of songs, their importance at setting the tone, and how many hours I spent hearing them, I never got annoyed, which is a feat in itself), and the writing is exceptional.\n\nOur Life: Beginnings & Always has the unique privilege of being in my \"best games\" category on Steam, a feat that only seventeen other titles have had the pleasure of achieving in ten years. I had no idea when picking up this game that I was going to be treated to some of the most beautiful, heartfelt writing I've experienced in a game. Watching the characters' lives unfold over fifteen years had me going through a rollercoaster of emotions, especially in Step 3 and 4, which had me laughing, crying (happy, sad, and angry tears), grinning like an idiot, and, quite unexpectedly, squealing and flailing. I never wanted it to end. The game tackled so many difficult subjects with such grace, maturity, and realness, and it never wavered in its overwhelmingly inclusive inclusivity. I cannot give enough praise to the writing team.\n\nThe writing for all of the characters is excellent--special shout-outs to my two loves, Noelani and Kyra, and best moody boys, Baxter and Jeremy--but there is no one quite like Cove Holden. Who knew that my unique weakness for green-haired soft bois would only become stronger through this game? I genuinely adore that man so much; I need them to keep making more DLC so I can shower him with my undying affection. Everyone needs to find their own Cove in real life. The way he and MC love each other and try to make each other happy is so beautiful. I tried to make their relationship a slow-burn, but once they hit eighteen, I couldn't pump the brakes anymore. I was in love with Cove and needed him to know it. IMMEDIATELY. I couldn't even stop myself from proposing in Step 3 after only starting dating that same summer, and when the time came to arrange the wedding, I was already chanting \"POPPY HILL, POPPY HILL\" before I realized that was actually going to be an option. Over and over again, things fell into place and felt so right--the pacing, the jokes, the callback moments to even the smallest of things that happened earlier in the game. Hearing characters reminisce about moments that even I had forgotten over the course of the few weeks I played it--I felt so truly immersed and connected to these characters and to the MC I was piloting and shaping over time. I have never played a true visual novel where ALL of my choices felt so fully realized in who my MC was or how her many different relationships developed over time. \n\nIf you're thinking of playing this game or any game by GB Patch Games, I beg you to give them a try. Even if you only play the free base-game, I promise it will be more than worth your time, and you will want more. It's honestly a crime that the base-game is free because I would have paid money for it just to support the developers for creating such a beautiful story. Amazing, amazing experience.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1690006173, "timestamp_updated": 1690006173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142547755": {"recommendationid": "142547755", "author": {"steamid": "76561199243179999", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2902, "last_played": 1690094148}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't believe I've ever had a game make me cry ever, but this one made me bawl multiple times.

I am a very very picky gamer, and i am even more picky when it comes to visual novels, let alone romance visual novels. I have never found a game so entertaining, inclusive, and just down right emotional. \n\nI have done so many playthroughs and i still am not bored of it at all. I have been playing this for YEARS. I had even broken my last laptop and still found ways to get around the bugs and damages of said laptop to play this. and for anybody who wants to know, you can play basically the ENTIRE game without a cursor, just keyboard alone, which very much helped me when my laptop cursor broke and wouldn't even show up on my screen anymore. Now with a new laptop, i am so excited to play the game again.\n\nNot only that, but this game is LONG too. each step of the game took me HOURS without having the DLC's, and with all of the DLC's added onto it, i can definitely say that it almost TRIPLES the amount of game content, maybe even more (math is not my strongsuit). \n\nI spend money on games, i have even spent a lot of money on games i didn't really like or want, but as someone who has bought EVERYTHING this game has to offer on here, i can 100% assure you every single SECOND of this game is worth it. I have not felt such a genuine love for a video game in my entire life, and i am SO excited for GB Patch to release more games. I have been patiently waiting and i plan to keep doing that!!\n\nAll in all, this game is quite literally the most perfect and beautiful romance (or not, if you dont want romance) visual novel game I have ever played in my life.

The relationships with your family, friends, and lovers are all something special to each player. There is no romance game I recommend more. While I myself became enthralled with Baxter Ward and his dramatic and heart-wrenching story, I of course like the majority of players started with Cove. I'll share my experiences with each of the three routes. \n\n!!!SPOILER WARNINGS AHEAD FOR EACH ROUTE!!!\n\nCove as the main love-interest is truly something special, and tender in his route. Your relationship with him blossoming creates a sense of fondness from Step 2. He clearly cares and adores and has some attachment issues from the divorce that plagued his early childhood. The steps truly show that you are magnets forever magnetized to eachother, holding strong as you grow. His family welcomes you and your family welcomes his. It's a perfect childhood friend romance story in a package. However, that can also be a complaint of mine. It was a bit too perfect? While there can be drama and some issues arise, it's never between you and Cove. It's always family related. I would've loved to see some turmoil that we bounce back from. But his route  is perfect for those who want a beautiful, serene, heartfelt story with progression pace chosen by the player.\n\nThen there is Derek, who surprised me a lot. He's a family man who is a little odd in my opinion. But a sweet route if you value a very close bond with family and siblings. I don't care for his route as much as it lacked having a deeper romance between you and your mc. Or perhaps that's just how my playthrough went. There isn't much to say besides his very clear sense of responsibility for his family. Eldest child syndrome is Derek in a nutshell. It is charming however it takes up 90% of the route which frustrated me as someone who found him possibly charming in the earlier steps as children. His personality is a bit bland as well, it's unfortunate but I'm sure there will be those who disagree.\n\nNow for who I believe to be the best written love-interest, Baxter Ward. You have the chance to meet him as a child at the soiree you attend as a dance partner. His personality is blunt, guarded, and of course someone who craves and adores the dramatic. Your story with him is one that hurts, one that could cause anger in some players and mourning in others. His story varies greatly from the others, as your first (yes, first) relationship with him is a summer fling. \"A suitor for the summer\". He comes across as a perfectionist who feels he must make up his self-proclaimed lack of personality with grand-scale gestures. You see parts of his craving for true closeness. Then when the summer comes to its end, he dumps you cruelly. Ghosting the player for 5 years only to be reunited by two friends' wedding. It's an emotional roller coaster and one I wish never ended. I highly suggest his route out of all three. For the rest, I leave up to you to play yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1689716354, "timestamp_updated": 1689716354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142331687": {"recommendationid": "142331687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015360618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2622, "last_played": 1687226924}, "language": "english", "review": "Satisfyingly complex and simple.

The game is very wholesome and welcoming while still not being afraid to dip its toes into more challenging subjects around communication, relationships, and maturity. The kids feel believable (already an accomplishment on its own) and the adults feel casually normal.\n\nThe options for gender/body/personality customization can't be overstated.

As a new steam user, I perused games in tags I was interested in and Our Life: Beginnings and Always was one of the ones in the otome/visual novel tag that I kept seeing. At first, I was hesitant because it was free and most popular otome titles cost actual money. But it\u2019s free and our main boy has mint green hair (which is my weakness) so I said why not, it's free it can't hurt to try. The way this game is structured creates an atmosphere of what feels like genuine interactions with Cove and creates an immersive experience. Honestly this game is something special and I look forward to more of what GB Patch makes in the future.\n\nCharacter customization for the MC is so much more in depth than most games in the genre and works seamlessly with the story. The fact that you can change what you look like and your name at designated spots in the story is innovative, appreciated, and establishes a very immersive experience. The self-inserting is done well with the choice customization and writing in general. Narration doesn't try to dictate what you do or feel unless you influence it with a choice and the characters are written to do the same thing. Never in this game have I felt like the writer wants me to feel a certain way about a plot point, you have the option to express a wide range of emotions during the story. You go at your own pace and the game respects you for it instead of punishing you. \n\nThe story itself doesn't aim to tell anything hard hitting or deep, but instead structures itself for a feel good, tender, coming of age story. You're never set on this one path for a result that the story wants you to have; you get to choose whether you want romance or friendship or neither if you want. Freedom of choice is a primary strength to this game, and I cannot appreciate it more for it. However, any tension that crops up are usually quickly resolved or accepted with no issue. There's no allowance for an ongoing conflict besides dealing with the strain of Cove's parents' divorce and is very much dedicated to making playing the game a feel-good experience. \n\nI don't want to talk too much about the characters because I feel that it's best to go in blind and form your own opinions, but I'll try to be as non-revealing as possible. Cove Holden is a cutie and obviously it's already really biased of me to say so but the game does such a good job of creating fun interactions and mundane but sweet things to do I can't help but start to like him and find him relatable (as a kid of a twice divorced mom, his story arc hits a bit too close to home than what I bargained for). Everybody else you can only grow so close with. Characterization for the adults besides Kyra are almost nonexistent. They're pleasant, but they are flat. I know next to nothing about Noelani and Pamela besides how they met, Cliff runs a business but you never see it or told what it is except in DLC and he's very much just a dad character and not much beyond that, Derek's dad is mentioned in passing like once or twice but doesn't hold a presence until DLC which I find weird for someone who is a business partner of our main love interest's dad. It's clear the parents aren't supposed to play a major role in the story to allow the freedom for you and the other kids to get up to hijinks (which I am fine with) but creates this weird feeling of an ideal world with no consequences. Liz is enjoyable, Shiloh can get fucked (I just found him annoying and has nothing to do with when he grows up), Terry and Miranda needed WAY more screen time than they got to be believable friends to the MC and Cove, and Lee is cool but she could've been removed and nothing would've change which I find sad to say because she would've been a great character to create tension or drama just because of how straightforward she is. There's a wide cast of characters but their relationship to you as the MC is underdeveloped compared to Cove. I didn\u2019t see this as an issue until I started playing Derek\u2019s DLC which I take some issue with. I don't own Baxter's DLC and I\u2019m not interested in playing it, but from what I've heard if you like angst and drama then go for it. Derek as a character is overall very sweet and the DLC adds a nuanced depth to him that I appreciate and wish his story was handled better.\n\nI've already stated that I really like this game, it\u2019s pretty much a 4.8/five for me, but no game is flawless. My number one biggest issue with this game is the CGs and how inconsistent the art seems to be. Some of them have slightly off anatomy or the perspective will look a little wonky. Some facial proportions differ slightly between CGs and the same goes for hair volume which sounds a bit nit-picky, but when it begins to look off model, I start to find that a problem. I feel like this is the most prevalent in Derek's DLC which makes me feel disappointed because home boy doesn't get a lot of CGs to begin with. I don't own Baxter's DLC so I can't say. I like Derek but there is a HEAVY focus on family as a theme in his DLC, to the point that the romance aspects are just left completely out of it. It was excusable in Step 2, but during his Step 4 epilogue I genuinely felt like I was getting rejected without it actually happening. Next to no romance occurs until basically the end and at that point it almost feels like Derek should've just got a separate game that focuses on his adult life rather than this growing up perspective. It makes me sad to say all this because I really enjoyed Derek's character and I think he's very cute, but I can't help but feel disappointed after playing his route because you'd expect more romance than what you actually get. Everything I have to say beyond this point is honestly extremely minor but still noticeable. This game has a unique operating system, so there's a lot that has to be covered to understand the mechanics of the game. And the tutorial just DUMPS it on you, and it was overwhelming enough that I almost quit.  I'm used to jumping in and figuring it out along the way, but if it's one thing I hate, it's getting a bad end because I didn\u2019t understand the game mechanic (I'm looking at YOU DANDELION). Overall the tutorial needs to be more succinct and that\u2019s it. The UI is very cute, love the colors, but it wasn't until I was literally almost sixty hours in that I realized that there are 40 save slot pages and not 20. The save and load buttons are also NOT next to each other and idk if that was intentional or not, but I find it would've been more convenient to have them closer because I keep clicking configure or log instead of load or save.\n\nDespite my critiques, I still heavily enjoyed the game and all the new experiences you can get from the variety of choices and decisions you can make. It ended up hitting a lot closer to home than I ever could've anticipated it doing and can't recommend it enough. After my first play through I was genuinely shocked it was a free game. For what it gave me, it's probably worth all the DLC I bought. Also btw if you play through the game completely free and like the experience enough to play it again, it will be more efficient to buy the DLC bundle. I bought individual DLC bc I thought \"oh hey I should save money and this is what I prioritize in my playing experience\" only to keep playing and buy everything except for Baxter's DLC which I might just buy anyway at this rate. BTW there is a 18+ patreon DLC, the soundtrack is pleasant and feel-good, and spiritual successor coming soon!", "timestamp_created": 1689610549, "timestamp_updated": 1689610549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142267740": {"recommendationid": "142267740", "author": {"steamid": "76561199216209476", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "playtime_at_review": 3972, "last_played": 1699624237}, "language": "english", "review": "I am literally addicted to this game", "timestamp_created": 1689601962, "timestamp_updated": 1689601962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142261673": {"recommendationid": "142261673", "author": {"steamid": "76561199081597870", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1689606811}, "language": "english", "review": "Cove is so sweet I love him so much\n(But seriously this game is so nice especially since it doesn\u2019t even cost anything)", "timestamp_created": 1689594218, "timestamp_updated": 1689594218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142252939": {"recommendationid": "142252939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803632894", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1521, "last_played": 1689580025}, "language": "english", "review": "Positively loved it.

I'm simply giving my thoughts and feelings, not grading it according to some set of standards or a scale.\n\nI love this game.\n\nI could stop there, actually, but I won't. Honestly, I started playing it and then stopped for a bit, not because of any dislike but because when I saw there were DLC's I wanted ALL OF THEM. This game charmed me from the very outset. I've not done much of the visual novel genre, in truth, and not many dating sims either, so I had little to which to compare this. Mostly I play things like Assassin's Creed, Frostpunk, Fallout, Subnautica, No Man's Sky... you get the idea. I really didn't know what to expect from this, but it was free and had an interesting concept, so I figured why not? Man, did that pay off!\n\nIf you're reading this you already know the basics of the game, so I won't rehash it. I will say that this game sucks you in. The characters are so well defined and distinctive, and even when they're being a little douche-y (the sister can be rather bossy at times) they're still loveable and you can't help feeling like you really know them. There were times when I was playing and something would happen and I couldn't help smiling and thinking \"Oh, that's so Cove\" or something similar. Huge props to the devs for bringing these characters to such life and making them so absorbing.\n\nI have not finished the game. I don't play obsessively every day or anything like that, though I do go through spurts. That's just how I am in general. I'm in the adolescent stage, and I'm playing through every moment in all the DLCs because I genuinely adore this story and being able to be part of it. It always makes me smile when there's a reference to something that happened in the past that I choose; It gives the player a true sense of involvement and agency, which is wonderful.\n\nThe art is lovely, and this is coming from someone who's never really been that into the anime style of art. It works perfectly for this game, even the green hair. (As an aside, my sister does keep telling me that Cove is going to end up revealing that he's a merman. This game has NO supernatural anything in it, but she insists it will happen. She has NOT played the game, but she says that all the signs point to it. I see what she means, but I am certain she is wrong. Maybe.)\n\nThis is the game I go back to when I'm feeling moody or down, or just want something that feels good. It's playable in short spurts or longer sessions. It's incredibly inclusive without making the inclusivity feel forced. It addresses all kinds of issues that you wouldn't expect, and does so in a way that is sweet and sensitive and lovely. It's a very comforting game, and still interesting and absorbing.\n\nI love that the game is free, but now that I've played it I would pay for it, and that's high praise from me. I want this developer to prosper because they put out a high-quality, beautiful, very carefully designed and well-executed game with lots of heart. That said, this style of game isn't for everyone, so don't go into it expecting high action or sex (Actually, I don't know about the sex since I'm still in the adolescent stage and obviously there wouldn't be any there). This is a game that focuses on a very special friendship (and romance, if you choose), and in that it excels. If that's what you're looking for, GET THIS GAME. Hell, I recommend anyone and everyone give it a shot; I mean, it's free, so why not? If you don't like it you haven't lost anything, and you might find yourself as charmed as I was. Seriously, this game genuinely took me by surprise.\n\nAnyway, in conclusion, it's a great game that I highly recommend. Oh, and the DLCs add a lot to it as well, so I consider them quality purchases, plus it lets you support the devs who I really think deserve a lot of credit.

Every choice you make feels wrapped in a sense of importance, even if it's minuscule in the bigger picture. This might not be the case for others, but for me, that makes it feel just like real life. Seemingly small and regular moments aren't glossed over, they're put in the spotlight. That just makes this game even more beautiful. \nI also love how this game allows you to have a unique opinion on almost everything that happens, including indifference and different levels of intensity on the spectrum of good and bad. It makes every occurrence feel more natural. This game doesn't force you to like, dislike, agree with, disagree with, or do anything you don't want to.

You choose who you want to be and the relationships you'd like to have.\n\nPersonally, I stayed as true to the person I was at the different ages which I think added an extra layer of fun and interesting. I also decided early on that if I was playing through it anyway, I may as well get all the DLCs to get the full experience.\n\n[b] Art [/b]\nI absolutely love everything about this art style. It's a beautiful blend of different colours that didn't feel too harsh. The backgrounds are fantastic, I don't think I have a single bad thing to say about them. The multiple expressions on the characters was a nice touch that not many people who make Visual Novels do. They tend to stick with a neutral expression which is fine but I'm glad that the people here went the extra mile. I also adored the attention to detail, even the smallest ones.\n\n[b] Characters [/b]\nThe characters feel more real than some people IRL do. That takes skill to make them that believable. There's an assortment of characters you can get to know: Your moms, your sister, your sister's friend, your neighbour, your neighbour's father, etc. There are much more after these.\n\nHere are my thoughts on some of them:\n\nYour moms are solid all-around \u2013 not too harsh but also not lenient. I found them to be an excellent blend of bad humour that only parents are capable of and incredibly loving but not to the point where it's annoying.\n\nYour sister is a brat at first but eventually comes around. I'll be honest, I didn't like her at all in step one. She was so bossy to the point where I wanted her to shut up. But somewhere in step two, I went from that to not minding her presence and eventually came to like her sassiness. The fact that she likes to tease too is also kind of fun.\n\nYour neighbour is by far my favourite character in this whole game. There were so many similarities between the two of us. Possibly because [spoiler] we're both autistic, [/spoiler] something that's not revealed until much later. I called that very early on. At the time, I didn't know if I was just projecting or if that's where we were heading. But I'm glad that I was right and it's so nice to see a character like that.\n\n[b] Music [/b]\nThe music's lovely. It's not anything grand that I'll add into my collection of game soundtracks. That doesn't mean it's bad, it just didn't blow me away.\n\n[b] Story [/b]\nThe story's fairly straightforward and if you have all the DLCs there's so much more to explore. The content in this game is insane. The fact that you can basically build your own character from the ground up is nuts. And I love that! I enjoyed playing as close to myself as I possibly could. I say that because there's no dropout option, you have to be successful in some way in this. Which is a little meh but I guess it makes sense.\n\nThe story I chose was that my neighbour and myself ended up as a couple. I have yet to explore the wedding DLC but I doubt that I'll not have fun with it.\n\n[b] Text [/b]\nOverall, I would give the text a 6.5/10. You may ask, \u201cWhy so low?\u201d Because I can't tell you how many times it immediately took me out of the story as I noticed something or another, repeatedly.\n\nFirst things first, there are way too many \u201cstarted\u201d and \u201cbegan\u201d words. These are good placeholders but should be removed before publishing. The reason I bring this up is because after a while, I couldn't enjoy myself fully as I kept getting distracted.\n\nYou also need more variation. There's one moment in step three where the word \u201ccontentedly\u201d or \u201ccontent\u201d kept being used. I also found \u201cbent smile\u201d seven times in step four, never mind in the other moments.

Their personality built is deeper and more consistent than any other game I\u00b4ve seen. Their narrative is exquisite and the fact that the game lets you find aspect of the characters that you\u00b4ll find in a real person after you know them better, it\u00b4s beyond appealing.\nMy real problem with the game is: There are no true consequences to anything.\n\nYou can make choices and the text will slightly change but the endings are straight out the same. If you reject any of them nothing happens, you are taking back on track to the original text with the same phrases they just change \"boyfriend\" for \"friend\", or they skip the other phrases where they say words of love or liking.\nI think this game has MANY unnecessary options, the fact that it\u00b4s more important for them to make me decide if I\u00b4m ok with my body or if I have body dysphoria is concerning. This is a dating sim, why is so focused if I have mental issues or not?\nI want to go to places with the characters, pick if I can be intimate with them or not, if want to change the story and do something different... not if I\u00b4m going to choose a vegan bread or not... it\u00b4s ridiculous how many time the game spent trying to make you feel \"accepted\" and \"special\" instead of guiding a story with the three main boys. \n\nDon\u00b4t get me wrong, I LOVE THIS GAME WITH PASSION, my 300+ hours prove it. I just think it could have been less intrusive in regards of \"me\", and I would like to have more options for different endings or more everything for the three main options of loving boys, than if I pick a chair to sit or the couch :/\n\nAnyway, I love Baxter with all my being, That\u00b4s it", "timestamp_created": 1688139892, "timestamp_updated": 1688140642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140962742": {"recommendationid": "140962742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316312479", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 381, "playtime_at_review": 4011, "last_played": 1700284420}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely adorable!

off with the technical aspect of the game. Visual-wise, it's great! I have minor problems with the CGs but it didn't really affect my gaming experience much since it portrays the scene well. The way it was drawn, especially some of the DLCs on steps 3-4, it doesn't sit well with me personally. The mechanics of the game are quite amazing. I used to play the game from left to right, but then once I experimented on things, some events affect another event if played in an order. Sometimes, certain dialogue choices can have an impact on how the world of Sunset Bird responds to you. I even saw screenshots or comments that I personally haven't experienced in game. This game can be played a thousand times and there are some small dialogues that you might have missed. It would be nice however if we somehow knew Xavier during the wedding since I have the Derek DLC and had met them at the boardwalk. Music is great, a bit redundant but portrays the scene really well. Voice-acting is limited but you can always feel the emotion when it's there. Story-wise, well, this is the best story and world-building I've ever read. Players also have the ability to change the affection level of the MC to the love interest. However, you can only change it upwards, and you can't pursue other love interests without the DLC. And you might find yourself asking, is it work it to buy the DLCs and I would say yes. The story is already amazing without the DLCs but having them adds a whole new flavor. It enhances the game to perfection.\n\nNow for the characters themselves.\n\nI have played several visual novels in my life but nothing can come close to this masterpiece. I was just scrolling through STEAM and Itch.io to play any visual novels during the pandemic. It was one of my ways to pass the time. Then the beginning of December, I found this game. I was immediately hooked by the premise and the price tag that of free to play. I remember feeling nothing about this since most free to play visual novels are good but not really tear-inducing. I didn't even like Cove's design? Like Jeremy said, he has stupid eyebrows. And I disliked the color green. But now, all I can think about is his wavy green hair, and his tear-stained face.\n\nCove Holden is the main love interest in this story. Of course, you have the option to just be friends with him or continue just being an acquaintance. You are free to choose what relationship you want to have with him. But for me, the best thing to experience OLBA (Our Life: Beginning and Always) is having him as a partner. I don't really have the words to describe Cove. He's an ocean-loving dork who likes mermaids. He's a sensitive and emotional person and values every little thing and moment that you have with him. He's shy, easily gets flustered, and is very clingy and spoiled. Cove Holden is the best person to ever existed in fiction, and in reality, like my fellow players wished for. Catching the fireflies with him, our adventures on the beach, and most of all, a Cove Holden trait, him climbing up your bedroom window. It was honestly funny for me. He's there when you are in your darkest moments just like when he's at his. My world honestly became brighter because of Cove. And a little bonus, he's the only person that calls you, with his voice, that you can hear. I kept loading the times he called me by name. It's better to play the game to fully experience that is the sweet cinnamon roll.\n\nDerek Suarez, a DLC love interest. Like Cove, you have the option to be lovers, friends, or not. I have played his Step 4 a year ago and I haven't played it again so my opinion of him as a grown adult is well, limited. From what I can recount, he is a sweet guy. But he is TOO responsible for his own good. As the eldest, he had overseen his brothers for the longest time and had to be the mature one. I like his design but I guess he really didn't click with me much. I recommend to see other reviews if you are interested with him.\n\nBaxter Ward, another DLC love interest that was just released recently as of writing this. Like the two love interests, you can pursue him to be your lover, friend, or just an acquaintance. I just played the DLC recently and had been intrigued by him even from before. At first, his forwardness weirded me out. Especially when he is makind advances (?) towards Cove and the MC. But as I got to know his story, I sympathized with him. I also have this mindset that I cannot be 'the one' in someone else's life. Like the MC stated, leaving behind footprints in the sand if I remembered correctly. I have friends but I don't really feel close to them and keep on having barriers around me, putting people at arm's length. I honestly disliked Baxter as I first played this game but as time goes on, I grew to appreciate this monochromatic guy. He can be forward and smooth, but so awkward with letting his feelings known. Cove Holden can be awkward but his feelings are honest. He cries when he's sad, happy, and frustrated, but Baxter Ward just runs away, like me. I guess I have a lot to say about this guy since he reminds me of myself too much.\n\nFor the other characters, they're honestly great. Noelani and Pamela are great moms, sweet but strict. They are very understanding and are quite nice people. Liz or Elizabeth reminds me a lot of my sassy sister. Lee resembles my cute cousin whom I'm very close with. Miranda and Terry are just so cute! I wish I could be as open with my friends in real life like here in fictional SoCal.\n\nNow, for Shiloh and Jeremy. They are characters and love interests from XOXO Droplets. I played that game before OLBA and since I'm broke, my main love interest was Shiloh. He's at his worst in OLBA or I just didn't notice how much of a handful he is in XOXO Droplets since the MC there has an equally horrible attitude. Or there are less interactions there because of the game system. I don't know but I swear, Shiloh really gets on my nerves more than Jeremy.\n\nAnyways, please do give this game a try! It's really fun and I swear, you would not leave Sunset Bird anytime soon. It's been 2-3 years since I've played this game and I always found myself here in this small tourist trap town.

You may be able to tell from my play time that this has become one of my top go-to comfort games. If you're  into visual novels/RPGs at all I'd say this game is WELL worth a try. The DLCs add even more detail and characters and are, in my opinion, far more than worth the price.\n\nThis game is beautiful both visually and thematically, the characters are detailed and lovable, PLUS one of the main characters is canonically on the autism spectrum. You can play your relationship with Cove as a friendship or something more (there's a sort of spectrum of options), and no matter what you choose you get a detailed and fun storyline you can replay over and over again. The DLCs add two more character storylines (which can also be played as friends or more) that add even more rich storytelling to the game. Plus, there's an abundance of options, both in-game and settings wise, for customizing your character's gender expression, pronoun preferences, and other details, although the physical appearance of your character is only seen in the 'in-between' steps between each section of the game and not in the game itself outside of a few bonus images.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy exploring how your actions effect the game world, if you enjoy very cute and emotionally rich storylines, and if you spend hours reading fanfiction of the same two characters meeting and falling in love over and over, you're going to love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1687982139, "timestamp_updated": 1687982139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140866116": {"recommendationid": "140866116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321461321", "num_games_owned": 473, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1641396781}, "language": "english", "review": "COVE <3", "timestamp_created": 1687981636, "timestamp_updated": 1687981636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140863886": {"recommendationid": "140863886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008054440", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1982, "last_played": 1687978033}, "language": "english", "review": "What a lovely game. \n\nThis is the first visual novel I've ever played, and I feel like it's set the bar quite high for anything else to compare to. Getting to experience unconditional love and acceptance, no matter who you choose to be in the game, felt like a breath of fresh air. I could be myself, at least as close to as the game allows, and nobody ever batted an eye. I could be who I am and that was that. No questions asked, no doubts from anybody, they just love and accept you for who you are. \n\nBy the time I got to the moments in Step 1, I knew this was going to be a really, [b]really[/b] good experience. I bought all the DLCs and played through every moment. I couldn't get away from this game; it's just so incredibly lovely. Getting to experience such an amazing childhood with the family, friends and Cove was such a joy. It's like I got to experience something I never had myself, growing up. I know it's a bit dramatic, but I really enjoyed the moments and the writing during the first two steps. This may be fictional, but it's something I'm going to cherish for a long time.\n\nThis also applies to the other steps; the writing is excellent throughout, though I did disagree with where 2 of the moments went; they go in a direction that I never would, nor had I ever gone in my playthrough until then because it was forced on me. It's nothing terrible, but to be specific without spoiling anything, I would never start a fight with someone and the game pretty much forced it. Didn't think that was really fun, not gonna lie; but that's my one and only complaint about the game.\n\nAlso, the game doesn't force you to get involved romantically with anyone. If that's not your thing, you can play through it without that, and that's perfectly fine! You're free to make those decisions; you don't get forced into anything like that.\n\nI don't think I can really do this game justice with anything else I could write here.

The base game itself took me around 4 1/2 hours to finish and it was such a nice experience. After said 4 1/2 hours of gameplay, I got the ending where I was dating Cove but hadn't advanced the relationship(my sad, cold little heart fears commitment), and there was still so much to do. I still had options for my relationship status with Cove, my dialogue options, my character settings, etc. There is so much to do in this game and I can tell that it was made with complete love and care. I'm looking forward to playing the DLC(i know i said i fear commitment but i wanna marry baxter)!\n\nThe story is emotional and it portrays life. Nothing extreme, nothing crazy out of the ordinary, it's just exactly as it says. Life. And let me tell you, that is a BIG breath of fresh air after playing so many fantasy/action games. I need a break from fantasy RPGs and platformers, so a point and click was a nice change of pace for me. \nThe game has pleasant music as well. Nothing memorable, but it makes nice background noise while you play. In the base game, you only have the option to date Cove, who's basically the secondary protagonist. There is DLC available for about 5 bucks each that gives you access to other characters(baxter my beloved), and all the characters are pretty likable. The game can be a bit slow at times, but it's a portrayal of life, what can you expect?\nSo, I know some people may be a bit wary about dating sims for....reasons, so I just want to give a bit of an overview for people who are maybe a bit unsure about the game. This game has no nudity. There are a few pretty characters put in but they're all fully clothed so it's not even a slight problem. When you get to about step three you get to choose Cove's interest/intimacy(?) can't remember the word, but basically you get to choose how, well, intimate you want to be with Cove. Setting it on a low level will tame things, which is what I did, seeing as I like romance, but with a few lines drawn. High level makes Cove able to be more intimate with you, so if you're not into that then set it on low. The game is very tame for a dating sim, but  it IS a dating simulator and it contains, well, romance, and I can understand why some people aren't into it. The game has no nudity, but there are suggestive themes and such, so I'd recommend it for about 12 and up.\n\nokay wait i came back just to say that after playing through the game again the most important lesson that i learned was that coves dad deserves that entire digital world seriously hes like the best character", "timestamp_created": 1687833682, "timestamp_updated": 1688004067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.719731032848358154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140761126": {"recommendationid": "140761126", "author": {"steamid": "76561199482116239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1626, "last_played": 1692311222}, "language": "english", "review": "Its just super cute and inclusive", "timestamp_created": 1687821699, "timestamp_updated": 1687821699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140760273": {"recommendationid": "140760273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198435180560", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1693423643}, "language": "english", "review": "super cute visual novel type game", "timestamp_created": 1687820434, "timestamp_updated": 1687820434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140758487": {"recommendationid": "140758487", "author": {"steamid": "76561199482703762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 826, "last_played": 1696457927}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es simplemente hermosa", "timestamp_created": 1687817839, "timestamp_updated": 1687817839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140756809": {"recommendationid": "140756809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040809872", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1697318279}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, please dont gift me the game, its free and i already have it, but Our Life: Beginnings & Always is a amazing dating game, and gladly, it isnt actually a psycological(Hope i didnt misspell it) horror like Doki Doki Literature Club, you start by making your character and choosing your name! you will be friends with a young boy from 8 years old, with the name Cove! and Cove is the calmest and (To me) the most innocent of them all! if Cove was a real life person, i would be his best friend! plus Our Life: Now & Forever is to be announced, its basically kinda like this one, but its four autumns instead of four summers.

This game (and the PLI within) captured me instantly. Well written story, artfully composed characters. I am not sure how I feel when I admit I genuinely fell in love with Cove (no judging me, I have nothing/no-one else, stfu) so job very well done. A couple of quibbles I have include the fact that some backgrounds were a little overused (I'm thinking of the parking lot in particular) the more interactive portions felt a bit clunky (the rock paper scissors having no rng whatsoever for example) and too few, and the 3rd stage felt a little short (though that could well be me). If you want to play this game with the best experience possible without wasting money, I suggest buying the DLC like so:\nBuy Step expansions 1 and 2 before starting.\nPlay until you meet derek (step 2), then when you get to the moments menu, then decide whether you want the Derek's story DLC.\nAt step 3 you should have an idea of whether you're interested in going further with Cove, so you can make an educated decision on whether getting the step 3 expansion and the wedding story are a good idea.\nIn addition, you meet Baxter in step 3, so once you've met him you can decide whether you want anything more to do with him.\nI write this little buyer's guide because I ended up buying the lot without even looking at the trailers. All I saw was Cove and that's all I needed to see. It turned out I didn't like Derek (he makes me uncomfortable) so getting his DLC was not much use. I don't regret the purchase at all though; the happiness, bliss, and feelings of interpersonal connection this game afforded me that I never get IRL made it worth every penny of the $40NZD I spent on it.

While it could be classified as an otome game due to its exclusively male love interests, the game extends its inclusivity by allowing players to choose their own gender.\n\nAs someone who rarely dabbles in otome games, the absence of female love interests is a noticeable limitation. The potential to explore romantic narratives with characters like [strike] Lee or even Elizabeth[/strike] would have added an extra layer of depth and choice to the game. However, I can imagine the difficulty of these so let's forget about that. Our Life: Beginnings & Always manages to reel players in with its engrossing narrative and impactful choices.\n\nThe game's standout feature is undoubtedly its respect for player decisions. Every choice made significantly alters the narrative and is reflected in the dialogues, creating a truly personalized gaming experience. It's a testament to the developers' commitment to delivering a game where your choices genuinely matter.\n\nAlthough a free-to-play game, several key moments are tucked behind paid DLC. However, the investment is worth it. The caliber of the writing, the immersive genre, and the beautiful accompanying music all work in harmony to create an engaging narrative experience. The cost of the DLC feels justified given the quality of the content it unlocks.\n\nThe main male love interest's narrative arc is compelling, tracing his journey from a meek boy to a mature character tailored to appeal to the player's tastes. But it's not just the end result that is intriguing; the process of growth and evolution itself is beautifully depicted and contributes to the overall appeal of the game.\n\nOne of the most engaging aspects of Our Life: Beginnings & Always is the sheer variety of outcomes possible through different player choices. The narrative is flexible enough to warrant multiple playthroughs, each offering a new perspective on what could happen if a different path is chosen.\n\nIn conclusion, Our Life: Beginnings & Always is an engaging visual novel that excels in its emphasis on player choices and character development. Despite leaning towards the otome genre, it doesn't limit itself and offers a wide range of experiences. The game's respect for player choices, combined with the quality of its narrative and DLC content, makes it an intriguing choice for fans of visual novels.", "timestamp_created": 1686894525, "timestamp_updated": 1686894525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140137435": {"recommendationid": "140137435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110890387", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 899, "last_played": 1689500387}, "language": "english", "review": "I love how queer and customizable everything about this game is.

more than just a short and average visual novel but i noticed it featured customisation which seemed like a nice gimmick, what i wasn't expecting was to be a well thought out touching VN that had me hooked the moment i booted it up, while this game doesn't have a wide variety of songs like life is strange the music it did have really helped set the mood the game was going for with it's quiet normal life feel.\n\nOur Life B&A goes truly in depth with how you want the MC to look and act, what their hobbies are and how you treat the people around you, even some of the small choices you made will have lasting effects with your friends or family remembering the things you do or say to them which really helps bring a lot of life into it. \n\nThe game has 4 stages to your life, childhood, teen, young adult and adult with each stage letting you customise yourself and offers you a decent amount of things to do in each stage with cove and the other friends you can make, each moment you play through feels perfectly made, it gives you enough dialogue and choices with the people you interact with to make it feel more like you're actually a person there instead of just reading dialogue and being the third wheel to the group of friends before you and each moment never feels like it's stretching too long.\n\nIt took be about 30 hours to finish the first playthrough (with most of the DLCs) and it left me with a bittersweet feeling, while i'll never be able to play this gem of a VN for the first time again the time i spent on this was well worth it, every stage of life was perfectly sculpted with enough dialogue for everyone, no character felt like they took up room just to have them be the focus and each person has their own personality that meshed or clashed with other people in a way that felt believable between them while also including you, if you're a fan of games with a good story and like making choices that matter you owe it to yourself to playthrough this masterpiece that i feel has that golden standard for VNs that put it up there with other gems like katawa shoujo.\n\nThe time i spent in this quiet town of sunset bird was truly a unforgettable

The writing is good imo, the story is super sweet. So far, I would say it's mostly slice-of-life with some (optional!) romance.\n\nThe best part of the game imo is how your character is treated in the story. It's hard to describe, but if you choose to make the main character similar to yourself, and make choices that you might make in real life, the story starts to feel quite personal to you. I definitely recommend playing the game like that.\n\nMy [b]favorite[/b] thing that I am quite impressed with is how the game handles LGBTQ+ content regarding your character. You can choose to change your character's pronouns and name later on in their life. The other characters in the story acknowledge these changes, so it doesn't feel like an empty choice. And there are moments where your character reflects on how they feel about themself. One particularly striking moment for me was being able to choose how my character felt about their body and gender, and then telling Cove that I was thinking about getting gender-affirming surgery, and he responded so sweetly. There are several moments like that throughout the game. The love interests will ask you what genders you're attracted to, if any. I think it's all handled so well.\n\nI wasn't sure if I'd like slice-of-life, but: The way the game is set up, each \"moment\" is like 10-30 minutes of reading, short but satisfying summer moments that happen throughout your character's life. So even if you're getting tired of one moment, you know you'll be done with it soon and can move onto the next one. And, the setting (a beautiful beachy town near a touristy city) is so pretty, and the artwork and music make it almost dreamy. In a setting like this, it's hard for me to get bored by the slice-of-life.\n\nIf you like romancing guys at all in your games, you will probably find something to like in one of the three(?) love interests (provided you buy the Derek and Baxter DLCs). Each love interest feels complex, and they're all quite sweet in their own way. You might get a little bored if you don't like slice-of-life and opt out of all the romance, though. In that case I would recommend trying the base game for free before purchasing any DLC to see how you feel about the slice-of-life first.\n\nSpeaking of the DLCs, personally I think they're all worth it so far, but even if you don't buy them, I think you could still enjoy the main story. The DLCs appear to add extra \"moments\". Without them, you still have I think 5 moments for each part of the character's life. The Derek and Baxter DLCs add additional moments centered around them as well. However, even if you choose not to romance them, you can still experience sweet moments with them as their friend.\n\nI'll update this if I think of anything else I want to mention after I finish the game!", "timestamp_created": 1685985570, "timestamp_updated": 1685985570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615154266357421875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139575595": {"recommendationid": "139575595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832367337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "playtime_at_review": 2166, "last_played": 1699762921}, "language": "spanish", "review": "This is the best visual novel I have ever played, if not the best visual novel period.

Weaving through the narrative the game made me ask very real questions about life's expectations, my identity and how I feel about it, and accepting how the past no matter how fantastic or grim led me to the happiness I feel. Every time I play through I call my mom, I tell a friend how much I care and I explore the world around me with more of a childlike perspective.

There is no way around this. Unlike other games of the same stripe, it does not patiently wait for you to summon the keyboard screen on your own. It will very helpfully force it up for you as soon as the screen loads and you will NOT be able to get it to go away again. Even if you try to use the Steam overlay menu, you are still on the keyboard. Even when you are desperately trying to turn the Deck off, you are still on the keyboard. In your dreams that night, you will still be on the keyboard. I had to forcibly power down my Deck to get out, and then promptly did it again two more times just to be SURE.

With the release of the Baxter DLC I figured I'd fix that.\nPotential spoilers ahead.\n\nI loved Our Life: Beginnings & Always before we got any DLC. Cove was so sweet, and it was nice to have a character be understanding when I played a mostly silent MC. Plus I love how customisable the MC is, from what they wear to physical traits. My only critique would be I wish there were more silent/quiet options that weren't disinterested or outright uncaring. There were a few times I picked a quiet option and MC started talking like they didn't care or were annoyed, and I didn't have a sympathetic option so MC had to speak when I didn't want to. It didn't ruin the experience but was a bit disappointing.\nCove himself is darling. I like that, rather than outright turning him into an extrovert, you can help him socialise on his terms. And even if he stays quiet and withdrawn it isn't treated as him 'not getting better' or something he has yet to overcome. Cove really felt like that friend who could tell the difference from an actual angry face and a resting b*tch face.\nAs for the 'spicy' scene, I think it was handled well with Cove. While I wouldn't say no to 'fade-to-blacks' or 18+ DLC, I'm content with what we got and think it fits GB Patch's style. Baxter was a bit different, but I'll get there.\n\nDerek is an alright character. Before the DLC I just couldn't connect with him, and to be fair I'm still finishing his DLC. That being said: my opinion hasn't changed much. I like him more, but this DLC has me more intrigued by Jorge than Derek himself. I'm currently in the Derek Epilogue, but I'm struggling because I'm still not invested in Derek himself. So far, while I don't regret getting the Derek DLC, I'm liking it more for Derek's family and expanding MC's relationships/personality than Derek himself. While it made sense story-wise, I think the absence of Derek in Step 3 didn't help endear him to players like me.\nMaybe if he had more phone calls throughout Step 3 so it actually felt like we stayed in touch?\n\nEdit: Having finished Derek's epilogue I can sadly confirm that Derek didn't click with me either romantically (compared to Cove and Baxter) or platonically (compared to Jorge). He's by no means a bad character, I don't dislike him or think he takes away from the story, he's just kinda there. One thing I do like is that he can develop romantic feelings regardless of whether you pursue him or not. It helps give the feeling of things developing outside MCs decisions and choices.\n\nAnd then there's Baxter. I always thought he was an interesting character, but after playing his DLC I don't know if I can go back to Cove X'D\nI love dramatic romances, it's a weakness of mine. But I love how GB Patch approached a character with Baxter's issues. He almost feels like a 'What If' version of Cove: What if you met Cove later? What if Cove didn't open up to you? What if Cove really was alone?\nBaxter shows himself as easy-going and eccentric-in-a-fun-way. But in reality he is lonely and constantly critiquing himself, spiralling over the smallest misstep he makes. He not only can't accept MC's feelings(romantic or platonic), he outright rejects the notion of his own worth.\nWith a shared history, it's easy to get someone to open up about issues and feelings. Not only does Baxter focus on your lack of history, he firmly rejects any attempts to reach out to him. And unlike so many other games, you can't reach him. Love doesn't magically make him open up. He leaves.\nIt isn't until late in his epilogue that you can potentially get back together. And even after that, Baxter still struggles. He still reflexively tries to exclude himself, distance himself, and blame himself. In fact, while you can confess around the half-way point if you wait for him to confess he waits until nearly the end.\nIf Cove is a puppy you found at the beach, then Baxter is a kitten you rescued from a thorn bush. Some thorns got in there good, but with love, patience, and care he can heal and finally have the people he deserves in his life.\nNow, the 'spicy' scene. Like Cove's, I thought it was good and fit the style, but I do have one thing to say: I think the option to take his shirt off felt forced. Not that MC forced Baxter to do it, but like GB Patch felt they had to go farther with Baxter than they did with Cove. That in and of itself isn't bad, I approve of stretching your boundaries if you want, but since it's just a make-out session it felt like an odd interaction. It read to me like Baxter was about to lead to a 'fade-to-black'(as I think would still fit GB Patch) but suddenly remembered he wasn't in an 18+ game. Not disappointed, but definitely felt out of place. And I know you have the option not to do that with Baxter, but since I read it I'd figure I'd give my take.\n\nFinal thoughts: Baxter Marriage DLC when?

I got to the point where I knew exactly what to say to him, or what he was going to say to me. I've played several visual novels before but never had I played one that allowed me to be so much myself. The MC in other stories can be very divided (aka your choices are basically a nice option or a mean option). The MCs in other games could be annoying or hard to deal with. Usually you have about two to four choices in a visual novel, but Our Life gave us a bunch more. I felt that Cove really knew me, and simple choices I had made in the past would come back (such as what I ordered to drink or something that I joked about). I have not felt so passionate about a visual novel in quite some time. It is wonderful that you can decide whether to be friends or romantic with Cove. I'm not one to spend money on a game but I am seriously considering some of the expansion packs.

And the game succeeded pretty well. \n\nPros:\n1) Cove's relatability is written extremely well in my personal opinion. As someone who hates sudden changes, I related a lot with Cove's fear of things changing.\n2) I liked that the game is diverse in the LGBT and race sides, without shoving it in my face and making a big \"Hoo-Hah\" about it. It's just a game that just so happens to have people who are of those communities. \n3) Repeatability. I like that there are so many hidden scenarios in the game that you can unlock by replaying it like if you choose to keep Cove's dolphin key-chain charm, Cove will comment on it or if you wear an anklet he also comments on it. \n4) The nostalgic feel of the game. I don't know how to describe it, but the game just creates a nostalgic feeling through the music, the scenarios, the characters, and the writing. \n5) The writing is entertaining, even though the scenarios are mostly real-life related, it draws you to imagine yourself actually being there with Cove or the other characters. It feels like stories that can occur in real life with your actual friends and families. I never thought I would experience something similar to Persona 4 in this game. \n\nCons: \n1) Didn't really understand what's the point of a customizable character, when we don't even see them. At best we just see the main character's lips or hand.  I wish that maybe the game could have placed the main character at the corner of the game to show their reactions and emotions considering we can choose how to feel towards Cove, but since this is for the self-insert kind of players I can see why the creator chose not to do so. \n2) Oh boy, incoming hot-take here: In my honest opinion, as much as I adore and love Cove, he is way too passive. sure he gets irritated when you tease him or disagree with him but he mostly whines for a bit and that's kinda it. even most of the initiative in my opinion is done by me, which is nice to an extent but...y'know the meme of the figure poking something with a stick to see if the thing does something? yea, kinda felt that was me. I wish Cove was a bit more initiative and I played the game on direct love, to see how direct he could get, and even then... I still felt he wasn't initiating enough. \n3) Too many pointless choices: choosing an imaginary sandwich for my mc, what my mc wants to eat, what kind of food the mc eats... I felt like the game could have used those choices for more nostalgic scenarios with Cove, Baxter or Derek in my honest opinion. Also, felt it was a chore to keep clicking the screen for choices that most likely wouldn't affect how the game would be. \n4) Found it slightly creepy that we the player can just change Cove's looks, clothes, and even his personality in the first game. I understand that the point of the game is to create your perfect Cove Holden, but I felt kinda creepy that I can just do so on my first playthrough. \n5) The explanations for which choices affected Cove's personality were too vague in my opinion, so I didn't like how I had to experiment for a bit to get the perfect Cove. I know we can adjust his personality, but since the point of the game is to choose your choices to create your perfect Cove, it kinda ruins the challenge the game posed on the player as it feels like you're cheating. Maybe they add a chart of which decisions affects Cove's personality like whether he is warm, cold, sporty or studious...etc. \n\nOverall, a really chill game with a nostalgic and homely vibe. the end of the game is also extremely heart-wrenchingly sad, but in a good way. Its like saying farewell to a good friend that you'll most likely never see again. It sure as hell made me cry tears of sadness.", "timestamp_created": 1685001623, "timestamp_updated": 1685001623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543352723121643066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138942651": {"recommendationid": "138942651", "author": {"steamid": "76561199098548212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2798, "last_played": 1684986500}, "language": "english", "review": "i recommend this to everyone it is the best game and the events feel so real and i love it the story is amazing", "timestamp_created": 1684982919, "timestamp_updated": 1684982919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138940899": {"recommendationid": "138940899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830096926", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 2836, "last_played": 1699591669}, "language": "english", "review": "Good  game\n", "timestamp_created": 1684979486, "timestamp_updated": 1684979486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138933256": {"recommendationid": "138933256", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087188645", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 6044, "last_played": 1699984210}, "language": "english", "review": "i've replayed it so many times, such a godtier game!!!!!! cove holden i love you forever :')", "timestamp_created": 1684966541, "timestamp_updated": 1684966541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138932295": {"recommendationid": "138932295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365262527", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5365, "last_played": 1685149304}, "language": "english", "review": "It's rare to find a game that so readily allows you to explore your gender identity and sexual orientation in a safe environment.I would strongly suggest Our Life Beginnings & Always to anyone who identifies as queer or is questioning.

I\u2019ve never seen such a perfect depiction on what it feels to be a perfectly imperfect human being, of how it feels to grow up, to truly love and be loved, and to understand, accept and cherish the people and the moments around you, big or small. Our Life brought me newfound appreciation for life, and a new understanding of what it means to care for the people I love and want around. This game is a lesson on how to be kinder, to yourself and others, and a reassurance that you\u2019re never truly alone.\n\nNow for the practicalities, this vn has an incredible amount of personalization, from your appearance to your tastes and hobbies, to your emotions and involvement with the characters, and it all matters in some way (to the extent of shaping your neighbor\u2019s personality, but scientists are still trying to figure out how that works lol). You could spend the whole game ignoring your illustrious neighbor or you could be the love of his life. Everything you pick matters, but there are no mistakes to be made, and all the wrongs can become rights. As someone who can be controlling at times, this game serves me as a reminder that people are lenient and everything is gonna be okay in the end. It always is.\n\nIt\u2019s also absurd to me how it manages to be free and the DLC to be so affordable. The 200 hours didn\u2019t come from nowhere, and I think all the money I spent on this franchise becomes pennies by the hour counting all the time I put into it. On the other hand, it being free was what drew me to try the game in the first place, and I couldn\u2019t have been more pleasantly surprised.\n\nIn summary, Our Life upped my standards for visual novels astronomically, and although I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be as moved by a game as this one has moved me, I can\u2019t wait to see what GB Patch has in store for the future.

Honestly, this is probably one of most feel-good visual novels I've ever played in my life. It's not going to be for everyone - if you like your stories dramatic, or you like to lose yourself in something that's already fully planned out, then this might not be your style. Our Life is one of those games where you have a thousand choices - some large, like whether or not you care for someone or can forgive them, and some small, like whether or not you feel comfortable hugging your best friend's mom - and some of them change the story completely, while others just serve to make the story feel like [i]your[/i] story.\n\nI've played this game countless times, and every time I play it I end up in a happy, comfortable, kinda-tearful haze after it's over. Our Life isn't a drama, or a fantasy, or anything with magic and intrigue. What it is is a small, slice of life narrative that allows you to make it... pretty much everything you could ever want it to be. It's you, your friend (or not, if you choose not to be close to him, but Cove is so sweet, so why wouldn't you), your family, and the people around you that you care for. It's story about growing up with people, none of whom are perfect, and navigating the sometimes-messy but always-warm first few stages of a beautiful, simple life. \n\nI cannot stress how much writing went into this story. It's soft and gentle, but it's got so much nuance, and depending on the routes you take, can really dive deep into the things that make us tick. It sorts through happy, sad, messy, complex, and sometimes selfish emotions in a way that shows everybody involved growing for the better. You meet an unforgettable cast of people that you truly end up loving once you leave them - but as the ending credits say, \"You can come back always.\" Because... you can. Our Life is always there, and there's always a new nuance for you to check out, a new route to take, a new decision to make. \n\nIt's incredibly inclusive. You can customize yourself in any way you want - gender, sexuality, preferences, body esteem, personality quirks, and anything else you can think of. Even when it's a choice as simple as how to respond to your sister saying good morning, you have half a dozen choices. There are all sorts of characters with all sorts of personality traits and they all feel like someone I might meet at work tomorrow. \n\nAnd the cast of romance options is prime, too. Of note, this is most definitely Cove's story. While you can play the story as indifferent to Cove (I never have, so I don't know how it would go), ultimately the story is about the two of you finding each other as children and how you grow up together. Cove is the sweetest boyfriend imaginable, should you choose to walk that road with him, and even if you only choose to be best friends, he's always there for you and never hesitates to tell you what you mean to him. And, should you choose to take that road, the wedding DLC for Cove is super, super sweet. I cried while playing it. \n\nDerek and Baxter don't have as much and yet, they have more than I'd expect. It's Cove's story, but if you pick up their DLCs, you can have a nice summer with either of the others, with an epilogue for any of them (the Wedding DLC is only for Cove, although your other friends are there). I will note that Derek's route probably has the least romance, which was a little bit disappointing; but at the same time, his DLC dealt a lot with his family - all of whom are charming in their own ways - and I still felt like it was an enjoyable story. And Baxter's... if you wanted drama, pick Baxter. There's heartbreak there, and you can choose to resolve that heartbreak in whatever way you choose. But should you want to see that heartbreak heal, the game delivers in [i]spades[/i] - I just finished it but I have a strong feeling I'm going to go back to read it again tomorrow. Baxter is a messy, messy man, but he's a good man at the core and the game does such an amazing job of navigating the kinds of emotional trauma a person can have.\n\nSo, Our Life may not be for everybody, but if you're looking for something feel-good and you like slice of life - or you just need someone to tell you how much you matter to them - pick it up.

Honestly, I tried this game out on a whim\u2014the summary sounded funny and interesting, and the fact that the MC was fully customizable made this game stand out from the other romance/visual novel games.\n\nEnter the main love interest of the game: Cove Holden. This dude is literally one of the few fictional characters that had me genuinely falling. I think it's mostly because of the fact that you grow up with him; there's a different kind of bond that grows when you go through that. You get to see him as a child, in his most vulnerable and innocent state. You get to see him as a teenager, a young person slowly developing and understanding who they want to be. And you get to see him as a young adult, someone who doesn't want to let go of the things and people that make him happiest. All of this topped with a budding and blooming romance between you and this very boy.\n\nThis game feels more than your usual visual novel. The fact that Cove Holden feels so fleshed out, so detailed and planned, makes him feel like an actual person at times. The choices you make in this game feel insignificant at first, but they all still matter nonetheless. Sometimes I regret treating Cove so nicely in my first playthrough, because if I wanted to play this game and treat him badly, it would make me feel like such a bad person.\n\nCove isn't the only lovable character in this game, of course. The mothers of the MC, the parents of Cove, the friends you make and lose along the way\u2014they all had an impact on me no matter how brief their appearances. The fact that you can now date Derek and Baxter (with the DLCs) could only make me think just how deep their stories really go.\n\nThe music and the artstyle, 10/10. Most of the time I play games while playing songs in the background, but the music in this game really makes you immersed; well, I also did play this game at the God-awful hours of 3am, so that's also a factor. But that also makes another point as to why I have nearly 27 hours and counting on this game: I could play this game from 7pm to 3am, non-stop. The urge to find out how and when the MC and Cove will fall in love kept me playing, because I'm a sucker for these tropes and an even worse sucker for confession scenes.\n\n'Our Life: Beginnings & Always' will always be one of (if not) my favourite visual novel games of all time. Major props to anyone and everyone who worked on this game, including the people who gave this game a positive review so that I could be convinced that this game was worth my time. I've played and heard many stories before, and I will in the future, but rest assured that the stories in this game will be remembered in my heart.", "timestamp_created": 1684638878, "timestamp_updated": 1684638878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138648465": {"recommendationid": "138648465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083541318", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 105486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3301, "playtime_at_review": 31334, "last_played": 1700748586}, "language": "english", "review": "A tribute to love in its many forms.", "timestamp_created": 1684625146, "timestamp_updated": 1684625146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138643594": {"recommendationid": "138643594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244991662", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2883, "last_played": 1685296543}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best visual novel games ive seen :)", "timestamp_created": 1684618897, "timestamp_updated": 1684618897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138641033": {"recommendationid": "138641033", "author": {"steamid": "76561199129090479", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 681, "playtime_at_review": 959, "last_played": 1700464754}, "language": "english", "review": "Baxter my love", "timestamp_created": 1684615877, "timestamp_updated": 1684615877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138631141": {"recommendationid": "138631141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159563265", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5064, "last_played": 1696619183}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing!

The fact that Cove is demi, panromantic, and autistic is such a nice touch too - I rarely ever see games with rep like that with the main love interest <3 and the fact that the player themselves can discover who they are at different stages of life or even know right away what they identify as is a nice touch. It's just super personalised and inclusive and just knocks most other VNs/dating sims out of the park.\n\nI even got the DLC because I was so invested. Definitely a game I will keep coming back to.

I was hesitant to begin the genre because of cliche moments, or feeling like things were forced, or poor options/results to my choices... But this game didn't have any of my expected issues.\n\nThe dialogue: TONS of options. Your responses affect the game, who returns as friends, or who leaves your life... the game has many references to your past decisions, even in the dlc (I only currently own the wedding dlc, with intent to buy more).\n\nCove: The game set it up to be however you wanted it to be in regards to him. How shy he is, how assertive... Do you want him making the first move? Or do you want him to let you? It even went as far as allowing you to tweak his personality at the end of each segment of the game if he had become too shy or assertive during his own growth... This leading to you having whatever experience you want.\n\nInclusiveness: pronoun/gender options, even in wedding scenario. Are you a female, but want to be called a husband at your wedding? Great! However these things are optional and not forced on anyone. The game lets you choose your own comfort with (most of) it, and even change your characters preferences mid game.\n\nIn conclusion, I give it a 10/10. 1: For the vastness of the choices. 2: Feeling like those choices mattered. 3:Ease of use, the game was tailored to my personal playthrough. 4:IT'S FREE!!! Even without any DLC, on ONE PLAYTHROUGH I was at over 11 hours, and that's with me skipping a few things the game had because it didn't suit me or my character I was playing as... Then the wedding DLC put me to over 17 hours total!\n\nSo go buy the game! And even if you don't plan to use it, buy a DLC and support the creators for giving this insane amount of content for free!

This is seriously the most sweet and wholesome games I've played.  After playing, I wanted nothing more than to protect his little pixelated heart! <3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAfter having sunk a ridiculous number of hours into this game and all the DLCs, I honestly cannot recommend this game highly enough.  What a ride.  Our Life: Beginnings and Always is an absolute delight.  The story line is slow, comforting, and peaceful, and all the characters are beautifully fleshed out.  Cove and your MC are really the stars of this masterpiece, and unlike other otome I've played, it was so easy to sink into character and get completely immersed into the game and emotionally invested.  The characters and situations are believable, the emotional reactions were fitting, and I loved the number of options you can make throughout the playthroughs.  I loved the amount of detail put into descriptions and callbacks are frankly astonishing - often characters would recall something and mention events from one Moment to another, truly making you feel like you were having a conversation with them.  As for the additional paid DLCs, they are necessary, but they're absolutely worth getting.  The DLCs add a lot of content to the main story line, and if you found yourself loving the characters there, you'll definitely love spending more time with them via the additional Moments.  I very rarely like replaying visual novel type games, but this is a special exception.  The only thing I didn't like about this game is that, like your time in Sunset Bird, it does eventually come to an end.  But unlike real life people who may eventually grow apart from you, you can always revisit Sunset Bird and know that Cove will always be there for you when you need him.

I was honestly hesitant to even start playing, I wasn't highly thrilled, but this game really roped me in and gave me a good time which I hadn't expected at all. \n\nPros:\n\n- A very relaxing, cozy slice of life game. No stress, really good for a comfort game.\n- Nice and well rounded characters\n- Ocean theme. Always a plus. (I am a massive ocean lover myself.)\n- Nostalgic. Brings back memories of my own childhood. I did not have friends or as much freedom as this but i did live by the ocean. this game was kinda therapeutic in providing childhood experience that felt very realistic with more freedom than i ever had irl and also some buddies. \n- the actual relationship with Cove feels very real.\n- The feeling of time naturally moving along at a steady pace was nicely captured \n- Very inclusive of LGBTQ which makes me happy since i myself am a part of this community. In this game there is a demisexual, panromantic, a trans FTM, and gay moms. yay.\n- touched on some relatable albeit extremely watered down family issues. \n- I got to give a fish a very obscene name and then everyone was referring to the fish by name\n- Generally interesting plot although it drags sometimes and certain things become repetitive \n- characters have arcs and change over time\n- You really feel like a part of the story \n- You are allowed a wide array of choices like your height and assigned gender at birth, your pronouns which you can also change later if you want, and who is more initiative of physical affection in the relationship. very in depth!\n- actually makes you want the DLC and i havent tried them yet but will one day, since they must be as good as the base game after all\n- achievements \n- replayability\n- captured the phases of life really well from the care free days of childhood and teen angst and that awkward part when ur a young adult and dont know wtf to do with your life (me)\n- extremely wholesome\n- good writing but some repetitive terms that get annoying the 100th time youve seen them\n- really pretty artwork\n- idk if others will agree but i found this to be very immersive. when they wake up early for road trips i could almost feel those sensations and their beach visits made me relive my own from the past which was nice since im far away from the place i consider my home, by the ocean.\n\ncons:\n\n- a little bit overly dramatic. i feel that certain things were made out to be a bigger deal than they needed to be, like the $20 bill, admittedly i never been in this situation but i personally feel like it wasn't that big of a deal despite being a very big main conflict in the story. arguments between characters feel very silly and unnecessary. \n- this is only in cons because i didnt know where else to put it, so not to kink shame but headcanon: Cove has a foot fetish. The way that this dude react to an ankle bracelet is just something else. I found it really funny. \n- this thing can be cringey but um what did u expect ahah this is a guilty pleasure and will be cringey\n- sometimes stunted dialog like \"ok\" when i feel like a lot more could be said\n- insufferable banter and bad jokes, but this could be just a me problem \n- so much blushing these people are going to pop a blood vessel\n\ni also realized this is from the same people who made Lake of Voices because of a little mention in the game and i was surprised because thats another really good game and i would recommend u check that out if u havent already \n\n8/10 extremely enjoyable and has much more pros than cons", "timestamp_created": 1682713252, "timestamp_updated": 1682713252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541666686534881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137435200": {"recommendationid": "137435200", "author": {"steamid": "76561199405591591", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4102, "last_played": 1692539134}, "language": "english", "review": "cove is a good fren :)", "timestamp_created": 1682705752, "timestamp_updated": 1682705752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137409814": {"recommendationid": "137409814", "author": {"steamid": "76561199020043166", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1682668065}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly visual novels arent my thing cute romance tho", "timestamp_created": 1682670047, "timestamp_updated": 1682670047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137404647": {"recommendationid": "137404647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855979876", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1403, "last_played": 1697445653}, "language": "english", "review": "help i played this for 6 hours straight on a whim and now i've played it through like four times in five days.", "timestamp_created": 1682660458, "timestamp_updated": 1682660458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137373814": {"recommendationid": "137373814", "author": {"steamid": "76561199058690615", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 599, "last_played": 1684675631}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game and I would trade my left leg in for Cove", "timestamp_created": 1682608234, "timestamp_updated": 1682608234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137356647": {"recommendationid": "137356647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116763508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3067, "last_played": 1694061464}, "language": "english", "review": "WHEN JEREMY DLC?", "timestamp_created": 1682574611, "timestamp_updated": 1682574611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803258657455444", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137355723": {"recommendationid": "137355723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348790546", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2729, "last_played": 1684814028}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game!

As a gal currently approaching 30 and only just getting things set up for an autism assessment, this game allowed me to self insert so hard that I was able to see how different I was as a child, struggling with the same kinds of challenges Cove did. I can't really put into words how much this game felt like a big ole warm blanket straight out of the drier. There was a moment during a market scene where the parents leave your character to shop by yourself - and initially I fell back on what my 'masking' would demand- that I be alright with it. That its not a big deal. Gotta people please, gotta fit in. \nBut Cove finds your character and is very sweet and genuine- asking if you're really ok. And I wouldn't have been, not really. Crowds freak me out, I've just had to squash that down even if it hurts. Later on Cove is angry on your behalf, and says something I found very powerful and touching: 'Just because Y/N tries to make things a good time no matter what, that doesn't mean you can just leave her out of your plans and expect her to go with it every time.'\nLike- ow. You know when you experience something you didn't know you needed? Yeah, that moment was that for me. It was deeply personal. I appreciated it so so much.\nSo uh yeah - thank you devs. I rec this game for anyone who likes slice of life stuff, especially friends to lovers and fluff. If slice of life stuff bores you then you might find this slow, but personally I really enjoyed this game despite not usually liking the genre. \n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1681766710, "timestamp_updated": 1681766710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136857369": {"recommendationid": "136857369", "author": {"steamid": "76561199225369573", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3652, "last_played": 1695502775}, "language": "english", "review": "im crying.", "timestamp_created": 1681738724, "timestamp_updated": 1681738724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136856986": {"recommendationid": "136856986", "author": {"steamid": "76561199465353247", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2043, "playtime_at_review": 13172, "last_played": 1700380866}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "timestamp_created": 1681738166, "timestamp_updated": 1681738166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136854539": {"recommendationid": "136854539", "author": {"steamid": "76561199486482437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3350, "last_played": 1689625946}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game, I highly recommend", "timestamp_created": 1681734525, "timestamp_updated": 1681734525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136845433": {"recommendationid": "136845433", "author": {"steamid": "76561199444347255", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1723, "last_played": 1697716135}, "language": "english", "review": "I wouldn't be lying when I say I am absolutely in love with this game. At first, I downloaded it from another site, and honestly it's the first visual novel that I spent countless hours on, not wanting to leave things unfinished. I just kept playing out different scenarios, and it was all with just the /free/ base, there are simply so many things you could be doing, how you're treating Cove (even though it's hard to be indifferent to him, I couldn't bring myself to try that out), what you want from life... It's such a comforting game, especially to those who are a part of lgbt+ community (being able to make your character trans, or be worried about being gay out in public), but not limited to just that. It's good in every way possible. There was a moment I decided to finally get it on steam though, mainly for the purpose of finally trying out the paid content, and I have to be honest- it was the greatest decision of my life. The DLCs (which are honestly so cheap) are absolutely worth it. More stories, meeting characters in a different way, choosing to date Derek, or maybe choosing to marry Cove.

If not, skip it. [/h1]\n\n[b] PROS: [/b]\n[list]\n[*]The characters and overall artwork are fantastic! They are all drawn really well. The CGs are all beautifully drawn as well.\n[*]TONS (and I mean tons) of options for the player to make throughout the story. While many of these may not significantly impact the gameplay, I think it feels very immersive and more personable to be able to choose every single thing your character prefers throughout the story. I've never played a VN with so many options.\n[*]Generally likable characters all around. \n[*]Choices impact gameplay to a pretty decent extent from what I can tell. They also affect how Cove turns out, although you can choose to alter these either way.\n[*]Options to style Cove the way you want! Really neat feature to be able to choose how you want the main love interest to look like throughout the story.\n[/list]\n\n[b] CONS: [/b]\n[list]\n[*]Although you can \"customize your character\" you never really see your character, except for their arm, so it doesn't really impact much. It would be cool to at least see a bit more of your character in CGs based on what you chose, although I know that might be tougher to code in.\n[*]Kind of a bummer that [spoiler] the highschool years were just entirely skipped over--I think that is when the MC and Cove would have mostly connected during, so it felt like a huge jump over things. [/spoiler]\n[*]Sometimes Cove acted a little silly for his age at times, [spoiler] like when he would say \"Oh my god!\" about little things...very dramatic. [/spoiler]\n[*]Toward the end things just became very underwhelming and I got bored. I started skipping through a bunch of dialogue without reading. There was nothing to really keep you around by the end. I didn't even really care for Cove much by the end. \n[*]Overall my biggest complaint was how woke this game was. I've played many visual novels, but maybe it's because many of them are foreign and more traditional, but this one was definitely American lol. I know there are a lot of young people into all the woke stuff nowadays, but for a regular person it was just a lot of options to go through when just trying to play as a straight female. \n\nI kind of rolled my eyes at the amount of woke options for your character, but I think the real turning point for me was when [spoiler] Cove randomly told the MC that he was demisexual and pansexual or something. It honestly didn't even make sense and felt forced. [/spoiler] \n\n[spoiler] But then randomly at the end, one of their best friends who seemed like a regular girl and had zero signs otherwise, just up and out of nowhere became transgender. And then Cove also randomly was autistic out of nowhere. [/spoiler] It just felt like your typical case of \"what can we do to try and add in wokeness?\" It is just so forced. If you're gonna do it, at least make it make sense and not seem like you added it in last minute just to appease a group of people. I know this will make some people salty, but for anyone not into the woke culture it's a game I would skip. \n\nOverall, I'd give it a 6/10 mostly because the art was wonderful, it was fairly relaxing to play and a nice concept, and I managed to make it til the end. I also enjoyed customizing Cove. Unfortunately, it had too much forced wokeness for my personal taste and took away from the immersion.

I'm planning on buying the DLC to both support the devs, and get more of this amazing game.\n\n9/10 - I never rate things 10/10 because nothings perfect, but damn does this come close.", "timestamp_created": 1681442293, "timestamp_updated": 1681442293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654377877712249756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136648934": {"recommendationid": "136648934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150529243", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 879, "last_played": 1681344460}, "language": "english", "review": "cove is a weird name for a person", "timestamp_created": 1681421727, "timestamp_updated": 1681421727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493533939123153687", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136636086": {"recommendationid": "136636086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832206852", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 849, "last_played": 1684623142}, "language": "english", "review": "Cove is love, Cove is life!", "timestamp_created": 1681403423, "timestamp_updated": 1681403423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136633912": {"recommendationid": "136633912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092163663", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1681401196}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I don't like sand.

Your choices matter in the sense that they are remembered by characters - even in later arcs. The will reference something you did as a kid and you'll laugh about it or tease you good-naturedly. There's a lot of care and attention in the details, and honestly this is the kind of game that makes you feel loved. The characters feel real to me, like they really could be your neighbour or your weird childhood friends or memories of a time growing up. Part of that is that the setting for the game aligns really well with the actual timeline in which I grew up, so I feel like this was all stuff I really did or experienced. But also, the way characters grow throughout the years feels very REAL, but not in a depressing way. \n\nI've played all the DLC for this game (including ones that are currently Patreon only, because yes, I decided to back the project), and while there are a few moments or the odd character I don't personally care for, I think there's a lot here that many people would identify with. Cove is the softest, best boy and I love him to pieces, and it's very friendly towards the LGBTQ+ community. You can make yourself or you can make your dream self, and I think both ways are healing. \n\nThe hardest thing about this game is trying to get the achievement where you are indifferent towards Cove the whole time - probably easier now that there's DLC out for other characters, but that was certainly a TIME when I first did it. But maybe you'll like that too, I dunno!\n\nAnyways, strong recommendation from me for anyone who loves visual novel-type games and a wholesome storyline, whether it be for healing, acceptance or amusement. 10/10 Fantastic game.", "timestamp_created": 1681288060, "timestamp_updated": 1681288060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136560287": {"recommendationid": "136560287", "author": {"steamid": "76561199174259944", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 608, "playtime_at_review": 3162, "last_played": 1700687095}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me cry which means that it's excellent\u2014an 11/10 in my books. \n\n[strike] Also, I would die for Cove.

It is a nostalgic and wholesome story about a childhood friendship (and optional romance) between two neighbour kids who are growing up together in a quiet American beach town. The story is not linear, but consists of \"moments\" that you can play in any order, such as a day at the beach, a sleepover, doing homework, going to the movies or on a roadtrip (and I wish there were more, including a \"step\" of when they are 15-16 years old). I recommend to buy all DLCs before starting playing, so you could enjoy all moments in a single playthrough.\n\nYou have a lot of freedom, from deciding the appearance and personality of the main characters to lots of choices in conversation options. Some of these choices unlock new chat topics, however no matter what options you select, you cannot \"ruin\" the story. Just say what your heart says, and enjoy the heartwarming moments.

There is nothing else out there on the market (outside of their second game) that come close to this. Ive played this game so many times and i love each outcome. So far with the theme of both the first and second game, im hoping it means they are going to do one for each season and id spend all my money on them and the dlc. Please play this and enjoy this with us. \n\n\nI cannot begin to describe the pure unfiltered joy this game has brought my heart, [b] 100% representation throughout the ENTIRE GAME [/b] I'm talking hijabs, headscarves, SO MANY POC HAIRSTYLES, and an entire range of spoken names INCLUDING ETHNIC NAMES and custom pronouns (downside for neo users there is currently no options but hopefully they'll add some of the common ones). You can choose whether you wear pants, skirts, dresses, shirts, or even a combination, it's the same way for jewelry. The customization is a cute little chibi-style character where you only see the face of, but man, SO MANY OPTIONS. It is disappointing at first but they do not let you down. I truly recommend reading through the explanation of how the game works before jumping right in if you are new to this game or type of game. Even if you play without the DLC (which is like 15 together without the soundtrack DLC, don't quote me on that not 100% sure of prices as i got it all during a sale) it's completely worth it. The DLC adds so much more content and story, the world-building and art style pulls the whole thing together. 100/10. It truly is an amazing game and I'm so excited for the new game they are putting out, so please delve into the world of Sunset Bird and love every single second of this coming-of-age story.

I'm actually struggling to come up with words to describe how great this game is.\n\nFirst of all, I love how accepting and open this game is to pretty much everyone. The MC can be a girl, or a boy, or they/them. You can also later choose to change gender, how you see your body, the way you deal with things... And your family and friends are all accepting and nice. Sure, it might be a bit of a fairytale but it has such a positive message.\nYou can also choose which gender you like, if you're comfortable with touching Cove and him touching you or not at all, how far you want to take things... You really are completely in control.\n\nThe amount of choices also is amazing. You really are part of the story and don't just spend minutes upon minutes just reading dialogues before finally being able to choose something again.\nThe art is very nice as well. Every stage the characters get older and I loved seeing how the moms get some gray hairs and how the house changes for example. It's subtle but strongly done.\n\nWhat I loved most though was how you can completely shape the relationship between you and Cove. I myself love romance, hugging, touching but also just being very close to each other. So my relationship with him was basically being glued hip to hip. And I'll tell you, when the characters go to college and have to separate for a time, I really can't remember the last time I cried so hard. It seemed a crime to separate them at that point and I hated the thought of it.\nThe story has a lot of moments where the characters remember their past and are thankful for each other. I will admit, in the end at some points I got a bit tired of it since it felt like a lot of the same thing. But I was still just looking with a big goofy grin on my face and thinking how adorable they are together.\n\n1 thing I did not like is how you never actually see the MC. You can change the way she (/he/they) looks but that's only her face and you never see sprites with her (I'm just gonna go with the MC being a her since this was the case with me). I would've loved it if there were a few, like 4 or 5 pictures or even just 1 where they get married, where you see Cove and the MC together. I understand this would've been difficult with all the things you can choose but another game I played (Tailor tales) does this by offering some basic colours for hair/eyes. You can still change a lot more but the main image only offers those choices.\n\nBut really, that's just nitpicking at this point. This really is the most beautiful, cute, sweet and amazing game and that they ask so little money for it is a crime in my opinion.

This doesn't take away from the experience at all though! \nIt's grand, it's lovely, it is blissfully creep- and yandere-free and it's a breath of fresh air for the genre.\nDon't hesitate to get the DLCs either. \nThis game was made with so much love and it shows. \nIf you like the slice-of-life genre at all (romance optional, but great if chosen), you will adore this.", "timestamp_created": 1678887306, "timestamp_updated": 1678887306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134679641": {"recommendationid": "134679641", "author": {"steamid": "76561199167959364", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5392, "last_played": 1696044699}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes me so sickeningly nostalgic I avoid playing it most of the time just to come back and sob over how much I enjoy the game all over again.", "timestamp_created": 1678843516, "timestamp_updated": 1678843516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134664305": {"recommendationid": "134664305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231527744", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1289, "last_played": 1691634944}, "language": "english", "review": "Very, very sweet game.

There is so much love for the MC - and every choice is okay. There is no bad ending. \n\nA definitive must play for everyone who likes visual novels. The music, the dialogues, the pacing is just perfect. \n\nThe amount of choices and settings you can choose from is incredible - your room design, your hobbies, your sandwich, your crepe choice, your fudge choice, your favorite ice cream, how your character looks, including details like how you feel about your looks.... its endless - it even includes vegan/vegetarian or lactose intolerant dialogue and the game / characters around you remember it all the time (!) through the whole gameplay and is very open minded about everything. \nI was so happy about this detail because irl I often don't get support for this but am criticized for being \"such a picky eater\". \n\nAnd as a nice side effect I learned a lot while playing this game and had so much fun. This is why I think everyone should try it. \n\nOne thing especially surprised me and was very well done: I have never seen a romance VN before where you can actually chose between 3 ways of \"how should the LI and the MC handle intimacy?\" \n\nThe only game I saw a choice like it before was \"When the Night Comes\" and there you had a choice every single time there was touching, a kiss ore more and the game asked how you wanted that to play out (or if not). \n\nHow the authors handled this here is incredible and I love details like this that include the player freedom and the overall \"feel good and relax, this here is a safe place\" feeling of this game so much.\n\nThank you dear developers for this gem! It helped me relaxing when I needed it the most.", "timestamp_created": 1678453714, "timestamp_updated": 1678797856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498400866985321045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134396326": {"recommendationid": "134396326", "author": {"steamid": "76561199050357914", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 4983, "last_played": 1700633013}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2611 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2611 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2611 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2611 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2611 It's free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2611 10", "timestamp_created": 1678443245, "timestamp_updated": 1700633132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86880803108215332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134392399": {"recommendationid": "134392399", "author": {"steamid": "76561199012839742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5945, "last_played": 1693830736}, "language": "english", "review": "The art is absolutely stunning and the music is perfect for the setting.

I [b]would not[/b] recommend this game, unfortunately.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- There are quite a few genuinely sweet moments that literally had me clutching my chest\n- There are a few good supporting characters that are quite interesting and even funny\n- The story is good enough that I finished it (as you can see), so there's something to it\n- The writing itself is well done, from a literary perspective.\n- If you use the Cove Creator, you can modify him to be more to your liking (as his default personality is horrendous but I'll get to that later)\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- This game is toothless, spineless, sexless, mealy-mouthed... all those adjectives and more. It is just so so so bland. As someone who normally plays 18+ otome games and reads a lot of adult fiction, this was, at times, torture to get through. \n  \u25ba The game seems to be actively afraid of anything related to sex or intimacy beyond what middle schoolers will do behind the bleachers (aka - just... kissing). This is fine for the younger stages of the game, but once you reach 18 and beyond, it becomes ridiculous to the point of being a huge distraction. Most grown adults (especially 18 year olds!) don't act like this. Which brings me to my next point...\n\n- The universe this takes place in is very Truman Show-like. It does not exist in any reality I'm aware of, yet  pretends it does by referencing our pop culture and whatnot. It is such a picture-perfect fantasy of a place that it, again, becomes a distraction.  Everyone is filthy rich with seemingly unlimited time and income. Nothing ever goes wrong and nothing bad ever happens; the most serious conflict I can remember is two 18 year olds having a sleepover misunderstanding that was resolved in 2 minutes. \n  \u25ba I kept getting sidetracked and ranting to friends about how nothing in this world made sense (a bunch of 18 year olds go on a boat party and are all too afraid to drink alcohol... right...). It's not like Animal Crossing, which is very clearly hyper-stylized and operates on cartoon logic, and its cutesy fantasy land can be forgiven. This uses hyper-realistic backgrounds, references currents events of our world, and yet is nothing like it. It's very very jarring. There is something so unsettling about how everyone is just so [i]nice[/i] and even the \"mean\" characters are actually just so [i]nice[/i] after a conversation or two. \n  \u25ba There's a difference between escapism and dystopia and this game leans into the latter.\n\n- Cove. COVE. COOOOOOOVE. Holy sh!t. I don't know what they were thinking with this LI. At first, I liked him and felt bad for him, and I find his design in general to be very good and appealing, but I realized over time that I actually started to hate and resent him, which has never happened to me before in all my years of playing otome games with all kinds of trash LIs. By the time I got to the final step, I was actually upset that there was no option for me to turn down the marriage proposal, which is WILD for me to say for an otome game. \n  \u25ba He is just so so whiny, needy, spineless... everything upsets him, everything throws him for a loop, everything makes him freak out in some way shape or form. It's exhausting and deeply unattractive in a LI. Even when, in the last step, he's much friendlier and gregarious, he STILL gets flustered by the dumbest sh!t. It's unreal. \n  \u25ba I also need to point out that Cove is, miraculously, a [b]much better character as long as you never pursue him romantically,[/b] which is also WIIIIILD for an otome game. I tried a friendship route with him out of curiosity and I could not believe how much more interesting and mature he was when he was just your friend. WHERE HAD THAT COVE BEEN?? When you are on a romantic route with him, he's a whiny, sobbing mess; he literally refuses to sleep in the same bed as you, despite the fact that you've basically been dating since you were 8. It's a whole argument and ordeal. But when you're just bros? I asked him to share a bed and he's just like \"Yea, sure!\" in two seconds flat, no issue. ??? THAT is the Cove I would have been interested in marrying, not the one you end up with. It's so bizarre that it almost feels like a bug.\n\n- Customization seems to do nothing other than to change your skin in certain CGs. It would be nice if the player could at least have a little sprite with different reactions in the dialogue box.\n\n- Some of the CGs are unbelievably gorgeous (the one where he's sitting in the window staring at you literally made me gasp because of how good it looked) and others are horrendous and completely take you out of the story. I don't know why they couldn't maintain CG quality.\n\nSo, yeah. Lotta negs, here. This probably sounds like I am unfairly flaming the game or something, but I truly did want to like it. I love otome games, especially ones written in second person, which are difficult too find.

But, like I mentioned this may be more fun to replay for detail-oriented players than big picture players. \n\nIt was the first VN I played that allowed character customization. Even though you do not get to see the MC, since it is first person, the writing considers the selections players made. That is also true in regards of all the little decisions you make along the way. So much care and consideration went into the writing and creation of this game.\n\nThe settings are wonderful. The cast of characters is endearing. The music is calming. Big shout out to Fat Bard for creating such a good song for the game. DCL has been released for this game since it was released.\n\nThe only three areas which I feel this game could improve are that I feel like more characters should have portraits. Even when characters play a minor role in the story. I would love a face to the name or role they are fulfilling. That would further help immersion. This is most noticeable if you are play the Cove Wedding Special DLC. \n\nThe other small area the game could improve in are the special art images, Which I believe unlock once you buy the original game, so you can see them throughout your story then. The art in those images is not of the same quality as the art elsewhere in the game. I do understand why that is. But none the less I feel I should mention it.\n\nLastly, this is just a detail. The way the fireflies are animated in the backgrounds in certain summer evening scenes. They are moving yellow orbs. I do not remember if they fade and reappear as they move at all. It has been a few months since I played this.They do not change in size as they move. Which makes their movement flat. Just adjusting those would help a lot with the illusion of depth. Also if the opaque yellow section was smaller, and they have a larger section with a lower level opacity yellow surrounding the opaque section, with a soft/feathered edge, that would help too. \n\nI am only listing these minor issues due to my love and respect of the game. I want to be honest so I can do what I can to help the creators do even better in the future. I am looking forward to their future projects. :) As I said at the start, this is my favorite visual novel by a mile.\n\nI hold it in higher regard than ones created by big companies which tend to rest on their laurels of set game mechanics, fancy art, and big name voice actors to carry their games. Rather than actually trying create visual novels that will satisfy players better. For which I blame the management and big shot callers at such companies rather than the people who directly create the visual novels. \n\nSo major props to all the indie companies and creators using their freedom to create more satisfying visual novels to play. They are the ones who are the future of visual novels. So please do support them. Thanks for your hard work making this game. And thank you for you time for all who read this. :)", "timestamp_created": 1677434145, "timestamp_updated": 1691109191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503526091575622559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133669143": {"recommendationid": "133669143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280736775", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_at_review": 600, "last_played": 1700491636}, "language": "english", "review": "he is not real and he will never be real, one of the best visual novel game i played", "timestamp_created": 1677421559, "timestamp_updated": 1677995619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520290255546569824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133665414": {"recommendationid": "133665414", "author": {"steamid": "76561199097147455", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2163, "last_played": 1699355743}, "language": "english", "review": "Obsessed, have come back multiple times to replay.", "timestamp_created": 1677418328, "timestamp_updated": 1677418328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133636371": {"recommendationid": "133636371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040780671", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1692672657}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved this game, it's a quick four-five hour romp without the DLC and its very enjoyable.

Almost had me crying on the last stage, because at the end of the day it's not about the romance, necessarily, but reliving those memories of growing up, and still reaching the end where you look back at everything and feel...

Really feels like you can put a lot into your character. From their gender to their style to things like if they want a crepe. You get to choose how much initiative Cove (and Derek if you got the DLC like me) have, what Cove wears, his personality (if he's warmer or if he's sporty, etc.). You also don't even need to end up with anyone, you can go through friendship routes too, especially since you get to choose any sexuality and romantic preferences for your character! I do wish we could see our character while we're speaking, I always forget what they look like and get surprised after each step!\n\nCharacters: I love every character in this game! The MC's moms are both AMAZING I love both of them greatly, their sister Liz is quite charming in her own snarky way, the MC's cousin Lee is a really great female friend to have and is brimming with positive energy. Shiloh and Jeremy make a return from XOXO Droplets (& Blood Droplets haha) and ohhh boy having two members of the Jerk Squad in a warm little game like this was very amusing! (Side note: Jeremy's parents did him dirty with that bowl cut.). Now for the prime character: Cove. Amazing, fantastic, growing up with him you get to see his struggles, his flaws, his fears, and how our friend grows from it all. He's not afraid to be emotional and honest and has a passion for all things Ocean! Cove is a genuinely well-developed character whether you're romancing him, befriending him, or treating him like a stranger.\n\nYou also get to meet Derek, a non-resident of Sunset Bay who comes to visit on his dad's business trips who has a business with Cove's father (another well-rounded, funny, yet tactless character). He's an adorable, responsible, fun-loving guy. And if you're like me, you might end up adoring him enough to get his DLC which is TOTALLY WORTH IT! I love seeing more about his family who are all charming and chaotic (especially a certain little trouble maker.). Derek is an adorable sporty-shorty who puts too much pressure on himself and I adore him.\n\nVibe: The overall vibe is very warm and accepting, the art has a soft nature to it as does the music and every character is friendly (aside from Jeremy lol). You grow up and face hardships, but its all worth it at Sunset Bay.\n\nGreat game, free, inclusive, and very re-playable.", "timestamp_created": 1677115048, "timestamp_updated": 1677115048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614525377750396729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133381587": {"recommendationid": "133381587", "author": {"steamid": "76561199363932808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 829, "last_played": 1677615992}, "language": "english", "review": "Cove. for fuck's sake- COVE I HAVE A DOOR YOU KNOW", "timestamp_created": 1677101150, "timestamp_updated": 1677101150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133312158": {"recommendationid": "133312158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386083784", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1660329355}, "language": "english", "review": "cove is literallty the Autism Creature. i love him so much", "timestamp_created": 1677010593, "timestamp_updated": 1677010593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133307610": {"recommendationid": "133307610", "author": {"steamid": "76561199097272762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12322, "last_played": 1678573451}, "language": "english", "review": "I never write reviews but I have far too many hours in this game.

Out of all of the visual novels I have ever played, this is one of my absolute favorites. Still in shock the game is free! Bought most of the DLC's and felt no guilt from it!

It's LGBTQ+ friendly and provides a safe space for the player. If you are looking for romance, you will not be disappointed! There are a lot of beautiful and sweet romantic moments throughout the game. On the other hand, If you're only looking for friendship, you won't be disappointed either! The story is beautifully written and portrays true emotions a person could experience. Each character is incredibly unique and different in every way, from their character design to their personality. I love that the game is able to give everyone a more enjoyable personality and is still able to provide interactions you would see in the real world. Vulnerability is something that is often overlooked depending on the game you play. But, Our Life: Beginning & Always is able to portray vulnerability with ease, which makes the game so much more enjoyable. I love the way this game is able to tackle difficult topics in a way that makes the player feel emotional and safe. This game has definitely become a comfort game for me, especially when I need a break from the real world. I'm such a sucker for the kid next-door type of romance.

Puppy love, and later deep trust and understanding. \n\nThe game gives you more customization that you could shake a stick at and it's almost overwhelming all the quesitons it asks to customize your experience but in the end getting through all the prompts I felt I could really be ME. I am sure I could play the game again with different options different customizations and see all the different paths the story could have taken but I think I like my run.\n\nAlmost no matter who you are you can be you and there is something special about that and it doesn't seem to pressure you into one thought or another though it does seem to pesteringly keep asking \"Is this how you still feel?\" like a parent might.

The little choices you make can come back later in 'life' as little anecdotes or even big milestones, all woven together to create a wonderful story. If you can, I encourage you to get the DLCs, they add a lot of great content. \n\nAnd if you want my (almost) full thoughts, here you go:\n\nPhew... Where do I begin? I've had the game a week almost hour for hour and oh boy... I may or may have not sacrificed both many responsibilities and much sleep to Sunset Bird, Cove Holden and Derek Suarez (and soon Baxter Ward!) in this short time-frame. Do I regret it though? Oh hell no. It's been worth every tired, squinty-eyed blink and panicked 'oh shoot I gotta do this'. \n\nI initially picked the game up because it was in the LGBT+ tag and it wasn't a 'woohoo sexy wowie bewbs!' game that steam insists on shoving down my throat (get better, steam). I wanted something nice and light y'know? Browsing curiously in search of kindred spirits. \"Huh, a visual novel game?\" I remember thinking, \"Okay, I've never liked them much, but it's free and it probably won't take long. And if I like it enough I can support the devs by buying a DLC or two.\" HA! Oh how na\u00efve I was! \n\nOh boy.\n\nGuys, gals, and pals, I bought all the DLCs within the first 5 hours and have since spent almost 87 hours of my life on this game and have every intention of spending many more on it, although hopefully at a slower rhythm than the unwavering single-minded devotion I've had until now. I can assure you, it's not short, and it's very replayable (I'm on my third(?) full playthrough, with added time for just replaying some moments and steps differently). It IS however light-hearted, impossibly gentle, and the exact kind of relaxing I was looking for. \n\nIt was thrilling to find out I could not only pick neutral pronouns, but got to change them at the beginning of every step if I so desired, and then throughout the game even got to pick assigned gender and how I wanted my MC to present, the clothes they would wear when the occasion called for it, surgeries and HRT they may have been through... \n\nThe game offers countless possibilities to explore oneself, which I think is absolutely fantastic; for people still in the closet, for people searching themselves, for people who know themselves and what they enjoy inside out, the thing we have in common is that we'll all have a nice time, whether we're playing as a completely original character of our own imagining, or projecting ourselves into the story. It's easy; there's no pressure, you do it however you want as many ways as you want, as many times as you want. The game respects boundaries as much as possible, giving options all the way to your choice of greeting people, old and new.\n\nThe only real 'downsides' I can find is that I would like to be able to have even more fluffy and cuddly little moments, as well as the option of poly. \n\nI am so very very fond of this game, it's a true labour of love, and am so glad I picked it up. This has quite honestly been exactly what I needed lately; a little escape to a peaceful place. \n\nHighly recommend, Cove/10", "timestamp_created": 1676057223, "timestamp_updated": 1676111754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132502737": {"recommendationid": "132502737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452347728", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 93, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1699817944}, "language": "spanish", "review": "One of the sweetest games I've played, can't get enough of it <3", "timestamp_created": 1676002277, "timestamp_updated": 1676002277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132501367": {"recommendationid": "132501367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125985939", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 109, "playtime_at_review": 757, "last_played": 1699759491}, "language": "english", "review": "the things i wouldn't do to have a cove in my life is not a very long list.", "timestamp_created": 1675999472, "timestamp_updated": 1675999472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132495707": {"recommendationid": "132495707", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229873331", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 140, "playtime_at_review": 4019, "last_played": 1700521344}, "language": "english", "review": "This means so much to me as a person.

Very LGBTQ+ friendly and inclusive. You can customize the main character (you) almost completely. Can be a romance novel if you want it to be, but can also choose to just have the love interest be your friend. There are some heavier topics like divorce, bullying and body image issues, but it is not touched on in depth unless you pry. The characters are interesting and unique. The setting/town is very nostalgic, the environment feels very safe and lighthearted. The base game is completely free, but I bought all of the DLC for the extra scenes and extra moments. It was completely worth it. You get a lot more attached to the characters as you go on, as you and the people around you get older throughout the years. There are very bittersweet moments while you grow up in game, which do nod back to real life and how relationships can change over time. The art style is beautifully well made, very pleasant to look at. The music is also amazing to listen to. The entire soundtrack I find myself coming back to time and time again as it gets stuck in my frequently and overall is very pleasant. I don't have many complaints about this game at all, but one of the things I don't like is how short it is. It took me about 4 hours to get through the entire base game.

You never have to really agonize about your decisions - with very rare exception, decisions are mostly about self-expression and deciding what sorts of scenes you want to see, rather than affecting the world around you.

I didn't think much of it, but then again it was the first game I've ever downloaded via Steam. I was surprised that I spend 24 HOURS playing through Cove's (non-DLC) routes and I fell in love with his character. Not only is he fully flushed out as a character (pros and cons - gotta love them) but there are choices that MATTER. OUR choices MATTER and they don't have to be paid for! \n\nGAME PLAY\nIf you have the chance to get the DLC content, I admit it's very--VERY worth it. The developers have DLC content for each stage and then the final stage (which is the wedding). Each patch has at least an hours worth of content because there are additional stories you are free to explore or not explore. Memories you can make or skip -- I would not recommend skipping them though because once a memory is started it can't be stopped and once you go on to the next stage you can't go back (unless you saved). Also if you skip memories, you won't be able to make more personalized choices in the game. The DLC content is sprinkled with little moments that Cove will remember going into the next stages, i.e. if you told Cove your favorite flower is the peony, in the wedding DLC he's going to want you to have peonies. BUT I will say that this works even without the DLC content, you won't get a half-baked Cove Holden in the free play. \n\nINCLUSIVE\nI spent so many hours (24) playing through the free version of this game testing different outcomes. What would it be like if I played this stage (stage 1 is where you and Cove are kids) in my childhood mindset? What would it be like if I went with my instincts now? The choices, at least for me, changed. There are options to change Cove and customize him however you might like, personality and looks wise, but I think there's something special about how YOUR choices affect his personality in each stage. The save section is one of the most valuable pieces (MVP?) in the game because you don't have to backtrack so far if you want to change a certain outcome.\n\nThere are 3 stages in the free play: childhood, early teen, and late teen. In each section you decide how you want to navigate your life. There are so many options and I don't want to spoil anything so here's a great example. Sometime between early and late teen (stages 2 and 3) you get to decide how you view yourself. Are you tall or short? Do you feel secure about that? Are you a vegetarian or pescatarian? How are you in your sexual orientation? What are your long-term goals and are you feeling nervous about the future? All of these questions (and more) are yours to explore as you play through the game. Not only are these very personal and immersive questions that make you feel as if you're really part of the game, but these are moments that make you feel heard if not seen.\n\nCHARACTERS\nCove, for all intents and purposes, is a cinnamon roll who needs a hug. He's a character who I didn't expect to care for so deeply (I ended up buying all the extension packs and I have no regrets -- but you don't need to do this to fall in love with him). He plays the roll of that neighbor kid you grow up next to and you get to decide how much/little you want him in your life. He can be your childhood sweetheart (Taylor Swift?) or he can be your best friend and greatest ally. He can even be the kid you grew up next to, no obligations or anything. Because of how the game is structured through stages, you ultimately get to decide.\n\nThe game, for the most part, is centered around you, Cove, family, and friends. As I mentioned earlier, it's a game that heals the heart and soul because I'm pretty sure everyone's got a little something they wished they could've done in the past (or maybe future if you're younger) that they wished could've happened -- in a realistic sense of course. You get the chance to live vicariously through your character. Between the family dynamics of your moms (yes there are two) and your friends (because it's not ALL about Cove), I got to experience what it would be like to be in different supportive environments. It also heals the inner child because I was also able to play the mischievous younger sibling for once. I didn't always have to make that mature decision, even if I wanted to do something else impulsively. Here, you can do that but it won't change the way your family or friends view you (not in a negative sense). Or if you want to play that mature character, you can totally do that too, again the affection from the other supporting characters aren't conditional.\n\nThen here comes Derek! I ADORE Derek Suarez, you get to see him in stage 2 and from small snippets it's really cute to see the boy have a crush on you. Sorry to say though, that if you don't have Derek's special DLC then you won't see him much after stage 2. Free play Derek isn't around as often as I wished he were, but I had enough of his character to want more. When his DLC came out, I did buy it and I have no regrets. This is where the story can become EVEN MORE interesting. Derek has a crush on you, and it's pretty hard to miss. However, when you get into his DLC content you realize there's so much more to the short kid with green eyes. I won't spoil anything about Derek because if you decide to pick up his DLC, then you've dedicated yourself to learning more about him. I already have the wedding DLC and got it before Derek's, but once I downloaded Derek's I also found out that he's got a stage after stage 3 where you are both adults. I'm not sure if you get this stage with Derek's DLC but I'm taking a wild guess it's a yes since Derek pops up in stage 2 and this final stage where you are adults. In this last stage you make big kid decisions and decide what you want at the very end -- is it marriage or is it just friendship? You pick.\n\nThe hard part is choosing between which one you want though! Even though you don't have to go the romantic route with either of the boys (Cove/Derek) you certainly can. I haven't tried doing anything like having a crush on both of them at the same time, yet, but whatever you decide they will both be respectful about it. Even if you get Derek's DLC you don't have to choose to want Derek romantically at all, he's a solid friend just like Cove. However it does get difficult because they're both so endearing. \n\nBaxter (the third and final prospect) comes at stage 3, but just like free play Derek you won't get much of him until the developers come out with his DLC (and I'm patiently waiting). He does pop up in the wedding DLC and Derek's DLC (in stage 2), which is a nice surprise but there's not much about him to really say. He is interesting though, I will say that (again patiently waiting).\n\nCONCLUSION\nI could go into so much more detail about this game, but if you've already made it this far then you should try out the free version! I emphasize this so much because I'm not the type to pay for games unless I'm really dedicated (Mystic Messenger/My Child Lebensborn), and I found that this has made it on to that list of never delete ever. Even without the DLC content, I still love the game and I'm sure that if you give it a fair shot then you will too.", "timestamp_created": 1674240607, "timestamp_updated": 1674379227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131197827": {"recommendationid": "131197827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034666883", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 648, "last_played": 1674125792}, "language": "english", "review": "+++ The writing is extremely well done.

Seems to average at about 6 choices per situation on what to do or say.\n\n+ Handles sensitive topics like [spoiler]gender and divorce[/spoiler] extremely well.\n\n+/- As a straight male, I felt like I wasn't the target audience for this game. I was frequently presented with choices and situations to get romantic with Cove, [spoiler]Derek, or Baxter[/spoiler]. There are no female characters you have the choice of being romantic towards. I didn't realise this until about 1/4 through the game, and at that point I decided to keep playing for the good story. Luckily you can play the entire game at the \"friend\" level, and it \"mostly\" respects your choice, apart from the occasional \"are you sure you don't want to be gay?\" situation.\n\n- I only started buying the DLC during Step 2, but the DLC assumes you've bought the DLC for all previous steps, and it was very confusing because I had no idea what the characters were talking about.\n\n- The choices are not very \"deep\". There are references, jokes, etc, to past choices, but I didn't feel like anything I did had a dramatic impact outside the individual \"Moment\". You still end up having access to every Moment, and each Moment will still follow the same general direction.\n\n-- You never really leave the main town outside of special occasions, almost everything happens within the same few locations ([spoiler]your house, Cove's house, the steets, the hill, the beach covers 90% of the Moments[/spoiler]).

Overseas trip to the [spoiler]Philippines[/spoiler]? [spoiler]The struggles of moving in and living together?

As a gay man it is quite hard for me to find LGBTQ+ games that are both fun, fluffy and don't portray my existence as taboo. This game is exactly what I needed. \n\nYou play as the adoptive child of a lesbian couple who live in pretty much a quiet middle of nowhere type of neighbourhood. The journey starts when you are 8 and you can customise pretty much everything about yourself from your name, your pronouns, your physical appearance, whatever scars you might have, whether you wear a hijab or not and the types of clothing and accessories you prefer. It provides quite a bit of diversity (although of course as a white man I can only judge that from my narrow perspective). The customisation continues in step 2 (when you are 13) and step 3 (when you are 18) and you are allowed to change every aspect of yourself including your pronouns at any point between each step.\n\nAs for the story, Cove a young boy moves into the neighbourhood with his dad and you get to grow alongside him. There is not much that can be said without spoiling the contents of the game however there is a wide variety of choices on your answers (most of which affect the story later on). Before each step starts you can choose your feelings towards Cove so if you'd prefer playing this game just by nurturing a friendship with him that is possible. You can also choose to customise Cove in full (appearance and personality).\n\nThe art is stunning. The only issues I have in terms of it (and this is where you might get spoiled so be advised) is that in step 3 Derek and Terry seem to be hastily made. Specifically their voices. There is nothing I can directly point out as wrong per se they just seem to be out of place. Their voices sound as if they are put through a voice changer to sound deeper and personally it felt weird to hear.\n\nOther than that, the game itself is a masterpiece in my eyes and I keep coming back to it no matter how many times I've played it through. I wish there was more to it because I can never get enough of Cove!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1673405492, "timestamp_updated": 1673405492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130609172": {"recommendationid": "130609172", "author": {"steamid": "76561199220976227", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1118, "last_played": 1683674475}, "language": "english", "review": "loveeeeeeeeeeeeeee", "timestamp_created": 1673404678, "timestamp_updated": 1673404678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130604939": {"recommendationid": "130604939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156364150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 656, "last_played": 1692208406}, "language": "english", "review": "mmmm wedding dlc baxter \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "timestamp_created": 1673398277, "timestamp_updated": 1673398277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130598208": {"recommendationid": "130598208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198871978357", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 4905, "last_played": 1700111056}, "language": "english", "review": "im so unhealthily in love with this game and its characters, i've replayed it about a doze times and each time i manage to find something new or find the same joy I had when i first played.

I've had loads of fun playing as a complete jerkoff in different flavors, although not so much in how little that ultimately affects overall story progression. This works very well within Steps, however; no problem there. It seems like the only things that really matter here are your approach to Cove and your relationship status with him, as side characters sometimes don't seem to remember what you've said or done to them. Probably a caveat of the feel-good angle this VN is working with, but it doesn't really work for me. Mind you, this could also just be a target audience issue lol\n\nDLC is totally worth it; it gives you more opportunities to experiment with your character's choices and seeing how they play out in other scenarios within the same Step. Additional scenarios also grant you more opportunities to see if you want to leave things the way they are with Cove or maybe bump it up to Fond/Crush/Love in future Steps. With more scenarios, I ended up especially loving Lee from Step 2, Terri and Baxter from Step 3, the entire Suarez family (cop that Derek DLC, it's so worth it wtf) and one \"secret\" character from Derek's route. Hell, I even started to come around with Jeremy in the Step 3 DLC. Took my constant abuse of him in past Steps in stride lmao, god bless\n\nThe gripes I have with Beginnings and Always appear to be rectified in the Now and Forever demo along with the addition of incredible features; I've been bleeding said demo for everything it has, I absolutely can't wait to grow alongside Tamarack, get into tussles with Qiu's gang and learn more about the player character's mother. I also do appreciate how characters are more willing to disagree with you and assert themselves as they do in XOXO Droplets, which I would love to play but can't because I absolutely despise the player character in that one.\n\nBut again, Cove starts to really annoy me in Step 3 onward with his near disregard for relationship status; you can be as disinterested, aromantically fond, intimately interested or deeply committed to him as you want and he'll almost certainly react the exact same way with a strange sense of reverence. His actions make a lot more sense if you're at the Crush or Love level, but Fond could work if you intend on dating Cove in future Steps in a friends-to-lovers sort of way.\n\nAgain, there are myriad ways to play Beginnings and Always thanks to robust customization in comparison to other dating sims and VNs like it. Your choices don't always make a difference and the roster of dateables isn't the best at the moment, but the sheer amount of story and development present in this game is hard to stay neutral about. So much went into developing these characters, that much I can tell. The base game is pretty good, but beware: you get one DLC pack and you're gonna want to get the rest of them once you see how expansive this installment of Our Life can get.

I have 30 hours on it for a reason and have replayed the whole game multiple times. It's a very cute, feel-good game where you can pursue friendship, romance, or neither with the absolute sweetheart known as Cove Holden.\n\tIn the game, you play as a main character you can customize the name, pronouns, look, and personality of. That means you could play as you, or a random character you made up. The game is divided into 4 steps, each showing the characters at a different age and each having unique game-play. And, you can unlock even more stuff for each step with the DLC (I recommended it, it's super fun and cheap) plus an entirely new step where you can plan your and Cove\u2019s wedding (if you decide to have a romantic relationship with him.)\n\tThe game is really chill and cute, without much conflict or many antagonists so it's never stressful. It's something to play if you just want to be happy and relaxed and can be picked up quickly when you have a little free time (no super long loading screens, don't have to play with a mouse, and don't need a super great computer to run). Plus, you can save the game at literally ANY point, which is always super nice. All in all, I highly recommend this because its absolutely so cute, it can be replayed an endless amount of times with all the different choices you get, and it's also free, so why not?

And it instantly had me completely hooked that I ended up playing it over and over.\nBecause there are so many possibilities in how you can play the game and what kind of routes you do in what order, with so much customisation that it's almost insane. I have never seen a Dating Sim where you could actually create yourself or any kind of OC you want to such a level, since all other games I had played before have some kind preexisting personality type for the MC, unlike here where the player can decide on everything, from looks, to personality, to gender, to sexuality, and how your life with Cove will go.\n\nThe characters are all so wonderful and I instantly ended up loving them. Where once again it's completely up to the player if they want to befriend them all or not. They are fun to interact with, have heartfelt backstories to explore, and are just such loving people that it makes you feel all warm inside.\nThe way the game is made is so well done as well. It's such a heartwarming story where you get to grow up over the course of the story and decide on the MCs development and get to see how your past actions have influence on the later steps in game. [spoiler]Like when letting Cove in Step 1 buy you a keychain, you can later on use it in Step 3 for your phone and he will recognise it. Or how he will in both Step 2 and Step 3 gift you your favourite flower if you tell him about it in Step 1.[/spoiler] It is clear just how much love has been put into this game by the developers. Where the same can be said about all the DLC, which are worth every single last cent.\nAlso another thing worth mentioning, which many might also agree on; as an autistic, queer person it really made me feel so deeply loved with how much everyone in the game is accepting of it all and even encouraging about it. The same is also the case with any body types, where everyone is so loving about it. Everyone in the cast is always ready to encourage you for being yourself and openly loves you for being who you are.\n\nAll in all I love this game so much and can only keep on recommending it to everyone there is.

I so heavily recommend this game it's not even funny.\n\nI am not kidding when I say this game was transformative for me. As clich\u00e9 as it may sound, this game changed my view on parts of my life, and it helped heal wounds I didn't even realize I had.\n\nOn a more direct note, this game had an excellent illusion of choice for my first run through. Every choice felt like it had an impact, and I held onto each moment like my life depended on it. The amount of description choices to fill out your character were superb, and extremely inclusive, even though I wish they came back up more often. Subsequent playthroughs made it easy to see through the cracks, to see that there wasn't really many choices (or at least, none I was willing to make), but that doesn't soil the initial experience. The theatre of the mind was also strong, supported by solid writing and relatable material. Cove Holden is a solidly written main character, and feels enough like a standalone person from the MC to be all the more endearing, regardless of the routes you take. The supporting characters are nothing to scoff at either - all of them are equally interesting, caring, and well thought out.\n\nThe story beats struck a chord with me and had me sobbing. Often. It's a more personal reaction based on my past experiences, but that feeling made this game all the more memorable. I will hold onto the memory of this game for possibly the rest of my life. Unironically, this game reminded me that I love the idea of love, and I love the idea of having someone in my life whose presence every day is as certain as the sun rising.\n\nI have never felt the feeling of \"Fernweh\" so intensely as I did playing this game. The longing to live the simple childhood of growing up loving your best friend is something I can obviously never achieve. I will never get my childhood back, let alone in such a carefree and loving place, surrounded by so much unconditional love. And that feeling is so precious. Something I wouldn't trade for the world. There is something profound about how this game played out for me, and I can only hope others can experience even half of what I got to cherish.\n\nLet's be real, I processed more emotional trauma because of playing through this game than in the several years I've been in therapy haha.\n\nEven as life takes more steps forward, I know I can always return to Sunset Bird and to our lovely ocean boy.

This one really touched me. I really enjoyed the setup of different life stages and growing up not just with Cove, but with friends and family. The personality details for each of the characters are great. I found myself incredibly attached to the sister Liz. As an into child myself, I got a feel for what it was like to have a sister, and was thrilled to make her my maid of honor in the DLC.\n\nThis game doesn\u2019t have high stakes or crazy plot twists. It leans hard into wholesomeness, which I was definitely okay with.\n\nPro Tips:\n- Get the wedding DLC. You will absolutely not regret it. It is quite a lot of extra content and I found myself way more touched than I thought I could be.\n- By accident, I had to replay this game before I originally beat it. I first got to end of Step 3, and then had to start again from scratch b/c I didn\u2019t have my computer with me when visiting family. The first time, I went very Slow Burn mode and didn\u2019t become a couple until inbetween 3&4. The second play through, I went to way bolder and became a couple as soon as possible - so many different and great moments then, and if you like slow burn, I think you will also really enjoy the payoff if you go about play through the same way.\n- Join the GB Patch Patreon for some *ahem* extra dlc and cultured content ;)\n\nThat is all.

your choices don't get forgotten as it goes on is SICK. you can quite literally be anyone you want to be and it's refreshing.\n\nplus it doesn't force you into a romantic relationship with anyone. you can be just friends (or even less) with cove and derek.\n\nlove love LOVE this game :) thank u so much for allowing people to enjoy this", "timestamp_created": 1672187062, "timestamp_updated":

The LGBTQ+ representation is amazing and they give you a TON of choices for gender expression and sexuality. Cove is such a layered character with complex emotions and reactions, and it makes it feel like your choices really really matter. Sometimes the romantic lead in other dating sims can feel a little shallow or like they'll fall in love with you no matter how you interact with them, but this game is entirely different. You can even choose to not get together with him and just be friends if you want! I haven't done that myself, but it's nice that you have the option. The settings for how Cove interacts with you are also an amazing touch. I love that you can change how much initiative he takes in interacting with you. My first playthrough I chose medium because I wanted to be the one to initiate most things, but he still initiated a little. I'm going to try high initiative in my current playthrough. So excited! Overall a fantastic game. I can't believe the base game is free! Honestly a super smart choice because I loved the game enough from trying it that buying the DLC is completely worth it.

It's a real treat.\n\nSo thanks GB patch, for helping me with myself, my girlfriend, and our shared boyfriend Cove Holden", "timestamp_created": 1669662462, "timestamp_updated": 1669662462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127405032": {"recommendationid": "127405032", "author": {"steamid": "76561199222543036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2253, "last_played": 1698516422}, "language": "english", "review": "the best thing in the world", "timestamp_created": 1669651252, "timestamp_updated": 1669651252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127392397": {"recommendationid": "127392397", "author": {"steamid": "76561199110074395", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1675125753}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't.

Though I'd heard of the game before, I only played a few months ago, starting a save file with my girlfriend... then I ended up so addicted to it that I stayed up til 2-3 am after work playing it. Then when I finished the DLC, I stayed up til 3 yet again to write Cove/MC fanfic haha <3 \n\n As a VN writer and longtime gamer, Our Life is one of the best visual novels I've ever had the pleasure of playing. It's so fun and never gets old despite how many times you replay. (The variations and callbacks are insane btw, kudos to the GB Patch team for that!) \n\n It's so wholesome and lighthearted. The jokes never failed to make me laugh (I loved teasing Cliff and Cove). And the hurt/comfort moments were handled so excellently. The Reflections DLC moment got me bawling so hard. The realism and depth of these characters are amazing. \n\n Whoever said the perfect man doesn't exist has never met Cove Holden. (And this is where I took a mini break to cry because I miss him so much.) Getting to know him was such a precious, irreplaceable experience. He's a wonderful friend and playing the platonic route was fun, but honestly? He's one of my Top Tier LIs of all time. Sweet, stubborn, and maybe a little bit spoiled (who can say no to him??), Cove is so easy to love. His struggles in dealing with change is so relatable. The way he can be /our constant/ in a life that's ever changing is so beautiful. I can't wait to replay the game and love Cove all over again!! \n\n Derek was fricking amazing too. He's such hardworking thoughtful guy with issues that cut deep (I vibed with having a fam that's very dependent on you and struggling to figure out your career). \n\n I'M SO EXCITED FOR BAXTER WHO I [lowkey sp0iler alert] ACCIDENTALLY GOT AT THE SOIREE IN STEP 2 BY A STROKE OF FATE LMAO!!! [end sp0iler]\n\nLike I said, the supporting cast was so fun and comforting too. Ma and Mom are lovely, and I adore Kyra and Cliff so much. Elizabeth really felt like an older sibling, and I love the Filipino rep <3 \n\n All in all, it broke my heart to say goodbye to Sunset Bird, especially since real life changed so drastically, so similarly to the end of step 3. But Cove was always there. Every, \"See you tomorrow\" came true (especially at the butt crack of dawn, oh Cove). There are no words to accurately describe how returning to Sunset Bird feels so comforting, how being surrounded by all these loving and lovable characters felt like family, and how seeing Cove again feels like home, the way our MC is home to him. \n\n Thank you so much, GB Patch.

The story is beautiful and all of the characters feel like real people who develop naturally over the course of the four sections of the game. The dialogue is both fun and accurate to how real people talk. The MC's relationships with their mothers, sister, and especially Cove are all extremely well developed no matter which path you choose. You can do indifferent to lovers, friends to lovers, or mutual pining in your relationship with Cove, all of which are fun routes to play. I highly recommend going the friends to lovers route because that felt the most satisfying for me, especially waiting until the very end for the confession, but I am a sucker for slow burns. I also highly recommend the DLCs for this game because they all add exciting and fun new stories that show even more sides of the wonderful characters, like Cove's parents and the MC's high school friends.
