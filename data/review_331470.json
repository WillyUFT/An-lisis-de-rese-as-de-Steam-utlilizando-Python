On one hand Steam recommended me this in play next and the visual novel isn't really my type of genre for solo play. Still, i don't mind and actually quite like the reading format. The visuals are pretty nice, although they seem inconsistent at times. \n\nThe big elephant in the room though.. actually two elephants. First elephant is that from first impression it kind of plays like.. a harem? At start we have a guy that's asocial, doesn't handle the life well and doesn't seem to have a drive to change it. Suddenly he gets Isekai'd into a reality where many girls from the get go seem to treat him favorably. I dislike that stuff and even if the plot is centered around that and mindblowingly justifies it in a masterful way, i still likely would've had a bitter taste from it. That's not how reality works and i'm not a fan of escaping into fantasy atleast in that way.\n\nSecond elephant in the room.. oversexualization. There are scenes that have literally NO reason to show a panty shot or show some sexy graphics whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, i do enjoy the curves, the energy, hairstyles etc. of them feminine girls but my dislike for harem fantasy escapism is also paired with dislike for oversexualization. I think in case of games (atleast the ones i preffer to play), the horny mode should be left out of them, unless the nudity or whatever else is unintentional or super brief. There's gf or pron sites to activate horny mode on. \n\nWhile there are some decisions, i feel like there could be more and the ''uncontrolled boat sway'' aspect of our character while adventurous, can feel weird at times, especially when i keep on my mind something i'd like to do and something that would make lots of sense to do, but can't be.\n\nStill, the interactions, setting and the intrigue want me to play more - along with the pros stated at the top. I've barely touched the game so there's likely quite a bit to find out. For now it's.. 6.5/10. As stated, i'm not a big fan of playing visual novels by myself and i'm surprised Steam somehow made a recommendation like that.

One of the symptoms of this developmental disorder is a complete lack of social inhibition, which makes the person particularly outgoing and trusting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying we have found the mutation that controls sociability,\u201d Bridgett vonHoldt, one of the authors of the study, told The Verge. \u201cThe story is far from complete.\u201d\n\nVonHoldt first noted these similarities in a 2010 study and tested the theory by running a series of behavioral tests on 10 wolves and 18 dogs. Researchers placed the animals in a room with a puzzle box that contained a piece of summer sausage \u2014 first by themselves and then with a human. The wolves went for the sausage no matter what, but the dogs couldn\u2019t focus if a human was in the room.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re really doing is just obsessively staring at this human,\u201d vonHoldt said. \u201cThey don\u2019t really care about the task, they\u2019re just interested in the person.\u201d\n\nThe research is part of a broader study that\u2019s trying to figure out exactly how dogs evolved from wolves, and came to be domesticated. The team acknowledged that the sample of animals was small and more research needs to be carried out before they determine what exactly this new finding means.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t found a \u2018social gene,\u2019 but rather an important [genetic] component that shapes animal personality and assisted the process of domesticating a wild wolf into a tame dog,\u201d vonHoldt told

The English translations are a bit rough, however you quickly can get used to it.

Unfortunately I do not speak Russian, so I am unable to enjoy any of the community made mods, but the base game along with it's fan-made sequel was more than enough content for this game to have a spot in my memories for years to come. \n\nPlease give this game a try if you haven't already, and make sure to finish through to the end, because I promise you, the last few endings are so good that it makes it well worth your while. \n\nOverall, a 9.5/10 game.", "timestamp_created": 1682902360, "timestamp_updated": 1682902360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605263113975524902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137580723": {"recommendationid": "137580723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133925696", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 823, "last_played": 1684090332}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

It looked like a standard \"visual novel\".  But, having played it for 5 hours... I am pleasantly surprised at how compelling it is.  It is truly a \" choose your own adventure\".  There are a TON of choices, and from what I have seen, huge divergences in the story and how it ends depending on the choices you make.  Quite honestly, the most dramatic differences in the ending of a game that I have seen.  \n\nWithout spoiling anything, but I got one seriously dark ending that seemed like it was going to be a \"good\" ending, one genuinely good ending which is actually identified as a \"bad\" ending (by the achievements), one bad ending that was short and to the point, and 1 neutral ending which was pretty unsatisfying and slightly dark.  I did that in 5 hours.  In reality, I was sort of power-skipping through some of the dialogue the 2nd time, though I would slow down for when it was something clearly different from what I had already seen.  \n\nI am 100% going to keep replaying this until I get all of the endings, and this time, I am going to write down every single decision point in the game and what choices I made, because there are so many, if you don't do that, there is definitely no way you will be able to remember all of the choices you made before that point.  I am sure there are guides out there, but I want to do it myself to test myself and see how well my strategy works.  \n\nThe writing itself is quite good.  With a surface inspection, it seems shallow, but if you really pay attention, and especially if you replay it... you begin to realize it is a massive onion and there are tons of layers.  Some really interesting, introspective and philosophical stuff.  The \"really dark ending\" which seemed like it was going to be a happy ending... was all about whether what had happened was real or imagined, if it FELT real and it HURT worse than anything that the protagonist had experienced up until that point.... did it really matter whether it was \"real\" or not?  For all intents and purposes, it WAS real, more REAL than anything else in the life of the protagonist....\n\nThe art can be quite beautiful in places.  I am legitimately going to try to figure out who created that art so I can follow them on Instagram, because it is really good.  \n\nHighly recommend.  This isn't a sex game.

I mean come on, it sounds ridiculous. Mostly because of the Russian Miku who I will now be referring to as Muki for the rest of this review. I booted Everlasting Summer up and proceeded to go through the opening and prologue just expecting terrible writing. However I actually started to get really invested in the world because of how well done Everlasting Summer is made. To start, this game actually has a fire soundtrack, the visuals are great, characters are lovable and there is this gorgeous opening scene which roped me in really quickly. The story itself is extremely interesting and had me constantly wanting more and more. I can't delve into specifics as to avoid spoiling anything for anyone. But Everlasting Summer has great dialogue that really makes you care and get invested in its cast of characters. Like Muki.\n\nNow this visual novel is very long. Its something you would take breaks between playing and pick up on different days. If you are someone who prefers short 30 min to 1 hour visual novels it probably isn't for you. On top of that Everlasting Summer has like 14 endings, seven good and seven bad. Half of them you can save before the final choices.

So I decided to make a Steam\naccount to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game\nsince the 80's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing this game.\nI loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games\nreminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought\nme and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.", "timestamp_created": 1668453620, "timestamp_updated": 1668453620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487918227910995483", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125440179": {"recommendationid": "125440179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198863201170", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1675034347}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is free but the story is really good.

highly recommend it to anyone, but especially to people in their early adulthood.\n\nHere's a review for those that might be interested in investing 20 hours of their life into the game : \n\nFirst of all, the soundtrack is beautiful and diverse. It is well handled and conveys the intended emotions smoothlessly.\n\nThe graphics are pleasing to the eye, especially the backgrounds. They are not always accurate to what is happening in the scene, but they capture the feelings with great care. \n\nAs it is a visual novel, the gameplay is quite simple, mostly limited to making choices. The game engine is quite basic but is more than enough to serve the gameplay. There are options to listen to the soundtrack, to watch a photo gallery and to watch the unlocked endings. All of which are great bonus.\n\nThe story is captivating. I was not always a fan of the MC's personality but I was still eager to know what would happen in the next scenes and read his inner thoughts. We feel a large array of emotions, from joy, sadness, fear, anger, etc... The game never feels likes it's trying to enforce an emotion, it just comes naturally. The characters have depth and are authentic, with their lifelike qualities and imperfections. The endings are well conceived and each have their own flavours that makes it worth to try to see them all.\n\nOverall, this game is a great experience filled with nostalgia, I had a great trip down to memory lane. The game being free (which is a steal honestly, I would gladly give $40 to the studio) and relatively short, anyone should at the very least pick up the game and try to finish it once. I wish more games were like this one, that studio would invest more in breathtaking stories instead of tasteless standardized AAA scenarios that have become the norm.", "timestamp_created": 1665366477, "timestamp_updated": 1665366477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123601616": {"recommendationid": "123601616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272422419", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 861, "last_played": 1661052852}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game a few years back and recently replayed a portion for the achievements.

The developers somehow managed to tie everything together for the people that kept playing their game even after finishing it once, giving us a satisfying and emotional conclusion. \n\nAll the stories all incredibly well written. Every time you'd think you can guess what happens, the story surprises you again and again. The characters do fall into the usual tropes we know, but that doesn't make them shallow. Every one of them has their unique traits, conflicts and phylosophy, it's something that makes every path you take feel like a completely new game.\nThe deeper you dive into it, the more unforseen outcomes you see, it's something I value a lot in a story, especially if it fits well into the rest of it.\n\nReading it was a pleasure, but the music is also unbelievably good. I love how the impact of a scene is shaped by the great music. An emotional part is accompanied by a fitting track to truly set the mood, an intense scene is ignited by the powerful tones, the way they've used sound to paint the atmosphere is amazing. (A good example would be in Ulyana's route, when the protagonist is telling her a ,,scary story\", right as Semyon is slowly building up his space station universe, the music changes, completely switching the tone just to give more power to the otherwise uninteresting to the reader story. When I got to this part, I wanted to skip through it because I didn't want to waste time on a non-canon little fairy-tale, but when the music dropped, it instantly got me curious as to what I might have missed when spamming spacebar. Just that intense music alone got me to look back and read it from the beginning, something that I do not regret.)\n\nThe only negative critiques I could think of would be the sometimes inconsistent art style. Although, for a free game, it's way above standards. Background art is gorgeous, but some of the character sprites and CGs deserved more love.\nAnother thing that might make some heads turn the other way would be the game's focus on russian culture.\nI personally loved it. It's something new, it's interesting and living in a country that once ran under communism, I could recognise some of the references myself, even though I'm not russian. I can see why some people would find that unappealing though and if I could leave them a message, it would be to just put down all your prejudgements and just go into it like it's any other beautiful culture, appreciate it.\n\nMaybe because I've felt myself like I was in the protagonist's shoes (something I'm sure a lot of people did) made me biased to think of this visual novel as something special, perhaps to someone who doesn't really relate to the MC, the story wasn't all that great, but for me personally, I felt like I wrote this game myself in another life and now I'm reading my own thoughts. \nI do not mean this in an arrogant way, it simply fit too well for me and for many other people living in this modern society to the point that it's almost frightening. \n\nBut I digress, this concludes this review, I tried writing it all fancy but even this wouldn't do it justice. I loved it, so much so that I felt the need of writing a review (something I don't usually do seriously).\n\n8.9/10", "timestamp_created": 1664618733, "timestamp_updated": 1664619231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123089231": {"recommendationid": "123089231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000998015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1296, "playtime_forever": 1604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1604, "last_played": 1662077984}, "language": "english", "review": "Free and Anime", "timestamp_created": 1664559697, "timestamp_updated": 1664559697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872172832489014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123044118": {"recommendationid": "123044118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198845227186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 866, "playtime_at_review": 1438, "last_played": 1700038918}, "language": "english", "review": "A very old-school visual/interactive novel, with many possible outcomes, many of them challenging to figure out how to achieve.  It's a great challenge to manage to see every possible scene, and to get positive outcomes rather than FAIL or an endless loop--both outside the story, and INSIDE it.  A bit of a mind-**** that can intrigue and frustrate.  The novel has many features that making trying out different decisions much easier and less tedious, to see how particular decisions affect outcomes.  So--as long as you are willing to go through it more than once, it is a supremely intricate logic puzzle.  Note that there are some surprise outcomes impossible to achieve if you haven't first achieved some or all of the others, including at least one surprise character.\n\nBut I must re-iterate that this is really old-fashioned, but interesting on many levels, if even only for historic or titillative interest....and the MUSIC--Sergey Eybog is a genius, though he's moved on from composing game music to  Sound Design for more major games since this one was made.  But, the music from \"Fiber Twig 2\"  that Eybog composed led me to all these older Russian games with great music, I even have purchased the composer's catalog (Highly recommended--good psybient is hard for me to find) at Bandcamp.  i use the music to increase my productivity in coding and proofreading my website.\n\nLots of fun, if a bit tame compared to the frenetic crazyness of current videogames and adventures.

Some of the references to Russian 4chan and Soviet culture might be a bit obscure, though in their defence, they do add explanations for the Soviet parts. The background art is lovely, the character art mostly too, except some of the intermediate and H-scenes which were drawn by other artists without any art direction, resulting in two or three completely different art styles\n\nThe story is okay, the first run seems to take forever, especially if you don't realize Olga Dimitrievna does not have her own route, which isn't obvious as technically you are the same age as her (in your time) so it'd make sense to romance her. The bad MC ending is actually very interesting, it's only unfortunate they didn't do anything with it. But if you just enjoy the characters and the little world they're in, it's actually a really enjoyable game.\n\nMusic is nice and routes do take some effort to go through.

I wrote this review after finishing the game twice (once blind and once with a guide).\n\n[u]Pros[/u]:\n[list]\n[*] [b]Beautiful visuals[/b] (especially the backgrounds)\n[*] [b]Amazing soundtrack[/b] -- Not only does the music actually sound good, but it also perfectly matches the atmosphere changes throughout the game. When you're in trouble, a heavy metal guitar riff plays. When you're in a romantic moment, a smooth piano tune plays. AAA studios could learn from this sound design.\n[*] [b]The choices you make in the game matter a lot[/b] for the story. And it's a [b] pretty good story [/b] (for a visual novel, I guess). The game is played over 7 days and in my two playthroughs, the last 2-3 days were completely different (and there was already a lot of differences in the first 4-5 days).\n[*] Sometimes [b]the game gets pretty romantic / philosophical / deep[/b].\n[*] I think it allows a people to [b]learn about Russian culture[/b]. There's a lot of references throught the game to Russian culture and if you google them a bit, you will learn even more. Like, this game makes me want to travel Russian countryside and eat Russian food ...\n[*] [b]Extensive achievement / collection system[/b] -- I might take a short break now, but I definitely want to replay this game again in the future to get more endings / scenes.\n[/list]\n\n\n[u]Cons[/u]:\n[list]\n[*] [b]Few choices[/b] -- While the choices in the game matter a lot, there's not many of them. I can't count the times when the protagonist just did / said something dumb / rude and I didn't have any way to influence that. That felt very annoying.\n[*] It seems like [b]no character in the game has a sense of humour[/b]. I don't think I ever laughed once playing this game. Some of the characters joke in-game, but it's not funny for the player nor for the other characters (who seem to get offended very easily at everything).\n[*] [b]Bad translation[/b] -- Some phrases just sound weird after they were translated from Russian to English. On top of that, there is a lot of typos.\n[*] [b]Boring dialogue[/b] -- On the second playthrough I noticed how often the dialogue is so stupid.

caught me by surprise. When i saw that it was made by an indie developer, mostly a single person, I really wanted to try it out. The main reason was the setting. You rarely see a Russian, let alone a Soviet setting for a light novel. Since I come from a country that used to be united under Communism I remember the stories of my parents that experienced being pioneers. This reminds me of that and also the camps I was on during summer. It wasn't too different from how it is shown here. The intro of the game got me depressed a little bit since it hits a little close to home. Then after a few days of pause I decided to complete the game. And oh boy was it fun to experience all the endings this game had to offer. It is nicely written and id you look at the ture ending it is very uplifting and for young people this would mean a lot. You can say that this is made for \"Children or teenagers going trough a tough time of entering the world of adults or simply growing up\". Sure the bad engings can get dark indeed but the whole point of the game is the good endings. If you just commit to one you can hardly get the bad ending if you just think about it. The characters are interesting, you can find favorites quickly and when pursuing the endings you get quite a few twists, especially with the special endings and the true ending. The game has great concepts integrated into its story and you don't have to treat it as a typical dating sim if you want. The music is awesome. I really love the tracks and the main theme and menu music are iconic. Menu reminds me of Silent Hill for some reason. The sound effects are also quite good and the background art is very nice. Although the character desings are nice their artwork is hit or miss depending on the CG. In the end this game is wonderful and does a great job at spreading the good-old Socialist/Communist culture that people have not experienced or have forgotten about. Also the MOD support is awesome, be sure to check that out or even use it to create your own characters and story.", "timestamp_created": 1655002248, "timestamp_updated": 1655002248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116834649": {"recommendationid": "116834649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198382000004", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 625, "last_played": 1654980332}, "language": "english", "review": "i'm compleated only Lena's bad ending and i can say that was so emotional.

And there's no hints on what choice does what, it's just random chance that you'll score positive or negative points for a certain path/girl. There's only 7 days to make stuff happen, only one or two choices per day, and if you're too nuetral, you get nothing but just \"coasting by\" storytelling. You there's more intense decisions later, but they're ignored/locked if you don't have enough \"positive points\" for a certain girl.\n\nYou really CAN'T answer honestly, or \"be yourself\" in this game you have to know what choice does what to control your story. (and every decision-making moment comes about every hour or so, with not enough leeway, or extra decisions to give extra padding or properly zone-in on one girl/path. You can nuetralize your path by gaining a point or two for another girl/path if you make the wrong choice).\n\nIn the end, I got a kiss from Lena, but that's it, not many scenes or deep bonds with other girls. Just a fun hangout or two. \nAlso, the ending was a bit clunky, with absolutely a coin-toss decision to get the \"bad\" ending or \"good\" ending, involving the bus ride & the voices.\n\nAll in all, I don't feel like replaying, unlike the other visual novels I've tried. I felt punished for answering honestly and trying to be well-rounded, but also focused on two particular girls. (No Mika path until you complete the game once? I wish I knew. Don't even introduce her to the story if you can't be with her.)\n\nThanks for the game.

The best of the best for me is Yulya.\nI think for u it will be maybe not best game ever, but good 100%\nSorry for my bad English)))", "timestamp_created": 1649951612, "timestamp_updated": 1650026886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113840846": {"recommendationid": "113840846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844043165", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2147, "last_played": 1650163652}, "language": "english", "review": "Alisa <3", "timestamp_created": 1649944631, "timestamp_updated": 1649944631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113822185": {"recommendationid": "113822185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059981891", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 442, "last_played": 1633394578}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never been hooked into a game so fast", "timestamp_created": 1649908642, "timestamp_updated": 1649908642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113805900": {"recommendationid": "113805900", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982833471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11788, "last_played": 1650066733}, "language": "english", "review": "I just love this game and different mods.

The outfits, the buildings....the vehicles you name it, it all ringed a bell and it was hilarious for us to see it in a visual novel like this. All the popular references were killing us. However I started to slowly acknowledge the immersivity with all the nice painted pictures, cool nature sounds and even the writing was not bad at all, on the contrary to be honest. I really felt like I was being teleported to some strange place with bunch of strange people and I wanted to know all the answers, like how tf I got here, how can I get out, what century it is etc. On the other hand I began to be interested also in the characters you were meeting on your journey.\n\nSo what started as a joke suddenly became a really interesting mystery to me. If you would have told me the day before that instead of playing Destiny 2 pvp or Elden Ring on my day off (my gf was out of town) I will be playing this for almost the whole day I would have laughed to your face like yeah for sure bro. But it did end like this and I enjoyed it more. I was drawn to the story more and more and I finished it after like 6-7 hours straight almost (with some food breaks). It was an amazing experience and honestly I kept thinking about the outcoume for a few days later (I a got a bad Alisa ending, which was not completely bad but it raised a lot of thoughts in my head like if I am doing maximum with my life right now and so on). \n\nSo I am definitely looking forward that I will try other endings and maybe some mods (I saw that most of them are in Russian but still few are in English) and I must say that whoever did this made a great job. And it's free to play as well, what more can you possibly want, definitely give it a try if you are just checking it out for fun or for real, it's worth it!

with 13 possible endings. I enjoyed the reading a lot but the quality of some routes varies. Certainly one of the better of non-japanese VNs though. Even more so, considering the fact it's completely free. \n\nThe writing and the mystery is absorbing from the start. In terms of story quality, it goes like this: \n\nSlavya > Ulyana > Yulya > Alisa > Miku > Lena > Semyon\n\nFirst three listed routes are great as the chemistry between MC and the girl works pretty well and overall message works nicely. Alisa is nice tsundere but her character kinda blends with Ulyana. Miku route was certainly different but not sure about this B-horror movie theme. True end was actually nice, but maybe bit forgettable as I would prefer if all routes meaningfully clicked together, creating bigger picture. Still enjoyable conclusion though.\nBut I didn't really like Lena - not because her route was depressing but because I found it hard to believe MC would want to voluntarilly spend more time with her after certain point.\n\nIn fact, speaking of MC, he surely likes to argue a lot during the course of the story and it gets kinda annoying after a while. He is the definition of drama queen yet at the same the game doesn't really show the reason for it. His childhood is only scratched and just mentioned several times. And it doesn't help the main character stays the same for the most of the game.\n\nI also didn't like the fact that some characters were inconsequential (Zhenya and Nurse mainly - although the first one gets her own route in DLC). Some story elements would also benefit from using Chekhov's gun as they served no real purpose. Namely [spoiler]the mobile phone, the owl, the ghost, the bunker, Slavya dance in the forest or Yulya's provisions[/spoiler].\n\nOn the positive side, if you want more, there are lot of other stories to be read on workshop and you can get handful of translated mods here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725863054 \n\nWhat I can't complain about at all is the atmosphere which the game constantly maintains so well. This is also thanks to the best background pictures I have seen in any visual novel up to date - the detail is simply unbelievable.

But once you play through all the routes, you'll fully understand the entire story and what's going on in the camp. The characters are amazing, and are basically the best part of the game. Each one is different from the other of course, but when reading, you get this ominous vibe the more they break their character. It's really cool how the developers expect you to think that this is how they will act but they are hiding something behind that smile or face. The music is very mellow and quite relaxing, and definitely fits in with the mysterious vibe the game brings out. The choices you make will very much affect the story including the route you are going for. You will possibly get the bad ending of that route, which is really cool that the developers made both good and bad endings for each of the routes to make players feel their outcomes. This visual novel is very unique and it's amazing how much detail they were able to put into such a complex story with great characters, a lovely artstyle, calming music, and a good amount of replay-ability.

I can tell this game's target audience was supposed to be directed at people leaving in post soviet states with it's heavy emphasis on nostalgia for those times. I personally was not effected by all of that since I'm an american zoomer that grow up a decade after the fall of the Soviet Union.

the 410 bus and heads off to his school reunion. He falls asleep and when he wakes up, it is the hot summer and the bus lets him out in front of the Sovyonok pioneer camp. Confused and intrigued, Semyon integrates into this new world, wondering if and how he'll ever get back to his home.\n\nThe game consists of a prologue, epilogue, and seven days at the camp where Semyon can steer his way into one of several different endings by making different choices that affect his affinity towards one of the girls in the camp; typically locking into a path by day six. This game is intended to be played through multiple times as some paths don't open until completing the \"good\" ending for one or more characters. At its heart, this is a mystery novel, though at times somewhat disguised as a romance.\n\nFrom a narrative point of view, this is a pretty well-written story; the translation is mostly very good; though you'll certainly encounter spelling errors, typos, and the occasional sentence that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But all-in-all, it's well done. There is a variety of very nice musical tracks that set the mood and graphically, the backgrounds and sprites are all done well. But by far my biggest complaint is in the CG, which for the most part, really isn't very good. The quality of the art is vastly inferior to all the backgrounds, with highly exaggerated facial expressions, coloring that is almost always wrong, and just generally sloppiness; it really is disappointing, especially in comparison to how well done everything else is.\n\nConsidering this game is entirely free, there isn't much of a reason not to try it out; though you won't get the whole picture with just one playthrough; I certainly recommend going through all the endings to get a clearer understanding of the world.\n\n*There is an adult patch that you can install by subscribing to it in the Workshop located in the Community Hub. It adds about 20 images but unfortunately contains mosaic censoring; something that is immediately disheartening the moment you encounter it in-game. This fact alone would be enough to change my review to \"Not Recommended\" if Everlasting Summer cost any money as I'll *never* encourage anybody to reward censorship financially. However, since the game is entirely free, I'll give it a pass here, albeit a somewhat painful one, as it certainly reduces my opinion of the overall product.\n", "timestamp_created": 1638663886, "timestamp_updated": 1638672848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105220753": {"recommendationid": "105220753", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060386423", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 652, "last_played": 1616883242}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1] Una de las mejores obras visuales [/h1]\n\nEverlasting Summer es una novela visual como cualquier otra la cual narra los sucesos de un adolescente en un campamento de verano al cual ha llegado a trav\u00e9s de diferentes formas.

The story is like the artwork - it has a great foundation but felt unfinished. \n\nIn the case of the artwork, the backgrounds and some of the scenes (especially horrific ones) are quite good but the cartoonish simplicity of the character sprites was a bit unappealing. I wish they looked as well crafted as the backgrounds. The choice to show graphic sexuality while censoring it was also odd - cropping the shots instead of blurring them, etc. would have been a much better choice.\n\nAs for the story, you only get interesting tidbits very sparingly and it takes a really long time to get any answers. In fact, most of the questions are left unanswered, but it wasn't until the final endings that I didn't care. The unappealing characteristics &/or uninteresting nature of the characters made much of the game a bit boring and relationships a bit shallow, but you find there's actually a reason for that by the end.\n\nIn the end, I found the overall story sufficiently interesting to overlook the negatives.

Maybe getting transported to an alternate time and getting to relive your teen years at summer camp beats my usual six day grind and was just comfy. I enjoyed the various characters and liked where the mystery was going as to why I was there and what caused it. I have to say that by the end it just kind of fizzled out for me. I didn\u2019t really feel the story was well explained by the end and I also have to say that given my choices I don\u2019t feel like the ending I got reflected the paths I took. The buildup was good as was the side plots that came about. The art was well done and had a good style to it. Individual scenes did have some issues such as a few scenes where my room mate was supposed to be sleeping across from me but in the scene itself their bed was empty. I also felt the transitions from scene to scene early in the game were strange and took a little long to happen but that seemed to get better as the game went along. The sound effects were well done. There was a card game that is similar to poker with a few tweaks that was also enjoyable once I got a handle on strategy. I didn\u2019t much enjoy a section of the game where you had to choose the correct turns in a tunnel in order to escape because with the lack of a map or any hints it was simply trial and error to do it. \n\n\tI played Everlasting Summer on Linux. It never crashed on me and I didn\u2019t notice any spelling errors. Alt-tab didn\u2019t work. You could manually save whenever you wanted and there were 108 save slots. \n\nGame Engine: Ren\u2019Py\nSave System: Manual\nDisk Space Used: 995 MB\n\nGPU Usage: 0-9 %\nVRAM Usage: 809-993 MB\nCPU Usage: 1-5 %\nRAM Usage: 2.5-3.1 GB\n\n\tOverall there was a solid game here even though I wasn\u2019t overly enthusiastic about the ending.

I would have liked a bit more character development as they seemed a bit flat at times though. The art is gorgeous and includes CGs. In fact, all of the features I would expect a good visual novel to possess are there. You can skip, save and load with ease, and the UI is well designed.

I didn't really like to read at that time, so I've played only for pictures. I wouldn't call it an experience but after playing it (I had Lena's bad ending, which would be kind of rough for a kid, but since i wasn't reading...) my impressions were positive, because of pleasant visualisation\n\nJust a couple of months from now, when the time for me to leave high school and \"enter adulthood\" has come, I somewhy decided to play it again seriously. I was glad Everlasing Summer happened to be on Steam, free (thanks, SovietGames). I quickly started a download and right away began to *I would like to say \"play\" but since it's more of a book, novel I think the word \"read\" fits better*.\n\nGOD WAS IT SO GOOD AND NOSTALGIC, to see familiar faces, and get to know each character's story.\nThe overall storyline is not really complicated but at the same time it is very interesting to see how the things will end up. Most of the characters make only good impressions, especially Slavya... I was afraid for classic horror elements, like screamers and stuff, but MOST of the routes are just fine with it. I also enjoyed a lot of Soviet art references, like Electronik's character is written from Soviet TV-series \"the adventures of electronic\", or Shurik, who in Russian film universe is very popular because he appears in Leonid Gaidai's cycle of movies about  Shurik.\n\nThe OST is definitelly playing an important role in setting the atmosphere and overall vibe of \"careless childhood\". Huge props to Sergey Eybog and Between August and December for creating such a good soundtrack and especially for putting it on streaming services. My favorite Tracks could be Lightness, Waltz of Doubts, Lena's Theme and many more\n\nOne of the main cons of this novel would be characters's visualisation, I mean, I can believe  Slavya, Olya Dmitrievna, Alisa, Electronik, Shurik or maybe even Ulyana, that things which are happening take place in Soviet Pioneer Camp. I'm talking about appearence, I suppose it has to be 1970s, while Brezhnev really was a \"stand out\" leader, if you know what I'm saying, I don't remember colorful hair, like Lena's, Miku's (I know she is somekind asian, but still) and the final bus art where pioneers are heading home, you can see I guess \"red devil eyes\" in some of the fellows. You couldn't really stand out like that from a crowd in Soviet Union, but at this point I find it the only visual con of this game/novel.\n\nTo be honest, this game took me out of depression at the time I was playing it, but after finishing... It put me in even deeper depression (ironic) in which I still remain, reminding me how pathetic and miserable I am.\nThat's the power of this particular visual novel, it digs in the bins of your soul better than any psychologist, and then leaves you alone without instructions \"how to continue to live\"...\nBut as I can see, this walkthrough experience will remain in me for a long time.

love visual novels, this game is a MUST to play. As usual, there are good and bad endings to this game. However, what makes this game unforgettable is the experiences you go through in each play through/ending. Every ending has its unique touch to both the player (you) and our MC. Personally, I'm a huge soundtrack fan. If you're also into that, then this game wont disappoint. Many songs listed in the game are tailored to specific characters. What I mean by that is up to you to figure out. All in all, the hours I spent on this game had a huge impact on me. Whenever I see the game in my library, fan art of a character, or listening to the Everlasting Summer soundtrack in music apps, I would close my eyes and remember it all. All the bad endings that hurt me hard to the point where I regretted going down that path for days; as well as the warmth filling my heart and the smile I would have on my face whenever I got a good ending. The playful, joyful, and heartwarming moments mixed in with fighting, madness, and sadness. When I finally reached the end of the game, I softly told myself that it was over.

I know.. I know.. I'm late for a few years here, but amazingly the community is still somehow active and I can also see the content on Steam Workshop get updated. Also the devs are developing another game which is going out this year (2021) which is cool.\n\nSo about the game, you can see above but tl;dr, its about a boy called Semyon who is sent to the past, to a Pioneer Camp  specifically and there he meet bunch of girls then I'm sure you know what happened afterward. This game got multiple endings and I found this game storyline pretty confusing, and this game got special endings and pls play this ending after you finished all other endings or you might be much more confused than before.\n\nHow about the mature content and all that? It's there on the tags! Well regarding that, I think it's being censored on the Steam Version and I think the ways you can get them back is by downloading something from the Soviet Games' website or by searching them on the Steam Workshop, IDK I'm only here for the plot not the mature content ;).\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yeah if you like this kind of visual novel, dating sim, it's honestly pretty good and I'm sure memorable because I can't get it out of my head even when I'm going to sleep. Anyway, just get it, it's free anyway.

So basically you have choices but not in every important decision. And did I say this protagonist is really dumb?\nI think the other stories would be better than mine, I got the Lena bad ending, in wich the plot wasn\u00b4t explained and the ending was just stupid and not making sense, maybe the other routes are better, I can\u00b4t say, all I can\u00b4t say is that doki doki and other games handled this dark kind of themes better.\nAlso who decided on the rape joke on the little kid girl? wtf?\nI recommend the game because it\u00b4s free, it\u00b4s not a bad game but it was disappointing, it started good and full of potential and then the story was just poorly delivered and without much logic on things that happened. If one would compare this game to Katawa Shoujo for example, I would say that the story in KS was better but the bigger difference is that KS takes the time needed to develop the characters and make you love them, this one is rushed.\nAlso, if there was a route for the leader of the camp that\u00b4s what I would choose, sadly there isn\u00b4t.\nThe game has controller support and achievements, that\u00b4s cool.\nIt\u00b4s free so if your REALLY into visual novels grab it and try it out, for you it might be a better experience in another route.\n\n(Edit: I searched now and tried to find out how I failed, and this is the only game where I can say that I failed in the most stupid choices possible, things that didn\u00b4t even have to do with Lena or just didn\u00b4t make sense for such a hardcore ending, so basically logic doesn\u00b4t apply in this game lol, just so you know what I mean... SPOILER ALERT... I have to lose to her in a card game for her not to commit suicide? I have to praise the book she\u00b4s reading for her to not commit suicide? and then there are some choices that doesn\u00b4t even impact her... But if I fail 3 choices in 19 I get the bad ending? despite being choice that have no impact on her or choices that shouldn\u00b4t have had it? Just so you know, where it mattered I have made the right choices, I am just angry with this game because it defies all logic, I choose the right important choices but just because I won the card game for example in the end she kills herself?Because I failed 3 choices that shouldn\u00b4t matter so much as to give her excuse to do this, even worse my character killed himself too, wtf. If you are a logical and rational person you will get what I am saying if you get the same ending. The story tells me she killed herself because she was jealous of another girl that I didn\u00b4t even date in the game, the reality is that she killed herself because I won a card game against her, didn\u00b4t praise the damn book and in the first option of the game decided to stay by the bus when Lena was still not even introduced to the protagonist, wich makes 3 wrong choices lol, choices that shouldn\u00b4t have that much powerful impact, sadly in this game small choices have the same impact as big choices, maybe if I praised the book and lost the card game but rejected her I would\u00b4ve gotten the good ending because it would be one less bad choice, do you get me now?

This is not my mother tongue, so please not be too harsh.\n\nThis VN is really flawed in my opinion. I'm played throw an handful of VN\u00b4s so far, so I can only compare this to them in certain fields.\nThe biggest problem is the crushing length of this game. The monologues of the protagonist are way to long in a lot of moments. Worse, these are full of angst, stupid thoughts and overthinking. I get that this should represent a younger adult, that was thrown in a confusing situation. Maybe driven by events, but still. Some monologues and reactions from his side made me literally scream at my screen. And not in a good way,  I was really annoyed. I skipped through a lot of monologues, I really think the creators should proofread and rework some of these monologues, or even dialogs. This game should lose 1/4 of the text, streamlined and more to the point. That would improve it in my opinion greatly.\nThe VN itself might be aware of this, because at one point the protagonist says to Slavya hey... you said in two sentences what I was unable to do in one long rambling. Yes indeed. And because of that, reading through these texts was tedious, and it made it more confusing to get the points. As is said, at the end I started to skip through a lot of these.\n\nThe other problem this VN shares with a lot of other VN\u00b4s. It does not matter what you do most of the time, one small decision give you the bad ending. Or the good ending. And this decision is not grand, most of the time it is something really inconspicuous. And this is annoying. This is a lot of trial and error, with no way to do this naturally.\n\nThe game offers you a few choices, but not enough in my option. The are chains of events, that were clearly written that way, and needed to happen that way. This leave the player unsatisfied, because a lot of time things move on direction, that you not wanted. And so far you did everything not to end there. Also, you feel driven by events, but not in a good way. Because most of the time, they are driven by the creators decisions, not by yours. And I understand that this is only achievable with a lot of work, and a lot of paths. I still think this is a weak point.\n\nMost of the characters are not really valid humans, these are constructs to serve a purpose. I\u2019m sill not sure if everyone represented some part of the human psyche, avatars if you will. Or if this really are just constructs to carry the story. So I did not have the genuine feeling of working with personalities, that I had with a lot of characters  in other functional/interactive media. This is just a remark, not really a negative point. Just for people, who might expect something different.\n\nThe artwork itself is simple, but do the job. For me it was enjoyable. Also the context with the soviet pioneer camp was interesting, the creators also popup additional information to certain things, that are not widly known outside of russia. I appreciate that.\n\nFor the record, I played through the Lena and Slavya paths, that was enough for me. So, in the end, why do I leave a positive review?\n\nI see that a lot of effort was put into this. Someone took a lot of time and hearth to script and write these texts. And I think that someone also used some kind of personal experience doing so. I said the monologues are too long, raw and confusing. Some dialogs are pure cringe. But I take that over something, that was only created with a certain goal in mind. This VN leaves you kind of confused, but with certain life experience, it will also trigger some thoughts. After I played this VN, I had a deep and, in parts,  confusing dream about a love, that ended long ago. So after I woke up, it took me some time to process all of that. With some tears, and some laughter. These memories of mine are pleasing. And also painful. Because they remind me of a time back then, where I was really happy. They also remind me what an empty, emotional husk I am at some times. That I miss something in life, that I learned to live without it. At least on the surface.\n\nBut also, that I am grateful for the good things, that happen to me in my life. And to some extent the bad things too, because they form you as a character, and make the good things even more valuable. And that you always take nothing for granted. This is also a motto in this VN. And I can only support that.\n\nSo this VN triggered something in me, and every work of fiction that is capable to do this is fine in my book. If you want, you really can think about certain dialogs, and have your own thought  about that. Your own emotions, if you were and are in similar situations in your life. This works for me more than the Asian VN\u00b4s with similar  message. You know, make the best out of your life. Be humble, work on yourself, be diligently, follow your goals etc. This one is more emotional, more questioning. Maybe it is more the \"Russian\" way of feeling and thinking, I don't know.\n\nSo in the end, if you deal better than me with the flaws, go play the VN normally. Otherwise, I recommend getting a guide, and play through the parts that interests  you. And don't feel bad if you want to skip some texts, I think it will help you in the end to be not too confused, There are some messages in the game, that don't need this amount of fluff text.\nAlso, I think this VN works best if you don't just want to see naked girls, or want just a basic dating game. These parts are here in some degree, but in the middle of something bigger. So you might be better off with a different VN, if you want a more simple experience.

Creo que es lo m\u00e1s flojo del juego. Repito, el inicio es lento y se excede en montones de descripciones superfluas y comentarios del personaje principal, pensamientos, comparaciones y dem\u00e1s, que un poco aburren. Pero una vez llegado al primer punto de inflexi\u00f3n de la trama, y a medida que empezamos a conocer los dem\u00e1s personajes, la cosa se va volviendo m\u00e1s interesante. Hasta ahora lo he empezado y terminado una sola vez, y es incre\u00edble que el juego tenga tantos finales sin que tengamos que tomar tantas decisiones. Pero es que el juego es muy \"inteligente\" en ese sentido, y se va adaptando todo el tiempo a las peque\u00f1as decisiones que hacemos. Realmente uno termina haciendo lazos muy fuertes con algunos personajes, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n otros, aquellos que dejamos de lado en alguna oportunidad, se van alejando de la trama sin que apenas nos demos cuenta.\n\nEl tono del juego empieza siendo ligero, pero termina siendo crudo. O por lo menos, en el final malo que me toc\u00f3 a m\u00ed, sin hacer spoiler, debo decir que termin\u00f3 mal realmente. El juego va creciendo en todo momento, as\u00ed como mencion\u00e9 anteriormente, arranca con un ritmo lento y a lo mejor para algunas personas como es mi caso, poco atrapante, pero de a poco se va poniendo cada vez mejor.\n\nEl nivel de los fondos y las ilustraciones es muy bueno, sin tener un mill\u00f3n de im\u00e1genes, pero s\u00ed una variedad considerable para los puntos m\u00e1s importantes de la trama. La m\u00fasica es excelente, hay composiciones que son sencillamente espectaculares.\n\nY por \u00faltimo, sobre el tema de la calificaci\u00f3n del juego, debo decir que me esperaba un juego mucho m\u00e1s ligero en donde el protagonista es el t\u00edpico loser que trata de ligar con todas las chicas, pero \u00e9sto no es as\u00ed. Como en la vida real, el protagonista debe tomar decisiones, no puede ligar con todas, y aunque elija a una chica, el juego tampoco va de zexo (evitando la censura) simpl\u00f3n y gratuito; de hecho dir\u00eda que se basa mas bien en las relaciones profundas y rom\u00e1nticas y en las m\u00e1s de seis horas de juego que he tenido, s\u00f3lo se vieron unas dos o tres im\u00e1genes de desnudos (muy sutiles), y algo m\u00e1s al final (aunque comparado con otros juegos m\u00e1s expl\u00edcitos, esto es CASI para todo p\u00fablico).\n\nEn fin, si te gustan las novelas visuales, ya te est\u00e1s tardando en jugarlo.

At first I found the art style a lil jarring but that passed quickly. This is a really enjoyable, exciting and complex game with lots of twists and leaving enough questions open for you to ask yourself at the end what it all means. I still think about this from time to time long after playing it. Only bad thing I can say about it is that the card game made no sense to me whatsoever and as is common with visual novels, you probably would never figure out which answers to give in order to reach a certain path. I give it a 4.5, standout title.\n\nDon't forget to install the uncensored patch though if you want to play the real deal.\n\nPS: The 0,5 subtraction are for not being able to fuck whatshername, the younger one.

If you haven't played it, you are definitely missing out on a great story. It also has some replay value. You won't get bored playing it twice if you haven't played it in a while. \n\nThere's not much else I can say without giving spoilers so give it a try. If you've ever felt lonely, the good ending of the game will help you feel like there is hope in meeting new people. However I do need to note that some of the scenes might be disturbing to some people so if you have problems with that sort of thing, I would say not to play it. It's not so bad in comparison to many other games, so if you've ever watched an 80's horror movie you'll probably be fine. There's steamy stuff too so don't play it at work, unless your boss is cool with it? It's up to you. 10 out of 10 game.\n\nMore reasons to try it:\n\nIt plays flawlessly on both GNU/Linux and on Windows(I haven't tried a mac yet).\n\nWorked with every computer I could test it on without issues.\nOperating systems I've tried it on with no problems, bugs or lag.:\nWindows 8.1, 8, and 7\nFedora, Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Mint.\n\nWorks with both Intel and AMD Desktop CPUs ( 1.7 GHz - 3 GHz CPUs were used when tested.)\n\nAlso got it to work on two laptops from 2007-2009 with no problems.\nSpecs for the 2007 laptop used for testing: (Intel 1.7GHz CPU, 2GB RAM)\n\nSpecs for the 2009 laptop used for testing: (AMD 1.9GHz CPU, 3gb RAM)\n\nI'm pretty sure a potato would work too. Probably will run on a tablet but I haven't tried that.\n\nIt's a Free game. Did I mention it's free?\n\nIt should go without saying, but there's always that one guy so... This review is my personal opinion. If you disagree or if you didn't like the game, then just uninstall the game. Not everyone will like this game but I sure did. I really recommend it to anyone who has ever been on a message board, posted on a forum, watched anime, read a visual novel, used the internet, read a cat poster, or used Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1609749510, "timestamp_updated": 1609756000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83963308": {"recommendationid": "83963308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137325875", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1181, "last_played": 1653103743}, "language": "english", "review": "Give it a try its free", "timestamp_created": 1609736082, "timestamp_updated": 1609736082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83842176": {"recommendationid": "83842176", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089788403", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1603756206}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego, me gusta mucho.

tienes la oportunidad de probarlo si aun no lo has hecho. Algo a mencionar es que fue creado por una desarrolladora rusa lo cual influye en que dentro de la trama de la VN tomas lugar ambientado en la rusia moderna, aun que para meter un mejor contexto inicias la historia asi hasta que eres transportado repentinamente a un campamento de verano que tiene lugar durante la existencia de la union sovietica en algun punto de la decada de los a\u00f1os 1980, en una version joven del protagonista a los 17 a\u00f1os. (Para ser honesto no se si esto califica como un isekai ya que el concepto y la manera en que lo llevan es similar, no obstante sigues en tu mundo asi que simplemente eres transportado en el tiempo a una epoca diferente). Ademas de que la VN cuenta con multiples finales (De los cuales me faltan por descubrir)\ndependiendo de tus elecciones tu decides que hacer aqui, si solamente deseas buscar respuestas y una explicacion al como llegaste a este lugar o si en lugar de eso durante tu estadia quieres relacionarte de manera amorosa con alguna de las chicas con las cuales tienes contacto. Realmente el hecho de estar en una epoca de anta\u00f1o me da una sensacion de nostalgia, en el sentido de que te sientes parte de lo que el protagonista siente y vive lo cual es un punto a favor de la inmersion que te ofrece, dependiendo del rumbo que quieras avanzar en la historia vives varias aventuras y momentos de suspenso, tension, desamor y reconciliacion, etc. Asi que depende de ti como acabe este viaje, con momentos buenos y malos. (Personalmente yo consegui el final bueno de Alisa y debo decir que fue bastante emotiva la manera en que acaba).\nComo ya eh dicho la historia tiene sus momentos asi que no te vas a quedar insatisfecho con ella, tienes 13 finales distintos y horas de rejugabilidad. Otros detalles a mencionar es que tiene un soudtrack bueno y algunas transiciones y escenarios estan detallados que llegan a ser bastante bonitos.\nEn cuanto al contenido +18 que originalmente estaba en el juego tiene sentido y razones de estar si se lo instalas y de alguna cierta manera contribuye mejor a la historia. Pero tampoco te saca de la inmersion con fan service sin sentido. si quieres una historia tal cual como originalmente estaba dise\u00f1anada, adelante crack eres libre.\nUna VN que siendo gratis recomiendo para jugar y darle un intento. no se arrepentiran.", "timestamp_created": 1604137499, "timestamp_updated": 1604137499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540069699287414551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78435682": {"recommendationid": "78435682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260288169", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1659127318}, "language": "english", "review": "I've spent more than enough time on this game.

You don't have to assume that it is a sign, or a prophecy, or a prediction, or a warning.  Sometimes, a dream is just a dream, nothing more than a hint of an idea, sketched by your meandering thoughts, and painted by your own imagination.\n\nDo you mourn a hallucination when it passes?  Do you grieve for your dreams when they inevitably end?  Do you long for the colors and shapes and sensations that you experienced, once the experience is over, even if you are entirely sure they weren't real?  Transient images and shadows slip away, that you cannot grasp, even if you could reach them.\n\nCan you truly believe in something that never existed?  Belief alone does not make something real.  No matter how vividly recollected, or idyllic, or plausible that it may seem, a belief is nothing more than a wish with a sprinkling of determination that it must be real.  A billion believers in something does not make it any more real than a single soul.\n\nBut now, that belief is an itch.  You want what you 'had', you need it, the absence of it consumes your thoughts and your spirit.  You see a sound in the corners of your eye, you hear a color just on the edge of your sensory range, the spectre haunts your every waking hour, rather than the sleeping hours.\n\nSo, you try to recreate the conditions in which it occurred.  You climb aboard that same bus, sit in that same seat, close your eyes, and believe.  What's wrong with that?  Futile as it may be, there is no harm in belief itself.  But that isn't enough, thankfully.  If everything were to come to you so easily, you probably won't value it much.  So the unattainable, or that which was had and lost, is that much more precious, isn't it?\n\nBut why mourn?  Why cry?  What will it change?  It wasn't real, and it never was.  The world itself is real, but not because we believe that it is.  Reality is what we can hear, feel, touch, see... isn't it?\n\nBelief does not work magic.  It can't conjure a presence, or a circumstance, or a place or time.  But sometimes, those presences, and circumstances, and places and times, they can find us instead.  Serendipity, happenstance, fate, destiny, these are all concepts that our inner selves use to explain an effect that we didn't cause.\n\nThere's no logical reason why the stuff of our dreams can manifest in natural reality, but sometimes it does.  It may be subtle, or faint, or fleeting, to the point that we may miss it entirely.  But if we see it, and grasp it, we can experience that which we previously only imagined.  The not-real can become real, and though belief has nothing to do with it, you may have difficulty admitting it, in that moment.  And that is what keeps the belief going, that potential, the possibility, of having your hopes fulfilled, and your beliefs realized.\n\n...\n\nThe game's protagonist, Semyon, is a loser.  He has no job, no prospects, no action or dynamism in his life.  The game tells this story, of an internet troll, a loser from Russia, with nothing to live for, who is given the opportunity to find that reason.\n\nCan you separate a story from the context in which it is produced?  Can a world unrelatable to many, be made to stand on its own?  Can it be made believable?  Everything can be interpreted from multiple angles, especially when you have a particular motivation.  If you hate internet trolls, you will have a bias that will need to be overcome in order to relate to the character.  If the context is too relatable to your own life, you may find yourself in the same boat, grabbing at a dream or fantasy, angrily and desperately clawing for your own serendipity or good fortune to have it made manifest.   \n\nDepending on the ending you get in the game, he may never reach his own potential, or he may wind up happier than he ever thought possible.  Contentment and happiness don't correlate with success and prosperity.  Sure, its easier to cry in a Cadillac than a Lada, but crying is crying.\n\nHaving a dream fulfilled, even in some small way, can mend wounds and soothe the soul.  It doesn't matter what a loser you were before, or how your life trajectory was headed, or anything else.  When you reach what you've desired, fantastical that it may be, in that moment, you are happy.  You, and that which you sought, have each other.  Semyon has the opportunity to have his dreams be made real.  In that moment, he is happy.  He, and that which he sought, have each other.\n\nNot everyone will reach their potential.  Most don't, in fact.  Fewer still are happy.  But you don't have to be the absolute best version of yourself to be happy.  Maybe, instead, the happiest version is the best one.", "timestamp_created": 1603339927, "timestamp_updated": 1603339927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710904300212860107", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77925068": {"recommendationid": "77925068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198874316852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1603298140}, "language": "english", "review": "\n", "timestamp_created": 1603295063, "timestamp_updated": 1603295229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77822869": {"recommendationid": "77822869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251943254", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 886, "last_played": 1652965435}, "language": "english", "review": "Good.", "timestamp_created": 1603130112, "timestamp_updated": 1603130112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77723045": {"recommendationid": "77723045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411143195", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3309, "last_played": 1663796491}, "language": "english", "review": "Sad", "timestamp_created": 1602965684, "timestamp_updated": 1609426819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074658870697021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77686511": {"recommendationid": "77686511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986438355", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1261, "last_played": 1658813076}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun and COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1602913930, "timestamp_updated": 1602913930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77682601": {"recommendationid": "77682601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184001974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1603058146}, "language": "english", "review": "Woah.\n\nJust finished my first playthrough, which takes about five hours, depending on your reading speed.

I felt railroaded quite a lot during the course of the game.\nFor positives, the story is interesting, the setting is very unique, the characters designs are all pretty nice (I like that one of them is just Hatsune Miku lmao) and the art is appealing and well done. The music is pretty good, and its got some nice horror-lite elements towards the end. \nI will probably play it again, but I entered this game with high hopes, based on its user score, and left slightly deflated and disappointed.

We play as a modern Russian young man who lives a lonely life in a large Russian city. Someday he accidentally finds himself in a pioneer summer camp somewhere in the Soviet Union.

Even tho I played this game in Russian I will write my review in English. ^_^\n\nDo you enjoy lovely stories about regular people with a romantic outcome? How about multiple endings, some of which can be sad and some quite happy? Do you like listening to lovely music while reading? How about reliving the best aspects of summer camp? Then come right here!\n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged with Soviet themes, it is a perfect opportunity to experience the life in a Pioner summer camp right before the fall of USSR straight from the comfort of your room. The game greets you with every day routine life of a ~25 y\\o who has lost the will to search for *the* point of life and just spends his days browsing the internet. Sounds familiar? (hope not) He no longer has any hobbies, lost most of his friends, life is dull and grey somewhere in the outskirts of Megapolis (no point to specify which \u2013 they all are mostly same). But the creators, or God, or local drug dealer or *somebody* finally helps him out and sends 410 bus his way which takes him far and back in time\u2026 And that is where he, and maybe you, is reborn.\nThe game did something great for me \u2013 it cheered me up so well, I feel great all week since I played it. It should be given to people with depression or just people who feel let down by life. The fact that this game is FREE does not sit right with me. The music itself can\u2019t be free! Devs are too good for us. However, as google helped me, they do have an internet store with goodies! And this year they are planning to release a new game, which won\u2019t be f2p so might as well show some support there folks.\n\nPS.: People who game this game a negative review \u2013 what the f is wrong with you? It\u2019s an amazing FREE game that gives you a FREE adventure, some light reading, art to look at and heaven for your ears. Do reconsider (if you read this) to change your review.

Specifically, if it's the main story, or the mods. \nThe main story is very unique. In the first place, it is unique for something like this to be developed in Russia. It does not borrow too much from the things that I see frequently in anime/games/movies/series, it has it's own charm. The characters are not \"OH MAH GHAD TOP TIER SHIT\" but they are definitely complex. There was effort put in, whoever wrote them. This is a dating sim, yet none of these characters are two dimensional waifu material for the sake of being appealing, they are a retrospective of real people in real life. The same touches were made for the protagonist of the story, though he is far less unique and is on the whole \"socially awkward and unappealing, low self esteem young man normally a cuck but now a chad\" deal. That's my first gripe, though complaining about this is elitiesm - most modern anime have that thing, and it's not necessarily always bad; in this guy's case at least, he has some appeal to him - he is a good soccer player, and pretty athletic, that's something.\nMy second gripe, and the one that puts this product from being a masterpiece, came upon me when I completed the game. There are 13 endings, 2 for each of the four main girls (8), one good and one bad, then 1 secret one that is available after completing the game once, 2 for not dating anyone (one good one bad), the true one that is available upon completing every good ending (and a secret one), and a harem one, with the same condition. The problem is, this is simple. The mechanic behind the game is simple. Be nice to a certain girl a certain number of times, you date her. Be nice to her a bit more, you get a good end. There is a score counter (widget) hidden in the game (actually you can enable it through mods IIRC) and that alone gives you a complete grasp of the entire game - which route you fall onto and so on and on and on. All 13 endings are easily accessed. Once you did that, the game has essentially outlived itself. There is nothing for you to explore anymore. 6/10\n...EXCEPT the thing that makes me recommend this game. The mods, or fanfics, or whatever you may call them. This is where the top notch content is at... is something I would like to say but of course, among a thousand fanfics, there will only be a few good ones. The good ones are the ones the most people are subbed to. And of course, most of them, if not all, are untranslated, though I do plan to work on it in the future. Here are my three favorites.\n7 Days of Summer, basically everybody knows it as a retelling of the main story. The content that was added involves new characters, the old ones getting more important (one of them actually being instrumental to the greater scheme of things), a different lore explanation - like, DRASTICALLY different, the main characters being more complex and there being more than 50 endings instead of 13. And btw, Olga is now datable. And there is a Karma score alongside the normal dating points. The good parts are more endings and better characters (that includes the protag). The bad point is the unbelievably slow pacing. Some of the dialogue is also very awkward. 8/10\nSamantha, a completely different story. Samantha Smith, AKA the girl who died in 1985 in a plane crash aged 13, who was also trying to establish a good relationship between USSR and USA by going to a Soviet summer camp in the real world, comes into Sovyonok and our good ol' MC, now an absolute madlad chad whom history will remember for ages, is appointed her translator - because \"age of the internet in Russia is gud wiz Inggleesch\". And he ALSO tries to prevent the airplane crash by convincing her about him being from another world, from XXI century where she actually died etc etc. The best part is, it is translated into English - somewhat, but translated. The comedy in this one is top notch funny; the sad moments are SAD, they hit really hard. Dialogue, although it is awkward in translation, is great. 10/10\nLast Summer - the what if scenario sci fi lore expansion sequel to the main game, diving into the MC's mind deeper than the mainline game did. Pretty heavy and philosophical. Currently incomplete, but three chapters are done - in Russian, but still done.

You play as an awkward, socially-outcast guy, you have a couple of potential dates, you usually choose just one and you watch the wonderful still images as you read through tons of text. \n\n[h1] The only dating sims that DO stand out are the weird ones [/h1]\n\nUnless you are really into dating sims, you probably won\u2019t be able to name many of them. Other than Hatoful Boyfriend \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/310080/Hatoful_Boyfriend/\n or Doki Doki Literature Club\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/\n, I couldn\u2019t really tell you a popular dating sim because they really don\u2019t stand out. I guess, if someone wants to make a popular dating sim that will stand out outside of its community, they better make something really weird. I\u2019m kind of sad to say that, while Everlasting Summer is unique, it doesn\u2019t do much to really stand out among the rest of dating simulators.\n\n[h1] A non-Japanese dating simulator? [/h1]\n\nOn the surface, Everlasting Summer, doesn\u2019t do anything much different from other dating simulators. You have the main character who is socially awkward, you have a couple of eligible love interests that all have different personalities and looks, you mostly read loads of text and every now and then make a decision and the graphics are presented with still images. \n\nWhile most dating simulators are anime-based and thus made in Japan, this one was made in Russia, thus it takes place in Russia. Most characters look like typical anime characters, even act like them, but the game really wants to hammer in the point that it takes place in Russia. \nI just want to point out that this is really refreshing. While it\u2019s clear that the game takes inspiration from numerous Japanese dating sims, the culture, the location, the events and the overall theme are very much Russian. \n\n[h1] Be prepared! Always prepared [/h1]\n\nThe story starts with out 20-something main character derping on his computer in his room. The main character is complete social outcast. He almost never leaves his home, he mostly spends time at his computer, he has no ambitions, you get it. One day, he gets on a bus and falls asleep during the trip. When he awakes, he is on a completely different bus and is in a USSR young pioneer camp. What\u2019s worse is that, he has no idea how he got here, what year is it and why did he suddenly become a teenager again. Seeing how the camp is located in the middle of nowhere and how he has no idea how to return home, he stays at the camp as a young pioneer. \n\nIn case you are curious, young pioneers were something similar do American boy/girl scouts. Basically between 1920s-1990s, kids aged from 8-18 (I guess) would become pioneers and would spend summers at pioneer camps. There, they would learn various skills, discipline and socialize with other pioneers. It was a way to raise healthy patriots and potential soldiers. Honestly, I think the movement was a wonderful idea and I am sad that the Young Pioneers don\u2019t exist anymore. I would have loved to go to a camp like this back in my days, but that\u2019s beside the point. \n\n[h1] If you had a chance to re-experience being a teenager again with your current mindset, what would you do differently? [/h1]\n\nLike I mentioned above, Everlasting Summer, other than being Russian themed, doesn\u2019t really stray at all from the regular dating simulator formula. You will lead your peaceful life in the pioneer camp and as you go through your daily routine, you will get choices that will impact the ending of the game. Depending on which girl you decide to pursue, each playthrough can be a whole new experience. \n\nThe main character is a dweeb. I really couldn\u2019t relate to him, no matter how hard I tried. Usually, when you play these games, you character \u201cevolves\u201d into your own persona but the main character was set on being the most depressive person ever. He constantly complains about everything, he is unsure of his feelings, when he has time, he always takes naps and when it\u2019s DEAD OBVIOUS a girl likes him he doesn\u2019t realize it and makes the whole situation awkward. I guess, he acts like a typical teenage boy but he is actually a 20-something year old, meaning, he is very much immature for his own age. \nThe potential love interests are typical dating simulator girls. You have the down-to-earth one, the one that looks underage, the angry one, the quiet one, the loud one\u2026 typical stuff. Actually the loud one is Hatsune Miku, I didn\u2019t much care for her since she really seemed out of place. \n\nThe story itself is pretty linear and will probably play pretty much the same each playthrough and the only thing that will be different is the girl you end up with depending on your decisions. \nI really loved the Russian setting. The game takes place in around the early 80s and I loved the little cultural details that they used. You brush your teeth with tooth powder, you will eat Kompot and drink Kefir, all characters have beautiful Russian names (except for Miku) and it\u2019s just a joy to get a glimpse of what being a pioneer was all about. \n\n[h1] In Soviet Russia, decisions make you [/h1]\n\nWhile you do get to make a decisions about which girl you will pursue or how you will spend some days, these come really rarely. I really wished that there were more decisions to be made during my playthrough, especially during the ending. One time, my character was tasked with delivering a package and he decided to open it and temper with it. I would have just delivered the damn thing and not care at all about the contents but the game was set that way and I found it really immersion breaking. I mean, often, I wanted to choose what to do next and the game just didn\u2019t let me. Still, I didn\u2019t feel like the game chose right girl for me because I really wanted to end up with the angry one and, I\u2019m happy to say that I did end up with the angry one. \n\n[h1] Everlasting summer really made me question the state of video games [/h1]\nI played Everlasting summer for 8 hours and have only seen one ending. During these 8 hours, I had a lot of fun. Now, lately I have been playing games that lasted for 2-3 hours that wanted like 15 \u2013 20 euros. Everlasting summer is free. There\u2019s no catch, it\u2019s a free game and I\u2019ve had a lot of fun with it. Even if had a laundry list of problems, it\u2019s hard to not recommend a free game. \n\n[h1] Play this game [/h1]\n\nI\u2019d like to end my review with this message which should summarize my feelings about Everlasting summer.\n\n[h2] I would have paid money for this game [/h2]\n\nNext game: Evoland Legendary Edition\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075061111/recommended/1020470/\n\n[h3]If you liked my review, feel free to follow my curator group. I\u2019m trying to review every single game in my library. Seeing and interacting with fine folks, like you, keeps my motivation up. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/RevAMG [/h3]", "timestamp_created": 1589663027, "timestamp_updated": 1610887770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608522176742553711", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69241040": {"recommendationid": "69241040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342639566", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1593772600}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c... \u0421 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435. \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c.", "timestamp_created": 1589640565, "timestamp_updated": 1589640565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69199024": {"recommendationid": "69199024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141361193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3586, "last_played": 1479075644}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encant\u00f3 la historia y me encantaron los personajes.

Un gran apunte es la edad del protagonista, que creo no se revela pero da a entender que es de 25 para arriba. Esto es un gran apunte para los que estamos en esta edad, ya que es muy f\u00e1cil identificarse (gran escena y m\u00fasica la de la introducci\u00f3n).\n\nTengo algunos detalles que mencionar con spoilers. Hablemos de \"Miku\":\n\n[spoiler]\nPersonalmente me hubiera gustado que la ruta con esa chica hubiera sido con la \"verdadera\" Miku y no esa actriz que cae m\u00e1s mal que bien (no creo que nadie se llegue a enamorar de este personaje). Esperaba que se revelara algo m\u00e1s de esta chica japonesa y que hubiera algo detr\u00e1s de ese car\u00e1cter especial.\nA\u00fan as\u00ed debo halagar la originalidad de esta ruta. A destacar, yo hubiera puesto las escenas duras algo m\u00e1s silenciosas. Yo no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 problema tienen los creadores con el heavy metal. En lugar de dar miedo psicol\u00f3gico le da un toque de comedia y no pega mucho. Me recordaba al meme de \"run\".\nEn cambio las escenas con Lena (ya sab\u00e9is de qu\u00e9 hablo) s\u00ed generaban mucho miedo. El mejor terror es el miedo a lo desconocido. Si pones una escena en la que no hay m\u00fasica o hay la de siempre y notas que algo va mal, te paralizas de miedo (como ya hicieron en Doki Doki).\nA\u00fan as\u00ed, debo decir que consiguieron que despu\u00e9s de acabar la ruta, estuviera el resto del d\u00eda en shock.\n\nOtro detalle aunque no tan importante, las ilustraciones. Para representar los personajes \"cambiados\", preferir\u00eda que hubieran mantenido los sprites con los detalles necesarios para dar miedo (como han hecho con Lena y como sale en Doki Doki), en lugar de hacer ilustraciones m\u00e1s bien abstractas, pero bueno eso ya es al gusto de cada uno.\n[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1587368299, "timestamp_updated": 1644736369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67648756": {"recommendationid": "67648756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198446937611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 849, "last_played": 1587329502}, "language": "english", "review": "I find that Everlasting Summer is more of a sci-fi adventure than a dating sim.

Suitable for relaxing. \nDo not get fooled by the beginning of the story. Loooong boooring winter. Just read quickly through it.\nAnd after the character has left the bus. Here we are: Summer Camp.\nGreen grass, no rust, all clean and of course the birds singing. \nSo if you like to relax at some time of the day...\nthis is a perfect possibility to do it. No stress at all.\nAnd of course there is to do something. Explore the camp place. Meet the others. And read through a long\nstory of a talented writer and programmer. \nThis game (visual novel) is sure worth a look. Because it is a nice and well crafted game indeed.\nAs to say so: It is one favourite now.\nMarch 2020.\n\nRemark: Recommending through and through.

conventions including some eroge art which upon reflection carries plenty of thematic baggage and is surprisingly restrained despite its mature elements.\n\nCharacters and plot are respectively well defined and fairly original. Script and setting are superficially disappointing: the multiple realities / time loops concept appears to be a flimsy cover for completionists, the protagonists' inner monologue often coming across as irrelevant narrative exposition - maybe even voicing the authors' own existencialist ramblings. The narrative depths are well hidden - in the achievement names, in the allusions which gain meaning through repeated play, in the context of collapse of USSR. Surprises and more explicit reveals do happen, particularly in the special routes.\n\nI don't know if it's consciously trying to allude to Solaris style SciFi or it just happens to point there due to common cultural influences. It does not matter though - it's far from being in the league of Tarkowsky nor Lem but it does live next door to subversive genre pieces like Groundhog Day or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\n\nContent Warning PS: the narrative restraint is rather in the underlying themes as there are dating sim and horror tropes explicitly throughout covering self-harm, sexual assault, extreme violence and even some gore.

The setting is unique - the protagonist is a nobody in modern-day Russia, until he magically gets transported to a Young Pioneer camp in the twilight years of the USSR. There is a secret bunker, a mine, a creepy Stepford Communist building robots - it's full of all kinds of mysteries! Unfortunately, you don't get to solve any of those mysteries, you just get to romance one of a series of cookie cut VN women.\n\nThe women are as stereotyped as you'd expect, but more egregious than the stereotypical women is the completely dickish behavior of the protagonist. He is a jackass every step of the way, moping about his life and treating everyone around him like trash. Still, somehow these women fall for him and depending on your clicks at least one will get nekkid for him.

I am not someone that cares much for the somewhat sexualized visuals that associate with the characters, but rather the core of the story and writing. And Everlasting Summer does deliver in that regard.\n\nThere are no voice actors, or gameplay outside of making choices and reading the conversations that come out of it. Nonetheless, with its setting taking place in a Soviet Union summer camp and characters with drastically different personalities (some straight up unlikable...and kinda creepy), I found that I enjoyed at least one or two endings a whole lot as well as the rather meta-feel this game encompasses. The music is pretty nice and the overall style feels like a sweet rendition of the anime art style in the varying seasons of Russia.\n\nIt's free but it has additional secret characters/endings that got me motivated to finding them all reaching to about thirteen hours of gameplay which is a pretty good bargain if you ask me.

And when I least expected it, the twist was just the beginning of many more to come in the shapes of questions to raise in my head and answers to find about what was all of this about.\n\n[h1][u] About the Concept: [/u][/h1]\nThe concept of the story is marvelous and quiet original from my point of view, I really liked how they developed this intriguing ambient without going too far into the details of why things occurred the way they did, that\u2019s one of the many eyes covered with one hand that the game was telling me to come forth and explore all the possibilities, even the most questionable ones. And I say this because from here and there I found, what I consider, some black holes in the story that maybe they didn\u2019t reach so well with Semyon\u2019s develop of his persona and the structure itself of the world that it is constructed (I\u2019m referring to Masha and Yulya\u2019s path in this case), I firstly want to apologize if I take it like this, but I see both of them mostly like a nice condiment to accompany the main dish that is Sovyonok camp and Semyon\u2019s never ending seek for the truth at the same time that he has to fight himself in this epicly philosophic war by always remembering who he was in the past and where he is standing at the moment, what does it mean to be here, and what all in this life means\u2026 All of this at the same time that he\u2019s stuck in the body of a 17 year old boy trying to figure out if there\u2019s more importance on such riddle or being on time for the line-up of every morning and what the other\u2019s think of him. \n\n[h1][u] I really loved this: [/u][/h1]\nThis Visual novel gives a soft grasp on the subject of philosophy romanticized epicly in the words of our narrator, Semyon himself. This is something that I personally made me feel way connected with the game because I do love writing similar to that. Finding the poetry in every circumstance is as beautiful as remembering an old-time melody that for some reason we carry all of our lives without fully comprehending why, but deep inside we know that everything will be fine. Maybe that\u2019s an interesting way to summarize what this novel feel like and what Semyon went through.\nI don\u2019t like nitpicking into the negatives or the \u2018lack of\u2026\u2019 since I feel that such thing depends on each and every person and how they interpret their own feelings and how things impact on them. So, I will be more direct with this one.\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nWith the few people in real life that I know that have experience playing visual novels, and this one as well, they all basically had a similar argument \u201cI like the idea of the plot, but the drawings aren\u2019t attractive enough to keep me interested\u201d. And yes, I personally feel this as a closed mind sentence, but like I said before, everything depends on how feelings convey into people and how much they are willing to \u2018sacrifice\u2019, if we put it that way, to find joy in the unusual things that we find in life. We also can\u2019t leave behind the fact that most of the visual novels are indeed, based on the same essence brought by Japan: Cute Anime Girls, A constant Fanservice and just the need to advance so we can get that Spicy CG or H content straight away, I\u2019m not generalizing but we can\u2019t discard the fact that many people play visual novels just for those reasons. \nEither way, It\u2019s no use trying to compare an artisanal beer against the titans of the market, because certainly the numbers will speak for themselves and that\u2019s the truth. \nSo yes, when it comes to graphics, it could be better? Possibly, even at its own you don\u2019t need to look at the CG with much attention to find the disturbances on the drawing style, and even some feature like the colors of eyes and hairs that do not match with the sprites. In this aspect, the game isn\u2019t exactly solid, it goes with the flow that I feel it was a collective one and all gathered together in one game. Does that make it bad? Not for me, I always considered that the message in the letter is more important than the letter itself. But when it comes to this special case, I believe that Everlasting Summer received a well-deserved credit even across the globe with its message, so having a nice letter to wrap things up would be wise in the future; being more faithful with the relationship of the concept art and the sprites and vice versa. \n\n[h1][u]If I could leave aside\u2026 [/u][/h1]\nIf I have to decline one part of the story, I\u2019d choose the condiments that I mentioned earlier (Yulya and Masha) specially Masha\u2019s route. I rather have it as a mod for the game than an actual route, because honestly, I was expecting something else when I found out that you had a route with Miku, and I mean Miku. But dear god, that route was one hell of a trip! And I played it at 3 A.M. so the ambient couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for that route!\nAs for Yulya, the story was really entertaining and I consider her one of my top favorites, but I felt that the story took some closed turns and raw bites that went from point A to point B too quickly and when the end presented itself, it left me dumbfounded with both of her ends. I still appreciated them and left me with a big smile in my heart but the feeling of uncertain in some events was some kind of a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\n[h1][u]Now my favorite part of this thread: [/u][/h1]\nThe Original Sound Track.\nWonderful, Marvelous and even Magic! Each and everyone of this sound tracks are quite outstanding, I consider this an enormous column that maintains this game on the top of the hills! \nFrom the very beginning the game presented some curious tunes that I found quite pleasant and not at all annoying in any sense. I even have the album on my Spotify account with my favorite ones marked already! Big thumbs up for the masterpiece of music that this game launched itself with, it is an excellent fuel for the rest of the game and its originality on every stroke of a cord, on every melody and every key pressed on the piano is sensational and I personally will never forget. If I have to compare it with other outstanding visual novels, I\u2019ll put this OST in the same shelf than Katawa Shoujo. Both games did an excellent job by spreading the magic in every scenario and every sprite bathed with their respective feelings for every occasion, the difference would be that Katawa Shoujo takes is more to a realistic ground and  will be more than pleased to letting you know how did your decisions affected the path that you are stepping on, even if you don\u2019t speak the English language and find yourself playing the game and just hoping that the button that you pressed was a good one, the following change on the chords and instruments can take you down as good as an arrow to the head. \nEverlasting Summer however, you can even taste the magic and the fiction on the air even before Semyon gets in the bus 410 for the very first time, the trip that you take from here goes from \u2018woah this is getting crazy\u2019 to \u2018wait what just happened?\u2019 all in all the music will be the one in charge to multiply how you feel at the very moment and will start to escalate step by step with every phrase that you encounter ahead until an end comes and the process repeats again. \n\n[h1][u]Finally... [/u][/h1]\nThank you once more for the deliver of this game, you have proven that a game based on a different culture than the ones we are used to when we play games of this sort, it\u2019s not bad at all, in fact its even encouraging to seek for more.\n\n I wish you all the very best and My best Regards from Argentina to you.", "timestamp_created": 1576096389, "timestamp_updated": 1576096389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605852484703063965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59583466": {"recommendationid": "59583466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098519528", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "playtime_at_review": 864, "last_played": 1700553221}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego esta muy entretenido y los diferentes finales no estan tan mal.", "timestamp_created": 1575938872, "timestamp_updated": 1575938872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59535184": {"recommendationid": "59535184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200046758", "num_games_owned": 1529, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1635614102}, "language": "english", "review": "it good.", "timestamp_created": 1575859024, "timestamp_updated": 1575859024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59383569": {"recommendationid": "59383569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321856157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 354, "last_played": 1599535222}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story with well written characters.

If you don't want to take much time use a guide or walktrough, \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1197094495\n\n\nThis game leaves me a good memory of the stories, the whole experience is quite nice, I will always remember.\nThe best about it is that it's free, it runs on SteamOS (meaning it will run on Linux machines natively)\n\nIt may be a Russian game, but the art style is Japanese anime, and it looks quite nice (they even borrowed Hatsune Miku as a \"cosplayed\" character!)\n\nAnd... there is a sequel named Frosty Kiss?\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/431540/\n\nIt is clear that the intention of the game is that you follow the story and fall in love with the character you choose as a \"story path\", or at least you read how your character does. \n\nBut still there is more to the game than just a simple novel story! It has drama, suspense, romance, horror, and well yeah some erotic images (If You Know What I Mean) *patch needed* *cough* the game is +18 anyways. And even so, it seems that the patch that reveals the images is still a bit censored.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/331470/discussions/0/1694917906669453764/ \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346601625\n\nIt is clear to me that the story is used as an enigma or riddle for the player to solve and ultimately interpret it as they want. The given choices are sometimes clear about what the player would want, but other times they are involved in a mystery aura, being unclear and having no apparent effect, as the effect and repercusion of those choices will happen much later in the story and will add up (without a guide you wouldn't know for sure how the point system for the girls routes work, in some cases you would have to experiment, save, load and retry a lot )\n\nOn a personal note, I must say that I liked taking buses and follow the whole route just to see new places I didn't know before. I was into the whole \"mysterious bus\" plot even before playing this game! So, it is as if the idea had been thought for this in an interesting way. \n\nSPOILER WARNING\nThis game's story contains not just suicide references, but actually in a Romeo and Juliet style turn of the events, more than one character indeed commits suicide. It's a +18 game anyways.

I have no idea what the context of the story is. I got every achievement in the hopes that I would be able to hook up with the nurse character. I couldn't. There was no way that I could hook up with the nurse. The story - from what I have gathered - is pretty solid. Pretty deep. Pretty emotional. But I cant hook up with the nurse. My 6.1 hours of me scraping my way through this game was not worth it. How are you gonna add a Russian Hatsune Miku into this game but not even think to add a nurse hook-up feature? We are talking about 50+ hours of content, and you're telling me that throughout all of the content displayed there was not a single thought to add a section where you hooked up with the hottest nurse I have ever seen? I mean, I'm being serious. She is the hottest nurse I have ever seen. Even hotter than nurse joy. And you're gonna stand there. Twiddling your thumbs. Rocking back and forth in a single spot. Telling me that there is no way that I can hook up with the nurse. You drew the art! You could have done so much with the character! But what did we get? A singular high quality image an a couple sprites? Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. I am bewildered that you didn't add this as a feature. I mean, what's the harm?

Though the genre has always intrigued me, I'd never found a specific VN to actually try out, and I don't play games very often nowadays. However, after reading a brief description of Everlasting Summer, I was so interested that I tried it out - and it's actually free, so that was very easy to do.\n\nI am a major sucker for themes of \"nostalgia\" and one day I'd actually somehow found myself on the Wikipedia page about nostalgia, even though I've read about it a million times before, and that's how I got to the page for this game. Needless to say, I found it very touching and immersive, with a really interesting story. There are many different endings, and they really make you think. I would've liked E.S. good enough if it had been as straightforward as it seems as first, but it really doesn't stay that way - there are some seriously unexpected twists and turns, and the time really flies by fast the more you explore and theorise. It's clear that the developers put a lot of effort and passion into this project, and to have it be free of charge is just amazing. I really liked the artwork, music, and also the writing. The English translation has some grammar and spelling mistakes here and there, but it's really nothing too distracting and I say that as someone who's usually hyper-aware of those sorts of things. All in all, it comes together as a great package!\n\nMy only nitpicks would be that I wish there were more frequent instances of choice-making - sometimes you find yourself wishing you could choose something different or react a different way than what Semyon decides on his own during long stretches where it's only reading. Still, the amount of different paths makes up for that and it's not a big deal. Ultimately, I found Everlasting Summer exceptional, and I will definitely retain \"only the fondest memories of my time at Sovyonok\"! Also I will probably keep an eye on when the current project that the Developers are working on gets released.", "timestamp_created": 1567019941, "timestamp_updated": 1567019941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54806867": {"recommendationid": "54806867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238119112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 567, "last_played": 1514648253}, "language": "english", "review": "A very memorable VN.

But not only vanishes that whole characterization as soon as he enters the camp, his thoughts also seem SO constructed. I mean, brackets? Really? Who thinks in brackets in a novel? Anyway, I get that the whole setup is surreal and there's mystery stuff going on but a) you don't need to remind me every 10 seconds and then act like everything's fine although you're supposed to be a lonely depressed chan guy, and b) it all seemed just a little too forced.

It jumps quite inconsistently between entertaining and flat-out bad. Bad, as in, dumb. Having bad writing in a VN is a notable downside. There are also some pacing issues.\n\nBut. And that \"but\" is one hell of a saving grace.\n\nEven if the packaging has a few dents and scratches, this game has something many others have lost somewhere along the way: a heart.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- The character art is okay, even though it's about as inconsistent as the writing. Some are cool and pleasing to the eye, others are only meh.\n- Backgrounds are great. All sharp, and look really nice.\n- The music is definitely the strongest point to be presented. Styles are varied, and do a good job of accentuating emotions, especially for touching scenes.\n\nAdd all that up, and don't force yourself to read all the text letter by letter, just let the atmosphere carry you... and you get an amazing experience.\n\nIf you were a kid in the 80s in any Eastern Block country and went to summer camps... then this game will most likely hit the mark, regardless of imperfections. Just the main menu will draw you in.\n\nAlso, it's free, so what do you have to lose by giving it a shot?\n\n\nPs.: Alisa rocks. :P", "timestamp_created": 1562832043, "timestamp_updated": 1562887538,

First and most important, writing. Sometimes it was literally painful to read. I first played in English and was thinking that maybe the original version is better \u2013 but no. I later played most of it in Russian and it was in the same way awful (if not worse). Love scenes \u2013 they are just disgusting. I pity the author\u2019s partner, if he has one.\n\nAnd let me be clear: I played every story line \u2013 although I disliked this game from the middle of my first run \u2013 I was just curious if it can become any worse.\n\nI would write a better script when I was fourteen.\n\nSecondly, \u201cchoices\u201d. Some decisions you get to make are random, e.g. taking a random apple from a table or not. You can rarely predict consequences of your choices, because they make no sense. And once you have made a couple of mistakes you lose a girl for good, there is no way to win her back. This is why you are most likely to get one of the Semyon endings, i.e. end up alone. However, given the language of love scenes, it is for the better.\n\nI could probably mention other issues, but by this point you should have already realized what a piece of garbage this game is.\n\nDisclosure: except for DDLC, I had never played a visual novel before. People say that Everlasting Summer is the best Russian visual novel. I cannot rule out that it is true, but it would mean that other Russian visual novels are absolutely worthless.\n\n2/10", "timestamp_created": 1561804150, "timestamp_updated": 1561804150, "voted_up":

good for a free game!\n\nI really enjoyed the atmosphere - the summer, the mystery, the \"remote location in the middle of nowhere\" setting. It really managed to draw you in. It was also complemented by great background music and CG. \n\nThe plot has its ups and downs. The beginning is really strong and it really sucks you in and makes you want to figure out the mystery, what happens next and how the story unfolds. Unfortunately there are many episodes of boring exposition and introspection as well. The  internal monologue was quite repetitive at some points. \n\nSome of the routes were really good and evoked really positive emotions in me and had nicely handled endings, while others were really confusing or even downright depressing. Nevertheless, overall I remained with a positive impression from the whole experience.\n\nGameplay-wise, unfortunately you have to replay the game several times to experience everything and to obtain the true ending. You can skip already-read dialogue which speeds up the process but at the same time it breaks the immersion. I guess that's a problem all multi-route VNs have.\n\nOverall a great game which managed to instill some emotions in me, which is not that common for many games I play.", "timestamp_created":

I loved the soundtrack and the characters although Ulyana is meh. I legit got invested in all of the routes once again except for Ulyana's. Even the game itself calls the achievement for Ulyana's ending \"Attack on Pedobear\" which is fitting because only a pedo or a kid too young to play this game could like her route.\n\nThere is one or two things that I find annoying though even though they're not that big of a deal. I understand that the developers are Russian and they had to translate it for different languages, but it would have been nice for there to be voice acting. I heard someone was trying to make a voices mod (English) a few years ago even with a page for auditions, but I can't seem to find it if it ever got finished. Also, some of the endings are real dick slaps. Lena's good ending has a flash forward to far into the future. Even though Lena is my favorite by far I was still invested enough in the other girls to want to see where they go after the camp. In literally all of the other good endings they just leave on that last scene giving everybody a middle fingered salute. Even after going through all the trouble to unlock the secret endings I felt like there was room for more. \n\nOther than that the game in my opinion is better than Doki Doki Literature Club which you are free to attempt to change my mind if you think you can.", "timestamp_created": 1553726081, "timestamp_updated": 1553726081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49766461": {"recommendationid": "49766461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386645660", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1553587740}, "language": "english", "review": "Please\nRead any visual novel you find that is not this horrible thing\n\nIf I have to describe it in one word it's \"empty\". There is litteraly nothing worth your time outside of the backgroud pictures, trust me.\n\nIf you still want a detailed review, fine. I'll tell you everything and I don't care about spoilers ( to be honest the story is so bland I don't even consider anything I can say a real spoiler but still) \n\n\t\nThe whole game is literally consist of following a social misfits talking to NPCs.\nThe \"~\" in the beginning and end of each of the mc internal dialogue make him look even more brainless than he already is, not to mention the overall writing (or traduction i can't\ntell since I don't know russian) and the \"!\" which amplify his stupidity even more. NONE of his actions or thought are consistent. He forget things, don't hear others and generally just go with the flow. And don't tell me something like \"but it's because it's a dreaaaaaam\", that logic is valid only if IT DON'T APPLY TO 95% OF THE STORY. using the \"I was only pretending to be ret4rded\" card work only if it's for a really short time. Not to mention that someting retarded is still what it is, done deliberately or not.\n\nOthers characters too are completly unlikable, and not only because they're the ugliest creature existing, but also because of their mentals problem(not in a good way), they become angry for no reason, are immature beyond reason and pull pranks on you (like putting scolopendra in your plate while you're about to eat, hahaha so funny)\nThe problem is, everything is centered around them and you go from one charaters to another, and that's it. The game have nothing else. The funnier part is that in the 100+ VN I've read, this is the first time I saw a reason for the characters to meet up everytime THIS absurd, you literaly are are under the impression you're playing a bad MMO and everyone give you a quest consisting of '\"talk to that person and then come back\". The whole game. \n\nDid I tell you one of these horrible characters is Miku? Yes. Hatsune Miku. The real one. Do I have to tell more? I guess her route is the most interesting one but the fact that she is Miku  got NOTHING to do with in that. She literaly have no reason for existing ouside of meme maybe, I don't know.\n\nTo finish with characters, let me post one of the numerous stupid conversation so you can understand what I mean by \"bland\". This is beetween Semyon and Lena during Lena route : \nSemyon - You shouldn't think like this.\n- How should I think?\n- I don't know\n- I can only draw conclusion based on your behavior.\n- I really don't know... I guess I'd better go. \n- Why? Since you came...\n- Alright.\n- And?\n- What?\n- What did Alisa tell you? \n- Nothing special.\n- I see.\n- Yeah.\n- Well then.\n- Yep.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/395744069550342155/559657372021293056/unknown.png\nIt's not better with context. You just have to know that this take place near the end of the route, and their bond is at his peak.\n\nThe best part in that is that the mc know he's talking to NPCs, but still fall in love with them in approximatly 3 seconds ONLY because in the head of the writer, a visual novel is inevitably some dating sim where you end up loving and having sex with one of the girl, even if it doesn't make any sense with the \"big\" story. Great for him, but anyone how played more that 2 VN should know it's not.\n\nThe ost is... Average, but tracks plays randomly on scene that don't go well with them haha\n\nThere is a screamer at the beginning, a completely ridiculous and random one. That's not how you place them (you're not even supposed tu use such a poor trope in the first place obviously). Every single time this game try to set up a heavy or scary mood it fails lamentably because of idea like this one and the cruel lack of build up, backed by the random ost, the awful writing and the changing background.\n\nNobody know why but there is a stupid card game.\n\nThe feeble storyline is advencing extremely slowly and every dialogue that are a little bit significant are interrupted. That is the only way they found to create suspense, and also their mastercard because they have nothing to show up at the end, so they litteraly can't be too revelent.\nThe few foreshadowing are so enormous you can only laugh at them, and the rest is purposely vague so the reader feel like the story hide something and can imagine it himself. Too bad foreshadowing is interesting while imprecise bullshit is not. Not in this case at least.\n\nSome routes are completly twisted with inconsistency, for exemple, I triggered Alisa end without seeing her play the guitar even one time. By the end of her route, the mc play in a band only because he was affected by Alisa during the story. DEEP LORE RIGHT HERE.\n\nTalking about route, there is almost no difference between bad and good one, outside of a few lines telling nothing. But somehow you need all the good ones to progress. It's always a pleasure to restart a game and redo everything just to get 1 more character point so you can read 2 new lines. \n\nNot to mention almost every route follow the same pattern, mc grow up alone after waking up and encounter the girl again later, the end. Nothing more is told.\n\n_____\n\n\nTo tell you the truth, I only got this far in the game because of people recommending it to me, and telling, while I was reading with incomprenhension \"everything will be revealed later, you'll see\" and the habitual blabla, but when I saw it was all false hope, only my hatred carried me. Yes, I hate this Visual Novel with all my heart and litteraly want to kill every characters outside of Yulya. I want to say to Ulyana that I'll play football with her and then do it with her head. I want to make sure Miku never talk again while telling her her music was the worst I ever heard (and that come from someone supposed to like her song outside of the game). I want Lena to suicide again and definitivly. And a lot more. \n\nYou might say that in the end, this game successed at giving me emotion and involvement, so maybe it's worth something. But it's only due to my autism and the circumstances I was in. In truth, only the first 10 minutes of the game mean something and is kinda intriguing, then, the opening plays and you see every characters sprites. Anyone in it's right mind would alt+f4 the game at this exact point, and I recommend you to do exactly that if you don't want to end up like me.\n\nI love Visual Novel very much, and this is exactly why this thing triggered me this much. If it wasn't clear enough let me emphasize why : THIS IS OBJECTIVLY THE WORST STORY I EVER COME ACROSS IN EVERY ASPECT.\n\n\"This stupid camp, that script of yours. Everything ! Everything is bad ! And you are not a child anymore !\" -Miku \nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/484081427969736717/559739202783281192/SPOILER_unknown.png\nMaybe the author should have listened to himslef.", "timestamp_created": 1553589077, "timestamp_updated": 1564006301, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469017565250396729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49743695": {"recommendationid": "49743695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335750225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 848, "last_played": 1504466799}, "language": "english", "review": "i want to die alone tonight.", "timestamp_created": 1553463223, "timestamp_updated": 1553463543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740067958831787109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49742840": {"recommendationid": "49742840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450272907", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1765, "last_played": 1662149328}, "language": "english", "review": "Is good.

Like a lot of people probably I tend to get a bunch of games on steam all at one time when a sale pops up so this title spent some time languishing in my visual novels folder for a while before I got around to playing it. After finishing most of the routs I decided to have a look to see how much I paid for the game and was surprised to see that it was one of the free titles. It's a long and well made game. I would have paid for it.\n\nOne really neat thing about Everlasting Summer is all of the Soviet era imagry. I'm an american 80s kid and it was interesting to have a game from that perspective. I always thought of summer camp as something uniquely american and went to one as a kid so this game was really fascinating even before the story went off the rails.\n\nIf I had a criticism (and it's a relatively minor one) there were some translation issues I don't know if the translation got better as the game progressed or if I just got used to it but before reaching the camp the first time I was worried the game would be a bit of a slog. The story is great once it gets going though. \n\nOne last thing, I really REALLY like the song that plays in the endings. I've got it stuck in my head at this point after playing through the whole game. Thanks for putting this title up on steam and making it available for free.

I won\u2019t write about music, characters, plot - believe me, they are excellent here. [i]Also, there are no spoilers in this review.[/i] I will write about my emotions and thoughts that I got while playing.\n\nIt left me with mixed feelings, it\u2019s difficult to explain, but I\u2019ll try. With all my hatred for the Soviet Union, this game still managed to give me unforgettable memories. \nThe Soviet Union is what my country and I suffer to this day(30 years after the collapse of the union, my country and I still suffering from its remnant in the form of Russia).\n\nBut as a person who was born in a post-Soviet country and lived all his childhood in the city, in every building of which one you can see the spirit of the USSR. For me, as for many, childhood was carefree, joyful and eventful. This game was able to evoke those memories and bring it back.\n\nThis game shows the Soviet Union through the eyes of a \"child\", in which the problems were a tasteless lunch in the canteen, being told off for bad behavior, going to an abandoned camp at night.

The artstyle turned me off at first, but it was rather easy to get used to. There are some really obvious character tropes, (tsundere, yandere, etc.) but the developers did a nice job of adding their own twists to classic archetypes. The characters do not at all feel one or two dimensional, and are actually likeable/dislikeable. I actually sat in my chair for a good ten minutes deciding whose route I wanted to go on. I don't typically do that for VNs. If there was one thing I had to critique, though, it would be how the endings work. Luckily, there are guides on Steam and the internet, but I feel the game is not forgiving enough in terms of making \"mistakes\". Sure, making choices that would negatively should cause some strife, but you're only allowed to make one wrong decision, if that. If I had to suggest a change, I would take a page out of Katawa Shoujo's book and add a neutral ending for each character.

The artstyle turned me off at first, but it was rather easy to get used to. There are some really obvious character tropes, (tsundere, yandere, etc.) but the developers did a nice job of adding their own twists to classic archetypes. The characters do not at all feel one or two dimensional, and are actually likeable/dislikeable. I actually sat in my chair for a good ten minutes deciding whose route I wanted to go on. I don't typically do that for VNs. If there was one thing I had to critique, though, it would be how the endings work. Luckily, there are guides on Steam and the internet, but I feel the game is not forgiving enough in terms of making \"mistakes\". Sure, making choices that would negatively should cause some strife, but you're only allowed to make one wrong decision, if that. If I had to suggest a change, I would take a page out of Katawa Shoujo's book and add a neutral ending for each character. But, seeing as the studio was relatively new and unheard of (at least in the US), I can understand. Overall, Everlasting Summer was an enjoyable experience, with much more depth than is first revealed.\n\nTL;DR: Don't let the amateurish nature of the game throw you off, it's quite good. GIve the Communist anime girls a chance. And if you liked it, look out for Love, Money, and Rock and Roll, Soviet Games's up and coming VN, which, I can personally guarantee, is going to be amazing. \n\n\n[strike] also lena best girl [/strike]\n", "timestamp_created": 1545794667, "timestamp_updated": 1545794667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624377906322479248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47815119": {"recommendationid": "47815119", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963835759", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 494, "last_played": 1546007424}, "language": "english", "review": "I've found myself playing / reading for hours.
