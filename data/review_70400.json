How delightful to have encountered such a beguiling game, which subverts the tired conventions of the JRPG genre by presenting the player with a fresh, engaging, and oh-so-clever concept: running an item shop.\n\nAs one who frequents the most esteemed art galleries, I am particularly enamored with the game's presentation. The charming, anime-inspired graphics are a breath of fresh air in a medium that is often overly preoccupied with hyper-realism, and the lovingly crafted pixel art adds a sense of nostalgia that is sure to delight any connoisseur of the retro-gaming scene.\n\nBut it is not merely the aesthetics that draw me to Recettear. No, what truly sets this game apart is its masterful blend of mechanics and narrative. The player assumes the role of Recette, a plucky young girl who inherits an item shop from her absentee father, and must use her wits and savvy to navigate the cutthroat world of commerce. As she purchases and sells various goods, the player is treated to a richly woven tale of friendship, betrayal, and adventure, complete with lovable characters and unexpected plot twists.\n\nBut what truly elevates Recettear to the level of high art is the way in which it grapples with the themes of capitalism, class struggle, and the intersection of commerce and human relationships. As Recette struggles to keep her shop afloat, she must contend with the demands of various factions, including the guild of adventurers, who rely on her wares to survive their perilous journeys, and the wealthy nobility, who seek to exploit her for their own gain. Through it all, Recette remains steadfast in her belief that the value of a person is not determined by their wealth or status, but by the relationships they cultivate.\n\nIn conclusion, Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is a truly remarkable achievement in gaming, and a work of art that is sure to delight and challenge even the most discerning of critics. Its blend of mechanics and narrative, coupled with its richly realized world and thought-provoking themes, make it a game that is not to be missed.

This game is all about capitalism, neglectful parents, and overcharging villagers \u2013 and it's a blast to play.\n\nAs the titular character Recette, you're tasked with running a small item shop in a bustling town. You'll have to haggle with customers, manage your inventory, and keep your store stocked with all sorts of goods. And let's not forget about the dungeons \u2013 you'll have to delve into dangerous dungeons to find rare items to sell.\n\nThe game's graphics are adorable, with bright colors and cute character designs that are sure to put a smile on your face. And the soundtrack is just as charming, with catchy tunes that will have you humming along.\n\nBut what really sets Recettear apart is its humor. The game is full of puns and witty jokes, and the characters are all quirky and memorable. From the lazy slacker who runs the item shop next door to the creepy old man who hangs around the town square, you'll meet all sorts of colorful characters in Recettear.\n\nOf course, the game's core mechanic is buying low and selling high. You'll have to be savvy with your pricing if you want to turn a profit, and sometimes that means overcharging your customers.

Turns out it is just actually an innocent yell, kind of like \"Heave, ho!\" when pulling something heavy. M-merde...\n\nWell, besides that, this actually turned out to be a fun and engaging game. I actually get quite nervous when it comes to shop games because of stuff you have to keep in mind, but this game wasn't like that. From putting items in your shop according to your preference whether you like to organize or just put them at random, to the customers and characters with different personalities that you have to pay attention to and adjust your prices and haggling accordingly, to the shop make over that attracts or discourage certain kinds of customers based on the atmosphere, the dungeon adventure game which isn't really necessary to win the game but it's there, the satisfying just combo and near pin exp bonuses, and to the rather tragic plot, cute retro graphics, and larger than life cast and voice overs; this game was, is, and will still be such a joy to play. And also the story and little interactions with each characters were funny, engaging, and sentimental at times(especially between Tear and Recette), as well as some customer lines that might sting your heart or just straight up piss you off.\n\nOverall, very fun game if you're looking to pick up a shop-keeping adventure game with a somewhat mild but satisfying learning curve. Don't expect it to be stress-free though, some customers might test your patience sometimes(I'm talking about the housewife) and also might make you feel guilty haggling with a little girl while she pleads you to lower the price some more, but that's the art of haggling to you.

You own an item shop indebted to a loanshark fairy, and every week you have to make payments.  This goes on over the course of five weeks, the payments getting steeper every time.   Each day is broken down into a few segments, and you can choose to open shop, go to the wholesalers to obtain more stock to sell, redecorate or rearrange your items/shelves, or go dungeon diving to gather loot yourself. \nThe main gameplay loop is you opening your shop each day, haggling with people who want to buy stuff from you or sell their junk to you.  Buy-low, sell-high is the name of the game here, with the risk being that each character is unique and is willing to pay only so much, and only so much over the base price of an item and if you push them too much they will give up and leave.  And there's variety thrown in through, as the time of day and the days change, the prices of different categories of items rise and fall in the general marketplace, which directly affects how you buy/sell.\nThe problem is, it's pretty opaque.  It's upfront in telling you whether an item is selling high or low in the marketplace, but beyond that it leaves you to your own devices.  Rarely will you get customers taking the 30% margin markup the tutorial tells you.  You end up establishing in your own head rough patterns for different characters for what they're willing to pay or be paid, which stays fairly consistent for a time, maybe a day or two, but this seems to change then with no real rhyme or reason (I'm looking at you, annoying little girl brat shopper).  And there were times where it didn't matter how much I eroded my profit margins for some characters, they still weren't willing to pay anything, and stormed off.  I'm not sure if it was random, but it was pretty baffling altogether.\n\nAnd to make matters worse I found, with the best will in the world, it was completely impossible to win the game first time round.  Unless you're already an expert and are min-maxing your way through it.  But once you fail by missing a payment date, you go back to start of the 5 weeks, BUT you keep all your items and level (which isn't really explained by the way).  So it becomes trivially easy.  I found I had enough saved within about 3 weeks of my second loop through the game to pay all remaining loan, but there was no option to do this early, or fast advance time. I had to keep leaving and re-entering my shop constantly to make time go forward so I could watch the credits which seems like a silly oversight.  But then again it is an old game with rough edges.\n\nThere's a whole dungeon-diving aspect to the game but it is very basic and repetitive and not the focus here, and honestly on my second loop through the game I didn't bother with it at all.\n\nSo with all that said, it's a tentative recommendation provided you know what you're getting into and can handle the jank.", "timestamp_created": 1674166381, "timestamp_updated": 1674166381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508928596973419189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131015044": {"recommendationid": "131015044", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004519682", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 183, "playtime_forever": 2891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1429, "last_played": 1674498152}, "language": "english", "review": "The absolute best merchant/trading game I've ever played.

The haggling mechanics could use more explanations, how each customer tends to shop and clearly indicate when they're trying to sell you something and you instinctively offer 130% what it's worth from your supplier. The art is cute and has a unique calming-excitement to it, you're ready to start selling but it's still a very familiar domestic setting rather than off on an adventure personally challenging monsters, just trying to figure out what an old man thinks a steel sword is worth and why a small girl came in here thinking I sell books.

The plot and characters is one of the game's strong points. The protagonist, a little girl named Recette, is told by a debt collection fairy named Tier that her father died and left behind a huge debt and she's come to repossess her house. They work out a payment schedule of escalating amounts each day and quickly convert the house into a fantasy item shop.\n\nThe core loop involves buying and selling items from customers, arranging the shop, and haggling prices. There are places in the city that you can visit, but that takes time away that could be spent making money in the shop, forcing the player to manage their time carefully. Once you meet adventurers, you can hire them to explore the dungeon with you to find items to sell. Dungeon gameplay feels reminiscent of Zelda to me.\n\nI've played other shop management sims, and I think this one is among my favorites due to the ticking clock and escalating debt repayment costs. The storyline is funny and enjoyable, and I love the characters. The music and action gameplay are quite good as well.

Theirs not much to say about that part, its a pretty simple, but fun action RPG hack and slash where you fight monsters in randomly generated dungeons, fighting a boss every 5 floors. the neat part is that the adventurers use the gear you sell them, so sometimes its a good idea to slash your prices when an adventurer wants to buy something.\n\nthe writing is funny and the characters are charming, so the game has a fun, lighthearted feeling all the way through.

And yet, I enjoyed my playthrouhg of this game a lot because its main mechanic of running a store and selling your goods, adapting to the market and even dungeon exploring in an ARPG/Ys Games style was so intriguing. I thorougly enjoyed filling up my shelves, designing my shop for the right clientele and so on. \n\nAlso, post game exists and there's still a lot to discover after finishing the main story. More replayability is offered with NG+ and a Survival Mode, so there's tons of content that I didn't even touch yet, and probably won't for a while, because in my opinion, this one playthrough was just long enough to didn't overstay its welcome - at least for me, but everyone's different when it comes to that.\n\nSo yeah, I definitely recommend Recettear if you want to run your own shop and can accept the outdated graphics and the repeating music.", "timestamp_created": 1658257736, "timestamp_updated": 1658257736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119073790": {"recommendationid": "119073790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091193311", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 671, "last_played": 1658483606}, "language": "english", "review": "Who the hell this Character Caillou think he is?

Until, that is, a fairy named Tear shows up and says that her father borrowed a staggering amount of money and used their family home as collateral. Faced with potentially being thrown out onto the street, Recette is determined to pay off her father\u2019s debt. Tear (unusually for a fictional loan shark) would rather help Recette pay off the loan than break her legs and has come up with a business plan: Open an item shop on the house\u2019s  lower floor - an item shop which Recette dubs Recettear in honour of their new friendship.\n\nThe player must then find a balance between buying from customers, the merchants\u2019 guild, and the market, and selling to customers at a profit. By the way, buying from and selling to the customers at the correct price points will also level them up, meaning they have more money to spend in your store! Do well enough and you\u2019ll pay off the weekly installments, which get bigger as the month progresses. Fail, and it\u2019s out on the street for you.\n\nThere\u2019s also an RPG dungeon-crawling element: You can hire adventurers to explore dungeons, slay monsters, and collect loot. Some of the loot can also be used to create better quality items which sell at a higher price point.\n\nRecettear is a thoroughly enjoyable and adorable game. One of the best aspects, though, is the cycle of  new game plus - something common in JRPGs which is used to great effect here. If you fail to meet a repayment (or complete the game and choose to start again), you will restart with all of your stock still in your inventory. This means that if you know you can\u2019t meet the repayment, you can just spend all of your money to get items which will make the next run easier. The customers and adventurers will also retain their levels, which helps as well. So despite being very challenging the first few runs, the game is also very forgiving in allowing you to learn from these challenges.\n\nWhen it comes to the graphics of Recettear, the first impression is \u201cFuck that\u2019s cute\u201d, and this impression doesn\u2019t fade. Even the monsters the adventurers beat up are cute! (I still enjoy killing the bastards though.) The sound design is also very good, with music which always puts me in a good mood - I would honestly pay for the soundtrack if it was available. The game also runs very smoothly,  with little to no bugs that I could see.\n\n\nTop 5 Pros:\n\t- Cute as fuck\n\t- No romance in sight (but you can ship to your heart\u2019s content)\n\t- Cast have a diverse set of personalities\n\t- The cycles of new-game-plus allow for a lot of forgiveness\n\t- Adjusting your shop atmosphere for different customers\n\n\nTop 5 Cons:\n\t- Combat is very basic\n\t- Lack of diversity in skin colours\n\t- You will probably be thrown out into the street at least once\n\t- That irritating-as-fuck little girl\n\t- Euria. Fuck you, Euria.\n\n\nWould I recommend?\nYes.

It\u2019s stars Recette, a girl whose absent father took up a loan that he hasn\u2019t paid back yet. Because of that, Tear, a fairy sent by the company that lent Recette\u2019s father the money, shows up at her doorstep and demands incremental payments to clear her father\u2019s debt over a span of five weeks. And that\u2019s basically all the setup we get. Recette has money trouble and decides to turn her home into a store to sell a variety of items to fellow townsfolk as well as adventurers who frequent the town. I like this role reversal. \n\nIn terms of gameplay, it\u2019s mostly straightforward. To run your shop, you first have to acquire a bunch of inventory. You have multiple ways of procuring said stock, either from a market, the merchant\u2019s guild or by sending off adventurers and tasking them with bringing back items or ingredients to craft better items.\n\nThe first two are rather self-explanatory. They\u2019re a bunch of dolled up menus that show you what\u2019s on offer so you can buy it as stock to sell later on. The adventuring portion is a bit more involved though. You can recruit a couple of adventurers over the course of the game to go into a half a dozen dungeons to retrieve ingredients and gear. But the twist here is that it\u2019s not just a passive affair. You get to go along into those dungeons and the game hands you control over the adventurer you\u2019ve hired, to engage in some light combat gameplay while wandering around randomly generated dungeons.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, the dungeon crawling aspect didn\u2019t really resonate with me all that much. It\u2019s too simplistic to be entertaining and it also unnecessarily detracts from the other half of the game. I mean, it\u2019s right there in the title, it\u2019s \u201can item shop\u2019s tale\u201d. I feel like the inclusion of the playable dungeons detracts from the central idea the game is built upon. It\u2019s literally just a bunch of tacked together combat spaces filled with a random assortment of enemies that mostly exhibit the same behaviors and aren\u2019t tough to deal with. The uninteresting dungeon crawling coupled with the tacit betrayal of the game\u2019s central gimmick left me with a general unwillingness to engage with that aspect of the game all that much. And since that part of the game is also the one that nets you all the ingredients for the crafting system, I also never engaged with that in any meaningful capacity.\n\nOnce you have a bunch of stuff to sell, you can return to your store, put the items onto your shelves and watch customers flock in to see the wares on offer. If a customer shows interest in a product, you get to haggle over the price until they\u2019re happy with it or they eventually refuse to buy from you for not meeting their budget. Japanese games have a tendency to systematize a lot of their gameplay. And while haggling over the price is a central mechanic that gets extensively tutorialized at the start, it\u2019s actually counterintuitively not what you\u2019re supposed to do. The game tells you that typically a sale price of 30% above the base price is acceptable to most customers. \n\nThis initial \u201cstrategy\u201d of aiming for those 30% ended with me missing one of the payment milestones by quite a margin. At that point, the game actually sent me back all the way to day 2 of the calendar to try again, so it has somewhat of a roguelike quality, even though you can manually save at any point and just load up that save to continue where you left off previously.\n\nBut here\u2019s actually where the game took a turn for the interesting. Because even though all my money was gone, my inventory, merchant level, dungeon progress, etc. was all still there. So while the game is content with letting you screw yourself over royally the first time around, you basically don\u2019t get punished that hard for failing at it. And the fact that you get to keep everything except the money means that you\u2019re now much better equipped to deal with upcoming challenges.\n\nThe game also introduces market fluctuations that affect the prices of your items. If prices sink, you\u2019ll generally have to sell your items way below their base prices. A way to get around that is by simply not stocking these items. Characters typically only buy what\u2019s on the shelves. Sometimes they come up to you and ask for an item in a specific category, so if you have something there you can choose which items you want to sell. For these discounted items, I usually went with the cheaper ones, so selling them wouldn\u2019t eat into my profits. Conversely, there are also times when items can be sold for much more. \n\nThese scarcities actually led to a few in game days where I had such massive profits that I had the necessary funds to pay back the loan almost a week in advance. Now this might not sound all that impressive, but the weekly payments increase at an almost exponential level, from a mere 10\u2019000 at the start to half a million by the end. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to then just jump ahead to end the game, you have to run out the clock by artificially moving around town a bit. \n\nAnd I admit that by the end I kinda got a bit tired of the sale mechanics, because at that point I figured out the behaviors of the characters and consistently managed to pull in way more money than necessary. The gameplay never really changes while you\u2019re in the store. And yeah, I can hear you yelling \u201cthat\u2019s what the dungeons and the crafting are for\u201d, but they were also equally underwhelming, so it\u2019s trading in one gameplay aspect for another one that isn\u2019t that fulfilling and didn\u2019t really seem to accelerate my financial growth anyway.\n\nHere\u2019s where a theme or a relevant storyline could\u2019ve helped the game sustain my interest for a bit longer. The game starts off strong with the idea of a little girl being coerced into paying her father\u2019s debts by the fantasy equivalent of a loan shark. And there are a few jabs at typical fantasy game tropes thrown in there for good measure, like the quite frankly ludicrous price certain items fetch in relation to others. But I just feel that most of that is fairly superficial and leaves a lot of unfulfilled potential on the table. I mean, Recette herself adopts the catchphrase \u201cCapitalism, ho!\u201d. That would\u2019ve been an excellent angle to tackle a story from: make it a critique of capitalism. Make it about the struggle of being forced to work in a society that seems to be mostly centered around consumption. But no, as it stands, the game doesn\u2019t really tell a story. It introduces a sort of antagonist partway through with Alouette, who runs an apparently competing business. But it never really materializes into an actual rivalry, and it has no impact on your ability to sell to guaranteed customers. All that happens is that she and her fairy show up periodically at your store to buy something. And for the record, those two are the ones who\u2019ll never accept anything above base price, so they\u2019re reduced to simple to navigate obstacles.\n\nIn the end, I\u2019m not sure I can recommend Recettear. I mean, I\u2019d be lying if I were saying that I didn\u2019t have fun with the core item shop mechanic. It has this addictive quality to it, especially in the period where you\u2019re still trying to figure out the systems. But once you do, it becomes pretty rote and the systemic nature of the gameplay becomes fairly evident. But ultimately, that\u2019s not the primary reason why I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. To me, it\u2019s not that what I ended up playing wasn\u2019t a masterpiece, but more that I saw so much more potential in this idea that didn\u2019t get realized. A bad game is one thing, but I feel it\u2019s all the more tragic if you play a sort of passable game that\u2019s clearly standing in the shadow of the much better game it could be.", "timestamp_created": 1655669896, "timestamp_updated": 1655669896, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573567330837249756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117211151": {"recommendationid": "117211151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126399090", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 1278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1275, "last_played": 1681898622}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my now favoured merchant games.

This game is awesome. It's a perfect spin on the dungeon-diving game trope: you play the shopkeeper instead of the adventurer in an adventuring dungeon-diving world (you'll still get to dungeon-dive and control the adventurer, though! so you get to do both things!). Writing a review in 2022 feels silly because this game is a classic at this point. For whatever genre you'd call this, Recettear is the starting point or at least the first apex. There are plenty of games out there trying to emulate the mechanics of this one but don't quite recreate the same amount of fun and joy of fantasy capitalism this game gives, so if you've ever played a game that sounds like this game, or the reviewers compared it to Recettear, and you liked it, you'll probably love Recettear even more.\n\nThe pricing, buying, selling, and questing is fun to replay even though it should feel monotonous. IT SHOULD GET BORING BUT IT DOESN'T. The adventurers aren't complicated and only have a few special moves each but they're still fun to play. The background music isn't special but it doesn't get annoying. The story is silly and the dialogue is silly and it's all tropes but it's still endearing. The item bible is HUGE and the world is BIG and you will be able to go back to this game over and over. I've been playing it on and off for years now and I'm still not 100% complete. And that's great because it's a fun game.\n\nThe biggest hurdle to the game was, for me, the tutorial, because it's sooooo slow and feels like it takes forever to get through like it'll never end, and I actually started and quit the game several times before getting through it because I have a terrible attention span.

Recettear is one such game that ends up picking up such expectations due to the way it manages to reverse the roles placed upon the player in a typical RPG. Rather than taking the position of a questing adventurer or the hero, the player instead gets to play the role of an item merchant in their day to day life as they try paying off their debts and expanding their business, and I'd say that the game does a good job at providing enough depth to this idea to support its playtime while still being very simple and accessible at its core, despite some issues that become increasingly clear as you play through the campaign. This combined with the uniquely offbeat sense of humour that's presented ultimately makes for an experience that I'd consider extremely worth playing through in spite of the flaws that it presents front and centre.\n\nOne of the most effective things this game does is introduce new concepts in an easily digestible and tangible context. While the options the player has at the very start of the game are limited, they still feel like enough to get by, as if you could feasibly get through stuff at the pace you're going at, but then the game continuously adds new elements to its core loop that expand upon it in extremely clear ways that benefit you nearly immediately. The biggest example of this is once the player is introduced to fluctuating market prices, where certain items suddenly spike or drop in value. While this contributes to a heightened sense of complexity as the game now rewards you for having a varied stock in the backlog to best capitalise on these changing prices for maximum profit, the way that it's initially presented makes it something not just to think about in the long term, but something you can immediately do and see both the benefits and drawbacks of relying on these methods, as while they're effective, they're also very unreliable due to the lack of control over the market itself. While easy to understand and contextualised through gameplay effectively, this sort of underlying, layered nuance is what makes the shopkeeping aspect of the game tick, everything looks and feels simple, but the lightly strategic elements in play if you really want to double down and best run your business (which the game inherently makes you do) end up breathing so much life into these systems. \n\nThe writing is also really funny with the way that despite playing as this cute anime girl who's just trying her best to get by with what might seem to be righteous glee, the game makes explicit note of the way the tactics the player needs to use exemplify so much about the issues with capitalism, as you're charging absurd prices for even the most mundane of objects while also paying as little as possible to the desperate people selling of their possessions only to immediately charge triple the price, all while your main character is completely embracing it to the point where her main catch phrase is \"capitalism, ho!\" The rest of the game's writing matches this really well, painting this society as something that's clearly awful in a lot of respects, but having the characters seemingly embrace it in an entirely self-aware and explicit way, which creates quite a bizarre sense of humour that I can't say I've seen attempted to such an extent before, and I love it for that alone, because it makes for a truly special experience one way or another, even if it might not be for everyone. That said though, for as entertaining as it might be to be an airhead who's perpetuating the many egregious problems in society in such a lighthearted way, the game has one clear problem that heavily brings things down. \n\nWhile the entire shopkeeping section of the game manages to cleverly tackle genre conventions while still feeling like a distinct and interesting artistic expression in its own right and I genuinely think it's an amazing time, Recettear is brought down by the adventuring sections that the player has to pursue. A prominent way in which the player is able to collect more resources to put on their shelves is by hiring a mercenary to enter dungeons and essentially play a top down, procedurally generated dungeon crawler. My issues with this aspect of the game are pretty numerous as I feel that not only is the section pretty mechanically dry, but from a thematic standpoint I feel like it kinda goes against what the rest of the game was trying to do. For an experience that seems so deadset on subverting the many tropes of this style of RPGs, this section just feels like an extremely standard take on a top down dungeon crawler, with the experience really being nothing more than making your way through bland rooms and slaying waves of enemies to get loot, with not even a hint of more self-aware snarkiness or even something as simple as a proverbial wink to the camera, instead just being an emulation of the style of other games but just, worse. It also doesn't help that even from a purely mechanical standpoint, not only is this section pretty mediocre, but it ends up clashing with the other elements of gameplay and almost always just feels like a lesser option past the first few floors. The fact that the drops you get from the treasure chests don't remove lower tier items as you climb higher up often make these sections feel unsatisfying as you exit with a bunch of stuff that feels practically worthless, but still necessary to pursue in case you do manage to score a great haul. \n\nThe crafting materials that you find throughout also don't help much due to the limited inventory space (what a surprise, me complaining about this stuff again) making you have to choose between taking more valuable items or taking ingredients to potentially craft something better, the issue being that the steep amount of these materials you generally need to make anything worthwhile ends up making this barely a choice, as it's almost always more beneficial to just take the items that are worth more than to try doing anything special with them. It all ends up becoming a game of irritation and you're just constantly throwing out items worth ever so slightly less than others to make minuscule additional profits, ultimately micromanaging in a truly unsatisfying way that also wastes time that could've just been spent getting significantly richer off of buying and reselling items in town. I ultimately just feel that this section doesn't provide sufficient reward for the time investment and risk involved, as losing an entire in-game day if you fall in battle is absolutely brutal and will impede your chances at being able to pay off weekly debts pretty significantly. Everything about the game seems to scream against touching this portion of the game at all, and yet there are too many incessant moments that push the player towards that all that I have to assume that they want you to heavily engage with it despite it being by far the worst aspect of the experience by a huge margin.\n\nOverall, Recettear is a game that is an amazingly fun romp that manages to be equal parts witty and very silly and I love so much about what it does in certain respects, particularly everything related to the shopkeeping elements on display, but I can't fully embrace it and want to engage with it beyond its main campaign due to how hard the game pushes an entirely unsatisfying aspect of itself on the player. The amount of underlying nuance that the player is expected to figure out and best capitalise on is absolutely wonderful and provides further depth to such a deceptively basic time, but even so, if you decide you want to play this, be prepared for some moments of severe tedium.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1646479501, "timestamp_updated": 1646479501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111343088": {"recommendationid": "111343088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025077116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4689, "last_played": 1475459635}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a cute little game.

It's one of the most fun games based on the concept of running an item shop out there, a rather underused premise. It remains one of the most iconic games of its kind, and is often called the gold standard for haggling mechanics and the like.\n\nBut if you've found this game and are reading this review because you're still on the fence, you probably already know all of that and it hasn't convinced you yet. So aside from the accolades what are the game's selling points?\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the mechanics are solid. They're simplistic but they work, and there is definitely room to become more skillful if you really want. Apart from one character so far whose mechanics I dislike, I feel everyone plays well in the dungeons, and the shopkeeping and haggling is fun with a surprising amount of depth once you really dig into it.\n\nI wouldn't say that's the main selling point though. For me it's the characters and vibe of the game. The soundtrack isn't particularly complex, but it's happy and upbeat without being overbearing, perfect for relaxing and enjoying yourself. The characters are cute, and usually likable (obviously this is a matter of taste, some characters I don't like are liked by others). The main story cutscenes are fine, but the optional little scenes you can find in game range from funny to genuinely cute and heartwarming.\n\nRecettear is a game that feels good to play, it's relaxing, cute, and simple enough on the surface to just boot up and unwind with, while still having enough depth to try and challenge yourself and play skillfully, particularly after you unlock New Game+ and survival mode. \n\nIs it going to be your favorite game of all time? I'd say probably not for most people. There are going to be other games that do parts of what this game does better. But is this game worth your time?

And that is unfortunate.\nYou do not have \"full control\" over your shop.\nYou get pre-determined upgrades at certain merchant level goals, and the only control you have over items is a very simple haggling system when a customer picks an item. This same mechanic works the same for people selling items and requesting items as well.\n\nOverall:\n6.5/10\nThe lack of actual features hurts this otherwise interesting game.\nBut, I would go as far to say that this game likely helped pioneer the cross genre of RPG Shop Tycoon and Adventure title.\nIs it fun?\nAbsolutely.\nBut how long it is fun is up to the individual.\n\nI recommend this title for anyone looking for a sim or tycoon style game, but also a casual pick up and play.", "timestamp_created": 1642222824, "timestamp_updated": 1642222824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014469861984253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107975581": {"recommendationid": "107975581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024994537", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1216, "last_played": 1643012302}, "language": "english", "review": "I now know why this is the \"gold standard\" for item shop games.

The characters are cute and have distinct personalities (and playstyles during dungeons) and while you don't get all the details you can figure out a lot of interesting tidbits of their backstories from the various events in the game. \n\nCapitalism Ho!", "timestamp_created": 1624746499, "timestamp_updated": 1624746499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94429059": {"recommendationid": "94429059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016539146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 5404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5391, "last_played": 1653385493}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely lovely.", "timestamp_created": 1624727838, "timestamp_updated": 1624727838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94391647": {"recommendationid": "94391647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025339708", "num_games_owned": 871, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1624756855}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Capitalism, ho![/h1]\n", "timestamp_created": 1624690924, "timestamp_updated": 1624690979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579430818557739258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94384119": {"recommendationid": "94384119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054949718", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1248, "last_played": 1622128368}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Capitalism.. good?[/h1]\nRecettear is a \"first of its kind\" type of game, though I have no doubts there were shopkeeper titles before it.\nThe controls can be a little weird at first, but the overall polish helps immensely with easing into muscle memory. You won't have to juggle a keyboard's worth of binds, and it's very comfortably played with a controller.\n\nIn short, Recettear is about running a shop, and running that shop is actually pretty fun!\n\n[b]What about the Negative Reviews?[/b]\n[i]Sometimes you'll get a few saltines who essentially dropped themselves into a two-foot hole and blame the developers for letting them discard their shovel.[/i]\n\n[i]\"The dungeon is necessary to progress! I lose the game without it!\"[/i]\n[b]Not true.[/b] It's completely possible - hell, I recommend - to beat the game without ever touching the dungeon; and this is especially prudent when concerning the Challenge Mode. The name of the game is Aggressive Capitalism, my friends. Certain customers are willing to pay more for your product, it's about trial-and-error to see how far they're willing to go!\n\n[i]\"Very simple short game.\"[/i]\n[b]He says at 26 hours.[/b] Your average playthrough, once you're familiar with the game, can be banged out in a night or two. Going for NG+/Challenge can tack on another ten - you'd average at around 30 hours. If you want to be reductionist and purely go for dollar:hour, Recettear often goes on 50-80% sales, and it's a steal!\n\n[i]\"Moonlighter is better.\"[/i]\n[b]That's your opinion![/b] [i](and your opinion is trash)[/i]\nIn all seriousness, when compared 1:1, Moonlighter's focus is more on the (still pretty dry) combat rather than the shop. You don't deal with customers face-to-face, and it removes a lot of the charm of being a shopkeeper if you're serving items through glorified vending machines (which is also something you can do, optionally, in Recettear)!\n\n[b]Brief Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Great translation work on the dialogue, and a fair few funny antics through the story\n[*]A Sale-Chain mechanic that rewards keen customer service with quick levels and glorious feedback\n[*]\"Just deep enough\" progression/unlocks, with a New Game+ and Challenge Run mode\n[*]Meaningful (though limited) shop customization (themeing your shop draws in specific groups of customers)\n[*]Plenty of shop item variety\n[*]The dungeon is [i]not necessary to progress[/i] and can safely be ignored!\n[/list]\n\n[b]Brief Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Dungeon gameplay is extremely boring; a basic hack-n-slash that never gets better\n[*]Little Girls are the worst customer type by design\n[/list]\n\nI find myself returning a few times a year to play through again, and I'm sure many others share the sentiment. There's just something about the satisfying feedback loop from running the shop that really scratches that micromanagement itch, without breaking out a game that requires you to read a few pages from NASA's handbook first.\n\nAlways recommend Recettear over Moonlighter, no contest.", "timestamp_created": 1624681389, "timestamp_updated": 1624681978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646814465522766113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94252851": {"recommendationid": "94252851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107665662", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1252, "last_played": 1624511029}, "language": "english", "review": "I've spent too much time playing this game. xD It's really fun, but has a pretty steep difficulty spike early on that after quite a bit of playing I still can't seem to surpass. lol Take that to mean what you will.", "timestamp_created": 1624511150, "timestamp_updated": 1624511150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94225759": {"recommendationid": "94225759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006284332", "num_games_owned": 1389, "num_reviews": 189, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1627119415}, "language": "english", "review": "Capitalism, ho!", "timestamp_created": 1624465450, "timestamp_updated": 1624465450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474474459886550903", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94091832": {"recommendationid": "94091832", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998739387", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2653, "last_played": 1624239710}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a perfect game but an interesting experience.

What WORKS about this game?\n    * The protagonist, Recette, is endearingly upbeat and innocent despite the cutthroat implications of it capitalist theme.\n    * While the world-building is a bit of a mish-mash of fantasy, there are a lot of dialogue scenes that develop the various characters the protagonist meets, including Recette and Tear, the fairy business coach/loan shark who gives her advice on running the shop.\n   * There are challenges in the dungeon delving and in the running of the shop, provided that you don't spend a lot of time looking up guides on how to win.  \n   * Players get to make wide variety of choices that impact their playthrough, including which characters to level up via dungeon-scumming, how to decorate the shop, and when to expand its size to sell more stuff.\n   * The UI is well designed and the you can rebind the keys you use for controls.\n   * There is a lot of heart here.  While Recette says \"Capitalism, ho!\" a lot, you really benefit from NOT fleecing your customers every chance you get.  Knowing their pricing \"sweet spot\" (which inches up as you sell more stuff to them without haggling) is one of the keys to advancing the plot and finding out more about the various people who potentially work with you.  So the charm of this game isn't just about appearances and what's in the speech bubbles, it's thoroughly mixed into the mechanics of the game.  \n\nAs for the downsides, Recettear is not a highly tactical game.  The special powers that the adventurers you find to help you get into the grime of killing monsters are not super different from one another.  There are no ways to combine powers or to craft items to make them unusually effective versus certain boss baddies, since damage is damage is damage in this game.  It can feel repetitive as you go through the same dungeon several times just to get that one rare item that one of your customers REALLY wants.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, the sound and graphics of this game are nothing particularly special.  If Mega SFX or deep combat combos are what you are looking for here, you won't find them.  I should also mention that there is no romance or hentai elements here, for those gamers who have become accustomed to the hentai sub-genre of RPGs.  (And thank goodness for that.)\n\nFor a light action RPG with buy-and-sell at its chewy center, Recettear delivers an imperfect but delicious balance of key flavors for your gaming palate, if that is what you want.", "timestamp_created": 1623545892, "timestamp_updated": 1623545892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724099040031433105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93399232": {"recommendationid": "93399232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041371055", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 521, "last_played": 1623216990}, "language": "english", "review": "legendary game", "timestamp_created": 1623144257, "timestamp_updated": 1623144257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462975174188613892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93296399": {"recommendationid": "93296399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008968667", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 1497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1623240069}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it, While the cutesy graphics are not quite my style the game is good quality, it's grindy but what do you expect?

You often get announcements proclaiming when an item or category is having a price increase or decrease. With that information, you either buy an abundance of the item or category for future sales or sell the items for an exorbitant markup. Sometimes an announcement will inform you of a potential boom which, if the right conditions are met, will result in a ton of sales in a single period. You can even cause a crash in the market for an item if you sell too much of it in a short amount of time. Indeed, there are plenty of intricacies in the free market you would never encounter in one of those backward command economies.\n\nBesides the item shop, the other main component of the game is the dungeon crawling experience you receive from the Adventurer\u2019s Guild. Throughout the game, Recette will acquire the business cards for various adventurers; you will require one to enter the dungeons. Every dungeon will have multiple floors with a different layout every time you enter it. Each floor is populated with chests, enemies, and a single exit you need to find, with every fifth floor involving a boss fight. The combat is rather generic and the enemies aren\u2019t challenging to go against either, not to mention that it is a chore to trudge throughout the floor to find that one exit. Still, the boss fights are a fun break from the monotony of the dungeons and there exists story events and characters you have to go on an adventure to find.\n\nThe primary reason to go to the dungeons outside of story-related events is for the drops monsters provide. While you could sell these drops on their own, they can be kept to be used as fusion material. Fusion items include food, equipment, consumables, and decoration. While most of them are generally profitable to sell, the rest, especially equipment, can be worthwhile to keep and use for yourself. Fusing items tend to be a late-game activity, especially since fusion ranks are unlocked as leveling rewards, but the items you get are unique to the mechanic and can be the best equipment to get in the game.\n\nOutside of the shop and dungeons, you are able to travel to other parts of the city of Pensee like the Chapel and Town Square just to see events. They don\u2019t do anything gameplay-wise, but the interactions between different characters are joyful scenes to watch as they become more like story characters than just walking piggy banks. Of note are the scenes between Recette and Tear as they become more than just partners but also friends. Sometimes these events will provide bits of information about the world, sometimes they are there for pure comedic effects. I just like seeing them since it\u2019s kind of like playing through segments of a visual novel.\n\nIn overall conclusion, this game does not only packed with content and personality that challenges you to comb through dungeons and a spend-crazy customer base on a quest for profits. I love how the game made you dive into the dungeons with the adventurers rather than you sit and wait for your adventurers to come back behind the counter table.

Many people recommended Recettear instead, saying it was the original that got it right.  Everything Moonlighter lacked (variety, depth, story, fun characters) Recettear certainly had, such that I don't think I critiqued Moonlighter hard enough for being such a bad game. \n\nRecettear is a fun whimsical game that captures a the experience in a fun but challenging way.  It's definitely worth the buy, especially when on sale.  It has great characters, and a good story, and it's not easy and dull like Moonlighter is. \n\nThat said, there are some serious flaws with it still.  There's essentially no explanation of man of the market dynamics, but that doesn't really interfere with the gameplay.  My bigger complaint is that it was really hard to unlock all the characters/dungeons.  I played it blind at first, and couldn't get the next dungeon after Amber Garden, and never unlocked Elan. I then looked up how to unlock them specifically unlock these two, and tried putting candy, etc. but Elan never came, and Louie never unlocked the next dungeon.  This made playing a huge chore - I had to replay Amber Garden a mllion times, making it almost as dull as Moonlighter, and never got all the characters.  It left a bit of a sour taste and I stopped playing because of it.  \n\nOverall a good game, but still some flaws.

Beat it in 15.4 hours (after three tries) using a game controller.  Difficulty is medium.\n\nGameplay - There are two parts to the over all gameplay: the first being selling items at the shop and the second being the dungeon.  Figuring out the controls isn't too hard for either, except for the obscurity of where the menu button is (it's esc on the keyboard, and ended up being Left Bumper on the controller.)  You need the menu to access the calendar and save and they aren't straightforward in game about where exactly the menu is except that it exists.  So there you go.\n\n- The Shoppe: This is where you will spend most of the game.  Tear will hold your hand explaining everything, but once you get the jist it's smooth sailing.  Sell high, buy low.  Take and fulfill orders.  The more you level up as a merchant, the more you can change how the shop looks, how many items you can sell, and from there how many people will buy things from you.  It gets a little same-same with the actual selling, but it's so charming and peaceful I sorta zoned out and enjoyed it the entire time.  There's a time limit per day of what you can do, so if you run out to town to buy stock or enjoy little cutscenes for the characters or gallivant off in the dungeon, you have less time to sell in the shop.  \n\n- The Dungeon: This is where you go to collect rarer items and find treasures to sell. You can use the monster drops in town to fuse new items, which of course can be sold for more.  Most of the monsters can be jobbed easily enough, with a boss every five levels that may or may not keep you on your toes, and there are special scenes in the dungeons to uncover.  But for the most part the monsters don't drop good stuff enough (if they drop anything at all), you can only carry 20 items a jaunt, and while most treasures will help you early on they're mostly next to worthless once you get past a certain time in-game.  The boss battles were entertaining, though. \n \nCharacters Part 1 - All the main characters are cute and memorable.  They all have cute scenes throughout the play through that you can uncover.  Recette is adorbz and Tear is hilarious.  \n\nCharacters Part 2 - A few of the characters you meet will eventually give you a card that will let you use them in the dungeon.  Each has strength and weaknesses, but for my first full play through I didn't feel all that compelled to try them more than once with the crushing deadlines looming over the shoppe.  I also didn't get all the charries unlocked on my first playthrough.\n\nVariety - This is where the game slacks off.  There's enough variety to fully enjoy it the first maybe five hours.  After that, it starts to drag.  There are only around five npcs (not including friends you make) that shop at the store with their own selling quirks and limits.  You hit midway into the dungeons and the enemies recycle with and without different color combos, but with the same attacks.  The dungeons have different floor designs, with randomized layouts, but it comes down to the same plan of 'move around fighting the same monsters until finding the next door'.  \n\nHomelessness - If you can't pay off the debt you're homeless and have to start over with the knowledge and items you collected.  Sadly Tear will explain how the game works all over again, and you'll have to experience the same cutscenes and meet the same characters, unlock the same dungeons, etc.  Thankfully if you hit esc on the keyboard you can skip these scenes.  Wish this was handled differently.  A few of my friends gave up after being homeless X times, and I can understand why.  Thankfully the full game, itself, is short (guesstimating 5-6 hours total).  \n\nPost game/replayability! - There's a post game if you beat it.  In it you'll get multiple options of future playthroughts, from a debt survival mode to an endless no-debt mode where you can focus on collecting all the characters, to more!  So if you like it, there's more ways to enjoy it for later on.  \n\n\n\nIn summary, Recettear is a cute, often funny, chillax merchant game where you work to pay off debt and avoid foreclosure on your humble little shop.  It's niche and has many adorable quirks I fully enjoyed.  I'll probably pick it up and play again in the future.  Where it shines there's also a bit of repetitiveness to deal with that may turn some away after playing for so long.

I've seen a lot of people got into this game from his review, and I can see why.  This game is a masterpiece.  \n\nThe story of a young girl named Recette Lemongrass.  She's not the brightest bulb in the pack, but she's optimistic and willing to take on new challenges in life.  A fairy loan shark named Tear visits Recette and informs her that her father had built up quite a large sum of debt, and since he's missing, it's up to Recette to pay up.\n\nRecette and Tear decide to open up an item shop called \"Recettear\", which is obviously a combination of Recette's and Tear's names, where they sell to adventurers and townsfolk.  The inventory ranges from weapons, armor, and accessories, to food, treasures, and item drops from monsters.  Over the course of a month, Recette has to pay a certain amount back the debt to the Terme Finance Company, where Tear is employed.  This amount will increase as you get further into the story and you pay off the debt.  If something happens that you don't pay off the debt, Recette will lose her house and everything she owns, and she'll get kicked out onto the street doing God knows what.\n\nAs for selling items, you acquire items in a few ways.  You can spend your hard earned money at the Merchant's Guild, where they sell mainly weapons and equipment.  The Market is where you can buy foodstuffs, books, scarves, and treasures.  Then there's the randomly generated dungeons.  Obviously, someone of Recette's character can't fight her way out of a paper sack, so she hires an adventurer to fight in her stead while she follows him/her around as they progress through the dungeons.  As for selling items, a customer will approach you and you have to haggle the price that the customer pays.  Usually it's around 100%-120% of market value, give or take.  After your first successful payment, you'll eventually get bulletins where certain items will increase or decrease in price for a certain amount of time.  These bulletins will happen at random, so there's no way to predict these.\n\nGoing back to the dungeons, you're given an adventurer named Louie.  He's a capable fighter with a sword and shield, and he's willing to throw his life away for you because he also needs money.  You'll run into new adventurers as you progress, and each will come with their strengths, weaknesses, and unique abilities.  Your first dungeon will have five levels, and you can find treasure at the end.  Simple enough, but your next dungeons will have you fight in boss battles and gauntlets.  These battles will happen usually at every five levels you progress in a dungeon, and there's even some spots where you don't have to battle anything, just grab the treasure and leave through the door.  These spots will also be the only way you can leave the dungeon and have all your items you've collected.  Keep in mind that you have limited slots for your spoils, so choose what to take with you wisely.  And if you lose all your health while in the dungeon, you'll lose most of the items you've collected, but you can take two items of your choice with you, but it's more useful to not get killed.\n\nWith all this, you work day-by-day.  Time is split into quarters: morning, afternoon, evening, and night.  What task you do will take up one quarter.  The only exception is when going into the dungeons with your chosen adventurer, which takes up two quarters.  Going out of your shop and into town will take up a quarter, for example.\n\nRecettear isn't a hard game, but there's plenty of stuff coming out of left field to keep you guessing.  It's a matter of building up your wealth and paying to keep you in your house and your job.  I'd say that for the most part, the dungeons are pretty simple, since you have a button for attack, abilities, and an ability selector.  The main story isn't terribly long, as to fully pay your debt takes a month in-game, which isn't bad.  And if you do beat the main story mode, there's plenty of post-game content.  You'll unlock New Game +, Survival Mode, and Endless Mode.  New Game + lets you keep most of your unlocked content, but you have to repay the debt again.  Survival Mode is like the main story, but you have to pay off the ever increasing debt until you can no longer sustain your shop.  Endless mode lets you go on with your business with no pressure from the loan shark.  There is some more story to be had in Endless mode, so there's still some loose ends with the narrative.  You also have an entire item encyclopedia where you can fill it out with all the items in the game.  With all this, Recettear offers an impressive amount of replay value.\n\nOutside of the gameplay mechanics, the characters are very likable.  Recette is a great main character who takes the job of running Recettear head on, and her relationship with Tear becomes less business and more of a sisterly bond that works together to keep the business going.  She comes off as kind of a ditz, but she has her heart in the right place.  Tear is much more serious and is generally more focused on the task at hand.  She serves as foil for Recette's more lighthearted nature.  The rest of the cast is also really good.  I think what really makes me enjoy the characters is the dialogue.  There's some amusing interactions between the characters in Recettear.  My personal favorite character being Charme, who drinks more than a goldfish at the Pub.  \n\nOverall, I really enjoy Recettear very much.  It's a charming game that's got a lot going for it.  I kind of wish there was a sequel to the game, but for what we have here, it's great.  The characters are memorable, the amount of items you can sell are varied and plentiful at just the right amount, the dungeon crawling is a bit on the easy side, but still really good.  I can't really think of any negatives about the game.  This is a game I can't help but vehemently recommend.  It even runs on my dinky laptop with potato level specs, so you don't need a powerful machine to enjoy Recettear.  The usual $20 price point is fine, but I think I got it on sale some time ago.  Still, I think Recettear is a classic.  \n\nLastly, I just gotta thank EasyGameStation for creating this game, and Sseth for his review in my decision to buy Recettear.  Unabashedly recommended.  CAPITALISM, HO!\n\nNOTE: Watch out for a character named Euria in the game.

It came about at a time when I was into shopkeeping games, and I was looking for something with a little more meat to it. Recettear came recommended and I took the plunge and made my first ever Steam purchase.\n\nIn Recettear you play the role of a charming young girl named Recette as she is thrust into the role of a shopkeeper to pay off her missing father's debt. She is joined by Tear, a \"loan shark\" fairy, who manages the finances and teaches the biz to our young entrepreneur. Lacking a name for the new shop, Recette picks the name Recettear and a new shop is born.\n\nThe game does a good job guiding you on what needs to be done, and so I won't go into too much detail. The game is split into two distinct sections. During the shopkeep section, you place your wares on the shop floor and when the shop is opened, customers come in and make offers to buy the items. You may then make a counter-offer, and if the customer is not satisfied, they will make yet another counter. This repeats until the customer is satisfied or they become offended and storm off. Different customers have different budgets and tastes, and as the game goes on, you will unlock new features to tinker with.\n\nDungeon exploration involves hiring a single adventurer who you command to run through a series of realtime roguelike dungeons. Every 5th floor resides a boss and defeating the boss will open up an exit to allow you to either continue on (to conserve time slices) or to return to shop with all the goodies you procured. Ordinarily I enjoy dungeon crawls, but for whatever reason I didn't find the dungeon aspect all too fun. Thankfully it is possible to beat the game without going through the non-forced dungeons.\n\nThe graphics in Recettear are bright and colorful and suit the game well, catering to the young crowd. The music is fitting as well, being upbeat pretty much all of the time. I did not encounter any crashes or bugs so that's always good.\n\nI rate Recettear a C. The whole process of haggling and dungeoneering both ended up being more repetitive than I bargained for, and multiple times I found myself taking long breaks because my interest kept wandering off, which contributed to the unusual amount of time it took for me to get around to beating it. While the game has a story, it didn't really do a whole lot of character development and there were some mysteries that seemed to be unresolved by the end. The game has some good ideas, I just want a more engaging package to keep it entertaining.\n\nEDIT: Fixed small mistakes", "timestamp_created": 1614112521, "timestamp_updated": 1614116909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677072644233703613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87266715": {"recommendationid": "87266715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091716996", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1599448463}, "language": "english", "review": "stock market crash", "timestamp_created": 1614053638, "timestamp_updated": 1614053638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87018432": {"recommendationid": "87018432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080519064", "num_games_owned": 582, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 789, "last_played": 1622170398}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would not pay my debt again", "timestamp_created": 1613733556, "timestamp_updated": 1613733556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86974930": {"recommendationid": "86974930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198908998460", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1349, "last_played": 1625676533}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like making a lot if money in a game go a head", "timestamp_created": 1613675176, "timestamp_updated": 1613675176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86972129": {"recommendationid": "86972129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050101666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1579, "last_played": 1613531093}, "language": "english", "review": "Very simple short game.

The main concept of the game is basically buying items for cheap and then selling them for a higher price to rake in profits. It seems really simple and easy, which it is but as you progress through the game and the story you can expand your shop, get access to more items throughout the town and the dungeon and much more.\n\nThere is essentially 2 parts to the main game and main story. The shop managing part where you go around town buying items for the lowest price you can and selling them at your shop to get as much money for them as possible. But then there is also a dungeon you can go into with a selected adventurer of your choice. The gameplay in the dungeon is very similar to a dungeoncrawler or rogue like game. There are multiple floors and levels all with their own unique enemies and treasures to be found. At the end of each particular area there is usually a boss fight at the end too and I got a lot of enjoyment out of beating each specific dungeon area in the game. And this part also helped the shop management part from getting to stale and overplayed because there was a dungeon to explore as well.\n\nEven after you finish paying off your debt, which could take a couple of tries depending on how you go about doing it. There are still other game modes you can play afterwards such as endless mode and newgame+ You could also try and unlock the rest of the playable characters you can use in the dungeon as there is definitely a lot more than you think available to use and play, to add onto to that feature they even interact at your shop and will sell and buy items from you. \n\nAll in all the game goes on sale quite often so I would definitely recommend you pick this up and give it a try!

I will just say it is just as good as I remember it.\n\nThe game is very charming and the core loop is very fun... for a while. There isn't any variation really after the first week just bigger numbers and new clients. That is cool and all, but I wished something could really shake things up.\n\nI find the dungeon crawling to be my favourite part of the game. There are a lot of very interesting and different heroes to hire, each with a different play style. I like the more rhythmic feel to the combat, ei: you need to actually time your button presses to be any good. But then again you need to do so much dungeon crawling that it too can become boring. The cheer number of drops you need to farm to craft anything is ridiculous especially at the later crafting levels. This is why I haven't gotten close to 100% in this game. I stopped playing at the point I beat the main game and then unlocked the final dungeon which just has too many floors.\n\nAnother thing I like about the game is all the little town exploring events that are all great for the story and one of the main reasons I actually finished this game. And don't worry, you can't miss an event... well to re-phrase it, just because an event could have happened and you didn't go to it, doesn't mean the event is gone. The next time you go to that area at that time you will see the event you missed.\n\nScore Breakdown:\n\nGraphics: 9/10, these are incredibly charming graphics that look just as good as ever.\n\nSound: 7/10, the music is rather nice, however I find it can be a bit repetitive.\n\nGameplay: 8/10, as I said before, the basics were really good, it just never really went anywhere.\n\nDifficulty: This one is a mixed bag. It is very likely that you will fail the deadline, however doing so sends you back to day one with all your level, adventurers, and equipment all still there. This means it is impossible to truly \"fail\" and you will at some point on your savefile beat the game. On the contrary, if you don't want to easy way out and want to first cycle the game... I have bad news for you, unless you love min-maxing and are able to quickly find the most effective use of your days (or just watch/read a guide), you are going to really struggle.\n\nRequirements: I dare you to find a PC made in the last 4 decades that couldn't run this game.\n\nAll in all I give this game a score of 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1608077067, "timestamp_updated": 1608077067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82457718": {"recommendationid": "82457718", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973790305", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1608070182}, "language": "english", "review": "If I hadn't already played Moonlighter, i would like this game more.

The capitalizers, and the capitalizees. And then there\u2019s the socialists, but they\u2019re irrelevant to our American history. Recettear is a game that allows you to experience the joys of screwing people over with immorally-priced goods. You play as Recette, a little girl accompanied by a fairy named Tear\u2014can you guess where the shop name came from? As you can infer from the title, the game revolves you running an item shop and managing the sales and stocks of your store throughout the whole day. It may sound mundane, but through the power of anime, they managed to make Recettear a very fun game to play.\n\nGoing through the introduction, you\u2019ll swiftly discover that you\u2019re in a whole lot of debt thanks to your vanishing father. It\u2019s a huge debt, but rest assured; Tear\u2019s got your back. Every week, you need to pay off a progressively increasing portion of your debt, and you will by buying low and selling high. At the start, you don\u2019t have much capital on you, so head down to the Market and Merchant\u2019s Guild to buy some starting merchandise. Head back to Recettear and put your new products on the shelves. When you\u2019re ready to start the work day, flip on the open sign and let the customers flow forth.\n\nEach customer, be it a little girl or an old man, will have their own range of how much they\u2019re willing to buy or even sell an item. A big portion of the game revolves around you trying to figure out how much to sell an item for to a specific character. Perhaps in one deal, a man will agree to purchase something for 120% of the price. If you try 130% in another deal, he will attempt to bargain the price down. And perhaps if you tried to sell the item at 140%, he will outright refuse the deal. There is a specific cutoff percentage for every patron where they will always be guaranteed to purchase without hassle, and it\u2019s your job to figure out what that percentage is (hopefully without looking it up).\n\nAnd it pays to find that sweet spot as every successful transaction results in merchant experience. When you successfully haggle at that sweet spot, you get a bonus to that merchant experience that can be chained to create a combo giving even more experience. The merchant experience will increase your merchant level which unlocks new features and mechanics for you to discover. In addition, getting that bonus will net a significant gain to customer reputation. There are a few benefits to increasing customer reputation, but the primary one is that their spending budget increases when it is leveled, meaning that the little girl who couldn\u2019t afford a cherry now has the expenditure to do so.

This doesn't change the fact the game is charming and can be fun. Recettear's biggest appeal is its so different and unusual it offers a completely new experience you've likely never had. This is helped along by the fact Recettear's concept is simple and functional. Everything about this game feels like a throwback to the PS2 era so much so I'm surprised it isn't a port. This includes Japanese developers willingness to take risks making unusual, experimental games like Recettear.\n\nI\"d actually say Recettear is worth picking up at full price. But if you like to stretch your dollar; it goes for $4 or $5 during Steam's big seasonal sales. Its totally worth it.\n\nThe weakest thing about Recettear is the dungeon. Its easy to misunderstand the dungeon's purpose thinking the point is to plunder treasure chests. Yes, you can do that. But the dungeon is really meant for collecting materials to fuse better, more valuable items to sell. The dungeon is also rather simple, crude, and not that difficult. Its not bad by any means, but it can be boring.\n\nAlso, if you have trouble with the shop aspect of Recettear, the basic philosophy you want to follow is every transaction is successful 1st try. A string of successful trades makes shop XP go up faster to access shop improvements.\n\nthis is kind of a cheat sheet, but the following people tend to always buy at the following %'s:\nlittle girl: 110%\nold man + woman: 115%\nman: 120%\nmale shopkeep: 125%\n\nlastly: sorry ssethtzeentach.

"playtime_at_review": 1848, "last_played": 1596355109}, "language": "english", "review": "I will recommend this game, but not wholeheartedly. There are a lot of things I absolutely adore about Reccetear, but it's difficult to wave away the numerous glaring flaws that almost made me hate it.\n\nThe sales process is poorly explained and tedious. I wound up having to look up details on a wiki to fill in the gaps left by Tear's awful explanation of sales mechanics. The 120-130 pricing rule was not the catch-all I was lead to believe, and it wound up creating a lot of confusion for me when it didn't work consistently. There's also NO EXPLANATION of how 'just combos' work and how easy it is to miss these when following utilizing the haggle strategy suggested by Tear.\n\nIt's also very difficult to play this game without taking notes and frequently updating them since there's no way to track your reputation gains for various characters (this could be easily fixed by displaying hearts during transactions). I also find it frustrating that I have to memorize a percentage for the normal, high, and low categories for both buying and selling. I appreciate that the devs wanted to make the sales process more complex, but there aren't enough in-game information tools to compliment this.\n\n\nWhile the story isn't anything grand, it was quite pleasant overall. I appreciate the amount of love and care that went into the character writing, and this is equally matched by the translation. While none of the characters are particularly deep or complex, they still have a lot of charm and are filled to the brim with personality. There wasn't a single moment where I felt the need to skip over any of the dialogue; the interactions were precious to me. I was especially fond of Recette's optimism and determination (and she's just downright hilarious at times).\n\n\nThe combat is sort of a mixed bag for me. The mechanics do have a fair degree of thought put into them, so it's not all bad. Slow animations for the critical hits make it so much fun to land them, and I appreciate how well the specials are balanced. And even though it can get a little repetitive at times, I think it's both endearing and helpful when Recette reacts to your hero taking damage. The enemy variety is nice, and never feels like the game throws too many new creatures at you. \n\nThat said, there are some monsters with seriously annoying mechanics, so that kinda detracts from the experience. No matter how much I fight the same monster, I can never control for the mechanics that contribute to my frustration (like the ghosts disappearing after ONE HIT and the blasted flying pumpkin heads). I understand the need to make the game challenging and whatever, but there needs to be some kind of combat advantage that eases the player into fighting these guys as time goes on.\n\nAlso, whose idea was it to have floors with double defense power? That's just wrong...\n\nThe dungeon navigation is also kinda meh. Sometimes I feel really frustrated whenever I have to navigate an expansive floor since the incentivizes you to hunt down treasure chests since they contain loot that you won't find anywhere else. That leads to lots and lots and lots of running to cover all of the terrain (and no consistent boosts to run speed).\n\nLastly, the mod support isn't there. Not sure why, but modding isn't a thing in this game, and it should be. If I could at least get a QoL mod to address most of the flaws I've written about, I might even be inclined to play this game to completion. But it's not, so I won't. Damn shame, too.\n\nI won't recommend buying this game for more than $10.

Sell high, buy low; capitalism ho, that's what you are.\n\nThe game's meat is built around time and resource management. Your success is measured on how well you have utilized the time segments in a day. In other words, you had better earn some money in every segment or you're going to be moving in a cardboard box. I've been through that scenario, it is not fun.\n\nWhat makes this harder is the absolute, destitute bums that enter your store. You've worked hard for an item your inventory and some moronic kid on an errand is trying to scam it off you for 20% the market price. God forbid if you cannot meet their demand on your second offer; there goes your customer and your chance of raising your merchant level. Not that you had any hope to begin with; that gutter trash's wallet has never seen money.\n\nThe game is very enthralling and intense. I have been reduced to screaming, \"Get out of my store\" at my monitor, after the third customer asking for a bowl of beef soup has refused to buy it for 80% of its market price, then having some old alcoholic try to sell me his worthless, moldy candy apple to \"help with his pension.\" This is a store, people. Please have some money ready before you enter it, I am trying to run a business, and my loan shark fairy has no qualms over kicking me to the curb if I fail to deliver so much as a cent of my weekly payments.\n\nPersonally, I would wholeheartedly love this game if it wasn't for the dungeons. Dungeons are the meat and potatoes of acquiring (proper) inventory through the fusion system. Let me explain: Dungeons contain critters that drop ingredients that cannot be bought or traded upon their demise. You use these ingredients to manufacture items that are valuable, powerful, and unobtainable through any other means. Can you skip the dungeons? If you do not know how to abuse the market system, no. The player is forced to run through the same corridors with a limited inventory, hoping to get something that allows them to live for another week. \n\nThe dungeon grind is tedious and boring, not difficult or challenging in any other way. You can have some podcast running in the backround, while you press the movement keys and attack key to slog through the video game equivalent of a work day at the office cubicle. Why is there not an \"autocrawl\" -option? This portion of the game would at least be tolerable, if it were something like Darkest Dungeon's way of handling it.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 7/10. The story and merchant simulation is fun. To get to the fun, you need to work through the molasses slog of the dungeons.", "timestamp_created": 1594663965, "timestamp_updated": 1594663965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72630604": {"recommendationid": "72630604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091875384", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 535, "last_played": 1562563631}, "language": "english", "review": "Moonlighter is a top-down action rpg, where you play as the owner of a store named Moonlighter, whom has a dream to be a hero.

Esto supone un giro en el cl\u00e1sico Dungeon Crawler, siendo nosotros los aventureros a la par que los due\u00f1os de la tienda de items.\n\nEl juego se basa en las cl\u00e1sicas mec\u00e1nicas de comercio; compro barato, vendo caro. Esto encaja con las fluctuaciones de mercado que se nos presentan cada d\u00eda e incluso a mediados del mismo de manera aleatoria, oblig\u00e1ndonos a replanificar nuestra gesti\u00f3n del tiempo y los art\u00edculos en exposici\u00f3n. Estas fluctuaciones afectan much\u00edsimo a la hora de regatear con los clientes, porque vender un art\u00edculo al 100% de su precio es inaceptable si el viejo de turno quiere la espada de moda para su nieto y se la podemos colar a un 250%. De todos modos no debemos excedernos a la hora de regatear, puesto que nos interesa mantener un combo de transacciones inmediatamente exitosas para obtener una bonificaci\u00f3n de experiencia de incluso m\u00e1s de x10 en cada transacci\u00f3n. Esta experiencia de mercader permite el acceso a m\u00e1s objetos, m\u00e1s oportunidades de regatear, ampliaciones de tienda... al fin y al cabo, complica el juego a la vez que nos da acceso a mayores m\u00e1rgenes de beneficio si somos capaces de aprovechar cada nuevo elemento que se incorpora.\n\nEn Recettear el d\u00eda se divide en 4 etapas de tiempo:\n\n[list]\n[*]Abrir la tienda consume una etapa y es la principal forma de obtener dinero. Si no obtenemos una meta establecida al final de cada semana, ser\u00e1 el fin de la partida, y deberemos empezar de nuevo, arrastrando principalmente nuestro nivel de mercader, que como he dicho anteriormente enriquece mucho la experiencia y hace menos pesado este proceso dado que nuestros m\u00e1rgenes de beneficio son mucho mayores que la vez anterior y las metas son m\u00e1s f\u00e1ciles de cumplir por este motivo.\n[*]Ir al pueblo consume una etapa y es la manera de reabastecer el inventario de nuestro comercio. Conviene comprar art\u00edculos con baja demanda porque son m\u00e1s baratos, pero debemos tener de todo en caso de que un cliente lo pida para no romper nuestro combo de transacciones. En el pueblo podemos participar en conversaciones que desarrollan peque\u00f1as subtramas entre los personajes que iremos conociendo durante la aventura; nada serio, pero s\u00ed un toque encantador si te gustan este tipo de cosas. Desde el pueblo tambi\u00e9n podemos salir de aventura\n[*]Salir de aventura consume dos etapas de tiempo y es la parte Dungeon Crawler de Recettear. Sinceramente, ha envejecido mal. Esto no quita que sea entretenido para librarnos de la rutina del capitalismo y obtener art\u00edculos para la tienda pr\u00e1cticamente a coste cero. Esta mec\u00e1nica tiene varios puntos limitantes con el fin de balancear el juego; solo podemos llevarnos veinte art\u00edculos, algunos de los cuales ser\u00e1n un misterio hasta que abandonemos la mazmorra. Si da la casualidad de que morimos, solo podremos llevarnos uno de los veinte. Los controles y en general el flujo de este apartado son toscos, m\u00e1s a\u00fan de lo que cabe esperar en un juego de diez a\u00f1os, pero esto no merma la experiencia en general puesto que es algo casi opcional y anecd\u00f3tico si lo que nos interesa es puramente el comercio. \n[/list]\n\nUna de las mec\u00e1nicas m\u00e1s curiosas reside en los personajes que van con nosotros de aventura. Los iremos conociendo poco a poco y se nos ir\u00e1n uniendo, pero todos tienen un equipo bastante cutre en primer lugar. Si bien podemos prestarles el equipo, eso supone menos ranuras de inventario que las ya escasas veinte, y si somos derrotados perderemos la mayor\u00eda del equipo al solo poder salvar un art\u00edculo. Pero estos aventureros a veces vienen a la tienda, lo cual nos ofrece una vuelta de tuerca sobre la gesti\u00f3n de equipo: Si mi aventurero espadach\u00edn viene buscando \"un arma\", le ofrecer\u00e9 mi mejor espada y le har\u00e9 incluso un descuento. Si un aventurero viene buscando equipo y podemos darle algo que sea adecuado para \u00e9l, se lo equipar\u00e1, obteniendo una mejora sustancial en nuestras aventuras posteriores.\n\nCabe destacar que este juego no est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol. No necesitas una gran cantidad de vocabulario para entender qu\u00e9 quieren los clientes, pero tampoco deber\u00edas ser completamente agn\u00f3stico al ingl\u00e9s (o japon\u00e9s) si quieres disfrutarlo un m\u00ednimo.\n\nRecettear es un juego corto y encantador que ofrece much\u00edsimo.

Laugh, rinse and repeat[/u]\n\nJokes aside, under the guise of cutesy graphics and dialogues, Recettear perfectly encapsulates the many nuances of capitalism and it manages to make the theme appealing even to those people who don't know a damn thing about economics. For those who don't like the premise of managing your own shop, I can definitely assure you that you'll get addicted to this in no time anyway... Actually, it will consume you, and there's no turning back.\n\nThat's not to say it is all about buying and selling, or about keeping an eye out on how the market fluctuates every single day. It doesn't revolve around chitchats with the people in town either. This mundane life can become adventurous quite quickly, with a genre-shifting mechanic: you have the option (but not the obligation) to unlock and recruit mercenaries in order to overcome various dungeons... This way, the items you get can be sold at 100% profit!\n\nAnyhow; I could write a lot about this title, but I want you to explore it yourself. All I can say is that I really didn't see any weak point whatsoever, it is truly a labour of love and as such, I highly recommend it.\n\n[code][b]Did you find this review helpful?

Teaming up with adventurers and killing monsters for item drops is fun and rewarding.\n\nA simple game with some funny moments, it is quite easy to complete as long as you don't spend too much money.\n\nYou play Recette Lemongrass, a young girl who is forced to run the item shop attached to her house in order to pay back a loan her father had taken before disappearing. Your partner in this venture is Tear, a fairy who works as a loan broker and responsible for collecting your repayments.\n\nDuring the game, you meet adventurers who will fight in dungeons for you in order to collect items to sell and some NPCs who have their own stories that you can interact with.\n\n[h2]Pros[/h2]\n\n* Interesting game play - Running the item shop becomes quite absorbing and the adventures through dungeons gets tricky but the rewards are greater.\n* Haggling - Customers wishing to purchase your wares can engage you in haggling. Learn how your customers react to pricing and how much to take off to secure the sale with them.\n* Funny moments - Customers don't just want to buy, some have items to sell and they will have stories associated with what they have. Some of these are amusing. \"This belonged to my father. He treasured it all his life\" and they offer you a ham sandwich.\n\n[h2]Cons[/h2]\n\n* Quite short and easy to complete the main quest line of paying back the loan if you know how to make a lot of money.\n* NPCs tend to be forgettable and some are a bit shallow (in terms of narrative)\n* [spoiler]The woman trying to rip you off becomes a pain after a while[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I am fond of these types of games and having played some more, I always compare them to this to see how they change things and what they bring to the table.", "timestamp_created": 1593355467, "timestamp_updated": 1593355467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535268187522888184", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71552361": {"recommendationid": "71552361", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972563559", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1453, "last_played": 1593252579}, "language": "english", "review": "The premise of this game is most disturbing.

Welcome, Argentinians!\n\nI've played it for a long time.\n\nThis is intended to be a spoiler free review.\n\nLet me lay down some stuff, you will be able to tell if you'll like it or not.\nYour first playthrough is going to take a while and it will be fun. You'll figure out the mechanics, make mistakes, reload some saves, make some profit, then eventually come out on top. Everything feels great, the ending is wonderful, it's a complete experience all its own.\nThen, you get hit with new possibilities. Survival and New Game+ and you realize each new game+ builds on what you've got and that there's still stuff to unlock and bosses to beat. Now, you realize that the time system means you have to try everything to unlock everything and meet everyone, so it becomes more daunting of a task to undertake an ng+ playthrough because you have to ask yourself what you want to achieve after this cycle.\nNow, having thrown the gist of the life cycle of this game at you, you probably realize that this is a title with hundreds of hours to offer. \nIs the gameplay loop exciting? Yes. I enjoy it. In fact, it excels greatly at everything it does and gives the player almost complete control of the reins. \nControls on anything are great, moving items, changing furniture, adjusting prices, all the interface works as intended. \nI have encountered few, if any, bugs or crashes. \nBuying and selling stuff is fun and rewarding. You get personally invested in having a hero pick up the upgraded weapon or crafted armor you want to sell them for dirt cheap when they enter the store, only to have your hopes dashed when the item is bought instead by Alouette for an exaggerated sum. \nChanging the atmosphere in the store is interesting and it becomes an intriguing balancing act between items and decor to hit that sweet spot in the middle. \nThe characters and story are good. Sometimes, it's great. The writing is good. It's memorable stuff, often humorous. No huge contrivances here, it's like a B-rated anime plot with good writing was turned into a shop simulator/ARPG. To be quite frank, if they took the characters from this and turned it into an anime, I would watch it and recommend it to people.\nOkay, what else? Oh yeah, dungeons. The dungeons are fun. Juggling items isn't, but you take the good with the bad and eventually you know what you want and what to throw out. Sometimes things can be cheap and kill you real fast, but usually it's more or less a stroll to collect loot and occasionally smack some things. Bosses can be tough. Controls here are good. The fighting itself is interesting enough, especially when you're playing with the more interesting heroes.\nI think that about covers it. Get it, full price or on sale, it's worth it.\nCapitalism, ho!", "timestamp_created": 1592634586, "timestamp_updated": 1593893026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815453112125396729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70840161": {"recommendationid": "70840161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012256733", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1592320916}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1592247706, "timestamp_updated": 1592247706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492763608694076538", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70764109": {"recommendationid": "70764109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097950532", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 297, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 742, "last_played": 1592124989}, "language": "english", "review": "Capitalism Ho!", "timestamp_created": 1592121154, "timestamp_updated": 1592121154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480782091617584229", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70706557": {"recommendationid": "70706557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071993873", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 9223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2873, "last_played": 1597893274}, "language": "english", "review": "Really dark, based game about capitalism.

It's some real inception level stuff to be honest, but no spoiling! lol\n\nSomething that might be easy to miss for anyone, but the best way to increase your merchant level and unlock more items and similar is to combo the \"near pin\" and \"just pin\" sales and purchases without haggling. I was able to level up 5 levels within 2 in-game days of the first week simply by not breaking the combo chain.\nAlso, if a character you sell to has a heart pop up after a sale, that means their wallet just increased too. That doesn't mean you can sell cheap items at higher prices, but that you can now sell higher priced items. Take note of it, and it'll help.\n\nAnyways, it's a good game, and overall good time killer.

But then again, it doesn't really have to be.\n\nThe game works at a good pace, adding different facets of shop management to your options as you progress. You even get a rival who is, it must be said, also adorable.\n\nSo far, the combat doesn't seem particularly challenging. Anyone who has played any of the old top down action rpgs like YS, or the old Soulblazer games for the SNES will instantly see how to manipulate it in their favor. Bosses seem to have a gimmick that you can use to beat them easily once you learn to exploit it.\n\nYour adjutant fairy is quite helpful in explaining the rules of the shop, although it isn't an exact science. Although she says selling at 30% markup is ideal, you WILL very often encounter that unhinged, aggressive housewife who will make you commit prolonged murder in your mind every time she shows up to haggle with you. Because apparently, although your goods are simply too expensive, she simply must have them. Off to Big Bash with you, you cheap skinflint!\n\nWhew. . .rant over. Wait, not you again, you little brat! Stop complaining that your parents don't give you enough allowance. Just pay up!\n\nAnyway, the customers are certainly memorable. And also adorable.

Subsequent NG+ playthroughs sadly offer no difficulty whatsoever, as due payments will be the same, and you'll start out much better tooled up. On the dungeon crawling side of things, almost all enemies come in many different re-skins (well, pallet swaps, at least), but you'll still have to play for a fair bit before you'll have seen it all.

Recettear is, in a word, brilliant. It's one of those rare examples of a totally new experience: a game that both invents an entirely new subgenre, but also remains at the top of that subgenre as all of its followers struggle to be even half so good.\n\nSo what is Recettear, exactly? It's a gorgeous chimera of a game. Part visual novel, part action RPG, part shopkeeper simulator. And while it not be the best visual novel, action RPG, or capitalism simulator out there, it is very much a creature far greater than the sum of its parts. Most of that is down to the storytelling, which binds each element together. Those familiar with NISA's games (EG Disgaea) will find the tone familiar: the storytelling is character-driven and often humorous, relying on strange characters of limited capacity struggle to solve problems in inventive ways with no small amount of amusing misunderstanding. You play as the owner of an item shop in a traditional Japanese-style Roleplaying Game's starter town, and must venture into the nearby dungeons yourself in order to accumulate stock to sell off to the wandering heroes and pay off your debt. High drama is predictably eschewed in favor of humor and slice-of-life shenanigans. You won't be on the edge of your seat playing Recettear, but you'll find yourself laughing\u2014or at least smiling at the heroines' antics\u2014quite often.\n\nAs a slice-of-life style story might dictate, the overall structure of the game is fairly relaxing. You settle into a rhythm fairly quickly of alternating between simple dungeon-delving, inventory management, and reading through dialog scenes. None of the mechanics at play here are particularly deep or complicated or challenging\u2014but that's part of the charm. Your goal as a player isn't to get rich or become powerful or defeat a foe, it's simply to enjoy the ride. Few games manage to be as perfectly on-point tonally, and fewer still manage to nail the specific tone of a relaxing fantastic adventure quite so well. Many games since have emulated Recettear, but they've often chosen to abandon the visual novel aspect of the game to focus more on item management and dungeon-diving. These games, in my experience, quickly become stale as the lack of a calming narrative context leave the core mechanics to tell a story instead, and that story is always the same: an unceasing cycle of constant consumption.\n\nRecettear is brilliant precisely because it offers a little something to everyone in a very accessible\u2014and contained\u2014package.

There are a collection of systems here that could make for a pretty novel experience, but unfortunately most of them are deeply pointless, leading to a repetitive, disappointing buy > resell cycle.\n\nThe gist is: you run a fantasy item shop to pay off your dead dad's debt. In the course of everyday business, you meet adventurers, can sell them better gear, can hire them to partake in playable dungeon crawls, and can use the loot to either resell or craft into super extra fancy gear for further gains. The catch is that the dungeon crawling part of the game is time consuming, isn't particularly engaging, and has terrible drop rates. On top of that, the crafting is so impractical as to ALSO never yield you anything of value.\n\nThe end result is that you entirely ignore those three-quarters of the game in favor of running back and forth between your wholesalers and your store, making minor shifts to account for price & demand shifts until the game abruptly ends.  It was honestly a little odd, in that despite making an honest stab at clearing the dungeon content, the credits rolled when I was about halfway through them overall, having crafted maybe 2 pieces of meaningful gear and not even met all the adventurers. A completionist could play on past the credits for ages, but the overwhelming question remains: why *would* you?\n\nUltimately, it's cute and charming, but something like Stardew Valley seems overwhelmingly more engaging while hitting the same beats and enjoying similar status as a game you can continue indefinitely.", "timestamp_created": 1587415101, "timestamp_updated": 1587415265, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486999958753585815", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67706567": {"recommendationid": "67706567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054316965", "num_games_owned": 542, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4992, "last_played": 1659515793}, "language": "english", "review": "Started playing Recettear after reading a DeviantART post about 100% completion of it. I've completed four, twenty-hour run-throughs out of seven needed to start thinking about 100% completion. Expect 140 hours to get to that point, then a few hundred hours beyond that to get 100% completion.\n\nIs the game fun for the first few run-throughs? Definitely. \n\nWhat is fun after the first few run-throughs? Every next run-through, you can focus on another character and get small bits of progression in terms of finally completing certain crafting recipes. You can get lucky and get a customer who sells you an item you definitely need. There could be a drop in a dungeon you've been waiting for for ages.\n\nIs the game fun enough for many hundreds of hours of gameplay? I'd say not fun enough. In Pok\u00e9mon Emerald, completion feels like progress - you can train each of your monsters and find optimal ways to train them, you understand more about game mechanics and there's distractions and diversions all the time, with a New Game+-type of mode which makes progression more satisfying and also harder. In Recettear, completion consists of doing the exact same thing a bunch of times, with the only progress being unlocking one item. Gameplay difficulty CAN be increased, just not if you want progression -- you need to choose between two types of New Game+, and the more difficult one does not carry over at all to the progression-based New Game+.\n\nIf you want a game to grind for completion, Recettear is pretty hardcore and a bit lacking in short-term goals to make - everything is very mid- to long-term goals. If you dislike that, perhaps Stardew Valley, RuneScape or other games with many more short-term goals are a better fit.

Paying debt managing money and paying taxes is fun right? RIGHT? all joking aside this game is very fun and relaxing experience.\nThe story is a pretty simple setting that your deadbeat father decided to become an adventurer and took a massive loan for equipment to do so and never returned. Now you have to pay off the entire loan and you do so by running an item shop. The gameplay loop is very simple but it has a surprising bit of depth to it. You will get items and gear for your shop by either going into dungeons with an hired adventurer or by buying off of the market and then you sell them to your customers. You can set up the items you want to sell on display and people will come in and ask to buy an item that they want then you set the price. If they like it they will buy it or if they think that it is a bit high then they will try to haggle to get a better price, haggle too much or start the price too high then they will just storm off and not buy anything. You will spend a lot of your time haggling with your customers to try and sell your stuff at as much of a profit that you can, while simple there are new things you learn and are able to do that add in depth to it. The fluctuating prices on the market of items and gear going high or lower and the adventures that you can hire coming into your shop to buy gear as upgrades so you don't have to loan it to them when going out into dungeons adds in a lot of interesting depth to the game. Buying up a bunch of metal items while the prices are down then sell them when the prices stabilize, or do you wait until there is more demand and prices go up to sell them for a even bigger profit, these are all really interesting decisions that you will be making throughout the game. All of this though would not be nearly as engaging without the weekly payment that you have to make. The payments start out fairly small but it quickly ramps up and is fairly challenging to make all the payments in time adding to your decisions with the debt looming over you.\nWhile all the decisions on running the shop are fun and interesting there are some criticisms with the game especially with the dungeons. The dungeons are all randomly generated but they are so simple that you will quickly feel like you been through it all and controlling whatever adventurer you hire is not very interesting. While there are different characters that you meet and will sell to through out the story you mostly sell to the same generic old man, man, women, and little girl. Each character has their own preferences and willingness to the prices they will pay that you will figure out over time, but with such a small pool of people you'll figure out the best prices for all of them then it can get repetitive as you already know what price they would be willing to go for.\nDespite the dull dungeons it is largely inoffensive and as such i did not mind that it was so simple and the somewhat small pool of customers did not drag the game down too much. Overall i had a great time with this game. Now if you'll excuse me i have a golden statue to sell and a little girl just came into my shop that i need to chase out.", "timestamp_created": 1583022593, "timestamp_updated": 1583022593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519685029983520508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64168315": {"recommendationid": "64168315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030130947", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7268, "last_played": 1681420018}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game and a lot of fun.

That is if you like a game where the main focus is the trial and error approach. And frankly, I myself do not particularly like this kind of gameplay. It feels like wasted hours to me and a lot of the gameplay becomes tedious in the end.\n\nHowever, if you like the old RPG style, to sell items and guess how much you can get for them, along with running through dungeons to gather items. Then this game might be for you?\n\nThe story is: Meh. It is very fluffy. So if you like cute and simple stuff, then this is for you. If you like something more complex and thought-provoking, you shouldn't look to this game.\n\nGameplay: The dungeons can be very hard. If you die you die. So either reload the last hours gameplay or cope with the loss and lose the war later on. You decide?\n\nIt does offer content to do after you complete the maingame. So if you want more they have it. And the mechanic of the game is fun and unique enough in itself. Just don't expect it to be easy...\n\nFor a smooth and fun time I recommend that you check the wiki and other's playthrough before starting up a game. It might save you countless hours of gameplay that has to be revised.\n\nI have a few tips myself:\n- Always sell red items to 250%. Only the purple fairy and those who spend their savings will want less.\n- If an items gets increased in price (red). Buy them in stock and sell them. You easily reach the 500,000 pixie goal like this.\n- Always keep in stock two of each category. Everytime a customer leaves without good treatment, it destroys a XP combo that is VERY important! The game doesn't tell you this...\n- Nearpin, means you reached close to their limit of preferred price.\n- Reload if you die in a dungeon. You can't afford the loss of ingame hours!\n- What often gets increased in price is food and armour.\n- Buy lots of things decreased in price from other sellers and keep stock.\n- Always! And I mean always! Check other's gameplay of a boss before your first go. It might spare you a defeat!\n\nAnd that's it. :)", "timestamp_created": 1580506156, "timestamp_updated": 1580506156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62715074": {"recommendationid": "62715074", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986527965", "num_games_owned": 724, "num_reviews": 401, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 827, "last_played": 1452112174}, "language": "english", "review": "You run an item shop to pay back a loan.

You play as Recette, a girl, who's suddenly tasked with paying off her father's loan by running an item shop. The story itself is really short, it ends the moment you pay off your last debt; it takes one in game month to complete going through the main story. Upon the successful completion of paying off all of these debts, your main save file becomes the endless mode free of worries and debts. It also unlocks New Game+ and Survival Mode.\n\nShopkeeping in this game is really fun. You can buy items to sell from other merchants, or go adventuring through dungeons in search of loot to sell. By default you start off with one available adventurer, but can unlock more later. To sell items successfully it's important to pay attention to local news, and also, memorise acceptable price for different customers. As you level up your merchant level you get plenty of nice skills to use, these also include customisation and expansion of your shop.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Short main story.\n- Different game modes unlock when you compete the main story.\n- Pretty simple, yet still cute artwork.\n- BGM might get annoying during prolonged game sessions.\n- You can expand, customise and decorate your shop as you level up.\n- Dungeon exploration is pretty fun.\n- Lots of different items to find and sell.\n- You can accept orders from customers later on.\n\nOverall, this is a very enjoyable game and I highly recommend it.

Levelling up your shopkeeping is how you unlock higher tier gear for your adventurers anyways, so you HAVE to keep doing it even though it's repetitive and brainless.\n\nI've been playing for 28 hours and haven't managed to unlock any challenging dungeon content.

It might be one of the few examples where this meld of styles actually just makes it look nicer, the sprites can slightly re-orient themselves in the shop too, helping with this effect.\n\nThat said, it isn't a very big game, and it doesn't seem to have a large budget if the enemies in dungeons are telling a story of that.

I saw it first when a streamer I like to watch was playing it and I thought it would be perfect for me since it seemed to be a mixture of procuring and selling off items.

It felt like I was stuck a few times when the dungeons would be looted and I beat the boss but the next dungeon wouldn't open, so I looked it up online and apparently certain scenes need to play first before that can happen. Overall, the gameplay kept me engaged and I enjoyed making money off of the items I found. My one gripe with the market system is that you have very little room to play with when it comes to selling things; you can sell them for between about 110%-130% of the items overall value and it occasionally felt a bit tedious to stay within that margin. If you could sometimes haggle more with people to get a higher price or vice versa and be forced to sell things for less on occasion, it probably would have made things a little more exciting but it didn't get boring because if you spend a bunch of time selling things you can then go grind out  for a while and it keeps things interesting.

This game probably has the best item shop gameplay out there, though the dungeon crawling part is a little lackluster.

There are several adventurers to befriend, learn about, and upgrade as well as the normal townfolk whom regularly visit your shop. \n  Your shop will navigate a changing marketplace where there is a real chance at losing a lot of money if you're not respecting it's whims. With an increasing debt payment that needs to be paid every week, choosing to be nice to customers so they come with more money next time or wring them for everything they're worth to maximize short-term profits makes for exciting choices day to day with prices fluctuating and new items and mechanics being introduced regularly. \n   The tutorial and intro is too long, but you can easily skip it on subsequent playthroughs; I recommend not skipping it the first time though, since this game has a great, slightly infamous translation.

(Just DON'T google % spreadsheets or just sell everything for cheap like 105% of the base price. You ruining all the fun. Try to learn each person's payment limits and act like someone who is really trying to make serious cash.)\n- First game I ever saw a game that mix dungeon crawling with shop management successfully. \n- Music (Except the first music every music was quite good. Most were relaxing, but I liked dungeon music most.)\n- IMO It's cheap for the amount of time you gonna spend on this. Paid less than 3$ for this game and finished it in about 7 hours. I bought on a sale though.\n- Some replayability. There are new things unlocked once you finish it. Also, even if it's repetitive, for some reason it will get to you...\n- Charismatic casts. Yeah, the NPCS and the 'happy happy' tune are quite contagious.\n- Balanced difficulty. Even though I finished it on my first attempt, I 'd say it's was a good challenge and I had to stop and think a lot about what I was doing to get the last week's amount of cash to pay the debt. Don't worry about 'losing' though, I heard you start with some benefits which make the next run easier.\n\nMeh\n- Graphics. It's simple for an animated anime game, yeah, but I didn't care enough about it to make me play more or less. Considering it was done with very possibly a short amount of cash I'd say it's okay.\n- Main story. You are in debt. You must pay it. It exists for the sake of making you not slack off. It's passable.\n- No cards or achievements. I don't really care, but  I bet someone does.\n\nCons\n- Very simple dungeon system. Corridors, rooms and mostly monsters feel quite the same. I'm used to more advanced customizable dungeon crawling but since this game got focus on the shopkeeping part and doing dungeons is NOT required at all, I guess someone could skip this(?). The more you advance in the dungeons, more things can happen, but its still very simple.\n- The main protagonist act or get treated way too diferently from the reality. Well she is... way too dumb and forgetful to put it plainly and... basically only one person thinks it's strange for a little girl to be running a shop all day... Child work, profit lol? I personally didn't found that funny if that was the intention, so I just rolleyed and ignored it.\n- Some people will annoy you a lot so basically when you see them you would just wish them to GET OUT of your shop: Little girls, some ripoff woman and one more... For different reasons. Discover them yourself. \n- I wished there would be more diversity of NPCS entering the shop: Grannies, knights, clerics, friendly monsters (since this game is NOT quite logical on most parts), foreigners, royalty (not just one certain girl), etc.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it was worthwhile and I will very possibly play more.\n\nI only finished the game once on the first try so there are might be more things I don't know that might change my opinion on things.

It has enough goals to work towards, both story and completion, that I still enjoy it after playing through several times.

They always simplify the shopkeeping to be as straightforward as possible and focus most of their efforts elswhere, when this is a genre that doesn't really benefit from an action packed and deep dungeoncrawl system. \nThe dungeons are there to break up the wheeling and dealing of the shop, not be an equal or greater than it. You are a buisness owner, the only reason you follow the adventurers down into the depths is to see that they are doing their job and maybe to blow off some steam, not to cheer for your buddies as they slay the great evil of plauging the land or whatever. \n\n[b]YOU ARE A BUISNESS OWNER[/b]. A great evil means more hapless adventurers that you can sell sub-par gear to for a markup, and Recettear captures that extreme mercentileism unlike any other game in the genre I've played. \nThere is a reason the tags are Capitalism, Anime, RPG and then Dungeon Crawler. That is the priorities of the game, both in story and gameplay. You might do some delveing for free stuff, but while you were away galavanting with Lou the price of food skyrocketed and you lost out on some huge profits. The delveing is also only profitable on the deeper levels or really early, if you know your clientbase or just deal with the shop you can power through the merchant levels and buy better stuff than you possibly could find in the dungeon at the same time. \nEven if you prioritize the dungeons you need to sell the stuff you found and like yourself, every other merchant nocks a hefty amount off of the original value if you sell it to them so you are obviously going to sell it in your own store, meaning that you are going to gain merchant level regardless. The dungeon crawl is optional, the store shure as hell isn't. \n[spoiler]For a story run-through at least, for the (relativley boring) lore and to see all the items and characters you sadly need to delve quite a bit, which is the only major mark against the game[/spoiler]\n\n[b][i]CAPITALISM FUCKING HO[/i][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1572214828, "timestamp_updated": 1572215088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55689442": {"recommendationid": "55689442", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960574635", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4159, "last_played": 1571977955}, "language": "english", "review": "Capitalism, ho!", "timestamp_created": 1571584772, "timestamp_updated": 1571584772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55622415": {"recommendationid": "55622415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361155034", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2143, "last_played": 1522305455}, "language": "english", "review": "My only wish is that that were more content to this game.

There are two ways, and the serious one I'm gonna discard right at the beginning. So, without further ado...\nRecettear. Low budget japanese game, which does more for educating in economics than most schools today. Imho it should be called AnCap: The Game or Le Merchant Story (*rubbing hands intesify*). Why? Because behind cute visuals there's mercyless business simulator. Story is somehow simple, you inherit debt and you are forced to repay it. \"Pay denbts\" hits you hard every week and you need to work your ass off to meet the demand, which is growing up quite steadily. Buy low, sell high! Skin those adventurers alive and finally see the trading from the other side! All in the name of profit! (and cuteness of main characters)\nYou run the shop, do the business, you follow market events, and from time to time you join some poor adventurer on his journey to dungeon, where you collect all the loot. Yes, not a single item remains in their hands, except for healing items, which you kindly allow them to consume, so the bosses won't dismember them. Their payment is only hiring fee, which is comically low in comparison of loot's worth. Be greedy merchant, release your inner Harpagon inside! Create your own McNuke shop, where you sell swords to little girls and sailor uniforms to old geezers! All in the name of profit! And be sure, that this game is highly addictive, because you'll never have enough money. \nGraphic is nice, somehow it reminds me Ragnarok Online (heh, I played merchant there as well, oh the nostalgia...), that means simple textures and mix of 2D characters in 3D enviroment. Looks nice, is simple and it works. Music is cheap ass funny music, which you will hate maybe, then you'll get used to it and finally you'll find yourself humming the shop melody. Fukken earworm! \nConclusion - definitely recommended. Release your inner capitalist and make profit!

For one thing, it only seems to accept *some* NUM pad keys (but not the numpad arrow keys, which is what I really wanted), doesn't accept \"enter\" for the confirmation key like I was hoping, etc.. Secondly, there is absolutely no support for mouse-based controls. You can't even click on menu options, which makes me wonder if this game was developed by a company that mostly makes console/handheld games. In short, it's far from ideal, but the controls still function well enough, hence why it's 7/10 not 5/10 or less\nStory (9/10):\ndon't worry, no spoilers. I haven't finished it yet anyway so I wouldn't be able to spoil it if I wanted to (and of course, that also means take this rating with a grain of salt). What I can say so far is that the characters are all written in a delightfully humorous manner.

Ever since watching Sword Art Online I've always wondered about shop keeping roles in games. Like playing an RPG but just focusing on your shop and hiring adventurers to get stuff and do the hard work for you which is this game.\n\nThe controls are a bit odd, I honestly don't know the history of this game I feel like its probably a DS game or something thats just been ported to PC or some weird situation like that but it isn't too much of an issue. (while writing this review I did a quick google search and apparently no it has only been release on PC? Apparently the Z key being the \"default\" key is more common in some Eastern games?)\n\nYou have a time limit per day and have to pay off a debt on a weekly bases which the game says gets smaller but I wouldn't know I have maybe under an hour of gameplay as of writing this. Each action you take such as running the shop or going to town doing things and then returning to the shop all result in one of the four units of time being taken, except for the dungeon where you play as the adventurer which takes 2 units of time instead basically half your day though it is useful as you can get a lot of items compared to buying them and selling them at a marked up price.\n\nThat's the premise of gameplay really, you buy items and sell them for a profit or spend most of the day in a dungeon getting them cheaper/free but have less time to sell them but potentially make more money. Its a give and take system. The combat in the dungeon seems really simple, you have an attack and a special attack thats it from what i've played and its laid out like a dungeon crawler.

I thought \"Ooh, this game looks very chill and amusing to play!\"... oh was I wrong.  \n\nHere to make things simple I'll start with a Pros/Cons list:\nPros: \n- The concept of running a shop in a fantasy setting was pretty neat.\n- I like the fact that you can hire fellow adventurer to go dungeon crawling with if you'd like.\n- 'some' of the characters are really cute and amusing at times.\n- The marketing system is pretty well made... but not perfect (further explained ins Cons)\n\nCons:\n- This game runs HEAVILY on RNG, and is honestly, imo, in a quite impractical way too.\n- Kids... just kids... why did you even let them become a possible customer? (More so a common one?)\n- As playing as a kid yourself... well, lets just say that the way people treat you seems unethical.\n- The combat system would be neat, if it were fun... but its clunky and bland.  \n- Additionally, it is practically forced on you to do, as it is without a doubt the best way to make a profit.\n- A lot of the items you try to sell will end up selling little to none, heck sometimes u might have to lose out. (reason for the combat thing... in order to make your payments.)\n\nYou know I could actually go on...

Finally. xD\n\nRecettear starts with our main heroine named Recette Lemongrass, a girl who does not care much in the world and just go lazying around. Until one day, a fairy named Tear who came to Recette's household to collect her father's debt. Not aware with her father's debt and was left by her own father as an adventurer, Recette has to step up her game by becoming a store manager for selling various items in her shop that she named \"Recettear\".\n\nGame's a mixed of store management and RPG element into it. Your goal in the game is to pay your father's debt in some sort of installments as it gets... higher lol. You can price your items to get \"chain combos\", leveling your mechant level for new stuffs, get orders from customers, decorate your shop to your customer's liking, etc. There is much to do for this game, which is surprisingly fun. Upon finishing the game, there will be additional features for the game to explore, such as \"Endless Mode\", \"Survival Mode, and of course... \"New Game +\". I'll leave that to you to discover.\n\nOverall, if you like a simple game that has a lot of content and would make your brain analyze in managing your item shop. Well... I would recommend you to play this game! BUT!... if you're a person who's not into repetitive gameplay by going back and forth from the town to dungeons as you get items for your store and sell items while in town... This might be not your cup of tea. With that, ready yourselves as you get into their shoes, be a capitalist who satisfies one's own greed for money, and be successful as a store manager.

I've beaten the story at least three times over the years. This is one of my absolute favorite games! I have yet to find a game that even comes close to it in terms of fun and shop management. I do wish there were more patron sprites, but that my only gripe. I very much wish there were more games like it.\n\nThe items that patrons are looking for are tied to the morning NEWS system, so item demand changes from day to day. It gives the shop aspect a bit of spice and really drives you to pick up ANY deals you can get your grubby hands on in the markets.\n\nIt's nice to have a management game that doesn't fall too deep into micromanagement. It's a good game to lose yourself in and it won't drive you nuts with complex supply/demand systems. It feels and plays like you are running a homey little town shop. Since this shop is literally in Recete's house, that is exactly how it should feel. \n\nIt is a pretty decent dungeon crawler too. I am almost positive there are dungeons I haven't found yet due to not triggering their arrival. The combat is super easy. Once you get the hang of always approaching a monster at an angle then you really don't get hit very much. You do have to be aware of your adventurers' level and items though, as even if you don't get hit often you can die really quickly if you pop into a high level area. I really love how you can give your adventurers a smashing deal so that they are better equipped in dungeons. The monsters can a bit repetitive, but since you do have to look for specific monster drops I guess it would be awful if certain monsters were more rare.\n\nOverall, I love sinking time into this game. The main character is ADORABLE and the character interactions are super cute. The character back-stories have a bitty bit of depth in them. I wish there were more games like this all the time.

You would think that combat would be exciting and item shop management would be dull, but not so! The item shop was a BLAST for me. The haggling is nice, you learn folks' different margins at which they will buy compared to the item's worth, and there's just so much awesome wheeling-and-dealing.\n\nThis might just be the best game ever made which is focused mainly on running a shop.

The store management is nuanced, from what items you stock, where you chose to place display them, how you treat your customers, and how prices fluctuate. While you can nickle and dime your customers--buying low and selling high--they'll resent you for it. Your merchant rank also increases quicker if you're fairer, and the merchant rank gets you access to better products, upgrades, and more skills. Striking a balance between customer satisfaction and making profits is rewarding. I could go on, but there's so much depth without feeling overwhelming.\n\nI actually quite like the dungeon crawling gameplay too. It's less hack and slash like Rune Factory 4 or any 2D Legend of Zelda, and more slow and methodical like Illusion of Gaia for the SNES or Magic Knight Rayearth on the Sega Saturn or even Secret of Mana. It's more focused on landing precise hits in specific positions. You do more damage if you hit an enemy from the side, even more if you hit the back, and if you hit enemy right before it hits you, causing a counterattack. Most attacks can be dodged if you take it slow as well. When dungeon crawling you hire one of several adventurers you play as, each with their own class, stats, skills, and equipment. They all play differently and you'll have a favorite. Random events such as double experience, double defense on enemies, and MP cost halfed also help spice up floors along with traps and treasure chests. I actually really like the bosses as most are puzzle bosses. I think what makes the dungeon crawling work is that it's in service to the store simulation. It gets you items to sell, introduces more characters, progresses the deeper story, and adds contrast.\n\nThat being said, the dungeon crawling could have improvements. I'll defend the slower nature but it could feel smoother. Later in the game, dungeon crawling feels less optimal. Also, once you finish the last week of debt and continue the story in Endless Mode, you'll be doing more dungeon crawling, making it feel a bit more lopsided. It's still fun as you need money from the store to buy better equipment and items. You also still need to increase that merchant rank to get accesses to more items and equipment. I think if the game had you go to the dungeon every night (like the inferior Moonlighter), it would have fixed this. You would also advance the story more naturally. And it would allow for you to have a better and more varied stock of items. You wouldn't waste most of a day or even a full day dungeoneering. It would also make the Endless Mode feel less lopsided towards dungeon crawling as you'll have more time to in the main game to get to where the game expects you to be in Endless Mode.\n\nAll and all, this game is great. The store aspect is really deep and satisfying, and the dungeon crawling offers a nice change of pace and can be fun in its own right. It's a game much stronger than the sum of its parts. The store simulation could be its own game but the RPG elements widens the scope. The dungeon crawling is fun, but the store aspect creates a risk-reward situation where you have to decide what stuff to keep or throw away with your limited inventory space as well as whether you should continue going down another five floors or head back now. You could get deeper but maybe die and lose everything. You could find some valuable items but your inventory is full and you need to start tossing stuff.

You are a young girl in a small medieval European-style town, just living life as you please, when one day a representative of an international megolomaniacal banking corporation arrives to tell you you are in an enormous amount of debt. You begin to question the ethicality of familial debt enslavement for a moment, but quickly are thrust into having to navigate the market for sheer survival. Failure to pay your debt is death, so you persevere.\n\nYou begin small, selling old clothes and half-ripe apples. Buy low, sell high. As you get more customers, and the magnitude of the debt becomes apparent, you begin to grow your business. Selling little girls knives to take home to mommy doesn't seem right at first, but when you realize the profiteering potential those thoughts get brushed off quickly. You soon realize the most lucrative venture in which you can partake is arms dealing, not just to little girls but the whole town, and soon your business begins to grow. Rapidly. There are dungeons all around town to be plundered, and your little store is where all the locals can stock up on supplies to go butcher and conquest the local flora and fauna for the sake of your -- and your debtor's -- profits.\n\nAs you grow, you get some \"regulars\" who are willing to do some side jobs in the dungeons for you. One girl tries to rob you, but you convince her quickly, through a bit of gift and bribery, that she should instead steal for you. She agrees, and soon begins to deliver stolen goods to you which you buy low and sell high. You soon realize that, while it's fine and great to let the villagers piddle in the dungeons, some of them seem to have valuable stuff coming from the dark woods...so you ask some of the \"regulars\" to do a bit of grave robbing for you.\n\nThese regulars have deep and riveting backstories. One -- I believe her name was Nagi or Benke or something -- is dressed in traditional Japanese garb with a spear. As you go through the dungeons, she confronts a giant enemy crab which is clearly based on ancient Japanese history. You learn to flip the crab and attack its weak point for massive damage,  and soon haul its massive shell back as a trophy to be sold. The common folk don't seem to want this, though, so who can make use of it?\n\nThe answer quickly becomes apparent to you: Alouette, a blond-haired blue-eyed girl from a wealthy neighboring state, soon arrives and is willing to pay a high price for your wears. She begins to tell you also of her struggles with the ultra-national banking corporation, and how it is at deep-rooted financial war with her home nation. Before she can finish, an unexpected interloper appears: a dark-skinned red-eyed prince of demons named Griff, who swears the annihilation of your people is his destiny. He denounces your capitalist ways ways as evil, and despite Recette's heart-felt protests for peace and properity under which all your people might live together in harmony, Griff persists.\n\nYour story soon branches out from mere arms-peddling and price-fixing of the local economy: you must now defend the existence of your people from destruction. With hired arm, you march into Griff's stronghold, slaughtering his minions and bringing the rest to heel. As you reach the top of the tower, you best Griff in brutal one-on-one combat, admiring his tenacity but also revealing to him why he lost: you had the power of the capitalist banking arm behind you, while he only had his conviction. Though he fights valiantly, Griff ultimately loses, upon which you provide him an ultimatum: die in irrelevancy, or come visit your store where you can teach him the truth of the world. Demonkind is broken and beaten, you remind him, but they do have a future.\n\nGriff, to your surprise, shows up a few days later. While the fight with Griff was happening, Alouette's home nation falls to the international global banking conglomerate. Your debt has long since been repaid, but the reality has set in: Terme Financial Corporation, your debtor, isn't just after money -- they are after power. The debt you repaid them was not to simply grow a business, but conquest their enemies and establish a one-world bank upon which the President will rule as emperor. Alouette, in distress, disappears, and you strike out into the Lapis Ruins to search for her.\n\nIn a tear-jerking, penultimate climax, you send Griff into the depths of the Lapis Ruins to confront the President. Here it is revealed he has captured Alouette and her fairy, holding them as slaves, and only you can save them. His lust for power and insatiable greed has turned him into the form a giant demon, well in excess of what Griff was capable of conjuring himself. But now Griff is outfitted with your own weapons of war -- and trust me, you are indeed an arms broker to be feared the world around at this point. Hellclaw, Seventh Spike of Baphomet, wretched from the very fallen angel himself, now sits upon Griff's arms. With spite and rage, you turn Griff upon his real enemy, and only through violent combat do you financially strike down Terme Finance and rid the world of the President's ambition.\n\nAnd this is where your journey ends. Alouette is saved, and though her country is broken and ruined by Terme Finance beyond repair, they have finally been expelled. It is once again her own country, and reconstruction can be begin. Meanwhile, you return to Reccetear with your own fairy, filling the void of Terme's collapse with your own financial dealings. At this point, you have at least 10x the amount of money you had paid in debt so many years -- er, days -- ago to your debtor. War is coming to the dungeons, you smile, and soon thoughts creep into your mind...what if you started your OWN banking corporation with the profits?\n\nThe possibilities are Endless.

And It did turn out to be too cute for my taste, but at least it's not puerile, and there's none of that shrill overemotional voice acting that's so common with this kind of thing. The music is pretty annoying, but at least there's an option to mute it. It also turned out to be much more of what I'd hoped Moonlighter would be. \n\n- Recettear offers the player far more options for managing their shop than Moonlighter.\n- There's more stuff to sell in Recettear, and it's more interesting stuff than Moonlighter. \n- The inclusion of intermittent fads, and instances of supply and demand helps make shopkeeping engaging.\n- A story mode, survival mode, and endless mode and multiple characters to adventure with makes things more interesting.\n- There are a lot of hidden facets in this game: scenes in various parts of the city to look out for and a decently-sized cast of characters to get to know.\n\nI could probably go on for a bit, but the one area I thought Recettear lags behind in is combat, but I'm not so sure of that just now. Granted, it's an older game, but even then I'm not convinced higher res games like Moonlighter handle combat all that much better. Combat in Recettear may be more basic and less flashy, but I don't think it's any more repetitive than newer games - maybe even less repetitive since players have the option of adventuring with different characters whose weapons, fighting style, and abilities force you to play a little differently, not to mention the random dungeon conditions that pop up now and again that help to change things up a bit.\n\nAnyway, if you're interested in games like Moonlighter - a meld between storekeeping and dungeon diving, this is a great game to explore - especially whenever it's on sale. $19.99 might be a bit steep, but there may be enough game modes and enough depth to the game to possibly - POSSIBLY justify buying it even at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1545838936, "timestamp_updated": 1545965473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566008567810058594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47826274": {"recommendationid": "47826274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153573407", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1545801648}, "language": "english", "review": "How much debt does my dad have?!?!", "timestamp_created": 1545801919, "timestamp_updated": 1545801919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.62622523307800293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47758475": {"recommendationid": "47758475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263791816", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1735, "last_played": 1545765455}, "language": "english", "review": "You know capitalism's ruined you when you started cursing little girls and poor adventurers every time they walk in.\n\n10/10 would rip them off again.", "timestamp_created": 1545598374, "timestamp_updated": 1545598409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47755745": {"recommendationid": "47755745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155412451", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1572184193}, "language": "english", "review": "CAPITALISM.

I felt like I was being pushed to the brink, even if I was struggling to keep the shelves stocked and I hadn't afforded any upgrades yet.\nWhen after it was done and I found out about Endless Mode and New Game + however, I had some mixed thoughts. In New Game+, on top of the fact that I kept my old merchant level and I was more confident about going deeper into the dungeons, the difficulty level became trivial.\nIn Endless Mode it's even more of an issue. With no more debt to pay and no more real stakes, it's largely about working to get some more of the story beats you didn't get before. The story is adequate enough (Recetta and Tar form a surprisingly genuine friendship) but it's difficult enough as it is to get me interested in a visual novel when you don't have to grind to go to the next page. I think this could've been remedied by perhaps giving you the option to sign more contracts with more debts to do new things with the shop and do more in the story.\nEssentially the last thing left that really pushes you is more of the dungeons, and while these are surprisingly competent for being part of a game where they're not the main selling point, it bothers me that I bought a Shop Owner Sim game and spent maybe at least half the time playing a dungeon crawler. It's just not what I had in mind when buying the game.\n\nSo, yeah. Take that for what it's worth.

While the game may appear short there is actually quite a bit to do. There are multiple Heros to play, dungeons to explore and weeks to pass or fail. Unlike many shop style games failing is not the end of the world. If you do not successfully pass a week\u2019s goals you start back at the beginning of the month with all of your items and 1000pix. When you do finally win it will unlock more places to go, people to interact with and game modes. So I highly recommend it and I\u2019ll give you a nice pro tip here. Do not open the shop if you cannot win. Just head to the dungeon for the remaining time and build up as many items as you can carry. If you do it right you can visit the dungeon twice in one day and use that inventory to either craft new items or hold it for the next loop cycle. As Recette would say \u201cCapitalism, ho!\u201d \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1588758513", "timestamp_created": 1544730191, "timestamp_updated": 1544730191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471698105335235596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47490153": {"recommendationid": "47490153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141416684", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1403737287}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a fun little game, It just isn't my type of game.

Part of it is a dungeon crawler.\n\nGame is extremely cute, music is repetitive.\n\nDialogs are SO BORING. It seems they didn't know how to be brief or get to the point. As a consecuence, there's walls of text for telling you practically nothing.\n\nSelling and buying items can be confusing sometimes. As a client could be trying to sell you something and the phrase currently on screen does not clearly state it. I bough a couple of overpriced items this way. By the way, clients sometimes want to buy \"metal things\" but they seem to mean something more specific.\n\nAlso, they make orders and, when you get the items and are there for them, they don't want to play even a normal price. The order system is silly: a tracker was needed, and a clear maximum price for the order too.\n\nThe dungeon crawler is kind of nice, but very simple. Bosses are good, though, and each one has it's pattern and strategy. But, overall, it gets boring to explore random generated maps until you get to the boss.\n\nBut what really ruins it for me is that they make you pay an enormous debt for a house during ONE MONTH. You can barely play the dungeon crawler. After that, additional game modes are unlocked, such as keep playing without having to pay the debt. But... without the debt, why do I need to manage the shop? Uh, oh... I can play the dungeon crawler then, but... It's a very simple one. Maybe I should be playing a real dungeon crawler.

It's not perfect, but if you're into both money management and dungeon delving It'll give you many hours of entertainment.\n\nPro's\n+ Interesting haggling mechanic where you can decide to price of everything you sell.\n+ A beginning campaign with a good story.\n+ More story even after the campaign\n+ Just very charming to play.\n+ Lot's of interesting mechanics like people trying to sell YOU stuff, market changes with prices of items rising or dropping marginally, item orders, crafting items yourself through fusion.\n\nCon's\n- Dungeon Crawling can be a bit slow especially in later longer dungeons.\n- Fighting/movement mechanics are a bit outdated and sometimes annoying.\n- Item drops from bosses only have a small chance to drop.\n- Item drops in general can be a pain to get. (Especially as the amount you can carry back is very small. It gets more later on, but never quite enough.)\n- The later shop upgrades have it so you can't place counters exactly against the wall. It seems one \"tile\" space is missing. As the counters are on default moved in a way where you can't even acces some spots. \n- In the later shop upgrades when you change the floortiles further back they will be deformed. Wallpapers, floortyles and such also affect certains stads so you can't really decorate on what you find aestheticly pleasing. Sometimes to get the right store atmosphere you have to make some very ugly looking combinations.\n- Euria. \n- To fullfil certain customer requests you have to look up online which items fall within which categories. Otherwise it's just guesswork and you're bound to get it wrong with some of the more abstract requests. \"I need something warm\". \n\nSummary\nIt looks as if the con's are longer than the pro's. But most cons are minor nitpicks. Things that will be grating only if you play the game a lot. I personally haven't even found all the items yet or played through the whole story. (I just wasn't interested in freemode. But definitely continue to play in freemode. I've heard it's really good.)\nThis game shines in it's campaign mode when you just worry about paying back your debt and not about completing all fusion items and such.

It is way better than moonlighter, the only downside is that dungeon crawling/combat is not that fun. \n\nPS #1 : The Game does not end when you pay off your debt and the credits roll.

It's got all the same charm and smooth graphics that you'd expect to find on a Nintendo DS game. Imagine my surprise when I found out that not only is this game only on PC, but it's got Japanese indie developers as well. For how well made this game is, I couldn't believe it.\n\nRecettear follows the story of a young girl, Recette, having to convert her home into an item shop to repay her missing father's debts. The debt collector, a fairy named Tear, agrees to help Recette accomplish this goal by giving her advice and help to get started. While there's not much more to the main story than that, there are some interesting side-stories and scenes with the adventurers and customers that help you get to know the minor characters and give you a sense of what the town is like. While there aren't many of these side stories in your first run through the game, there are plenty of opportunities to see all the extra side scenes once you complete the game and enter endless mode, where there's a lot more character development and story to unlock.\n\nIf I had to describe Recettear simply, it's a mix of a simuation game and a JRPG. It's part dungeon crawling and leveling up, but part strategizing on what you need to do daily, and how much money you'll be making every week to pay back debts. As a fan of both casual sim games and JRPGs, Recettear made for a very enjoyable experience all around. While more time is spent doing the sim side of the game, the JRPG side of the game still holds its own with some interesting boss fights in the dungeons, unique monsters and gear, plus a crafting and collection system. Once you get to endless mode, you can pick whichever side of the JRPG/sim cut you'd like; devoting all your time to running the store, strictly dungeon crawling, or both. I can confidently say that endless mode has way more content in it than the story does, and makes the few hours it takes to complete the story worth it to unlock everything else you can do.\n\nYou as the player are in charge of making sure Recette's item store thrives and she can pay her debts on time. To get stock you can either pay an adventurer to help you dungeon crawl and pick up loot, or play the market and buy items from surrounding stores during sales, then sell at your own store during price surges. The strategy behind deciding how to get your store's stock and when to sell is really well done, as you not only decide what the most profitable route to get stock is, but you also have to determine what haggling points your customers will accept or turn away. Other small store mechanics come into play later in the game, such as fufilling orders and recommending items to certain customers. The store aspect is really well done in all of its points.\n\nMy biggest problem with the mechanics or gameplay of Recettear that other people may find as a sore point the longer they play and discover is that the dungeon is not needed past the first week to win. It's the most profitable when you're making very little money in the first in-game week, but after that you don't need it at all, in fact it's probably the worst route to take if you want to make the most money. When I played I found myself favoring just buying from merchants, which made the gameplay a little more repetitive and dull but also was the most efficient way to keep up with the scaling debt prices. However, once you've beaten the game and get to endless mode a lot of this frees itself up, as you no longer have debts to contend with and can play however you like, beating the dungeons and leveling up adventurers like you would in a regular JRPG.\n\nAnyone who enjoys casual games with minor strategy, or dungeon crawling JRPGs would really enjoy Recettear. It feels like one of those games I could see taking with me on a handheld and sinking hours upon hours into the endless mode, collecting all the gear and beating all the dungeons. If you enjoy sim-like games or small-scale JRPGs that allow you to play how you want, Recettear is a required addition to your play list.", "timestamp_created": 1539457268, "timestamp_updated": 1539457268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697772681713104248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45236853": {"recommendationid": "45236853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175111550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3476, "last_played": 1696986854}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is insanely addictive and an absolute pleasure to play.

While I made the game sound bad, Recettear is just decent at best, and the stand out mechanic is taking your spoils from combat in dungeons to invest in your store. There is a mild challenge in the combat, especially since you only have one \"life\" and loose all but one item to take back to your store if you die. (and it's easy to make mistakes because the game feel deceptively easy). Of course, most of your profit is plunked into a debt the main character father's owed, so it feels less rewarding to continue running the store, but it is upon the player to maximize profit from sales.\n\nThere are interesting mechanics such as trying to guess what kind of item a customer may want or placing important items on your window stands to attract customers. I've read of store customization and upgrades, but none of that is enough to keep me interested in playing this full term. I decided to finally play this game after YEARS since I've recently heard of the game, Moonlighter, which is inspired by this game, but I feel I don't need to complete it to understand the jist of this game, and I'd much rather play Dark Cloud 2 for an Action JRPG \"use/sell your spoils for your home base\" game.\n\n[h1].

It is slightly hard to justify the $19.99 price tag, but I would definitely recommend picking Recettear up when it goes on sale for 50% or more (which it does rather often). Recettear is intended for a casual audience. The storyline does not take particularly long to complete and even for a completionist (like myself) there is a limited amount of playability.\n\nThis is not to say that Recettear is not fun. It is. Very much so. It is a game that you can open up and play for 30 minutes during a break or lose several hours to during a weekend. The shop owner aspect of Recettear is done artfully, despite it being a rather niche feature. Moreover, the (gameboy) Zelda-esque dungeon diving is both fun and challenging. Combat has some rather interesting features revolving around invincibility frames and unique abilities. Despite that, the combat is easy enough for a casual gamer to pick up quickly.\n\nRecettear's storyline is a bit childish and cutesy. I personally did not find this to be a detracting feature. There was something fulfilling about being able to come home and enjoy an hour of heartwarming gameplay. Unfortunately, this does lead to the storyline being rather brusque and the characters rather shallow.

It is a LOT more fun than it sounds and the dungeon crawling is reminicient of Dark Cloud games, but there is no sense of scale to what you're doing. In my case, I needed to pay off 30K (caled pix) debt for that week. The 16-20 level portion of the dungeon keeps on dropping items that are only 200-400 pix each (and even the lv 1-4 areas dropped 1,400 priced items), and half of the chests are traps with no loot. Further on in the game, you get news events that increase or decrease the prices of items you sell. I get that this keeps things interesting/challenging, but when I keep getting price decrease events that target the only items (in my case, metal and food items) I have to sell a few days back-to-back before my debt deadline...this is either really bad luck, or artifical difficulty.\n\nThis leaves you with 2 options: Game over, or reload a previous save where you will likely lose 1 1/2 to 2 hours of playtime. You can save frequently in the game, but since so much stuff is randomized, it seems a better option to save on a in-game weekly basis since you don't know how bad the randomization will screw you over.

It's very exaggerated, and it comes off as annoying rather than adorable or quirky. The theme of the game is that you're running an item shop in order to pay off your missing dad's debt as a result of a loan he took out. It's a fairly simple premise, but it's also deceptive. Long story short, I ended up missing the first deadline for repayment. I figured, oh well, I'll just redo this day and it'll be fine. I was wrong. The game reset my progress to the second in-game day, six days of progress and nearly 1.5 hours wasted. For as grind-heavy as this game already is, I find this mechanic pretty frustrating. I would have appreciated the option to choose between resetting that far or resetting the day to see if I could have made the deadline (which I would have been able to make were it not for my dungeon-delving).\n\ntl;dr: some grind-heavy games are fun.

The characters are charming, and the plot is simple, you are a girl who inherited her father's debt and have no way to pay it off. So, as luck would have it, a fairy comes to help you pay off your debt in an epic adventure of... capitalism?! The concept of running an item store to serve RPG heroes feels unique in this age of gaming. The mechanics are simple, yet can be difficult to master. Just how much cash can you swindle out of that old man? How much of a discount can you get on that sword being sold to you? As the game goes on, you'll get a feel for each of the different areas of the game, your store, the market, the smith, the town center, and expeditions.\n\nExpeditions?\n\nThat's right. If you thought that running a store was all there was to do, rejoice to know that there's proper dungeon crawling to mix up the gameplay. It doesn't feel out of place, as your adventurers go out to gather materials for the store that you can't buy at the market. Combat feels responsive, if a little stiff, exploration is that of classic room-based dungeons, and is a great addition to the game. Between the stress of needing enough cash to pay off portions of your debt each week, and the stress of risking death in a dungeon while carrying the goods that could get you the cash, the two sections of the game blend together well.\n\nThat is, if you choose to partake in the dungeon-crawling.\n\nIt is possible to play only via buying and selling in the town to pay off your debt. This requires luck and mastery of business to do, however. Even then, playing this way is not recommended due to the game's flaws.\n\nSo what are these flaws? The addition of expeditions is meant to break up the gameplay and add variety. Despite this, there comes a point when you'll want to go out exploring, but the time constraint of paying off your debt gets in the way. You only have a certain amount of time each day, and you can't earn money while you aren't running the store. It's a lot easier to buy from the market than it is to explore for merchandise. In my own experience with the game, I forewent expeditions for the entire final week just to raise enough cash to pay the final debt. The game became rather boring and formulaic at this point. Dialogue can also become quite repetitive, as there is little variance in the lines spoken by the main character, her assistant, and general customers. Luckily, there are some unique customers, but their dialogue tends to meet the same fate.\n\nAfter beating the game, there was an endless mode where I no longer had to worry about the debt. I quite literally jumped for joy at the fact, since I was both stressed (in a good way) from the cash I needed to raise, and that I could go on regular expeditions without fear of failing. There is also a survival mode with a permanently increasing debt each week, to put your mercantile skills to the test. \n\nIf you want an RPG with a unique twist, and love the prospect of being the merchant that overprices everything, this game is for you.

When I open it again, my save data is gone. I look through the folder and there's no save files.\n\nBut I still recommend this game because looks like it's rarely happened to anyone. And because the game itself is just too awesome.... I didn't get mad at all that my save data is gone... I could still enjoy the game even though I should start from 0 again.\n\nThis game is really fun. These are what makes this game is fun for me.\n- The main goal of this game (paying the debt) is not that hard. But not that easy if you're still new in this kind of game.\n- The dungeon itself is quite challenging without proper equipment.\n- It's also fun to unlock and mastering each of playable characters in this game. Bored play with one character? Change to another. Or challenge yourself to play 1 different characters each day so their level is not that high.\n- Randomly generated dungeon each time you enter.\n- Bored in dungeon? Focus on shop. Just buy item in market and sell it in your shop. There's some interesting event almost everyday like \"The price of metal items increased\" or \"Everyone is looking for sweets\". It will make your activity on shop becomes more interesting. \n- Figure out what's each character likes and don't likes, what's their budget, and how much percentage of base price would be appropriate for them.\n- Decorate your own shop! After you reach a certain of Merchant Level, you could even expand your shop!\n- Many things that you could do in New Game+. Unlock TRUE CARD that makes a certain character with you forever even in New Game+\n- After you finished the game, it also has \"Endless Mode\" or should I say UNLIMITED DEBTWORKS! Nonstop increasing target each week!\n\nThings that are no fun:\n- There's no auto-save, even at dungeon. (If you save manually in dungeon, you will load the game right before entering dungeon)\nLet's say you want to go through the dungeon from Floor 1 to Floor 30 in ONE GO. But your real life boss called or you have other things to do that makes you to turn off your PC. And yeah... You know what happen... You have to do it again from floor 1 because your saved data only could save right before you enter the dungeon.\n- You can't check what you already have in shop when you're in dungeon. Except you found the same item and it says the amount of that items in your shop. You also can't check the fusion list in dungeon. So if you forgot what ingredients that you need to find, you have no idea what to get. (your bag in dungeon is limited. You should choose that to get and what to throwed away)\n- Unlimited stock bag in your shop, and non-function item in shop.\n\nWhat could be improved in this game:\n1. DUNGEON AND BATTLE\n- Hunger System\nI hope there would be \"hunger system\" in this kind of game. Where you explore dungeon but you shouldn't forget to fill your belly not only because of low HP. But also low hunger point. If the hunger point reach 0, the character HP will slowly decreases. So sometimes you consider to eat what's in your bag even it's just ingredient or walnut bread so you didn't die before reach the boss Floor.\n- Different Visual for Different Equipment\nI hope when we change the adventurers equipment, there would be different visual on the adventurers in dungeon. Like when Louie use Breastplate, the Louie's animated clothes becomes Breastplate too.\n\n2. SHOP\n- Limited Stockable Items and Upgradable Stock Space\nThis game have unlimited space to stock items. It made us to stock everything we can anytime.\nI hope there's limited space to stock items. So we should consider what to stock and how much.\nAlso I hope there's upgradable function items that also could decorate your shop. Like Cabinets for saving clothes, or Referigator for saving Food and Ingredients. Weapon Chest for saving weapons.\nEach of that item could be upgraded so the limit to stock items expand.\nFor example, Weapon Chest normally could stock up to 5 weapons by default. But it could be upgraded to 10 weapons, 15 weapons and more.\n- Best Sale Record for 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month\nThis game already have the highest price record for each items. But it needs best sell record for 1 day, 1 week, and ESPECIALLY 1 month. So after you finish the game, you could challenge yourself to beat your own best sale records.\n\n3. STORY / GAMEPLAY\n- Choices Matters\n\"No! It's fun and enjoyable game, so it doesn't need this kind of confusing things!\"\nYes, I agree. The choice I suggest didn't change the main story. But the NEWS. For example, the Guild Leader ask you \"should he go to vacation or not\". If you say no, nothing changes. But if you say yes, the Blacksmith will closed for 3 days, and the price of weapons goes up.\nOr another example. The woman ask you should she cook for her family or just buy food from market. If you say cook for her family, the prices of food goes down. If you say buy from market, the amount of woman looking for food is increases in great number.", "timestamp_created": 1527029709, "timestamp_updated": 1527029709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42169520": {"recommendationid": "42169520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009345176", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1526, "last_played": 1656240179}, "language": "english", "review": "i find this game very ZEN and relaxing", "timestamp_created": 1526952737, "timestamp_updated": 1526952737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42151021": {"recommendationid": "42151021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076518191", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2000, "last_played": 1512873811}, "language": "english", "review": "A very simple dungeon crawler with good artwork and mostly intuitive combat system.

I love a lot about it, the art style, gameplay mechanics and the dungeons. This game is great in that it combines all these familiar things in one strangely satisfying package. \n\nUnlike most RPG's the hero here is not a hero. She is a lowly shopkeeper with a rather shrewd loan shark of a fairy on her case acting as an advisor. The main setting is Recettear's shop for the most part and the aquisition of items and bartering with customers is your prime source of income. You can either buy some wares from the Market or the Merchants guild or you can hire a Hero and delve into a mystery dungeon and see what sort of loot you pull out. Your end goal is to pay off your fathers debt to the Fairy's company and make a name for yourself. As you would expect as you progress in the game more options and customisations become availiable for your store along with an increased inventory of items that you can buy and use. \n\nGraphically this game isn't stunning however the anime art style really works. The dungeons however combine 2D Sprites and 3D voxles and it creates a strange sort of fever dream of a world. I want to say that it doesnt quite work however that is far from the case. The 2D and 3D mix seems to work suprisingly well. The gameplay was fin and engaging.

It's debatable whether it's even worth going through the postgame content, though there actually is quite a bit of that if you have the patience. (If you want to try the postgame content without looking at a guide at all, mess around with your decorations until the shop atmosphere gets towards each of the four corners. This will attract certain visitors that you need for triggers.)\n\nThe one really bad thing is that the shop mechanics are not just unexplained (which would be OK, mechanic exploration can be fun), but explained wrong. You see, Tear teaches you to haggle at the beginning of the game. Haggling does generally get you more money on the current transaction (unless you outright drive the customer away), as she says. Nonetheless, 99% of the time you will not want to haggle, for two reasons. The first is that each time you get a sale on the first price, you get a \"Just Bonus\" of additional merchant XP. Chaining these together results in a \"Just Combo\" which are the main way to improve your merchant level. Second, each time you get a sale on the first price, your relationship with the customer improves. After enough hits they show a little heart, which means they've moved up a relationship level. The most important thing this does is increase the maximum price that they can pay.

Having finished it for the first time in 2018, I\u2019m having a hard time recommending it.\n\nFirst, the positives. Recettear has a pretty original concept going for it: you play as the owner of an item shop, a place where people in town go to purchases various items, from swords to pieces of candy. You are Recette, a girl who is forced into running the shop to pay off her missing father\u2019s debt. The game plays out as a mix between a dungeon-crawler, a time-management game and even a bit like a visual novel. Recette is a pretty great protagonist, there\u2019s plenty of funny moments, and the game just oozes charm.\n\nThat said, the game has plenty of problems. First and foremost: the games mechanics seem to be designed to work against itself. In one of the few tutorials the game offers you get introduced to one of the basic concepts of the game: haggling. What it doesn\u2019t tell you is that there are mechanics working behind the scenes, invisible to the player, that actively discourage haggling. This undermines one of the core ideas of the game, and the player wouldn\u2019t know without looking up guides online.\n\nThis can make the game unreasonably hard at times. In fact, the game seems like it was designed that way. You see, the game works with loops: should you at any point fail to pay your debt at the end of the week, the game starts from the beginning, but a lot of stats get carried over. I found it hard to complete the game without restarting at least once. Ultimately, this hurts the game quite a bit, because it only exacerbates one of the its biggest flaws: it\u2019s repetitive.\n\nDuring most of the game, you\u2019ll mostly be doing either one of two things: selling stuff or crawling in a dungeon. Selling things is relatively simple. Once you get the basic idea down, you\u2019ll be setting prices very quickly. The challenge disappears almost immediately, and it just becomes busywork.\nThe same can be said for the dungeons. Dungeons in this game are randomly generated, which is to say, it arranged a couple of perfectly square rooms in a certain order on a small grid. It\u2019s impossible to imagine dungeons that are any more dull than the ones encountered here. Contained within are a (very) small selection of monsters, a (very) small selection of traps, treasure chests and the occasional boring boss fight. Combine this with the extremely basic combat, and it gets really tedious fast.\n\nOn top of that, the game has some technical issues. It only runs in 4:3, which is really weird for a 3D game first released in 2007. The max available resolution is 1280x960. I experienced many frame drops in the dungeons, even though the environments are some of the most geometrically simple I\u2019ve ever seen in a game. Gamepad support is not the best, and there is no mouse support. The game constantly assaults you with voice quips that are so very annoying, but fortunately these can be turned off.", "timestamp_created": 1518578436, "timestamp_updated": 1518578436, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498030304908752441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40052552": {"recommendationid": "40052552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025186382", "num_games_owned": 1829, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1619, "last_played": 1561771650}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the combination of running the shop and fighting for supplies to sell at the shop.

There is  variety in the monsters you face and what they drop varies. You can sell items outright or create fusions in order to add value to the items sold. \n\nThe social elements in the game are entertaining as well. You get to know which customers will pay higher prices and which ones are horrible and whiney about how much you charge. Some of the in-game dialogue is pretty funny:\n(Somebody go rescue this guys grandchild- he is clearly being starved to death)\n\nPersonally, I found this game pretty entertaining. There is a wide variety of items to buy and as your merchant level goes up the items you can buy increases as well. If you fail to raise the required amount of money you loop back to the beginning of the game (you keep your items, but not your gold though).

It's set in a village which has an economy which fluctuates based on trends.  Sometimes prices of metal goods will rise, sometimes food prices will fall.  You can go around town and buy from the shops, or from people who come into your own shop when it's open for business.  Different shoppers have different preferences and some are stingier (or poorer) than others.\n\nIt also has [i]dungeon crawling[/i] for the purposes of obtaining loot without paying another shop or seller first.  You can obtain multiple people with different stats and abilities to dungeon delve with. and their equipment changes depending on what they've bought from you and what you've given them.  When exploring dungeons you control your companion, not Recette as she's a shop owner, not a warrior or mage.  It's not particularly in-depth, but it's definitely more than a minigame.

Different types of customers (old man, merchant, various adventurers, other main characters, etc) come in to buy and sell items, and your job is to maximize profits and have enough for your debt payments at the end of each week which increase over time.\n\nAt a high level, the strategy is to figure out the pricing tolerance of customer types through experimentation and haggling and how they change as your reputation changes, hiring (and playing!) adventurers to go into dungeons to find crafting ingredients and rare items not available in the market, how variables affect short and long term sales, and balancing them in various situations.\n\nThis all starts off nice and simple, but as you progress increasingly complex variables are introduced. A couple of examples are managing the atmosphere (i.e. the \"feel\" of your shop) based on what items you place where and your decorations which attract different types of customers, and taking advantage of random events such as supply and demand changes and news broadcasts. Also as you progress, more things can happen other than just a customer buying/selling which makes the gameplay more interesting. Playing as the adventurer and going through dungeons is also fun.\n\nOverall I like it a lot. There's enough complexity to make it interesting and it does a good job of simulating a real market, but not so complex that it's overwheliming. Once you're a few hours into the game, I'd recommend keeping a pad of paper and pencil handy. It's not necessary, but sometimes it's nice to be able to track what items you've bought really cheap that you want to push more, things like that.\n\nThe only criticism I have of this game is that there's no auto-save.\n\nTL;DR good game, does not get boring", "timestamp_created": 1511640118, "timestamp_updated": 1511640311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37568639": {"recommendationid": "37568639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067285245", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1512214743}, "language": "english", "review": "0.5h - Meh...\n1h - Still some tutorial stuff?\n2h - Ok, I'm uninstalling this!\nXh - Oh I can buy more than ~4 items from the city. *facepalm*\n4h - I'm hungry, need to eat\nXh - Need to eat again\nXh - Last in-game week left, am I going to get the debt paid?\n10h - Debt paid, game \"complete\"\n\nWhile I enjoyed the game and it's humor, it wasn't as good as I expected.

Both are fun but, as always, take a look at a Let's Play to see for sure if you'll like it. The game itself is obviously good with 96% overall positive reviews. \n\nIf you only aim to finish the game, you'll be trading most of the time. The main fun of the game is with dungeon crawling aka adventure. If you are aiming for 100% completion like me, you'll soon realise the game is now mainly a dungeon crawling game than a trading one.\n\nBehind the humor and cuteness, this game reminded/taught me about how harsh the world can be and that we can only learn to embrace the truth and make the most of what we have. This is what you get from the gameplay itself. The game CAN BE HARD. Much harder than what its cuteness suggests. It can be easy if you are easy on yourself or expect very little of your abilities.\n\nThere are several adventurers with different styles for your picking. You don't get to save while in a dungeon and you only get a chance to exit properly once every 5 lvls. You have limted inventory to take things out. If you died, you'll have to start over to proceed and you only get to take out 1-3 items (depending on merchant lvl) inclusive of items loaned to adventurers. If you lend them 3 valuable items then you get nothing from dying. If you lend them none you can get 3 each time you die and you will die ALOT in nightmre crystal. Believe me. \n\nPros:\n1) Value for money\n2) Fun Game\n3) Funny Jokes\n4) Teaches people to accept failure and/or how things turned out\n5) Varied difficulty based on player expectations\n6) Enjoyable music though not impressive\n\nCons:\n1) No full screen\n2) Button config is really limited. I can't assign numbers (the ones above the alphabets). Even numbers on keypad aren't valid choices. Symbol keys like \"[\", \"]\", \";\" are invalid as well.\n3) Obvious unpolished corneres i.e. 7 instead of 8 showcase for largest shop upgrade, items can get hidden due to camera angles, players can drop out onto/into unintended regions and get stuck. Probelm is ironically not an issue for when its lava since instead of dying, you just get teleported back into the parts of the dungeon you were intended to walk on.\n4) RARE ITEMS ARE HARD TO GET EVEN AFTER HUNDREADS OF HOURS OF GRINDING. This can be solved by cheating with a programme you can find and download online. But this is still not good especially for gamers with fking pride like myself.

They come up with a payment plan and set up an item shop. Sounds boring, doesn't it?\n\nWell, IT REALLY IS NOT! There's a surprising amount of things you can do in this game. You can (and should) customize your shop to attract different types of customer, e.g. young girls won't enter a store that looks like it does blood sacrifice on Sundays. You have 4 ways to get items: The market, where you can buy consumables, treasures, clothing, decorations and books. The Merchant Guild, where you can buy combat gear. Buying random items from customers once you reach a certain Merchant Level. Going into a dungeon and picking up drops. Each day is split into 4 time slots and the customers that you can get (and their quantity) varies based on the time, so for example you're not going to see young girls shopping in the evening.\n\nThe dungeons have an entire plot of their own, where you'll meet various characters and they'll become customers for your store or a customer for your store turns out to be an adventurer. You don't HAVE TO go into the dungeons, but the dungeons are the only place to drop items used for Fusion, which is basically a crafting system where you can create new items or more powerful versions of existing ones. The different adventurers that you unlock are all different, with single target or area-of-effect attacks, low or high HP/SP, ranged or melee attacks, different kind of special attacks or just... moving really fast. The game tells you that the dungeons are a good way to get stuff for your store, as you pay nothing for the drops. This is true, and you can find a lot of goodies in there, but it also takes a hella lot of time: Just going into the dungeon takes half of an entire day and exploring can take a lot in terms of real playtime.\n\nThe actual selling of items is surprisingly complex, with an experience system where you get experience based on how well you did with the haggling. The Merchant Levels will unlock store upgrades and give you access to more expensive items in the Market and Merchant Guild. Every type of customer has a different way they'll haggle. Some have very little money, so even if you give them a huge discount, they still won't buy stuff. Others are the opposite. Some will haggle based on the percentage of profit you try to make. Later on, items can become scarse or abundant based on how much you sell them. Also randomly, a specific item or item type will become \"popular\" with a type of character: You can use this to summon a literal horde of customers that will only buy that specific thing from you.\n\nOnce you clear the game, you unlock Infinite mode, where you can just keep doing things forever. You also unlock a mode where the debt will keep rising indefinitely as long as you keep paying it.\n\nThe characters in Recettear are also quite something. The main character, Recette is a dim, happy-go-lucky little girl who somehow forgot that it's been literally weeks since she last saw her father. Tear is a fairy sent to collect the money Recette's dad owns and she's all business, all the time. Bonus points for French swearing. Louie is the first adventurer you meet and he's a young, hopeful kid who is always poor. Caillou is a young wizard who simply will not accept that Recette owns the shop. Charme is a thief that really likes getting drunk and trying to sell you overpriced items. Alouette is your self-proclaimed rival and eventual heiress to the largest chain store around, who is accompanied by a fairy of her own.\n\nIf there is something negative about Recettear, it's that it's too damn positive. You're neck deep in debt, you have like 800 pix to your name, which buys you like one bowl of food and your father is missing. Meanwhile, the in-game music is stupidly chipper and catchy. You are supposed to be in a desperate situation, with a literal loan shark LIVING WITH YOU AND WATCHING YOUR EVERY MOVE... and yet your biggest worry is when a little girl won't pay 800 pix for a sandwich because THEIR ALLOWANCE IS LIKE 300 PIX OR SOMETHING!\n\nRecettear is not a game you play for the story: There really isn't much of a story or a \"real\" ending. Recettear is a game you play to explore the possibilities that the game gives you. Become a merchant that only sells 3 expensive weapons because that's all you can buy. Become a merchant who only sells one type of item (and perish because you can't feed a starving young man a book). Become an adventurer who only sells +11 Slime. Become an order-only merchant, only stocking items that people have ordered from you. Become a hoarder, making sure that you always have several of any given item type available. Just... do whatever, it all works. More or less.

The game is not about the cute anime girls, cute and anime though they may be; the game is about capitalism and economic success, and you'll find yourself caring about the colour of your shop's carpet and which things are stocked nearest the windows. \n\nIf you enjoy the healing experiences of games like Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon, this game will give you something similar, although with a decent helping of dungeon-crawling to go with it. \n\nI love the characters. Especially Charme and Nagi. And Tear. Actually, pretty much all of the characters are lovable in their own way, except the scammer bitch who exists solely to ruin your combo and your day. She can die in a hole, but everyone else (even the standoffish demon guy) is pretty cool. \n\nStory: 6.5/10. Standard stuff. No real flaws, nothing to reccomend the game for the story alone. \n\nWriting: 8.5/10. This is a genuinely funny and heartwarming game, with a heaping helping of memes spawned from it. \n\nGameplay: 7.5/10. Pretty fun. Whether you enjoy the nuances of running the shop or the decent (if somewhat simple) dungeon mechanics is down to personal preference. Personally, I like running the actual shop. \n\nMusic: 7/10. The music in town is lively and upbeat, and the music in the dungeon is appropriately forboding. It does what it needs to, but I wouldn't expect you to be sticking it in your MP3 player and listening to it by itself. \n\nReplay Value: 8/10. You may not get properly addicted to this game, but there is a lot to be said for multiple playthroughs, if only to play the game without the debt hanging over you or to amass more treasure. If you're a completionist, you will definitely get more than your money's worth collecting all the items and leveling up all the heroes. Also, you will likely need to consult the internet once or twice, as not everything in this game is entirely straightforward in regards to unlocking things. \n\nFinal Verdict: 7.5/10.

People saying it's too difficult to learn or the controls are horrible or whatever. Maybe those things are true if you're an idiot, but for anybody with 1/2 a brain, the controls are easy to learn & most of the gameplay is also. I always check the keybinds of any new game I play to see what you can do, but there were only a couple buttons I didn't figure out before I checked the keybinds. As I said, very easy controls. As for the gameplay, the game teaches you what you need to know to do alright. The dungeon aspect is very easy to learn, like most top-down action style games. The merchant aspect is a bit more complex, but not much. The most difficult thing to learn in this game is the best price-percent to sell/buy at with each customer. You have 2 ways to do this: 1- Old-school style, where you note every percent you try to buy/sell at with each customer & whether it worked until you find the best percentage for each, or 2- Wiki style, where you simply Google it & use the wiki to read the same information you could easily figure out on your own. Again, not exactly difficult either way, it would merely take longer to figure out if you do it old-school. I initially did things old-school, then decided using the wiki would simply speed up the game some without really cheating because it wouldn't give me any info I couldn't, or wouldn't eventually, get myself in-game.\n\nThe biggest down-side to the game? When you sell things in merchant mode, it doesn't pull the items from your stock, it pulls them from the display. In other words, you must put something on display to sell it (or in a vending machine). If you have 5 of the item in stock, the item you put on display is still the item sold instead of using your stock, forcing you to replace every display item you sell before each merchant session & preventing the same item being sold to 2 different customers each session (assuming you have multiple in stock to sell to multiple customers) unless you place multiple copies of it. It isn't exactly difficult to replace the items, it simply takes time. That's the only bad part of this game, and it isn't exactly horrible. It would be much better if they made it so it pulled from stock, but it would only save you a little time & hassle, nothing more.\n\nThe rest of the game is very fun & cute. It isn't the most action-oriented gameplay ever, nor is it the most fun game I ever played, but it is fun, easy to learn, & has a cute story with cute graphics. It requires multiple play-throughs to unlock everything, but so what? Each playthrough can be endless until you decide to end it, each restart has the potential to unlock new things depending on how you did things this time through, and dying or failing at worst forces you to restart through New Game + so you don't lose everything.\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, I have 100 hours played so far and will be playing more, so technically yes, especially if you don't mind the potentially repetitive item placing for the merchant system.

I'm also a fan of games in which you actually use the resources gained in your journeys to do something, rather than just progress. One of my favorite games on Playstation was Azure Dreams, for example. And now, in PC gaming, there is Recettear.\n\nRecettear is the story of a girl who inherits an item store... and a debt to go along with it. In order to pay off your debt, you need to sell things. In order to sell things, you need to get things. In order to get things, you need to buy things. In order to buy things, you need money. In order to get money, you need to sell things. \n\n\"Capitalism, ho!\"\n\nSo where does my discussion about the 'Roguelike' come in? Well, among the many things you can sell, most of the better ones, as well as a variety of combination ingredients (because like almost all my favorite games, this game has a crafting system of some sort!) are in the dungeons of the game, which are ever-evolving. In fact, if you progress far enough, you will find that the dungeon evolution is an actual *part of the game's storyline*.... but I digress. For your average player, this makes it an endless cycle of getting items, pricing items, selling items, returning to the dungeon, et cetera. \n\nMultiple adventuter characters show up in the game, each with an actual backstory to them. A story that one may have to dig deep to find, or go to certain locations at certain times, but that all exist to some degree or another. It just adds another layer of depth to a game that could be dull if done wrong.... but 'Wrong' is definitely not the case with this game, if my playtime doesn't say that loudly enough. \n\nI have a mental wishlist of what I would like in my perfect game. Recettear ticks better than 3/4 of those boxes, and adds its own spin on them. To that end, I honestly can't recommend it highly enough for people like me who enjoy 'roguelikes with a purpose', particularly when they include good characters and a few mysteries and hidden secrets to go along with them, not to mention after-campaign challenges and reasons to keep playing even *after* you have 'finished' the game! \n\nThere may be a day when I finally get everything, and get completely bored with the game.

The item shop system is well designed, the characters are funny and the dungeons are... dungeons, I guess. It should also be mentioned that the game's story is told in passages like a visual novel, while dungeons and the shop are played with the sprites of the according characters.\n\nFirst of all, let's look at the item shop itself. To even have items for sale, you need to buy them first from merchants or find them in dungeons. Some items can only be found in dungeons, others can only be crafted with ingredients found in dungeons. Those items may be valuable, however, they are not essential for winning the game.\n\nTo sell items, you have to place them around your shop. Location is key, items placed at the windows will attract customers and have a higher chance of being bought. Furthermore, some items may become more expensive or cheaper for a short duration, so you have to adjust your prices and locations accordingly.\n\nNot every customer will simply buy everything at any price, they will try to haggle to either sell their item higher or buy yours cheaper. Depending on the current values of items, you may even offend customers, causing them to leave. Succesfully selling items will grant experience which is crucial in expanding your shop. In addition, not every customer likes every atmosphere. Little girls like bright shops while thieves and assassins like it a bit more sinister. Using decorations allows you to change the atmosphere of your shop, either attracting or repelling specific customers. Combine this with higher prices for highly demanded items to become rich very quickly.\n\nAs for the characters, they are almost all likeable. Most of them have some quirks which lead to funny dialogues or situational comedy, but often it's just Recettes comments that made me laugh. Phrases such as \"Holy carp!\"[NOT a typo] make the novel part of the game so enjoyable.\n\nThe dungeons are nothing special, randomly generated and filled with different monsters with different colours. To enter a dungeon, you'll have to recruit an adventurer first and actually pay them to work for you. Furthermore, going to a dungeon will take more time than running your shop, so I highly suggest you play through the dungeons on your NewGame+.\n\nThe graphics are not great, honestly speaking. While characters are well designed, the overall game is not an artistic masterpiece. The music is great, though. The qatchy themes made me stop playing just to listen to the music.\n\nAll in all, Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is a solid game with a few flaws, but tons of fun.

You can also go out into dungeons to search for items for free, and verse a plethora of enemies and bosses using adventureres as your guide.\n\nOverall I did find this game very addictive, but by the time I had finished the five weeks of paying off my debt I no longer needed to continue playing. I didn't get addicted to the dungeon gameplay, but I did find it amusing for a short period. The item selling is a unique mechanic which is the core gameplay, which you will find is the only reason people like myself stay to play. Yet after the five weeks it became repetetive and I was done with playing, I had no urge to play through the post-game content. Whilst I do highly recommend this game, I do also say that you won't really want to complete it 100% and there may be some factors in the game which may irritate you.

The anime-like art style, the character designs, the music, it\u2019s all basically adorable. The premise draws on the concept from your typical RPG of the ubiquitous items shop. But while in most games, these shops are pretty generic, this story takes it from the shop owners\u2019 perspective, selling to adventurers and townsfolk alike. It definitely plays like an RPG, but the majority of the focus is on resource management in the shop. Not that you can\u2019t go dungeon crawling if you want to\u2013and sometimes the variety is nice. While the whole buying and selling thing can be a bit repetitive, you are faced with time-management challenges and an increasingly complex market as time goes by. Plus, there are some fun character interactions mixed in, especially between Recette and Tear. I think the adorable relationship between these two\u2013and the stark contrast in their personalities\u2013is what truly makes this game. It\u2019s certainly what I enjoyed the most. As for sound, the music is simple but cute. There is some minimal character voicing, mostly just set phrases, which is all in Japanese but is quite well done; the timing and quality of the actors really does add to the overall flavor of the game, although none of the actual words will make sense unless you have at least a basic understanding of Japanese. All the written text has been translated to English, though, so it\u2019s completely playable\u2013also, the translation is actually quite good.

So, warning to others like me with potato computers; the game can cause issues if you have an OpenGL under 2.0!\nTo everyone else with 2.0 or above, the game is a lot of fun and an easy recommendation if you like RPGs (especially dungeon-crawlers!) :D", "timestamp_created": 1499033141, "timestamp_updated": 1499291219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485576927661895752", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33114695": {"recommendationid": "33114695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979999540", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1560, "last_played": 1480193650}, "language": "english", "review": "Initially, I thought Recettear would be more of a light business simulation type game with some JRPG elements, but after a couple of Game Overs, I quickly realized that this was basically another dungeon crawler with a twist.\n\nThe main storyline is very short, so it quickly devolves into an 'infinite survival mode' grind type thing after you finish the actual story.

The object of the game is to make enough money to meet each week's deadline and pay off the ever increasing amount. Despite this, Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is a genuinely fun, cute, and surprisingly relaxing game. The game is split up into two core mechanics, shop management and dungeon crawling. The first being exactly what it sounds like. You decorate your shop, place items in key locations to attract customers, take orders, stock up on items, pay attention to item related trends, haggle, and BUY LOW AND SELL HIGH! The dungeoneering aspect revolves around your partnerships with a couple adventurers whom you control in the dungeons, going through levels in order to obtain loot to sell in your shop. There are 4 periods in a day: Morning, Noon, Evening, and Night. Certain places are only open on certain hours or on certain days. Due to how long it takes (2 periods), visiting the dungeon can only viably be done in the mornings. Due to this mechanic, I felt it necessary to start the game over once or twice because about 3 weeks in, I began to have trouble putting together the amount needed each week. It was only after consulting the wiki and guides that I was able to figure out how to spend each day wisely. Overall it's a very fun game. I would recommend tweaking the controls to your liking if you're playing with a keyboard as the game uses the default japanese layout for it's controls, or just play with a controller (that's the method I prefer).\n", "timestamp_created": 1496100208, "timestamp_updated": 1496100208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32048452": {"recommendationid": "32048452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047312042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 673, "last_played": 1496086697}, "language": "english", "review": "negotiate the price", "timestamp_created": 1496087010, "timestamp_updated": 1517406955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413743913173675537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32029921": {"recommendationid": "32029921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046652573", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 2977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2976, "last_played": 1511504285}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very fun and addictive game. However, if you don't have the right strategy it can become an extremely frustrating game. First, save a lot. Second, pay attention to announcements. When item prices go up, you can sell those particular items for up to 300% profit! When item prices go down, buy them cheap from the merchants - stock up! If you are going dungeoneering, enter the dungeon first thing in the morning because that takes 2 our of 4 time slots to complete. **Remember to spend your time slots wisely** Have at least 2 of each item-type because you never know when a customer will want them. Get to know your customers and the amount they can pay. To increase your merchant level faster, which is the most important thing to do besides making money, you will want to sell on the first try with back to back customers. Not only does that increase your level faster, it also makes the customers happy. Purchase different types of decor for your space as you will need to modify it to increase the number of customers who stop by to shop. Always ask Tear about the status of the shop's decor before you open your doors. On her grid, you want to be at the center. When certain items are in demand you can sell them for from 200-300% profit, depending on the customer. Finally, place the items you want to sell most by the North-facing windows. As your merchant level goes up, you will unlock new things. Take advantage when you can pay the weaponsmith to increase the size of your shop. I won the main game without purchasing Vending Machines. Not sure if they are a good investment. Is the game worth $19.99? Maybe, if you love haggling like a merchant, Japanese-style games with cute art and dialogue, crafting and making money.

At first glance, Recettear looks like a rather dated game centered around the niche topic of running an item shop in medieval-style world. Characters are 2-D sprites in a 3-D game world that would look at home on a PS1, and dungeon crawling is a simple hack-and-slash with different unlockable adventurers bringing a different class and playstyle to the table. While the game is hardly complicated or difficult, it is definitely charming and captivating. However, it is so much more than that, and the game really impressed me with it's hidden depths.\n\nTo shorten things a bit, the core game and plot is about Recette, a little girl whose missing father has a large unpaid loan about to default. In order to not lose her home, Recette, with the help a 'loan-shark' fairy named Tear, open an item store and begin trading in order to make enough money to make the weekly loan repayment. As you might expect, as the weeks pass, the amount required to pay grows exponentially until you either fail or manage to make the final payment. The main plot spans about 5 ingame weeks, and should you fail to make a payment, you start a new 'loop' from Day 2 with every item you owned as well as whatever cash you had left - this greatly helps remove the frustration of having to start all over from scratch.\n\nSo you might think that this is an easy game to beat. Well, yes, but the real meat and potatoes comes from post-game content. Beating the main game unlocks Endless mode, where you simply continue running the item shop with no more loans to pay back; New Game+, which starts a new loop with money and items carried over; and Survival mode, which has never ending weekly loan payments that grow until they overwhelm you.\n\nIs there a point in continuing your save free from debt? Hell yes there is. You see, the core game with its dungeon feature only barely scratch the surface of the content and characters the game has to offer. Within the first in game month, you are highly unlikely to meet even half of the available adventurers you can hire, unlock all dungeons, or even make a dent in the item encyclopaedia. In fact, there is essentially a post-game questline to still follow through to the end!\n\nConsidering that I expected the game to be focused on that one lone month of paying bills, I was impressed with how polished the gameplay mechanics are, and pleasantly surprised by the amount of content this game has that adds to replayability. For how the game looks to the average person viewing the store page, this game is diamond in the rough, and I wholly recommend it if you want a light-hearted game to drop hours into", "timestamp_created": 1491835939, "timestamp_updated": 1492579036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31003222": {"recommendationid": "31003222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053754822", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1113, "last_played": 1492942559}, "language": "english", "review": "Capitalism Ho!", "timestamp_created": 1491593539, "timestamp_updated": 1491593539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540179312229156494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30994686": {"recommendationid": "30994686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332323516", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1473, "last_played": 1592489058}, "language": "english", "review": "One hell of a game!", "timestamp_created": 1491561809, "timestamp_updated": 1491561809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497810184955596924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30982456": {"recommendationid": "30982456", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971994305", "num_games_owned": 1090, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1559094687}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my fav JRPGs!", "timestamp_created": 1491498043, "timestamp_updated": 1491498043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30973513": {"recommendationid": "30973513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108941850", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 3428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3428, "last_played": 1491413068}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple and charming game. \n\nYou have to both manage your shop and go dungeon crawling.

Sometimes, a lot of the same one will show up... and it's kinda creepy.\n[*]Enemy designs are also limited. Most are just palette swaps of the first dungeon's enemies.\n[*]The HUD is clean & easy to navigate. It could use some polish, but it's fine as it is.\n[*]It offers windowed & fullscreen.\n[/list]\n\n[*][b]Music:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The shop's theme is pleasantly happy.\n[*]You'll get tired of the looping dungeon music... but it's nothing that bad.\n[*]The game has full volume control. You can mute effects and music independently.\n[/list]\n\n[*][b]Story:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]By far, the worst part of the game. Characters are flat, one-dimensional and generally boring. So, don't be expecting some Harvest Moon-style relationships to develop.\n[*]Each companion has a miniature story that's revealed through events.\n[*]This is not a RPG, its story is extremely short and it resets to the beginning once you pay off your loan.\n[*]Due to the reset, you'll often see a character's first event several times before you see their second, simply because you weren't focusing on their story in your previous playthroughs. Events ARE skippable, though, so don't panic.\n[*]The dialogue often strains to be funny, but just sounds dumb. There are a lot of flat jokes, clumsy references, etc.\n[/list]\n\n[*][b]Gameplay[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Recettear uses a mix of time management and dungeon crawling that's like a very stripped down version of Persona 3.\n[*]This not a shop simulator. It's a dungeon crawler with a shop mini-game. You will need to spend a LOT of time in the dungeons.\n[*]Combat is really simple. Companions have only one normal attack and a few, often useless, special attacks that consume mana. It's boring and mindless, but sometimes that's what you want in a game.\n[*]The shop mini-game is fun and relaxing. You can change the shop's look, put items on display and haggle over the prices.\n[*]Unfortunately, haggling is pointless (and the game penalizes you for doing it). Since all generic customers have one of four fixed budget ranges, you'll quickly find the \"sweet spot\" for prices and stick with it.\n[/list]\n\n[*][b]Spoiler-free Tips:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Remember to visit the blacksmith. He'll eventually offer item crafting and shop expansions.\n[*]Items that you're buying will still show the \"Price Up\" and \"Price Down\" colors (red & blue). Don't be fooled, you're the only merchant these matter to. The blacksmith & wholesaler will still charge the normal price. This means you can buy a bunch of hot items and turn them for massive profits. (Assuming you don't overbuy!)\n[*]The \"mood\" of the store's decorations affects which companions show up to shop.\n[*]Customers start with small budgets. It is absolutely essential that you increase them by buying/selling items WITHOUT haggling and at prices within their \"sweet spot\". If you don't do this, they won't be able to afford the more expensive items... and you'll be screwed.\n[*]Don't neglect your Merchant Level. Raising it is how you unlock crafting recipes and store expansions. Your Merchant Level increases the same way customers' budgets do... so that's one more reason to NOT haggle and make sure you hit that sweet spot.\n[*]In case it wasn't obvious, the \"Near\" and \"Just\" bonuses that you see after transactions are indications that your price was in the sweet spot. (i.e. near it, on it)\n[/list]\n[/list]\n\nAll told, it's a simple game that offers simple joys. People who like grinding for crafting ingredients will enjoy Recettear, since that's by far the largest part of it. The rest of us can also find some fun redecorating the shop and playing the mini-game. Get it on sale, if you're interested.\n\nOh, and I strongly recommend newcomers google a guide on making money. The game is short and the loan payments ramp up VERY fast. For those who don't want to \"cheat\", let me just say reselling [spoiler]sweets (Watermelon, Takiyaki)[/spoiler] is a good starting point and [spoiler]Mermaid Shoes (Level 1 Shoes)[/spoiler] are very profitable once you unlock item crafting.

The characters are likeable and you learn more about them as you take more time out of the day to explore the city. It's almost like Final Fantasy 6 in the second half of the game.\n\nAll I can say is--this game is amazing. Honestly--the best way I can describe this game is a item shop tycoon/dungeon crawler/visual novel, all jumbled into one game. And yes, I said visual novel, which I will get into later.\n\nSo the primary premise of this game is that you run an item shop on a day to day basis, kind of like a Diner Dash-esque sort of game. From start to finish, the primary goal of the game is to make enough money to pay off your debt in weekly installments. That might seem boring, but in actuality the plethora of options that are given to you at every given moment make the game so much more than an item shop tycoon game, and it makes for such a fun and unique experience.\n\nRegarding the item shop tycoon aspect of the game--it is spectacularly done. There is just so much that goes into managing your shop, that it just feels fresh while you progress through the game. What do you decide to put in front of your window, which will affect what kind and how many customers will come in? Should you decide to invest in expanding your shop? Should you buy vending machines for your shop, which allow for increased and automated sales at the expense of customer interaction?\n\nBut I think the absolute best thing they did with this game is the PROGRESSION that you learn all these things. Sooner or later, as you start to buy and sell more things, and decide what to do with your shop, you start to distinguish between the different kinds of customers that want to buy things. There is simply a consistent pattern--this kind of customer just won't pay that much for an item (and you will learn to hate those customers), and maybe this other kind of customer has a bit of coin left in their pocket, so you can maybe offer him a higher price. It's all very subtle and unstated, but learned by the player as you sell more items. It's honestly magical.\n\nAnd what will be your main strategy to earn your keep? Should you go buy from the market and take advantage of item booms and lows? Or go dungeoneering into the depths to procure items and sell for 100% profit? Should you choose to go dungeoneering, you will learn that it's a very difficult balancing act of opportunity cost. Should I keep this item, or toss it to pick up this one? Should I use this healing item, or risk killing mobs to wait until I level up, which will heal me fully? Should I progress through the dungeon to use the day more efficiently, or not take the risk and use the checkpoint to go back home?\n\nThe day is divided into four slices. For each slice, you can choose to open your shop, go to the market, explore the city, or go dungeoneering, all consuming a certain number of slices. However, should you choose to go to the market, exploring the city will not take up any additional time. It's an ingenious way to make the player able to enjoy the story-side of the game. When you explore the city, you will interact with the townsfolk, which will bring up a short scene with your characters and their friends. As you take the time to explore the city more and more, you realize that each character has a backstory to them, and they develop more and more. It's one of the things I enjoyed most about this game.\n\nThe only gripe that I may have about this game is that the dungeoneering is actually very difficult. The controls are tight and fair, but some of the bosses spike in difficulty and you may easily die if you are not prepared for them.

Is this fun? It sure is. \nAs the game was released (the first copy, not steam release) you do have to accept the fact that this game is aged. The graphic is near PS1, or early PS2 titles. Music is nice and cheerful. Story is charming, despite its actual story isn't. I think the character is helping out a lot. Recette, the protagonist, needs to pay her runnaway-father's debt of his house, otherwise she will be homeless.\n\nThe sim itself is well made- you have certain amount of time in each day (works like turn basis) and you have few options to get yourself a money; buy/sell from other store, hire a client for dungeon crawling, or open your shop. Your merchant level increase by selling item in FAIR prices, and as it goes higher, you can sell things differently- such as custom order, or purchase vending machine, etc. Each customer will have different preference. So, you likely don't sell long sword to a little girl well, she would likely want to get food or books. Time also affect what kind of customer you'll bring in.\n\nThe dungeoun crawling is very straight forward, but the dungeon is randomly generated. You can use an item you find in dungeon, or save it to sell them later.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has 1 massive issue for me- the sheer difficulty. Almost to the point of unnecessary. Each week you have a set of debt that you need to pay back. The debpt increases by each week, however, it increases in such a rapid pace- first week is 10,000 second week is 30,000... so on. This is caused by the fact that you only have 5 weeks to finish the payment. In order to finish game fast, you have to have pure luck, as the entire game is randomly generated. The random event occurs from 2nd week (such as gold booming or bad reputation towards all of sword) and I truly mean randomly generated- even if you save/load, you will get random event. The meeting with important character (playable) is also randomly generated. All of the treasures in dungeon is randomly generated. \nTo cover this issue, the Recettear allows you to carryout your items once you hit \"game over\". Your money will reset to 1000 while all of your items remains the same. \n\nI understand that forcing you to cycle the game was their only plan to make this game feel less short then already is. THe problem? Well, once you got gameover, you will be sent back to day2. You can repeat this over and over until you beat the game. It gets repetitive, I also felt less encouraged to go back to day 2 from day 30. \n\nThis game is impressive \"doujin\" game, as this entire project was done by single person. Still, $20 price tag can seriously compete with other titles. \nThe game itself is good, however, it may not fit for everyone.

Here's what you'll expect.\n\nThe main focus of the game is to run a store to pay off a debt. Every week, you have to meet a payment and each time you pay, the next payment increases. If you fail it's game over, but not really. If you fail to pay your game timer is reset, you lose all your money and start from day 1, but you keep the items, store progress and character progress meaning the next attempt is easier. It does however count as a second run so you won't have a \"perfect\" save file if you lose at all.\n\nTo help run your shop, you hire people to run dungeons for you. You explore at least 5 floors of a dungeon, 4 large areas then a boss. During these dungeons, you find items to sell in your shop but your inventory is limited, so you have to pick amd choose what you want to bring with you. The combat during these sections is simple, but engaging. Think of classic Zelda as a reference. You have a basic attack and later you learn a few skills. You will find yourself dying quite quickly if you just run around spamming the attack button, especially on bosses.\n\nAside from the shop managment and dungeon crawling, anothre thing I adore about this game is the dialogue. The interactions between the different characters is well written, funny and sometimes pretty random. There are even small bonus dialogue events if you take the time to head into certain areas of town when you have the chance.\n\nOverall, a fun, cute, engaging game that offers alittle of everything from different genres.

I find them to be a linear experience and pretty much akin to reading a comic book with less panels. It's a genre that for me to really enjoy, it needs to have something extra thrown into the mix. War of the Human Tanks had a strategy aspect to it. Loren the Amazon Princess was a turn based RPG.\n\nWhich brings me to Recettear, This game has been on my radar for many years but I was always afraid to make the plunge but Steam sales being what they are, here I am twenty hours later and I loved every minute of it. Recettear takes the style of visual novels for its storytelling and throws in shop management and an extremely in depth dungeon diving/crafting system.\n\nThe games story is rather simple, one day a fairy named Tear shows up at your door.(Hence RecetTEAR) She explains that your father has disappeared/passed away and now all his debts have fallen to his daughter, Recette. Our main character is daft as a bird so Tear decides to help her run an  item shop so she can pay back her debt. Spoilers! You owe close to a million bucks in debt and have a month to pay it! Capitalism, Ho!\n\nYou will have to buy low, sell high, bargain, and pinch every single penny to be able to make all the payments in time. While it seems daunting the game gives you plenty of opportunity if you're smart.\n\nRecettear is a cute game. When I say cute, I mean this is bubblegum and rainbows type of visuals, story, and mechanics. If you happen to be a fan of anime you're going to be right at home here, but those who are unfamiliar with the style may be thrown off by it. Just expect giant cute googly eyes , fairies, and plenty of over the top emoting. Obviously the game has an anime aesthetic when it comes to character design so I am not going to talk about that all that much. It's a 'you like it or don't' type of scenario. I thought the characters were well designed but general run of the mill fantasy anime stereotypes. Where things completely change is in the dungeons and shop management.\n\nOne very important thing to note is that the game is not in a 16:9 resolution. This like most other Japanese visual novels comes in a 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\nShop management is done in an over the top view where you can control our main character, Recette. The game really reminds me of Paper Mario where you are a flat RPG sprite running around 3d environments. Its really well done and gives the entire game a dynamic feeling. Your shop is your bread and butter. You will spend about half the game there. You can re-design your shop, re-arrange just about everything and place items to sell.\n\nThere is an atmosphere system that depending on how your store looks will attract certain customers. Lean towards gaudy and expect a couple shady people, design in heretical tones and maybe a demon might show up. It's something I really thought was great and wish it had been expanded upon more. There are only about two dozen people in the game to sell too. So don't expect it to get that deep sadly.\n\nIf you are a wise shop-keeper, the best idea is to get something for nothing and sell it at a high price. Enter the Adventurers guild where you can hire a character you've befriended and go into dungeons for rare treasure. This aspect to the game is almost in itself a whole other game. This is where that Paper Mario aspect really kicks in, except Recettear is all about real time combat. Which can lead to some moments where your depth perception is going to be thrown off. It's not a huge deal but it happens frustratingly.\n\nYou run around randomly generated environments battling monsters, bosses, and avoiding traps. There are a total of eight unique heroes that you meet throughout the story and some you can access playing in the games Endless mode. Heroes all have their own unique equipment, abilities, and different fighting styles which is amazing. The adventurers all buy their equipment from your shop, so its up to you to equip them properly. You can let them \"borrow\" items for a dungeon delve but that takes up valuable inventory space for treasure. Level progress is done in a survival of four levels and then a boss level, you have to option to leave at that point or move on for another five levels.\n\nThe entire dungeon system is really awesome and for the first part of the game is super useful. Things start to fall apart though nearing the final weeks of the Story mode. Most of the treasure in the first 3 dungeons don't scale up with the amount of money that you need to pay your debt. By the time you get to the final week where you owe 500k, you are hopefully dealing in sales around 20-70k per transaction. Where dungeon loot maxes out at 1-10k. The reason being, is that the developer wanted the end game content to be all about that shiny treasure you find and give you a reason to come back. Once you complete the initial story mode, additional dungeons are available that have upwards of 500k type of treasure. I understand to control balance, why this was done, but it doesn't make dungeon diving a rewarding experience in the later half of story mode.\n\nAs you progress through the weeks, you earn merchant levels that give you access to more crafting recipes, more customization options, and store expansions which allow you to put up more for sale. You earn merchant levels through successfully haggling with your customers. It's a rather awesome system and feels super rewarding when you sell that big ticket item you wanted. There are market fluctuations, trends, and people who will want to sell items to you. These market fluctuations are a BIG deal and the key to beating the game. Buy low, sell high.\n\nPeople selling you items is my BIGGEST gripe with this game. Imagine dealing with hundreds thousands of pix(gold) and selling antiques, magic weapons and armor and then suddenly someone wants to sell you a lottery ticket and haggle over the price. This happens quite often and by the end of the game If I bought one more dang cherry I was going to lose my mind. While customers gain more of a gold pool through successful interactions and earn trust levels. It would seem that the item pool that they draw from doesn't ever upgrade. Keep in mind, this is solely based off my experience in Story mode.\n\nAside from the minor gripes mentioned, Recettear is a fun and enjoyable game. It never gets dull to set up your shop just the way you want it and make oodles of money. Dungeon diving, while not super rewarding near the end, is far more complex and extends well beyond the end of the game. The item encyclopedia is robust and you could probably triple my game time trying to fill it out completely. Additionally from the Endless mode, you have New Game+ mode which is more or less the same experience except you keep all items, levels, etc. There is also a survival mode where the amount of money required to pay your bill keeps rising until you can't keep up.\n\nThe game features controller support, delightful voice work and a jaunty little soundtrack that matches the tone of the game very well. The game doesn't have steam cards or achievements which is kind of a bummer. I can only assume this has to do with Recettear being translated for an English audience and not the other way around.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I got about twenty hours purely out of story mode. The game has amazing replayability if you enjoy its mechanics. I got the game on sale for $2.99 which made the game worth it and more then I could have ever hoped. I still think the game is worth it even if you can't nab it on sale though. It's not a perfect game but its unique and innovative and mixes genres very well. I couldn't stop playing the game from beginning to end and there is still more to do to the games credit.\n\nIf you are in the market for a visual novel but want to stray off the beaten path, Recettear is an easy choice.

Each adventurer you can hire has a form of a story to tell, and you can unlock dialogue and events in the dungeons by exploring them.\n\nThe adventurers also have different play-styles, which you can unlock as you progress further through the plot and dungeons. Some adventurers, dungeon events, dungeons, map interactions, and shop interactions can only be unlocked in the post-game, which I would suggest playing all the way through. \n\nWhen I first played this game, I thought it would just be another anime game, however there is a surprising amount of content in this game.
