This game is from 2014, so maybe I can excuse how bad the characters look and how empty the areas are. However, this game called \"A Story About My Uncle\" barely has the uncle and he tells the MC to fuck off at the end anyway. You can barely interact with anything, even though you are expected to explore the village areas. The best part is the movement. Once you get the rocket boots, it is super fun flying around from platform to platform and barely recovering when you mess up. I wish you could use the rocket boots throughout more of the game. Overall, I don't think this is worth $15; it took me only an hour to finish all the levels and I doubt they will ever add anything else.

I was probably 30% in, after only like 1 hour.  Not really worth it for the price, IMO -- the platforming (and secrets discovery along the way) is all there is, and it's all failure unless you are retracing or going on the anointed path -- which is sometimes pretty hard to spot.  I would guess that about 1/3rd of this game is guessing where the path is, and another 1/3rd is respawning and trying to same trick, which you can figure out, but not manage the timing of without some luck, over and over again.\n\nThe controls are not very forgiving... ironically extending the short game (in a bad way).  Not sure if it's intentional, but it doesn't feel good -- you feel like you're fighting with them a bit, not immersed.\n\nIt looks like a high res X360/PS3 port to 4K 60 Hz.. like they upscaled the textures, but it doesn't look pro.  The models are low res.  The animations are.. certainly not motion-captured, and not overly good.  The art execution is meh, but the style is good.

En fin, la historia sobre mi t\u00edo, es un juego muy sencillo en la practica y que no tiene mucho misterio, es b\u00e1sicamente un plataformero r\u00e1pido, con mucha mucha mec\u00e1nica de grappling y mucho movimiento a\u00e9reo, lo cual le da un punto y un ritmo diferente al juego.

Me encantaria una secuela que a\u00f1ada mas cosillas al movimiento y por supuesto con un nuevo lavado de cara, pero bueno, es mas complicado.\n\nLe doy un 8/10 para el juego que es.

It all begins with a heartfelt conversation with your daughter, weaving together past and present.\n\nYou start by exploring Fred's home in search of him, but your quest takes an unexpected twist when you stumble upon his observatory and a custom-fitted power suit designed just for you. This suit transforms your journey into a mesmerizing, gravity-defying experience.\n\nThis game stands as a rare breed\u2014a first-person platformer. We've seen glimpses of this genre, notably in \"Mirror's Edge,\" but here, it focuses on precision platforming that quickly puts your skills to the test.\n\nYou're armed with a versatile toolkit from the get-go, including basic jumps, power jumps, and a trusty grappling hook. The challenges come at you swiftly, introducing you to these mechanics through a thrilling obstacle course that seamlessly integrates with the narrative.\n\nYou'll encounter Maddie, a young frog-like creature living in a village who knew your uncle. They join you in your search, offering their assistance. The plot thickens as you uncover mysteries and the village's peculiar frog-like residents. Beneath the seemingly innocent surface, fear and uncertainty linger.\n\nThe game's mechanics are relatively straightforward, but they demand precision. You must master the art of momentum, angle, and timing for jumps and grappling hook use. Aiming for that perfect swing is both thrilling and challenging. The controls, whether on a gamepad or keyboard and mouse, are intuitive and responsive.\n\nWhat sets this game apart is its narrative. It boasts substantial dialogue and a compelling story, despite occasional language and voice acting hiccups. You genuinely care about the characters and their fates. The early sections of the game, with their slower pacing, draw you into the world, allowing you to see your uncle not just as a plot device but as a person.\n\nTrial and error are the name of the game here, but constant checkpoints and instant respawns ease the frustration of failing challenging platforming segments.\n\nVisually, the game shines, with vibrant lighting effects and breathtaking scenes. Character models, however, seem dated in comparison.\n\nThe sound design masterfully crafts an atmospheric and unsettling ambiance, immersing you in a world where fear lurks in the shadows, despite the absence of traditional enemies.\n\nIn conclusion, \"A Story About My Uncle\" transcends its individual components to create an exceptional experience. Its compelling story, impressive visuals, and demanding yet fair platforming challenges make it a must-play for those who appreciate games that both challenge the mind and the reflexes.", "timestamp_created": 1695529924, "timestamp_updated": 1695529924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559819400310516357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146808129": {"recommendationid": "146808129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800731046", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1678668454}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is actually so beautiful, I would strongly recommend this to anyone.

While the game boasts creative mechanics and a captivating atmosphere, it is not without its drawbacks. \n\nThe jumping mechanic, which allows players to swing from point to point with a grappling hook, is the game's shining feature. It offers a sense of freedom and fluidity as you navigate this mysterious world. The sensation of soaring through the air is captivating, and zipping from platform to platform is very fun... when it works.\n\nSadly, the inconsistency in the jumping mechanics becomes apparent as you progress through the game. The length from which you can grapple to objects seems to change from puzzle to puzzle, which can be frustrating and disrupt the otherwise fun experience. The game's difficulty curve is uneven, often featuring sudden and unexpected spikes in challenges, especially in the last two stages. Some sections require very specific timing and execution, leading to frustrating trial-and-error gameplay.\n\nThis game is short, like two hours tops. I've got it heavily discounted for like two euros, so I can't really complain much about its shortcomings, but if I were to buy it at full price, I'd be pissed, to say the least.\n\nRecommended, but at a discount.\n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1691037976, "timestamp_updated": 1691037976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517627477645874023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143248987": {"recommendationid": "143248987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357789377", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1690965079}, "language": "english", "review": "I started playing the game years ago and just picked it back up yesterday.

for shorter time than a chicken can and to make it worse with no guide whatsoever, which you can't help but admit that it makes everything even more annoyingly challenging in a game with bazillion flying rocks especially in much much darker areas (which also happen to be a completely different level of annoying). \nall these things obviously kill the fun of the game and to make it worse i just don't like the characters especially that reptile avatar step daughter, i don't enjoy the levels for the most part, and jumping straight to my third objection, i just don't like the story. i'm super

That\u2019s how I\u2019d sum up this game. \n\nTLDR: I have completed the game at time of review, and I can confidently say everything is /almost/ good. Story is almost good and the narrator is the only real thing holding it together. Main reason I kept playing instead of quitting instantly at the hour mark. Gameplay and controls could almost be good. But it falls short (literally & metaphorically) and becomes an annoying, rage-inducing mess. \n\nThe core gameplay is a grapple & power-jump mechanic. You\u2019d expect it to follow a kind of \u2018normal\u2019 physics, similar to a spiderman swing, but NO. It does whatever it wants and isn\u2019t very repeatable. This leads to an exasperating experience where you keep plowing directly into rocks just to loose your momentum, fall and die. Your jump dosen\u2019t sync very well to the audio cue, and sloppy controls don\u2019t sync well, so you jump short, fall and die. Other times you can\u2019t see the destination and then fall and die. It\u2019s not fun. It could have been, but it isn't. \n\nEverything else about the game is just\u2026alright. Story is cute, but not compelling. Music is there. Characters are pretty one dimensional. The whole 'story' is to find your Uncle, and you do, but for less than two minutes, and he sends you back away to never see him again. There is a translatable language, but no reason to figure it out. The one enemy you encounter is just to annoy you rather than present an actual challenge. \n", "timestamp_created": 1676347358, "timestamp_updated": 1676348320, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132770119": {"recommendationid": "132770119", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971742463", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1676318154}, "language": "english", "review": "Spider man but better", "timestamp_created": 1676290635, "timestamp_updated": 1676290635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132683346": {"recommendationid": "132683346", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026722276", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1586095509}, "language": "english", "review": "I still remember this game.

"review": "'A Story About My Uncle' is a Spider-Man web slinging game. No, there's no actual Spider-Man here, but the most prevalent gameplay mechanic here is shooting an energy rope at targets and using them to swing to further targets. You're only allowed to land on small floating islands; missing a target or an island usually means plummeting to your death and quickly being reset to the first part of the chain of islands you're trying to get through at the moment.\n\nReaching some places also requires high-jumps and sprinting off the edges of islands, and there are also a few more abilities I didn't reach yet; I gave up at almost three hours, probably halfway or 2/3 of the way through the game. The problem is that it's tedious; the targets are small and easy to miss unless you've flung yourself just right. Also, your energy rope pulls you straight towards them, and touching them stops your forward momentum and usually results in a death and a reset. (The reset never undoes much progress, but several places required dozens of attempts to get past, and that was frustrating.) It's also completely linear, meaning that the only exploration you'll do is to figure out where you're supposed to go next (which is more difficult than it should have been in the caves, which were very dark and made me with the settings had a gamma setting; once I set the brightness at the very beginning of the game I saw no way to change it).\n\nThe writing is a little bit clumsy, and the voice actors are stiff. There are collectibles to find, but the difficulty of making any progress through the levels stole any desire I had for that.\n\nThis game has promise, but I think it needs to have been made quite a bit more forgiving and also have some of the long repetitive sequences trimmed down.

The basic idea is really cool but I feel like it could have been honed much more precisely\n- the most frustrating part for me was, I didnt know where to go at some places: The surroundings are beautiful, dont get me wrong, but extremely repetitive so it is sometimes very hard to make out what you already have passed and what is your road to walk. That happened quite a lot because of the aforementioned visual issues.\n\nI didnt take much joy from this but got mostly frustrated, even though I saw great potential in this game: I only finished it in order to get closure: the story is okay with a small second layer of plot revealing itself at the end (which disappointed me tbh). Voice acting was meh \nin conclusion: I would give it a 5/10 but tended towards thumbs down because I really didnt enjoy it much even though this is exactly my kinda game. \nlittle tip: \"The valley\" does basically the same as this game but much better in terms of physics and visuals. But at the expense of a story :) \n", "timestamp_created": 1671019596, "timestamp_updated": 1671019596, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128506220": {"recommendationid": "128506220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286870722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 155, "last_played": 1670757969}, "language": "english", "review": "So good somehow??", "timestamp_created": 1670964374, "timestamp_updated": 1670964374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128403724": {"recommendationid": "128403724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198447873012", "num_games_owned": 537, "num_reviews": 192, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1670814008}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely worth it if you get it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1670814109, "timestamp_updated": 1670814109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128318922": {"recommendationid": "128318922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198796314965", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1670707142}, "language": "english", "review": "if you get motion sick easily dont even think about it", "timestamp_created": 1670707210, "timestamp_updated": 1670707210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128269589": {"recommendationid": "128269589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159608464", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1547474825}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1670649659, "timestamp_updated": 1670649659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128261473": {"recommendationid": "128261473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987983932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1655768766}, "language": "english", "review": "I was tricked by the allure of cool grapple mechanic and disappointed by the monotony of the 1-path levels.", "timestamp_created": 1670638146, "timestamp_updated": 1670638146, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128238068": {"recommendationid": "128238068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082995930", "num_games_owned": 1559, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1670608147}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but cute platformer.

This game is bad. It might be one of the worst I've ever played, it surely is the worst in its genre and by far the worst in my whole steam account.\n\nA Story about my Uncle is a perfect demonstration of how not to make a platformer, or a game in general. The controls, the collisions, the overall feel, the precision - they all feel off. You will fall hundreds, thousands of times (which is okay concearning difficulty because checkpoints are very frequent) while most of the time thinking \"why did he slide off, I was standing on solid ground?\", \"Why did he fall, I grabbed the rock?\", \"How could I miss that, the crosshair even lit up?\", \"Why didn't he jump, I released the button in time?!\" and so on and so on. \n\nCompared to other platformers where you see your mistake and know how to correct it, this game has to be learned pretty hard because you have to get used to do it \"wrong\", to jump too early to press buttons at awkward timings etc. \nThis is not the first game of this kind I've played: I have played and am a big fan of Mirror's Edge, I also enjoy both Dying Lights and, while I did not like the difficulty, Ghost Runner is also a game I've played for some time. So I know about first person platforming, have some experience and no, the game itself does not lag either. It really comes down to the game's design and neither my experience or hardware.\n\nYes, you can learn it. \nYes, checkpoints are frequent and fair. \nSo yes, you can complete it quite easily.\n\nBut no, if the whole game feels glitchy, unresponsive and therefore unfair, you have failed at crating a platformer. This is not about the difficulty, the game is frustrating for it's terrible movement.\n\nTo stay fair I've even sunk some mkore hours into the game, even trying to get the grapple and no-fail achievements. This is not a hasty rant, I've completed the game once and another time for achievements and collectibles. And I feel ashamed for having wasted all that time because even now after being really \"good\" at the game - compensating horrible controls and ridiculously bad design that is - I still hate it passionately and can't believe this game got shipped in this state.\n\nOh yes, and another minor thing: Don't expect a good story. Even as a Walking Simulator, even if you play \"just for the story\", you will be disappointed nontheless. The story is okay, kinda cute - but it leads to nothing, there is no twist, no interesting plot. The game looks nice and tries to show you a fantastic world, but everything is empty and quite boring, there is nothing to explore or experience.\n\n\nTruly one of the worst games of it's kind. I played years ago and was hoping for updates to fix the broken controls and systems, but unfortunately after replaying it the last few days I could only see that this game remains broken and unfun. A through and through terrible experience.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1662312675, "timestamp_updated": 1662312675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701394498348236084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121707844": {"recommendationid": "121707844", "author": {"steamid": "76561199276969842", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1689260883}, "language": "english", "review": "great game worth the 5 dollars definetly reccommend to anyone. the movement in it is just beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1662253659, "timestamp_updated": 1662253659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121650723": {"recommendationid": "121650723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123062907", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 608, "last_played": 1670374884}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Que hermoso juego la csm , me hizo sentir buenas emociones 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1662167331, "timestamp_updated": 1662167331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121644340": {"recommendationid": "121644340", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101086159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1662456781}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, nice controll scheme and great story.

You play as the man's younger self, equipped with your inventor uncle's various contraptions to navigate the cavelike world he was last known to explore. The devices power up as you go along, to the point that by the end you can cross tremendous distances and soar over great chasms. \n\nThe sensation is both tense and relaxing, like swimming in the air, or maybe a sci-fi twist of swinging on vines like Tarzan. The game feels like a very pleasant medley of other influences too: You've got the [i]Unreal[/i] engine world and physics, with puzzle mechanics and progression like [i]Portal[/i] (a theme with many of the games in my library), a [i]Myst[/i]-like soundtrack and ambience, in a world reminiscent of [i]Journey to the Center of the Earth[/i]. I think Steam recommended this one to me because of one or more of these influences, but I'm not sure.\n\nI played this one because it's one of the shorter ones in my library, with an expected playtime of 3-9 hours. This playthrough took me about 5 hours. I had played once before several years ago, but didn't remember much about it, not even where I stopped. [spoiler](Think it was shortly after meeting Maddy.)[/spoiler] A friend got it because he saw me playing it and [i]he[/i] finished it, but I never got around to finishing it until now. Near the end, your character says of Fred \"If he could do this, I can\"; similarly, my friend's winning the game gave me the extra \"It can be done!\" kick I needed to finish this one up.\n\nThe puzzles are not usually hard to figure out, but can be tricky to execute. Having a moving keyboard drawer can make them even more difficult. I did get stuck in a few places, but getting unstuck typically just meant hovering the cursor over things until it lit up. I technically didn't complete one puzzle: The game gave me a hint, and then when I failed many times and came close one time, it eventually (kindly) let me progress without fully solving it myself. The achievements tend to be either finishing a level without dying (er, falling, no lives in this game [i]per se[/i]) or doing it under a certain number of moves. If you're a very careful player, you might be able to get these in your first try. ([i]Narrator[/i]: Daniel was [b]not[/b] a careful player.) I would play this game again to try to master the levels enough to get the achievements.\n\nThere are also collectibles, which look like seismographs (saying so because the first one I saw I took for a regular prop) and which you can hone in on from their beeping noises. I only unlocked one Unlockable, which was a mode to change my beam color from blue to any custom color of my choice. And I think it happened because I collected X number of collectibles. There's a counter of how many you've collected so far in your Esc menu options. (I didn't see a similar counter for how many grapples you've used, so you may need to count those yourself -- or use as few as you can -- for the achievements.)\n\nPretty solid game, although I got caught in the geometry a few times. When I got caught, it was usually trying to figure out how to start a puzzle, rather than being in the middle of executing one. This happened in the ice cave level especially, where the geometry is very creative. Fortunately the game has a checkpoint system at fairly frequent intervals, with an option in the Esc menu to restart from the last one passed.\n\nIt packs in a lot of story for not being a long game, and does a very good job I felt with the story's closure.

It had some annoying bits near the end but this was a minor nuisance. My issue near the end was that it became difficult to determine what chunks of ground and rock one could grapple to. I didn\u2019t seem to have this issue before the ice caves level for whatever reason but it meant a lot more deaths than normal. The windmills earlier were also quite finicky. Overall I liked the grappling system as it made me try to plan out a route before taking the first jump. There are also a decent amount of augments you get such as extra grapples; rocket boots; super jumps; and cores that recharge your grapple mid flight. All of this makes you strategize when to use them so you don\u2019t run out mid flight. The story was at times basic but had some promise. You are searching for your missing uncle and need to explore this strange world to find him. My only complaint was that you don\u2019t learn more about the frog people and their history. For instance you get a companion who deciphers glyphs for you but they don\u2019t stick around long and there are plenty of glyphs after that point that I would have liked to know what they meant. The voice acting was very good. There wasn\u2019t much music in the game to judge. The graphics were decent overall. It was never a stunner but had some good art direction. The only bits that I thought looked weak, even for 2014, was the fire; hair and the frog people\u2019s feet. There were also some awkward transitions in the game where it loaded the next section of the game but only had a blank black screen. These transitions only took a couple seconds on my SSD but the first couple made me think maybe the game had frozen. I think adding a \u201cloading\u201d message would have been better. The ending seemed to be a bit flat and weak but I suggest waiting for after the credits when there is a post credits scene which ties things up nicer. \n\n\tI played A Story About My Uncle on Linux. It never crashed and I didn\u2019t notice any bugs. The game saves at checkpoints. Usually I don\u2019t like this over manual saves  but these were spaced out well for the most part and weren\u2019t a big problem. The game has a v-sync toggle; an FOV slider that goes from 60-120; three graphics settings; and three AA settings. I left V-Sync off as the game picked up my 144Hz refresh rate without it. Alt-Tab worked. The performance was very good. There were a couple bits where the frame rate dropped to 58 and 59 but these accounted for a total of about two minutes of my overall play time which was next to nothing. Typically the frame rate was above 80 FPS and was even over 100 FPS for a large chunk as well. I found that a keyboard and mouse worked great for this game which was impressive as platformers can be a mixed bag with them.\n\nGame Engine: Unreal 3\nGraphics API: OpenGL\nGame Version Played: Build 5188\nDisk Space Used: 1.3 GB\nInput Used: Keyboard and mouse\n\nGraphics Settings Used:  V-Sync off; FOV 100; all high; motion blur off; 8x AA\nGPU Usage: 0-100 %\nVRAM Usage: 737-915 MB\nCPU Usage: 8-25 %\nRAM Usage: 2.2-3.5 GB\nFrame Rate: 58-144 FPS\n\n\tOverall I think A Story About My Uncle was a solid platformer. If you like games like Valley you should like this. The story and presentation were good and the game play was more fun then nuisance. It had some areas to improve but was still enjoyable. I finished this play through in three hours and six minutes. I think it is worth it\u2019s current price tag of $16.79 CAD. \n\nMy Score: 7.5/10\n\nMy System: \n\nAMD FX-9590 | 16GB DDR3-2133 | XFX RX 590 8GB Fat Boy | Mesa 22.1.4 | Samsung 870 QVO 1TB |

Something you should about me is that i have severe panic attacks and lemmie tell you when i say the graphics are good i had to question what was real and what was fake.

to forget that video games are actually very fun for children, and thus are (were) primarily designed for children. A Story About My Uncle falls perfectly in this zone, and is an excellent kids' game. If you're looking to buy this for a pre-teen, like a 7 to 10-year-old, definitely go for it: the magic of a different world and strange aliens is well-realized, the story is simple enough, the graphics won't be a problem, and the levels are just difficult enough for their age range.\n\nUnfortunately, about 95% of the people reading this review are grown-ass adults trying to discern whether they should themselves play this kids' game, because apparently you can't outgrow childish things anymore (see also: the Star Wars fandom).

Moving around the set paths feels very smooth when you get a good rhythm going. There is never really any major combat or enemies in the game besides for one major one so there was never really much of a challenge besides for a few more difficult areas to traverse and a few times where the environment was changed so I had to take a few times to attempt to get through one area.\n\n--- STORY ---\nThe world building is good, from the start when you are first learning about your uncle while following in his path to find him to learning about the strays and their break off society. I was really engrossed in it as I played. The main narrator is great with most of the other voice acting being mostly good. Some of the bugs in the game did kind of make me do a reality check though as the npcs could be a bit janky\n\n--- Worth The Price ---\nAt the time of review the price is: \u00a311.39\nWorth the price? No, not at full price. The game only took me less than 3 hours to complete. On a heavy sale it is worth it.\n\n--- SCORE ---\n7 / 10\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1654979412, "timestamp_updated": 1654979412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116823149": {"recommendationid": "116823149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138480108", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1655039159}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with a short story and very satisfying gameplay, my only problem with this game is that there isn't more.", "timestamp_created": 1654964425, "timestamp_updated": 1654964425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116818816": {"recommendationid": "116818816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101837161", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1547174625}, "language": "english", "review": "The sprinting animation is the same as in Sanctum 2.\n\nSanctum 3 confirmed???", "timestamp_created": 1654958499, "timestamp_updated": 1654958499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116801518": {"recommendationid": "116801518", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987061720", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1655002402}, "language": "english", "review": "Challenging at the perfect level", "timestamp_created": 1654927058, "timestamp_updated": 1654927058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116745287": {"recommendationid": "116745287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058476412", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1654820893}, "language": "english", "review": "juegazo\n", "timestamp_created": 1654821006, "timestamp_updated": 1654821006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116733773": {"recommendationid": "116733773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122448654", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5949, "last_played": 1658714096}, "language": "english", "review": "its fun", "timestamp_created": 1654800278, "timestamp_updated": 1654800278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116715720": {"recommendationid": "116715720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399035634", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1694623885}, "language": "english", "review": "I know that it looks like I haven't played this much, but that's not true.

While a pretty game to look at with some rare moments of heart, this game struggles to satisfy as a platformer or a walking simulator. Lacking an emotional core to motivate player investment or a stable platforming system that doesn't result in constant false starts, this game can only be recommended as a curiosity to those interested in how an action-driven walking sim would play. Otherwise, stick to games that excel at either of those genres individually.\n\nYou play as a nameless nephew, reliving the story of his wondrous adventure in search of his uncle Fred. In searching for Fred, you must follow in the man's footsteps - across vast swaths of open air, chasms littered with floating rocks that are only navigable thanks to Fred's inventions. Largely through the use of a grappling beam, make your way through a half-dozen terrains as you meet different peoples, discover ancient remnants, and try to piece together what happened to uncle Fred.\n\n[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] tries to merge two typically separate genres: platformers and walking simulators. This game's gameplay largely consists of platforming, while it borrows the exploratory/narrative elements, short length, and the general structure of walking sims. Unfortunately, this game delivers underwhelming experiences on both fronts and thus leaves fans of either genre feeling disappointed. On the walking sim side, the game's story is bare-bones and lacking in emotional depth. Too many opportunities to offer immersion or character to the world are neglected, and what is shown feels one dimensional. Uncle Fred is too distant and enigmatic a character to develop strong feelings over, and there are simply no other characters worth mentioning - not even the one other named character. The epilogue is about the only time the game gets close to pulling a heartstring, though even the execution of that leaves players with more questions than answers.\n\nIn terms of the platforming, [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] delivers choppy and unpredictable gameplay. Grappling across sheer expanses should offer a thrilling breath of fresh air to players, but the experience more often verges on a strain as players must contend with the game's minimal UI and midair aiming akin to drunk Tarzan swinging on vines. The first major fault is the lack of notice for whether a player would be in range to grapple with an object in the distance; depth perception is shoddy in this game, leading to a ton of false start deaths. Momentum control is another, as plenty of barely-visible/moving areas prevent the player from accurately gauging whether they will hit the surface they're grappling towards, causing mid-flight death. Midair aiming can also be needlessly complicated by the lack of full 360-degree aiming, forcing players to sometimes lose bearings in low-light zones and thus get stuck trying to maneuver to latch onto a ceiling target while falling. The memorable pitfalls of this game's platforming outweigh its moments of wonder and exuberant traversal, that's for sure.\n\nThe game has relatively few strengths to compensate for its weaknesses. The environment design is one highlight: glowing blues and warm oranges color a luscious world, which though repetitive can help please the eyes over the course of the playtime. The soundtrack is not very memorable, though it too pads over areas with sufficient replayability. There are some bits of narrative dialogue offered via mementos scattered about the world that occasionally convey some charm. In terms of replay value, secrets scattered about the levels tied to unlocking new gameplay features could incentivize players who can tolerate the platforming to return.\n\n[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a cautionary tale about the experimental mixing of game genres. This game at its core seems to want to deliver the walking sim experience of an emotional journey about family and loss, but decided to dedicate most time and energy to implementing first-person platformer gameplay, largely botched that, and left the narrative elements underdeveloped as a result. Ultimately, while this game could still be appealing to genre die-hards and might even be worth a tepid recommendation at a sale price, there are simply better platformers and walking sims to spend your time with.

Instead the levels are linear, and most require a certain order to be able to get to the next platform/location.

A Story about My Uncle is a story where you hunt down your uncle through some strange fantasy sky-realm populated by frog-people. You do meet some frog-girl but damn if I cant remember her name, in fact all of the characters you meet, I cant remember. They seem to be really cookie-cutter and really poorly acted. The animations are really dodgy at best, as it seems like around the second act of the story, the characters started lacking a lot of detail in their animations, only using key frames.\nI finished this game in two hours, and apparently it can be finished even faster than that. Thing is, I was kinda hoping there was more and was sorely disappointed that there wasn't. \nOnto Character Arcs... There are none. The for girl decides to tag along with you for a noble reason \"finding your uncle\" but then in the next chapter decides to stay behind in the skylands because she didn't really want to find your uncle, she just wanted to escape. The story is written to think that this is a big decision, but the fact is that an hour of knowing her is not enough for me to get invested in her, and as such I really didn't care if she stayed or left. At least there's a time-trial mode, if you're into that.\nI also found that sometimes the platforming didn't work quite as it should.

Retell a magical adventure full of mysteries and intrigue, of strange creatures, enchanting caverns, dangerous beasts, and otherworldly places; the story about your uncle.  \n\n\n[b]Warning: this game can give you motion sickness; this issue is resolved by going into options and removing motion blurring and/or speed lines.[/b]\n\nBefore you buy, I\u2019m going to note here that I only recommend it depending on why you want to play A Story About My Uncle. If you want to play for the story, or you like speed runs and optional timed challenges, then yes, you\u2019ll probably like this! If you\u2019re playing with the intention of getting 100%, I doubt you will. A handful of achievements are actually kind of difficult to get, beating the game will take about 3+ hours, but 100%\u2019ing it? 10+. One is getting a gold medal on all timed challenges and the time constraints are\u2026 not going to be giving you much room for mistakes.\nWith that out of the way, the story is pretty good, the gameplay itself is really fun, you fly around 5 areas with a grappling hook and the speeds you can hit are exhilarating. Some of the paths you need to take aren\u2019t obvious and there is a bit of room for exploration, but all stages are linear. There are a bunch of collectables and story objects to interact with to enhance the world building, but the game ending is a bit disappointing. While I don\u2019t fully recommend A Story About My Uncle, I definitely don\u2019t hate it enough to give a negative review.  \n\nTL;DR: 3-10+ hrs, good story, fun gameplay, exhilarating speeds.

It's far from a must-play experience, but ultimately I found that I enjoyed it.\n\n\"A Story About My Uncle\" is a first person platforming game with a focus on a \"grappling hook\". It's a slow moving game that makes it relatively easy to get from point A to B. Even the hook isn't about smooth swinging and acrobatics... but functions as a hook shot that brings you straight forward. It works, but it feels more about being easy to handle rather than satisfying acrobatics. \n\nIt's obviously intended as a chill experience with very little in the way of punishment, speed, precision or dangers. I jumped from A to B and talked to people about stuff. But this relaxation is both a blessing and a curse and it leaves me a bit confused on how I feel.\n\nThe thing is.. the last level wasn't chill. There was dangerous levels of butt clench as I was forced to string together jet boots, falling stalactites, ice walls and precise landings. I hated it for the stress levels, but it was also the first time that I was having fun. \n\nMore fun events, unique challenges, and satisfying platforming occur in the last 25% of the game than in everything so far. It wasn't that they built up to it... but that they introduced the mechanics far too late and end up shoving half a games worth of progression into one awesome stage. \n\nBut even at it's best, the level design had MAJOR problems guiding the player forward. Probably more than a dozen times in 3 hours of play I needed to stop and struggle to find where to go next. The levels are 3 dimensional with lots of vertical space, and are made up of random asteroids and floating islands that lack defining features. Half a dozen times I ended up making what looked like the only possible jump... only to realize that I'd returned to the start of a stage. \n\nThe terrible guidance wasn't unforgivable because there's little punishment for mistakes, but it was a constant annoyance that started in the first stage and only ended with the game itself. Had there been an objective market, I'd probably have finished the game in an hour and half, but it would have been a better paced.\n\nThe game definitely ended on a high note and it's probably why I'm thumbs upping this. This could have been an absolutely amazing game had they unlocked skills earlier and introduced the challenges gradually... but as is.... its just a decent way to spend a few hours.", "timestamp_created": 1643086684, "timestamp_updated": 1643086684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108724273": {"recommendationid": "108724273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141462639", "num_games_owned": 642, "num_reviews": 218, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1673047766}, "language": "english", "review": "Coffee Stain's hidden gem.

This genre is quite prone to being a mixed bag, and unfortunately this title is no different. Before I elaborate, allow me to post some bullet points:\n\n[h2] PRO: [/h2]\n+ Nice Visuals and Environments (if a little samey)\n+ Nice Dialogue\n+ Cool Premise\n+ An Intriguing Mystery\n+ Fun Side-lore\n\n[h2] CON: [/h2]\n- Very Rigid Controls, sometimes finnicky (no midair control)\n- Optional collectables aren't fun to get, there is little sense of wonderment\n- Empty feeling world (zero character interaction, most environments are dark, dreary, NPC placement feels very \"sanitized\", as if a bunch of Garry's Mod ragdolls having been frozen next to one another at semi-regular intervals)\n- Not enough substance to warrant me continuing\n\n[h2] Review: [/h2]\nAs an artist myself, I'm by no means here to bash the developers and be all angry and hateful. I enjoy the effort, and I definitely see a potential player base that could enjoy this game (even just judging by the amount of Steam Reviews).\n\nThe game is rather nice visually, some it's lore is interesting, the central mystery of the uncle's whereabouts is intruiging, but it all sort of lost steam for me by the 90 minute mark and I only played an additional twenty to see if it got any better. I'm sad to say: it did not.\n\nLike mentioned in the overly long bullet points above: The game's world feels empty, the platforming just a little too slow, simple and yet strangely precise, a precision sadly not accounted for in the controls. For example there is this move the game shows you at the very start called the \"power leap\" where you perform a high jump (\"super jump\") and sprint at the same time, unfortunately, once you do so, you cannot adjust direction midair anymore.\nThe normal jump and power jump doesn't give you nearly as much forward momentum as you would expect either and the margin for error in actually jumping is little to none. In most platformer games, especially 2D ones, the game is automatically programmed so that there is a slight delay to when you're actually registered as having gone off a platform, so that if you press jump just a tiny bit too late, you still perform the jump (to account for the average human's reaction time and intuition). This is not present here and it feels wrong to me.\n\nThere is a village at the start of the game and it feels empty, there are obviously characters there, but they don't react to the player, barely to themselves even, as if they're all stuck in some far off fantasy land, perhaps a more engaging one than the one you, the player, are exploring. Them talking to each other makes barely any audible sound (if any! I actually can't remember.) And it all feels so \"scripted\" and, as said in the bullet points, \"sanitary\" like the NPCs have been surgically put there, with vast swaths of empty land and then a few NPCs and stock houses, placed at just the right angles, both the houses and the NPCs, it feels uncanny, as if lifeless life, a dollhouse hitting to close to actual home.\n\nLastly, and most importantly this was just not the game I was looking for. I recently played a game called \"Cyber Hook\", a fast paced first person platformer with a hookshot mechanic like the one here, but that one felt more organic, there was lots more momentum, speed and challenge that didn't feel stiff, meaning I could tackle a level in many ways. This game's grappling hook is just a puzzle mechanic, to a very simple puzzle, that feels unengaging to me, namely \"get from point A, to point B\".\n\nIt feels like the game is trying to have the precision and slow pace of a puzzle game, whilst simultaneously having the frankly banal gameplay loop of a normal platformer. Unfortunately there is a reason to why Sonic runs fast and Mario levels are filled to the brim with enemies, alt paths, pipes and powerups.\n\n[h3]Much love to Gone North Games and Coffee Stain Publishing either way, I wish you luck with future projects.

With your uncle\u2019s inventions you explore this world, uncover clues as to the whereabouts of your missing uncle, and meet new friends along the way.\n\nA Story About My Uncle is a first-person, narrative-driven platforming game where you travel through distinct areas in a strange world with the aid of several devices, most notable being a futuristic grappling hook.  Here you travel through the skies, up cliffs, and over yawning chasms by jumping, grappling, and swinging your way forward.  A Story About My Uncle is all about finding out where to go and figuring out how to get there.\n\nWhile the game is interesting, it is far from fun.  There were issues with the grapple mechanic that slowed the game to a crawl.  The story, while interesting in the beginning, fell flat early on and ended poorly.  Additionally, the voice acting was poorly done and grating.  In the end, it came down to not only the mechanics for the grapple but the numerous inconsistencies of the distance in which to grapple an object.  In a game where the placement of the grapple is just as important as being able to grapple an object; it is important to make this aspect of the game work, and its failure made the game unpleasant and frustrating.  I would not play this game again.\n\nAll the achievements are challenge mode\u2026for example, completing a level in a certain amount of time, or without falling, or using a limited number of grapples.  Getting these achievements will require multiple playthroughs and plenty of time and patience\u2014but well worth it in the end.  The good thing is after completing the game the first time you can jump between chapters.  Additionally, you can get achievements by finding all the collectibles or optional story items.\n\nI did not like A Story About My Uncle, but it was okay enough for me to finish the game.

The game is telling a story, so why not have the character tell it too?\nThe visuals are great, with each section having it's own vibrant colour scheme that makes the environment really come alive while you play.\nAnd my god, the gameplay.

Level design is pretty intuitive at the start but then suddenly there's just rocks everywhere and it's a 50/50 of can you grapple to this area or not because the distance of the grapple is completely random. The jump tends to be weird at times as well, and then there's the occasional bumping your head onto a rock will ruin your momentum.\n\n[b]Bugs:[/b] Sometimes you get stuck on rocks and are unable to move because you aren't technically supposed to be on top of this big rock. But also you can grapple on most surfaces, most of the time, except on this rock, and that other one yeah, and sometimes you phase through this rock and get stuck in it. Aside from the clipping, not much other issues.\n\n[b]Voice Acting:[/b] Pretty rough. Not the worst, but it's pretty emotionless most of the time. Kinda off-putting at the start of the game but you get used to it.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[b]Story:[/b] Yeah, it's pretty good, cute story. Nothing too spectacular in my opinion, although honestly I think my frustration with the end game just soured the ending for me. \n\n[b]Visuals:[/b] Very pretty. I took a couple of screenshots and was planning to do a screenshots run without the UI but I don't think I'll be doing a replay. Some non-puzzle areas are rather dark though. But it's a beautiful game. Just, don't zoom in on the characters. Don't.\n\n[b]Overall Rating: 6/10[/b]\nFun at the start, but the bugs and the level design at the end really just hinders the game for me. Was hoping to do an achievement run but I'll probably skip that. Decent game to buy on sale I suppose. Hesitantly recommend for the story.

No combat or anything, you just had to move through the level, and the path wasn't difficult to find. Also, I became interested in what this world was, and how \"Uncle Fred\" was connected to it. Even more so after meeting the frog people. The end wasn't anything to write home about, though.\n\nIn chapter 3, I started to use a Youtube walkthrough to validate I was doing the right things occasionally.\n\nIn chapter 4, I used it to frequently find the way without dying all the time. Towards the end of chapter 4 I was about to drop the game when I hit an egregiously frustrating sequence that I couldn't get past. I stumbled onto a set of cheats, used that to bypass that piece, and once or twice after -- arguably, I gave up more quickly now that I knew I didn't HAVE to do the frustrating stuff. I looked it up on Youtube to see where that guy was going, tried it a few times to understand what the problem was, and if it didn't work after a few tries I'd just skip it. The chapter that followed didn't exactly improve things either; I was mostly just bypassing things more than I was playing them. And, of course, they kept increasing the distances between checkpoints to an insane amount.\n\nIt's usually the imprecise controls. Forget the controller, that doesn't even work properly. Mouse controls felt weird at first because I'm not used to it, but it worked out. It's just imprecise, and some sequences require the right timing and angles and whatnot. That's just frustration until luck hits, or I bypass this with a cheat.\n\nIf you have a high tolerance for frustation for tiny scraps of progress, maybe this game is for you. Otherwise, stay clear.\n\nFunny enough, the cheats are actually built in -- they are just hidden, but can be accessed through a config file.

Otras te da la sensaci\u00f3n de que ya estuviste por ese lugar al ser todo bastante similar.\n\u2022 Historia demasiado rid\u00edcula, incluso para un juego de plataformas, un g\u00e9nero en el que no se acostumbran tramas demasiado profundas o atrapantes (hay much\u00edsimas excepciones por supuesto).\n\u2022 Cutre en muchos aspectos como sus gr\u00e1ficos, animaciones, o di\u00e1logos de sus personajes. \n\n[h1]Desarrollo[/h1]\nUn juego de plataformas en primera persona, que no puedo recomendar debido a lo mediocre que es, y la rapidez que tiene a la hora de volverse repetitivo, mal ejecutado y aburrido.\nA Story About My Uncle es un t\u00edtulo que no tiene una fama mundial impresionante, pero su nombre de vez en cuando me sonaba. Me encantan los juegos de plataformas y estoy intentando probar m\u00e1s juegos en primera persona para variar un poco, as\u00ed que era el momento perfecto para darle una oportunidad.\nAl principio no estuvo tan mal, los controles son buenos y un plataformero en primera persona, que haga uso de un gancho para columpiarte por todos lados no es algo que se ve siempre. El problema es que con el paso de los niveles, te das cuenta de que no hay m\u00e1s que eso. Saltar, engancharse, saltar, engancharse. Cuando me preparo para jugar un juego de plataformas, no espero algo muy complejo o ver cientos de mec\u00e1nicas distintas. Generalmente hay un salto o doble salto, un [i]dash[/i], puede que un [i]spin[/i], algunos se centran en dificultad o precisi\u00f3n, otros en que recolectes cosas. Lo que s\u00ed espero es cierta profundidad, ver que aprovechen bien las mec\u00e1nicas que presentan, por m\u00e1s simples que sean (hasta a un salto de pared o a un [i]dash[/i] se le pueden dar mil usos, y eso me lo dej\u00f3 muy clarito [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/][i]Celeste[/i][/url]) o que simplemente me diviertan, que se sientan bien al jugarlos.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2582313576\nEste juego solo consiste en ir saltando, columpi\u00e1ndose y ya est\u00e1. No aprovecha de distintas formas estas acciones, no impone limitaciones varias, u ofrece distintos elementos que te hagan reaccionar adecuadamente. En los dos \u00faltimos niveles se puede apreciar un \u00e1pice de esto, que es cuando te dan las botas propulsoras y aparecen los cristales que recargan tu energ\u00eda. Lo malo es que aparecen demasiado tarde o no se aprovechan bien. Con las botas es f\u00e1cil ir por cualquier lado, lo que provoca que te pierdas, o que no necesites el gancho o que lo uses para abarcar los 5 metros faltantes para alcanzar esa piedra flotante (lo que lo vuelve algo no muy satisfactorio de ver, o que se sienta que te sobran los recursos disponibles). Los cristales de energ\u00eda est\u00e1n muy bien, pero muchas veces est\u00e1n de adorno, sobran y son pocas las veces que realmente los necesit\u00e1s.\nEl hecho de que solamente tengas disponibles acciones tan simples, y que no se aprovechen de formas interesantes, lo convierte en un juego repetitivo (a pesar de ser tan corto) y que falle en uno de sus componentes clave, que es el plataformeo. Si al menos el plataformeo fuese satisfactorio, que te haga sentir bien saltando y columpi\u00e1ndote, o te da una sensaci\u00f3n de velocidad y adrenalina, por m\u00e1s que sea repetitivo, podr\u00eda compensar esa parte negativa y divertirte igual. Si bien como dije al principio, los controles y la jugabilidad en general no es mala (por ejemplo, la gravedad cuando est\u00e1s en el aire es algo lenta, para que tengas el tiempo suficiente de apuntar a donde quer\u00e9s engancharte), eso no quiere decir que logre una buena o satisfactoria sensaci\u00f3n a la hora de jugarlo. Columpiarse y engancharse a una piedra es apuntar y hacer clic, no tiene nada de interesante.\nA m\u00ed me hubiese gustado que las dos mec\u00e1nicas que nombr\u00e9 previamente, estuviesen en una etapa mucho m\u00e1s temprana del juego, y tuviesen espacios dedicados a ellas y que las aprovechasen de formas variadas e interesantes. A\u00f1adir otras acciones, como por ejemplo, poder contraer el gancho para desplazarse m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido a un punto espec\u00edfico, o poder extenderlo para llegar m\u00e1s lejos, la posibilidad de correr por las paredes, u otros elementos como piedras que aparecen y desaparecen u obst\u00e1culos los cuales hay que esquivar, hubiese sido un buen comienzo para volver de este juego, algo m\u00e1s interesante.\nBien, el plataformeo es muy flojo. Quiz\u00e1s el punto fuerte del juego sea algo m\u00e1s, como la experiencia en general que ofrece o su argumento.\nComo es algo bastante normal en los juegos de plataformas, la historia no es algo que va a cambiar tu forma de ver el mundo. Este juego se lo tom\u00f3 bastante en serio eso y trat\u00f3 de contar la historia m\u00e1s rid\u00edcula que se le pudiese ocurrir. Ni siquiera voy a seguir profundizando en este apartado porque me parece una perdida de tiempo.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2582319290\nLa experiencia que ofrece dir\u00eda que es donde m\u00e1s resalta. Es un juego muy calmado, que si bien gr\u00e1ficamente es bastante feo, tiene unos escenarios bonitos, que se sienten muy vac\u00edos y carentes de vida, pero que resulta relajante explorarlos (aunque tambi\u00e9n es cierto que lo que ofrecen para explorar es poco y nada). Diferente es su dise\u00f1o de niveles, que me pareci\u00f3 bastante malo. Es muy f\u00e1cil no saber por donde ir al estar todo tan alejado entre si, o perderse ya que nunca te indica de formas sutiles o indirectas por donde seguir. Tambi\u00e9n muchas veces te va a dar la sensaci\u00f3n de que ya estuviste por tal lugar, porque son todos muy parecidos entre ellos, pero bueno, los escenarios est\u00e1n bonitos.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2582335452\nYo s\u00e9 que este juego fue desarrollado por un estudio independiente. S\u00e9 que el desarrollo de un videojuego en tres dimensiones es una tarea laboriosa, complicada, tanto que ni puedo imaginarme el grado de dificultad que conlleve crearlo. Y por eso les digo a los desarrolladores, intenten con algo no tan grande, pero en lo que puedan brillar m\u00e1s. Desarrollaron un videojuego en tres dimensiones que les qued\u00f3 cutre en todos sus apartados. Gr\u00e1ficos, animaciones, los di\u00e1logos y personalidad de sus personajes, la historia en general, el dise\u00f1o de sus niveles, sus mec\u00e1nicas o el plataformeo, nada me convenci\u00f3 o me dio una sensaci\u00f3n de estar logrado. Solo sus escenarios que de lejos se ven bonitos y el control que por lo menos no es frustrante de jugar.\nNo es que me sienta muy bien dici\u00e9ndolo, pero yo creo que tiene tantas rese\u00f1as positivas gracias a que lo regalaron, y al ser algo simple y en tres dimensiones llama la atenci\u00f3n, pero la verdad es que me llev\u00e9 una peque\u00f1a decepci\u00f3n al jugarlo.\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n[/h1]\nUna peque\u00f1a decepci\u00f3n. Un juego corto que no tiene nada para mostrar. Aburrido, repetitivo, no es un desaf\u00edo, no es una experiencia, no es nada. Tampoco resalta en ninguno de sus apartados.

parkour games, if you can accept the occassional bug, and if you buy as part of a bundle or for less than 3-4 bucks.\n\nDecent FPS runner/parkour game, with fantasy setting, grappling hook mechanism. 80% of the game is linear and the last 20% provides platforming options and a spike in difficulty.\n\nStory is meaningless but there is a bit / collectables are forgettable and not worth picking up / achievements are too hard to get in a playthrough.\n\nOverall Rating: 5/10\n\nThis is a positive review, only because there is no \"thumbs sideways\" and because the game ended before I got pissed off

Y si podemos debatir si la duraci\u00f3n de un juego debe ser corta o larga mi conclusi\u00f3n es que debe ser un punto medio pero si es muy largo tampoco pasa nada (Siempre y cuando no recaiga en un bucle de repetici\u00f3n constante volvi\u00e9ndolo aburrido) En resumen el juego deja un sabor a boca muy amargo por lo corto que es y te deja con ganas de mas 1 o 2 horas mas no hubieran venido mal y una vez hablamos de la duraci\u00f3n hablemos del contenido.\n\nContenido: El contenido que el juego tiene para ofrecer es tan poco como el que tiene de duraci\u00f3n, estamos hablando de que no son mas de 7 niveles (1 de introducci\u00f3n y otro de epilogo) Y que en general si fueses lo mas r\u00e1pido posible no deben durar mas de 20 minutos, tampoco contamos con una opci\u00f3n para instalar mods de la Workshop lo cual limita much\u00edsimo mas lo que podemos hacer, en resumen el juego tiene una rejugabilidad muy baja, si no fuese por los coleccionables casi que no volver\u00eda a hacer los niveles.\n\nNiveles: los niveles no llegan a ser muy complicados es mas no representan un reto y eso me molesta mucho porque el juego tenia todo para darnos un verdadero desaf\u00edo y ponernos muy tensos, como la vez que aparece el gusano por primera vez, es un momento en el que por fin nos obligan a ir lento y frenar algo que choca a cualquier jugador pero a su misma vez tambi\u00e9n tenia todo para hacer niveles mas fren\u00e9ticos para ponernos nerviosos, pero lamentablemente no supieron aprovecharlos. Esto por lo general no lo digo pero los niveles se sienten muy apagados como que nunca se dan el lujo de jugar con las luces y hacer niveles mas coloridos\n\nHistoria: La historia trata de nosotros un padre de familia que le cuenta (valga la re redundancia) un cuento a nuestra hija en el que nos aventuramos en una b\u00fasqueda para encontrar a nuestro T\u00edo Fred, en el camino nos encontramos a dos civilizaciones y una chica llamada Maddie la cual se unir\u00e1 por un corto periodo a nuestra aventura para no hacerlo muy largo logramos pasar por muchas adversidades y llegamos a otra ciudad la cual Maddie decide quedarse (Y ac\u00e1 hay un par\u00e9ntesis y es que el juego quer\u00eda hacerlo sentir como algo triste pero realmente te es indiferente si te acompa\u00f1aba o no ya que no aportaba casi nada) En fin nos separamos de Maddie y vamos a buscar a nuestro t\u00edo en las cuevas de hielo el cual estaba construyendo una plataforma para volver curiosamente a casa pero despu\u00e9s de decirle que Maddie lo extra\u00f1aba dice \"No sobrino, vos andate y yo me quedo\" Obviamente lo resum\u00ed pero la historia en esencia es eso, muy simple, sin giros, sin nada. Se nos explica que Fred creo a las ranas/humano pero tampoco se nos explica porque fue a las cuevas en busca de que o que eran cosas como el bicho que encontramos antes y la charla con nuestro T\u00edo se siente muy desconectado ya que es alguien que no nos importa ni nos interesa como personaje. Considero que lo pero de la historia es que el personaje por momentos hable en primera persona y a veces en tercera puede llegar a confundir por momentos.\n\nMec\u00e1nicas: el juego tiene mec\u00e1nicas excelentes y este va a ir un poco conectado con el de niveles y es que realmente el juego tiene las mec\u00e1nicas justas para continuar y ser entretenido hasta el final (pero como ya dije no se terminan de aprovechar) Realmente moverte por el mundo es agradable y aunque el movimiento es MUY limitado no se siente molesto o feo (Aunque cuando conseguimos las botas cohetes el poder del salto casi se queda muy de lado.) En fin no puedo decir mucho mas por este lado el juego esta muy bien.\n\nBugs: no hay mucho que decir mas que, si saltas en lugares que no deber\u00edas mas de una vez te quedaras cayendo infinitamente, solo tienes que cargar el ultimo punto de control\n\nEl mundo que nos rodea: Finalmente el universo, el universo pese a estar lleno de NPCs se siente muy muerto, al hablar con Maddie tiene nulas expresiones faciales parece un modelo que mueve la boca sin mas. (Y ojo comprendo las limitaciones de la \u00e9poca pero eso no quita que se pueda hacer NPCs mas vivos.) Para hacer sentir mas \"viva\" las aldeas era tan simple como dejarte interactuar con ciudadanos o objetivo secundarios muy cortos como llevarle algo a alguien, cosas tan simples habr\u00edan hecho un poco mas vivo el pueblo pero como no hay nada que hacer simplemente son modelos desperdiciados que ni siquiera te paras a ver.\n\nReflexi\u00f3n: Yo realmente lo siento, vine con unas expectativas un tanto altas pero realmente el juego no da la talla no puedo recomendarlo por mas que quiera, si te interesa mucho la mec\u00e1nica ju\u00e9galo pero aun as\u00ed no es recomendable.", "timestamp_created": 1628583730, "timestamp_updated": 1628583730, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520057260990142822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97251036": {"recommendationid": "97251036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239922912", "num_games_owned": 889, "num_reviews": 319, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1628537038}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful smooth movement, jumping and the energy beam grabling is fantastic.

Going in, I expected a by-the-numbers platformer with a story narrated in the background. What I did not expect was the effort and care that clearly went into presentation here, nor being approached by characters in a manner that reminded me of Half Life 2. It's not perfect, but it's solid, and for a low budget title it shoots above the bar. The game manages to engage and invest the player in what is happening in a very effective way, and isn't overambitious with its plot. If nothing else, this one aspect deserves to be lauded, because it's one that many games fails at.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, well, it's a bit mixed. I think the mechanics overall work well, they fit in the story in a good way and there is a lot of potential for fun in them. The speed you can generate is notable as well, maybe even more so by someone that is better at the game than I am. However, the game falls into the same trap that many (if not most) first person platformers fall into: a lack of depth perception. It's pretty difficult to judge how far away an object is, which is something vital in a game with such small platforms. \n\nAdditionally, there is a big problem in level readability here. It's simply confusing, half the time you don't really know where you're going and just progress on pure faith, hoping that the way forward is the one you think it is and that the one boulder is the one you're actually supposed to swing from and/or is actually close enough. There are some cool moments here and there, and the environments are great, but they're all undercut when you look around and constantly wonder \"Where am I even?\". \n\nAll in all, this is not a bad game. It has problems, but it's pretty fun and has some really qualitative presentation aspects to it and connects it with a simple but entertaining story. A Story About My Uncle is good for what it is.

segments were quite the curveball. the story itself is pretty bad to the point were i turned voices of halfway through the game. the parkour mechanics itself arent that great either. the main mechanic, a grappling hook is way worse in this game than in similar games like verlet swing or cyber hook since hooking something resets your speed if you are going to fast and pulls you directly towards the point you hooked, which means that it is practically impossible to swing around objects. the only thing you can do is hook an object and then let go shortly before you hit it so you dont crash into it and can fly past it. i think the level design also gets worse over time where the beginning in which you are in a cave and can hook anywhere you want is the best, the middle in which you can still hook anywhere you want but are in a more open space so you have less spots to grapple is okay and the end in which you are in another cave that mostly consists of ungrappleable surfaces is the worst part of the game, since this just adds difficulty by taking things away rather than adding new and interesting variables. the game experiments with some interesting ideas every now and then with a few things like stealth, or moving ground but those ideas are always only present for one room and then its back to the normal boring gameplay (not to say that any of the named ideas were better than the normal gameplay, but at least they were interesting). simply putting more stuff that can kill you in your way like spike grounds or floating dangers could have made the game more challenging by adding something rather than just removing potential grapple spots so i dont see any reason why the game is the way it is.", "timestamp_created": 1626348920, "timestamp_updated":

Having received this game as a gift from a friend, prior to playing this game, I had no idea what to expect from it. Condensed, the story is quite an endearing one, but as a game, it has a couple of problems that I want to elaborate on below. The negative review marking here should be taken with a grain of salt. Instead, treat it instead as a hypothetical \"Neither\" option. \n\nTo me, ultimately the question comes down to whether the story presented in a story-based game is worth the price, something I cannot comment on as I received this game for free. However, I feel that I would not want to pay money for this game's story, nor do I feel like the story managed to engage me on any level until the end of it, upon which I started asking questions about what the story was trying to tell me. You may be more or less affected by the story if you can relate to it as it deals with themes of abandonment, preoccupation and family relations. Unfortunately, as a story standing on its own, I would argue that it fails to provide any real answer to the questions you ask if you try to analyse it metaphorically. The characters you meet are very endearing however, and the game is also very pretty, with the environments you explore being alien yet simultaneously very natural.\n\nThe game itself is merely 3 hours long if you go through the story itself. For me, the problem here is not the length itself. The problem is that, during those 3 hours, I was more engaged by the actual gameplay this game provides, which consists mainly of you figuring out how to get from point A to B using a grappling hook and other aerial abilities that you unlock as you go through the game. This creates a mix of puzzle-platforming which I was more intrigued by as I was going through the game, than the story it was telling me. Whether this is a good thing will be up to you, but what I can say is that this is no walking simulator like 'What Remains of Edith Finch', where gameplay is meant to service the story the game tells you. Another game that does this better is the Orwell series. Unfortunately for this game, those examples I gave did a better job on their story than this game ever did. The gameplay here also fails to connect to the story itself other than the fact that the platforming that you are doing has been done by the character you are following.\n\nOn the other hand, gameplay-wise, I very much enjoyed playing around with the core gameplay loop, and the game lays this out in a very Nintendo-esque type of way, slowly introducing you to new mechanics with easy puzzles, then builds upon these with new challenges that you have to figure out, building on what you previously learned. There was also one point in particular that I really enjoyed gameplay-wise where you had to backtrack over obstacles that you had previously overcome, which were now in motion. The new abilities you receive as you go through the game blend really well together and you get a Metroid-esque type of feeling of you powering up as you go along.\n\nAs such, to sum up this game, I feel that if you're going into this game expecting to be told an interesting story, you may leave disappointed, and there are many venues that explore this better. However, if you go into this game expecting a puzzle-platformer of sorts, you may find it worthwhile for the few hours you get to play around with it, and you may come off it wishing for more gameplay, new abilities and more challenging puzzle-platforming, like I did.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1624184001, "timestamp_updated": 1624184001, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525864362716674805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94011290": {"recommendationid": "94011290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396625852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1604946889}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

More than a story, or anything, this is a short platformer game. Not a puzzle platformer, mind you, a platformer, in first person, for that extra bit of \"where the hell am I positioned?\". If there's a game begging to be ported into VR, is this one, but...\n\nBut... the fact they cripple your grapple with only three charges (it should be unlimited, frankly) and add mechanics like air jumping just to make things unnecessarily complicated, instead of exploring properly the one cool mechanic they've got, is just beyond me. Well, this is except in the last level, where you can recharge in certain spots your grapple, you could have just made the platforming more interesting (have some puzzles, maybe) platforming and grant the unlimited grappling. I also found the controls, both keyboard + mouse and controller rather weird and unfriendly.\n\nThe story, since the title, there isn't much to it. Play the first 5 min, and that's about it. [spoiler] Now, I've plenty of issues in the way they handled the story. It's simple, I get it, it's meant as a story a dad makes up from the top of his head - or is it? - Why do it like this though? The problem is that it's tropey as all hell, and at points self-aware of this, explicitly as part of the text. Do not do this unless you're subverting or deconstructing something, it exposes and stops the story dead on its tracks, because you're not doing anything with it. Plus, it makes the audience aware, and the problem with that is that Maddie is one of those late 80s obnoxious children characters from cartoons, that everyone hates, played straight - in spite of her voice actress being too old to play the character (the voice acting is awful and poorly produced all round) - and ending her story by leaving her in a place she has known for 2 minutes. Girl, you're not going to have freedom there, whatever that means to you, you know nothing of these Strays. Also your uncle is a loony with a really weird fetish for glowing rocks, it really killed any enjoyment I might have had when I met him at the end of the game.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1622992979, "timestamp_updated": 1622993103, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93301506": {"recommendationid": "93301506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134594243", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 149, "last_played": 1622991327}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very fun game that you can pick up and play through in an evening, or you can spend as long as you want trying to complete the various challenges and time trials.\n\nOthers comment on the controls not being perfectly fluent but for the price (considering you can find good deals for it everywhere and its common in bundles and the like) your getting a still smooth enjoyable experience, at no point did i find it too hard or too easy and its the kind of game you can take at your own pace, giving yourself restrictions to make it harder, or just flowing through and enjoying the scenery.\n\nThe story while not perfectly narrated is still engaging considering how it is overall, the daughter chipping in occasionally is cute and refreshing and especially the portions with Maddie are just pleasant.\n\nIf there was anything bad about the game it would just be the length, and the fact that considering the games size and presumably the developers resources at the time, the world does get a bit samey aswell as the puzzles, im sure if you gave the dev's todays resources they would have made something even better, so you should still be considerate of the fact this is a now 7 year old game, and it stands up incredibly well.", "timestamp_created": 1622991930, "timestamp_updated": 1622991930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93287957": {"recommendationid": "93287957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120243972", "num_games_owned": 992, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1622977116}, "language": "english", "review": "+ story\n+ a nice looking world to explore\n\n- as you get further into the game, the jumping puzzles become more and more annoying, up to a point where the game requires you to make 3 very precise jumps and land on a tiny floating rock somewhere way out of sight from your initial position.

So, at best it's good for 1 evening, until the puzzles get too frustrating to progress further\n\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1622975968, "timestamp_updated": 1622975968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676191508769989014", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93287440": {"recommendationid": "93287440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198295631", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 94, "last_played": 1550336098}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent", "timestamp_created": 1622975293, "timestamp_updated": 1622975293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93255151": {"recommendationid": "93255151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286818215", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1681012974}, "language": "english", "review": "Fuck maddie", "timestamp_created": 1622926895, "timestamp_updated": 1622926895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467032968997955322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93228428": {"recommendationid": "93228428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325851586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1547355815}, "language": "english", "review": "its aight", "timestamp_created": 1622897478, "timestamp_updated": 1622897478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93222818": {"recommendationid": "93222818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198807275043", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 397, "last_played": 1623336546}, "language": "english", "review": "i played twice it is very good yes", "timestamp_created": 1622890002, "timestamp_updated": 1622890002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93215282": {"recommendationid": "93215282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056875753", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1622732664}, "language": "spanish", "review": "A [b]Story About My Uncle[/b] es un t\u00edtulo mediocre donde ninguno de sus apartados brilla con especial atenci\u00f3n. Sobre el papel las mec\u00e1nicas jugables son muy interesantes, pero su puesta en pr\u00e1ctica es torpe y farragosa.\n\nEn un juego en el que la precisi\u00f3n es clave para el flujo jugable es imperdonable que los controles sean tan bruscos y caprichosos. Nunca llegas a acostumbrarte del todo a unas f\u00edsicas en las que el personaje pesa poco y su reacci\u00f3n con el entorno es imprevisible en muchas ocasiones. Nuestro personaje da la sensaci\u00f3n de que va arrastr\u00e1ndose por el suelo, debido a la altura de la c\u00e1mara, y m\u00e1s de una vez caeremos al vac\u00edo en los saltos l\u00edmite por el choque de nuestro cuerpo invisible. Tampoco le hubiera venido nada mal que al estar cerca de los bordes el personaje se agarrar\u00e1 para subir a las superficies, os garantizo que eso me habr\u00eda salvado de muchas ca\u00eddas y repeticiones absurdas.\n\nEl gancho, el elemento mec\u00e1nico base, est\u00e1 muy mal resuelto. Te encontrar\u00e1s con situaciones en las que no te enganchar\u00e1s a las superficies por la distancia caprichosa a la que permite el agarre y con otras en las que perder\u00e1s por completo la inercia del desplazamiento por chocar con los puntos de anclaje flotantes. La capacidad de propulsi\u00f3n moment\u00e1nea, que la recibes m\u00e1s avanzado el juego, es igual de torpe y no siempre te ofrecer\u00e1 la misma fuerza de impulso, dej\u00e1ndote vendido en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n.\n\nAl final con todos los recursos que te dan en el juego te apa\u00f1as para llegar al final de nivel, pero ya os digo que no por seguir la ruta establecida. Hay secciones de plataforma que son una aut\u00e9ntica pesadez y os aburrir\u00e9is de dar al bot\u00f3n de reinicio. De hecho que haya un bot\u00f3n de reinicio ya da pistas del \"buen\" dise\u00f1o de niveles.\n\nA nivel narrativo solo necesitar\u00e1s jugar 15 minutos para darte cuenta de que lo que te cuentan no te interesa lo m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo y que la trama es pura excusa por tratar de dotar a la experiencia de una profundidad que no tiene. Francamente hubiera agradecido que se hubieran limitado a ofrecer una experiencia \u00e1rcade de plataformas, en lugar de torturarme con conversaciones de personajes [i]scriptados[/i] que puedes dejar solos hablando y gesticulando mientras intentas huir sin \u00e9xito alguno.\n\nQuiz\u00e1 lo \u00fanico que se salva de todo el trayecto es el dise\u00f1o de arte de los escenarios, con estampas en ciertos pasajes bastante bonitos. Aun as\u00ed el dise\u00f1o de personajes es ho-rro-ro-so. Es un contraste brusco ver el dise\u00f1o de personajes y los escenarios al mismo tiempo. De la banda sonora si la hab\u00eda no me acuerdo.

The game itself isn't bad as such. But recommending it would mean that I really think money spent for the game was well-spent and fun-cost effective. And I don't. I got this game as a freebie and completed it with a certain degree of fun (albeit tainted with a pinch of annoyance).\n\nSecond important factor impacting my oppinion of this game is the unavoidable comparison to grappling mechanics of Bionic Commando. And here's where this game falls terribly short. And it's the core feature of the game.\n\nThe grappling mechanics is the game's biggest asset and it's greatest flaw. Your grapples are limited to three consecutive ones before landing on the ground. Unfortunately it's easy to sometimes mistakenly click twice and lose one grapple (which usually means you won't be able to reach the platform). The game also doesn't \"recharge\" your grappler on some surfaces - it seems as if you've properly landed, you can move properly, you can even jump but you have no mor grapples to use.\n\nFurthermore it's impossible to judge beforehand whether you'll be able to use you grapple on something or will it be too far away. It feels as if it didn't matter on the predefined grappler device characteristics but more like predefined map spots from which you can or cannot grapple things.\n\nIn Bionic Commando you had the bionic arm which you could use to swing around and hang on it. Here the device pulls you automatically towards the object. Maybe it was a conciencious design choice but it's annoying as hell. Especially if you add it to the fact that the game cannot fully make its mind whether it's a platformer, puzzle or exploration game and you get yourself into a situation you don't know how to get out of.\n\nThe game itself is cute, has some story behind it (haven't finished it yet so can't tell whether it has a reasonable resolution). But seems to be rather short (with 3 hours on record I'm definitely way past half of the game).\n\nThe environment is nicely drawn but the characters look dated (I'm writing this in 2021, the game is from 2014 and it shows. The sounds are ok.\n\nIf you get this as a freebie - give it a try. Might be worth few hours of your time. If you have a chance to grab it with anhefty discount, well be warned that you might be disappointed. But you might like it anyway (number of positive comments shows that people indeed like this game despite its flaws).

As read in the description, the player takes the role of a nameless adolescent boy who navigates a foreign world in search of his uncle.  The core gameplay centers on three mechanics - long/high jump, grappling, and single-use rocket boots.\n\nGone North clearly put in tremendous effort into [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i].  The world is gorgeous, particularly for the Unreal 3 engine.  In terms of platforming, the levels are well-designed.  New mechanics and challenges are introduced at a constant, appropriate pace.  Difficulty increases incrementally.  The story is simple and told in a cute way.\n\n[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] has a few minor negatives.  The voice acting is sub-par.  The main narration has frequent points in which either the actor pauses mid-sentence or sentence fragments were hastily pasted together.  The story comes to an abrupt end that does not flow with the gentle rolling out of the main tale.  Some of the levels become monotonous and feel as though certain platforming sections only appear to make the levels have similar length.  \n\nHowever, the game does have a major flaw.  Its grappling mechanism needs a great deal of polish.  The player may use the grapple beam three times before standing on solid ground, which introduces a fun challenge in this mechanic.  However, it is exceedingly likely that the grapple will use multiple charges with a single mouse click, effectively forcing the player to fail.  It has the appearance of the grapple beam slipping and re-catching.  By the end of the game, when the player needs very precise control over their movements and checkpoints become sparser, such a failure in the grapple system becomes unbearably frustrating.  I attempted using two different wireless mice, a wired mouse, and a wired controller.  All input devices had the same problem.

The story is narrated by the protagonist, who's telling his daughter about an adventure he had as a boy when searching for his missing uncle. Uncle Fred, as he was called, was a scientist who'd invented many different devices, including an energy-based grappling hook. The story begins with the protagonist visiting his uncle's home, and being transported to a fantastic world.\n\nPersonally, I found the story enjoyable; while the narration felt slightly off at times (in terms of the dialogue delivery), the story itself was nice, with some beautiful locations and a loveable character in the form of Maddie, a young girl the protagonist befriends along the way. The gameplay is another good point of the game; as I mentioned, it's a first-person platformer, and your main method of movement is the grappling hook, which allows you to traverse large distances; you also get some upgrades along the way, like more charges for the grappling hook, or even some rocket boots, that increase mobility. As for combat, there's no combat at all in this game, no enemies to fight; in that regard, it's a very peaceful experience, and there's no risk of death (if you fall, you immediately respawn at the latest checkpoint).\n\nThe world design is wonderful, full of beautiful and different areas for you to explore; even then, the game is fairly linear, though you get plenty of times to appreciate the views. However, I'd say that the graphics themselves, while being nicely stylized, still show some rough spots here and there, especially when it comes to some of the character models. As a final note, this game also has a good soundtrack.\n\nSo, do I recommend A Story About My Uncle? Yes.

I actually got it when it was free for a time, so maybe that's why I thought it would be shorter. I would imagine the audience of this game is actually children, but not too young, since I struggled a fair bit with some parts of the grappling parts (which make up the majority of the gameplay). It mixes the grappling mechanic with rocket boost shoes, plus crystals that can recharge your grapple tool mid swing. It introduces each new mechanic very naturally and I knew exactly what they wanted me to do most of the time. Note: When you get to a part that seems suddenly way harder, look around for another platform half way. You probably missed it and it isn't actually that hard.\n\nI found the environments beautiful, although they're extremely static. The story is very linear as one would expect of a small game. The voice acting is alright, but some of the lines have grammatical mistakes, if you care about that.\n\nAll in all I actually enjoyed this game quite a bit and it offered quite a challenge to me (not that I'm a great gamer). I'd recommend this game. Maybe not quite at full price (which is roughly 7 USD currently) but it depends where you are. There is some replayability in the fact that they provide a time trial mode. But I closed the menu as soon as I saw that since I literally said to myself in one part of the game \"Gosh I'm glad there isn't a time limit on this.\"\n\nI liked the ending.

The glove also has this thing where holding RMB will charge it up, just letting go will make you jump really high and letting go while running will make you leap super far. Eventually towards the end of the game you get more stuff that helps even more but I won't say that due to it being fairly late into it.

One is that the game is incredibly short; a 2-3 hour experience for $15 with little replay-ability.

[/i]\n\nI would say that's all there is for that, it's some running, jumping, grappling. You gradually get all the upgrades in probably the first hour or so, which is fine. But the game starts to play with your limitations (like increasing how many times you can grapple by hitting crystals) or by de-activating a power ( [spoiler] your rocket boots get damaged at one point [/spoiler] ), but the introduction of these seem really just thrown in at the end to increase the challenge for like... 10 minutes overall in the last half hour? But- it's a short game- keep this in mind.\n\n[b] Art [/b] 6/10\n\nThe art style is quite lovely, each act/chapter has a different style, though it kind of seems like they had a 5 minute brainstorming session of \"what kind of themes should we do?\" and picked 3.\nand the character modelling is a bit unique but stylised, it fits the rest well.\n\nThe voice acting is really meh for the most part, the voice for Maddie is pretty good but every other voice is just one step from being read from the script in front of them, but I feel that this could be due to a small team and a lot of non-English speakers perhaps.\n\nAnimation in some places is hit and miss.\n\n[b] Story [/b] 3/10\n\nThe story is definitely kid friendly/kid-oriented, and a bit... cheap - very basic and sort of goes nowhere, and when you think it's going to, it still doesn't.

Certain environments are downright mind blowing!\n\nOverall, it starts slow, but the poignancy of the story grows and grows. I'm continually struck how I play this on an HP EliteDesk which is a decent computer, but by no means a gaming rig however, this game plays beautifully and fluidly.\n\nI'm also struck how my favorite 3D platformers are all first person, such as the Mirror's Edge series and this game, more recently. I'm playing this game with a controller, though my weapon of choice is definitely a keyboard and mouse. The game plays well with a controller, I think I would probably be a more competent player with a keyboard and mouse, but I use those all day, so a controller is nice for a change.\n\nAs far as mechanics, it's a nice balance of freedom and boundaries. Some aspects take a bit to get used to, since, the giant jumps and grappling hook are very unusual elements for a first person perspective game. Which reminds me of a good example of this balance: there is no falling damage, so you can fall as long as you want as long as you hit some visible ground, however, falling into the mist or darkness is the main cause for going back to a last checkpoint (and this does happen often!) But one issue with no falling damage is that unless it is a square hit onto the ground, you might bounce of a rock and careen into the abyss in spite of hitting the ground. The whole \"glancing off rock\" deal happens a lot with the floating rocks that you use to grapple, and it takes a bit of practice, but after a while, you can learn to be deflected in your desired direction. I really like all of the mechanics I've just mentioned, but I will say that learning the best times to let go of grappled targets is immensely tricky and bouncing off of a rock I've grabbed and plummeting into the depths is not a fun mistake.\n\nThe narrative of this game is a father telling a story to his daughter, which is such a wholesome, creative method of delivery. The game has been very wholesome (not without scary parts, for sure) but it seems like a very healthy way to engage say, an elementary child, on these fundamental fears we all deal with: the dark, monsters, falling, rejection, saying goodbye. This game is absolutely unparalleled by any other games I've played in that regard! I think a great comparison here is how one \"fails\" in this game versus Mirror's Edge. In this game, it's like falling in a dream, you just kind of fall and either you wake up, or the dream continues. In Mirror's Edge, you get to hear what it would sound like as many of your bones snap right before your brain sustains too much trauma to continue functioning. I think both games are wonderful, but geared towards different audiences, heh.\n\nThis game is worth the time, even just to *see* some of the levels..

"review": "I really wanted to like this game, but all in all it felt underwhelming, like a half-baked project that didn't know what it wanted to be. Not enough story and depth to feel like a narrative-driven game, not enough tricks or platforming variety to feel like a good platformer, it kind of fell short in both regards. I still give it a very tentative recommend because at times it was nice and the overall plot is sweet, but I'd recommend to get it with a big discount and not expect too much from it.\n\nPROS:\n- Story in a story: a man is telling his daughter a bed-time story about an adventure he had as a young boy looking for his uncle in a mysterious world. Simple, but touching at times.\n- A couple of sweet characters\n- At least one really beautiful level\n- Good voice acting\n\nCONS:\n- Pacing is awful. Levels are very long with only platforming and too few narrative breaks in between. Countless times I thought I was close to finishing the level, but realized there's still a huge section to go through. While you're platforming, in most cases there's nothing to look at, no environmental storytelling, no story bits and not even any memorable music. Feels like repetitive platforming in a void - really boring.\n- Honestly, I hated the couple of levels at the beginning that are mostly set in the dark. Boring and underwhelming. I get that it was supposed to be in contrast with one later level, but still.\n- Except for one side-character, the in-game race of frog people doesn't have any personality to them. They're basically just part of the scenery.\n- In the second half of the game there's a sudden difficulty spike that makes the experience quite frustrating.\n- Towards the end the level design is a bit off, it's often not really clear where I'm supposed to go, what to grapple towards etc.\n- World-building is wonky, many things seem to be just thrown into the story for the sake of it, without any logical explanation or connection to the overall narrative. It works for some stories, but it's not the case here.", "timestamp_created": 1614540063, "timestamp_updated": 1614540063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87620396": {"recommendationid": "87620396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381286874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 430, "last_played": 1614548228}, "language": "english", "review": "Muito bom!", "timestamp_created": 1614532103, "timestamp_updated": 1614532103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87606184": {"recommendationid": "87606184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262028285", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1593009376}, "language": "english", "review": "A Story About My Uncle is ironically enough less about the basic story and more about the parkour.

It\u2019s honestly pretty cute, and there are a lot of small details like when you close the game, you hear, \u201cI think thats enough for one night\u201d\n[/quote]\n[quote]\nI had a few issues with this game though. About half way through the game, you get a pair of rocket boots that gives you a boost mid air. Most of the jumps don't require a boost, and I ended up using it as a crutch 90% of the time. I think that this should\u2019ve been given to you in the beginning of the game, and then taken away halfway through. This would help players just learning the system, and add a layer of challenge to the latter half. Also, I found myself getting caught on the geometry of the last level.\n[/quote]\n[quote]\nOverall, A Story About My Uncle is a very good game which is very relaxing, challenging and very interesting.\nThe music, the effects and the overall vibe while playing this game is outstanding.\nI know this game from LeafyIsHere or something, on YouTube, not sure where he is now though.\n\nAbout the price, i suggest waiting for a sale. Game's pretty short but highly worth it but not for the full price in my opinion.\n[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1611023113, "timestamp_updated": 1611023113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455044835805892944", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84951991": {"recommendationid": "84951991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073716583", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1611032659}, "language": "english", "review": "Boring, barethread story.

Aunque sea con calzador y con unos personajes tot\u00e1lmente as\u00e9pticos y, en general, sin ning\u00fan sentido.\nLos controles, como se puede esperar de la mec\u00e1nica usada para los desplazamientos, complicados. Cabe se\u00f1alar que la combinaci\u00f3n de teclas no est\u00e1 en s\u00ed misma mal implementada, aunque se agradecer\u00eda haber contado con algunas asistencias visuales para el apuntado o la informaci\u00f3n de la distancia de los pedruscos donde tendremos que engancharnos para cruzar.\nLos escenarios imposibles hasta que no lo has intentado una docena de veces. Propiciado por el hecho de que la mayor\u00eda de las plataformas u objetos para engancharnos no los podremos ver hasta que no estemos ya encima de ellos. Es decir, hay que tirar para adelante sin pensar por que no nos podremos hacer una idea previa de por donde hay que ir ni lo que vamos a encontrar ya que, directamente, no lo veremos desde donde comenzamos. Por otra parte, las plataformas \"v\u00e1lidas\" son estrictamente las que el desarrollador ha decidido. Si intentamos descansar en lo alto de una monta\u00f1a, por ejemplo, que no est\u00e9 previsto de antemano, simplemente nos escurriremos hasta dar con nuestros huesos en el suelo.\nEl sistema de encontrar objetos coleccionables, de nuevo encajado a presi\u00f3n, ya que como he comentado en el p\u00e1rrafo anterior, la exploraci\u00f3n es imposible ya que nos caeremos de cualquier sitio que no est\u00e9 habilitado al efecto y sin previo aviso. Y dichos objetos no est\u00e1n precisamente en lugares accesibles.\nMenci\u00f3n especial a la orientaci\u00f3n, en la que parece que el dise\u00f1ador ha volcado todos sus esfuerzos para hacernos a\u00fan m\u00e1s complicada la existencia. Prep\u00e1rate a encontrarte cara a cara con la desesperaci\u00f3n de no saber para donde tirar entre tanta piedra similar sin ninguna pista salvo en contadas ocasiones.\nMi intenci\u00f3n original, como en el resto de juegos que pasan por mis manos, era terminarlo antes de dar una opini\u00f3n.

I would say that this doesn\u2019t actually fit into a category, it makes its own mix of adventure, 3d platformer, sci-fi and story.\n\nPositives: \n- There are a lot of different options including different languages for you to customize your game\n- The game delivers a great story that is easy to follow but not as easy to predict what will happen\n- It has a difficulty of normal and you barely find yourself completely stuck, but there are still some challenge (But those are solvable)\n- There is a lot to explore and you don\u2019t always have to follow the main mission\n- Great for speed running\n- The soundtrack (holy crap)\n\nNegatives: \n- The graphics are not realistic, not pix-elated but it does not give you a \u201cwow\u201d feeling, backgrounds, humans and creatures  \n   look very fake\n- Very short story, not worth to play a second time unless you are really into the game\n- There are some really annoying bugs \u2018\n- Some not necessary dialogues that you want to skip but you can\u2019t\n\nSummary and overall feedback:\nThe game is worth buying unless you are going for an outstanding visual experience, this game fits most of the game styles and is not for a targeted audience. Not necessarily wait for sale, but if you do so it will most likely be up for 3\u20ac.
