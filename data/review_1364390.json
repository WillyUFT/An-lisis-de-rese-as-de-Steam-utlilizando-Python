There are far too many crashes when you add and remove devices to the software and really isn't as intuitive as it used to be. I think that it's an unfortunate circumstance of technology catching up *VERY* quickly.\n\nI've previously spoken to support about my issues with the software - which didn't really lead to any results and, at one point I was also paying a subscription, but it quickly all lead to just an intuitive mess that I really didn't want to deal with further.\n\nVtuber Studio for me is the king of Live2D, is free and has very few limitations. The moment I touched it, I lost all motivation to continue using Animaze. It might be fun for a novel purpose perhaps, but I don't think its quite caught up with everything else. The fact that Vtuber studio does not crash at all when I insert my tablet for art streams and doesn't fuss when I switch monitors - the technical aspects are really what hold Animaze back.\n\nI think the app can be improved, but it would probably require a lot more work than the developers nessicarily want to invest - so I will just go with what is working for me rather than what isn't.", "timestamp_created": 1700533774, "timestamp_updated": 1700533774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1700644250, "developer_response": "Hello Zephyr,\nThank you for the time with Animaze, and the candid feedback, much appreciated!\n\n\nWe are always working to improve. \nYou might have noticed that there was a pause in updates recently, that's also because we are right now fundamentally re-assessing how we monitor, measure, and handle these kinds of hard-to-catch issues, and also coding in ways that make the users more aware of potential problems. Hopefully, that will bring the issue affecting you in the light, and get it fixed for everyone. \n\nFor edge cases that happen when adding/removing hardware devices, or changing monitors, we do need specific details about the context that caused the issue to occur, log files, and as much additional information (sent to support[@]animaze[.]us) as possible so we can reproduce the issue on a dev machine. \n\n\n_________________________________\n\nOn a more general, mission-related note, unlike most avatar software, Animaze does not use a ready-made corporate/commercial gaming engine to put your avatar on screen. \nIt would be indeed easier/faster to do so, (and that path should be explored, as it is, by many great apps), but there are several reasons why we are exploring a different, more challenging path, an indie engine path. \nThis is spurred by the fact that some of the corporate engines are partially owned by entities (including official investment branches of autocratic governments) that have a problematic stance on free speech and minority rights, (not to mention AI art);  their runtimes start to collect more data from their users as times goes by.\n\nStrictly for gaming/entertainment, perhaps that has no implications, but avatars and avatar identities are a tool for communication, free speech and its independence is of paramount importance here. An indie engine alternative safeguards from the potential influence of engine shareholder-dictated policies. That, as we saw this year, can happen, unilaterally, retroactively, and suddenly. In an engine-monopoly scenario, that can be scary.\nStaying independent on the engine side, and not using that very tantalizing pool of \"free\" work, means that the Animaze engine does not benefit from the vast commercial engine QA department and all the pre-written plugins for commercial engines, but, in doing so, stays independent. The price of that independence is that need to build and test a LOT more in-house, often with considerably fewer resources.\n\n\nIn the end though, as hard as we work, and no matter how many innovative features we were \"first to market\" with in the last 9 years, we know that independence from large companies aspect is not considered *that* important by many, and it is inevitable that there will be users who are not happy with some aspects of the Animaze indie engine, or at the speed at which we can move independently. \n\n\nCheers and happy streaming, no matter the platform you may use from now on :)"}, "150516013": {"recommendationid": "150516013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278214186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1986,

The differences in Animaze's favor are even greater if you use Animaze native assets, like Noah or the Personas, or start using the Advanced tracking settings for fine-tuning, to any degree.\n\n\nUsing Animaze correctly does require some usage flow changes, playing beyond the defaults, like the  \"studio gray\" initial light setup, and adjusting the default motion capture settings to your liking, but when you do that you'll find it has a higher expressivity/naturalness ceiling than FaceRig did.\n\n\nCheers, and happy streaming!\n"}, "144541713": {"recommendationid":

It does have a higher price than its FaceRig counterpart, but it vastly surpasses Facerig in many ways. \n\n\nHere is a personal top 10 features to consider (most can be evaluated using the free version):\n\n\n1. Support for IPhone face tracking (in any side-by-side comparison it surpasses anything that was ever possible on Facerig with its webcam-only tracker).\n2. In-app Persona Avatar Creator - an inexpensive way to get a highly customized avatar in minutes, with no additional cost.\n3. In-app retexturing (including with Spout2 Live feeds, for set-ups with in-world live screens a la CodeMiko)\n4. VRM import  support (both 0.0 and 1.0, including PerfectSync) and GLB /Ready Player Me support to vastly expand avatar library size options  (the old Facerig engine and toolset did not support blend shapes at all, and VRM PerfectSync models nor Ready Playe Me would have never been ever possible there)\n5. Twitch Actions/ Twitch integration\n6. VMC protocol support (for things like Webcam-based hand tracking body tracking,  or filming camera tracking for Virtual Production Studio scenarios. \n7. Far more face input emotion controls (78+), and far more body controls.\n8. Generalized animation system for all humanoids.\n9. Proper multiplayer, over the internet.\n10. Advanced camera motion controls (with optional camera interpolation between Quickscenes).\n\nThe list could go on,  Animaze API, support for Sony Mocopi,  Nvidia Maxine, Streamdeck, Tobii Tracker, Voicemod, Holographic display output with the Dreamoc Display, Hybrid Avatars, Live2D backdrops, Live2D freeform/advanced parameters set, one button import for Live2d (no more editing FaceRig CFG files), Full Body Motion Capture suit support with Perception Neuron PN3,  and many more. If there are features that did not make the jump, those are in general more fringe features that we noticed were not getting really any meaningful use in Facerig.\n\n\nFormer Facerig users considering the upgrade should only spend anything on Animaze if they genuinely are convinced is better and appreciate the cost being fair for all the new features, otherwise, the old Facerig license is still there for them to use today (just without any further update warranties due to its frozen 2017-level engine).\n\nCheers, and Happy Streaming!\n\n"}, "138658728": {"recommendationid": "138658728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106722915", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 789, "last_played": 1684639636}, "language": "english", "review": "Garbage.

When I start OBS and Animaze Plus 22 together with Elden Ring I get broken seem textures in-game which I fall through. You can actually see where the texture seems break. Everything in-game like my horse does not even load when I call it. I have to call it about 3-6 times then it loads, but not even underneath me but at my back. It breaks the game in total.\n\nThis is strange yet very fascinating for me. What on earth can cause this to happen I'm thinking. I've explored a few scenarios with this and the outcome is the same every time. I've even tried different modern games and all of it some point gives me strange behaviours that are game breaking. When not running Animaze Plus 22 the textures in Elden Ring is totally fine.\n\nI do not even get that much lag difference but the game textures and functionality seems to stop working correctly. I bought this to stream games but upon till now I am not satisfied. I do not see any other feature for it as to streaming games with an avatar but it does not work for what I want it to work.\n\nI guess for normal chatting on stream with OBS it is good but for modern game streaming together with OBS, not so much. I will be keeping it as I bought Animaze Plus 22 but I also will be abandoning it for the foreseeable future. Still interesting for me despite me not using it for what I thought I could do with it. I recommend for chatting, not for playing and chatting together with streaming.\n\nNote: After deciding not to use it for game streaming I played with the advanced tracking settings.

No, it's not because of their business model and I'm not going to touch that in my review because others are slamming them down already. This is more of an opinion to the company itself. All this time, Holotech are focusing on the wrong thing.\n\nThe biggest mistakes they made is not focusing to the CREATORS. Anyone who ever created models for Facerig and Animaze (2D or 3D alike) agreed the experience was painful. Holotech are refusing to use popular engine like Unity or Unreal for the sake of being 'independent' and pushed us creators to use a bunch of half baked toolsets with worst usability compared to modern 3D authoring software (seriously, Animaze Editor gives me a vibe of Valve Hammer Editor from the 90s). In turns, my creators peers are refusing to use it. Why should they waste their time to learn a very specific software that goes against established knowledge of working with Unity/Unreal? They dodged a bullet there because half of Animaze issues tracker are filled with complaints of their buggy, lack of foolproof Editor.\n\nTheir competitor got it right by making the experience delightful to CREATORS FIRST, then users second. They are introducing bunch of features that are not only useful for users, but also exciting for the creators. Simply put, they are able to establish a COMMUNITY. Bunch of people who are willing to help and support each other, with tools developed by community to the community. Holotech have no such luxury, so they are facing to different direction by catering to general users. But then they are directly competing to the bigger behemoth like Facebook, Snap, and Tiktok, who are already comes up with their own AR face tracking and avatar solution. Their attempt at developing mobile filters app failed miserably. Hell, they don\u2019t even stand a chance against VRM format.\n\nI held out myself from writing this review because I want to see how Animaze develops but after almost a year with bland updates, I\u2019m compelled to write this out. I\u2019ve been creating models for Facerig since 2015, went through a lot of false promises from them (stalled Facerig updates because \u201cour engineering bandwidth are full for new SDK we are developing\u201d, multi platform, avatar marketplace, etc). Maybe at this point the company are just waiting to be absorbed by bigger fish in the ocean. Until then, hold out on your Animaze licenses.", "timestamp_created": 1661329036, "timestamp_updated": 1661329036, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.799505949020385742", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1661770854, "developer_response": "Hello PixelVertice,\nThank you for the feedback!

The look and customization of the avatars is probably the only real positive. The tracking isn't great. It will easily lose track of your face even in the best of lighting.

Most time your mouth quivers like a crackhead, even when you aren't moving your mouth. I'm just glad the subscription fee was cheap, so I didn't lose much money on it.

Not only that but this program also tells you to buy another program just to make it so that way your hands on your model move and since I've done my research on that program as well you have to pay an extra $40~$60 so this program may say \"free\" but the overall price just to get the full experience of the app will cost $60~$90 just to fully use.

I would have even considered paying for character creation services.\n\nAnd I was equally interested in Animaze, and was willing to pay for it.  I was on the upgrade screen, look at the $100 price, and was about to click the button, when I noticed a word at the top of the window.....  \"SUBSCRIPTION\".\n\nWhen I had my furnace installed, no one said that I had to pay the HVAC people a monthly fee for the rest of my life or the furnace stopped working.\n\nI don't know why programmers or companies, think that they can write a bit of software, and then have someone pay them for the rest of their lives, while they do nothing.\n\n\"Well what about bug fixes??\"  Yeah, and Ford has never issued a recall to fix a broken part, and demanded I pay a subscription fee to replace their bad part.\n\n\"Well what about new avatars?\"   Yeah, and I am more than willing to pay for new avatars that I actually want.   But reality is, I'm going to use one avatar on my videos, and never use any others.  So why should I pay you for the rest of my life, so you can make an avatar I never use?\n\nTo anyone reading this, I'm sure Animaze is one of the best software packages on the internet right now for this sort of service.   But the reality is, it's not worth paying for the rest of your life.   There are a half dozen other software packages that do exactly the same thing, and are free, or have a flat fee.  Both of which is better than a \"Pay us until you die\" subscription model.\n\nPretty sad.  Almost paid them $100, and instead they get nothing.  And to think they had a kickstarter, and now they are demanding the people who supported them, pay for the rest of their lives to use their software.

I will say once you go pro not much really changes accept for the amount of generic characters you can use and some of the tracking options expand. If you are just starting out you don't NEED to go pro right away.

As a former United States Marine, I am definitely about packing the right gear to accomplish whatever the mission at hand demands. Animaze has forged us a powerful tool to accomplish that, tailor made to just about any virtual interaction ecosphere out there. The Animaze Editor is streamlined but packs enough punch to handle compositing, debugging, and particle effects. I am just beginning to find my own feet in the Editor now, with the aid of the concise documentation and tireless support from their team on Discord, answering user questions. I do love the expressiveness and range of emotion all avatars are capable of, in the Animaze SDK landscape.

I did see updates that gave more avatars and basic things but am not aware of anything substantial that was added run wise or feature wise other than token things like avatars. Comparing the two products having never used either, I felt like the one-time purchase item was better than the subscription product. The renewal for Animaze tripled in price but the features were not worth paying triple when their Facerig product still seemed to feel better. I have since started looking for a new product from another developer.  I don\u2019t mind paying for something but I am not down with paying more for a product that has less and does far less than I expect for a subscription product.

Yes, you need to *convert to .avatar*. And I said you can't use VRMs (and other **3D** formats) *directly*. If the whole point is protecting artists, then sure I'll concede that.\n\n2. Yeah you can see if it works and if you want to actually stream with animaze you have to pay, which on its own is reasonable. What I don't like the subscription model, which is what I am referring to as a 'cash grab'. (Facerig, which does predate vtubing getting big is not sub-based, which you already know.)\n\n3. Being a pioneer in a field doesn't mean you're immune from making missteps, nor does it mean your competition can't do better. If Facerig had gotten an update to support VRMs,  people wouldn't be upset. But Animaze...\n\n4. You can use the free tier to test if iPhone-based tracking will work for you, sure. But if you actually want to stream with Animaze, you need the subscription, and I already commented on the subscription model.\n\n5. Are you trying to imply I'm not a paying customer? LOL. The lack of recent hours is because I moved on from the app, *after having used it with a plus-tier sub for a few streams*.  And I did actually open the app recently - to cancel my sub. I left this review after uninstalling because I was making space for another game I'd bought. \n\nIn conclusion. Was I a little harsh? Yeah, and I shouldn't have been.

If you're paying for this you're being scammed. Vtube studio offers superior tracking for a one time 15 dollar fee if you want to pursue vtubing/streaming. If you wanted to make more than 500 dollars while streaming for twitch you have to purchase their more expensive plan. Animaze is just Facerig but with all of the predatory practices. There are lots of face tracking programs that do what Animaze does but better at a fraction of the price.\n\nEdit: I love how the dev responded to me with a huge wall of text insinuating I'm \"greedy\" for recommending vtube studio and making strawmans for my arguments and when they got criticized in the comments once they deleted the reply and wrote a new one with a video of a high pitched lion avatar breaking down my argument.

(60x return on investment or better) .\n\n\nIf you are not getting the 25x or 60x ROI or better, you can stay on the free tier, or if you want to be a paying customer who supports the development instead of a free user,  you have the 20 USD per year Plus plan. \n\n\nCheers!\n\n"}, "109872473": {"recommendationid": "109872473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198428084729", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 787, "playtime_at_review": 2610, "last_played": 1700639944}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this but what happend to the old facerig i cant find it anymore", "timestamp_created": 1644436962, "timestamp_updated": 1644436962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498007982969284058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109863627": {"recommendationid": "109863627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030563834", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 5908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4674, "last_played": 1690529192}, "language": "english", "review": "i use this for streaming best app ive found only one that dosnt lagg on my games unless im playing something really high end but thats my hardware not the app itself !", "timestamp_created": 1644426602, "timestamp_updated": 1644426602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498007982969284058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109674921": {"recommendationid": "109674921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120979973", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 11079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2312, "last_played": 1689746502}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Al principio cuadno lo sacaron la primera vez no era muy bueno y no podia usarlo con mi pj.

It was enough that it just didn't match my audio.  It showed 9/16 gigs of ram used and 50% CPU usage.  It was plugged-in.  If the recommended of an i5 6th-gen is accurate, this should have slayed this without issue.  It. did. not.  I'm a wee-bit disappointed in this as it should have used more CPU instead of making me turn it down.   Like if it was pegged at 80-100%, sure...   but it was 50% so it was sparing room for what?  It's 2022 and your multicore game better be on-point.\n* The paywall is like 20 bucks a year (currently) unless you make north of 500 bucks a month streaming.  This seems more than reasonable, IMHO.\n* The lip tracking wasn't nearly as expressive as I was hoping it would be.

More detailed information of what the letter suffixes mean can be found here: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-U-M-QM-MQ-and-HQ-processors-of-Intel-to-consider-when-buying-a-laptop\n\nThe i7-8565U is meant to function on 15 watts of power and below, while the desktop is one meant to run on 75 watts of power. The Ultrabook CPU does do an impressive amount of computation within those 15 watts (it is more power efficient) , but it is still a CPU achitectured around battery efficiency, and not a desktop high power CPU. \n\nDetails below, compared with the desktop grade processor listed as minimum requirement:\nhttps://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-8565U-vs-Intel-Core-i5-4570/m591977vs2770 the i5 is 12 % faster in terms of effective speed.\n\nUltrabook systems built with Ultra Low Voltage processors also almost never have dedicated GPU's, they are relying on the integrated Intel UHD video card. That also tends to clock in below (in terms of raw performance) what we list as the the minimal GPU requirement. Being an integrated GPU (and thus not having its own separate heat management solution), can further compound performance issue by causing thermal throttling (for both CPU and GPU) making the system stay at a lower clock speed. This too may contribute to less than ideal performance you are seeing.\n\nOn the default settings Animaze should take about 1 GB of RAM and about 20%~24% of an average modern desktop CPU. That CPU load can go even lower if the face tracking (typically an intensive CPU task the more details on the face are tracked) is offloaded to an external device such as in iPhone. In that case the total CPU load will hover around 8 to 10%.\n\nMemory usage can shoot up if using a lot of pre-cashed quick scenes and the asset count can quickly ramp up, normally it should be around 1 to 1.5 Gigs of RAM without pre-cached quick scenes.\n\n\nWe have a fair amount of performance tips and tricks listed on the animaze.us website in the FAQ section and we are also active on the forums and our Discord server with more performance related advices. If you are seeing unexplainable high numbers (on CPU, GPU or memory) you can also send in your app logs and dxdiag logs with proper context to support[@]animaze[.]us for us to figure out that was atypical, and why you are seeing more resource load than normal. There could be things that we need to tweak too.\n\n"}, "107332325": {"recommendationid": "107332325", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037628654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1641601852}, "language": "english", "review": "has anime", "timestamp_created": 1641333736, "timestamp_updated": 1641333736, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445290058851242065", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1641391959, "developer_response": "Did you mean to leave a positive review instead of a negative one?"}, "107270414": {"recommendationid": "107270414", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993464986", "num_games_owned": 442, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1641263903}, "language": "english", "review": "It's bloated Scam-ware.

This instantly makes it the most practical, polished, and user friendly solution for Virtual Avatars. A huge thank you to the Animaze team for listening to the feedback and finally making the change, even if it did take this long.  I'm more then happy to continue purchasing upgraded versions of Animaze as long as those licenses don't expire. Below is my orignal review before the new perpetual license options were added.\n\nThis is a tough one for me.  My reason for not recommending really comes down to being forced to rent instead of buy if you want to remove the watermark and use a couple other features that could be useful.  That being said, at the time of writing this and assuming they don't change the way the watermark works, you can technically circumvent it in OBS.  To be clear, I would only use Animaze for personal use in video calls and maybe an unmonetized stream or two.  I have no desire to make money as a streamer, but I think if you are, then its completely fair and you shouldn't have a problem paying a subscription for commercial use.  Its not fair for personal users like myself though and we shouldn't have the obnoxious eye sore forced on us.\n\nWhen Animaze first came out it had restrictions on the free version that would have definitely kept me away without a perpetual option to unlock them, such as a 90 minute time limit to use the virtual camera, but they've since removed a lot of those restrictions and its actually quite usable as is if you don't want to pay a subscription and are just using it to make video calls more fun, like me. That's why I've finally been tempted to give it a chance.  I don't trust it to stay that way though and that is why I wholeheartedly would recommend you look elsewhere for a virtual webcam.  I would even say pick up FaceRig while you still can (to the end of 2021).  The UI isn't as nice and clean looking but it still has all the features I think most people would care about.  Custom 3D avatars, LeapMotion support, green screen background, and most importantly NO WATERMARK!\n\nI actually don't mind supporting software with a monthly contribution (I donate $10 every month to Blender) but when its forced and I have no option to buy perpetual access then I'm instantly turned off.  I still use Adobe CS6 and will switch to freeware before every paying a penny for Creative Cloud.  The reason is it takes a way the incentive for them to keep improving the software.  If the only option for people to unintrusively use your software is to rent, you have a guaranteed stream of income and no real reason to add anything new.  I'll likely end up going back to FaceRig since I don't see them offering a perpetual version of Animaze any time soon if at all.  \n\nThe improvements in Animaze are basically all in the cleaner looking UI and the FacRig engine and tracking still looks pretty close to the same in my eyes.  There is an Anubis avatar in Animaze that I really like but I can always make my own for FaceRig if I end up really missing him.  If they back track on some of the restrictions they've removed or change the watermark so it can't be removed in OBS, I'll definitely be saying adios.\n\nI know this ended up a bit long but I wanted to actually sound constructive and not just talk down to Holotech in a fit of rage over their new licensing strategy.  I don't agree with the way they've executed it but do think they've put some hard work into making an improved version of what was formally FacRig.  I just hope they can eventually see why opinions like this matter and aren't going to change.", "timestamp_created": 1638522183, "timestamp_updated": 1662070395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784105896949768066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105124976": {"recommendationid": "105124976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143110800", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2054, "last_played": 1691204821}, "language": "english", "review": "  It;s a lot of  fun to play But it;s hard to learn you should take tutorials and  view the guides first then you will have a much easier time using it", "timestamp_created": 1638518924, "timestamp_updated": 1638518924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507518291473388672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1638548345, "developer_response": "Hello golddragon!\n\nThanks so much for the nice words and for calling out the importance of reading the guides and documentation.\n\nMotion capture, video broadcasting, and 3D animation are inherently complex as activity fields; we are working to simplify them and make them as understandable as we can (for everyday use, and everyday hardware), but high-quality motion capture will always have some need of care related to the proper set-up and calibration. \n\nThe support team is super happy to hear that the guides and tutorials have been helpful for you!\n\n\n\n"}, "105058044": {"recommendationid": "105058044", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076117554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1100, "last_played": 1658832107}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1638434222, "timestamp_updated": 1638434222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105024304": {"recommendationid": "105024304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104120347", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1648775197}, "language": "english", "review": "my god is this thing resource hungry. running an fx9590 it uses 90% cpu no matter what settings. defo cant play games with it open so i guess its just a cool little gimmick", "timestamp_created": 1638386276, "timestamp_updated": 1638386276, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1638395107, "developer_response": "Hello 1Jacky_folf !\n\nDefinitely not normal values, most people are seeing values around 20%, on average machines, not 90% (90% is a shocking number to be sure).

I excitedly backed it and awaited the launch. So when it came out I was thrilled. JUST as I got into streaming (my dream at the time) support for Facerig was dropped. I was crestfallen, but hopeful for Animaze.\nWhen Animaze dropped and I opened it only to find that it had a timer on it I dropped it entirely. \nI could use the program that was said to be -replacing- facerig, not just as a new program but this had been touted as being the full replacement for facerig. Because they were stopping all support for facerig, removin it from the app stores and all. \nand the first thing they did was say 'oh well... yeah you bought the full license of facerig but THIS program is different and you can use it for 90 whole minutes to stream'\nI deleted it. \nI didn't plan to come back to it ever but my friends insisted I try a cam on my stream. \nI tried it again and the timer's gone. \nCool...\nBut there's a watermark. \n\"Oh you can erase this annoying watermark for 10 bucks\"\n\nI tried to use it on my tablet so I could actually stream. \nBecause it's linked to steam. I can't. So I can't play my games AND stream animaze at the same time. \nWhy? Because Animaze, a program that does all of its rendering and tracking locally, will not work whatsoever without an internet connection. And if you're not connected to steam, it won't register that you have a subscription. \nBut if you have it connected through steam OOPS! You can't run another program on your main computer because you're already running animaze, and IT has to use your steam account 100% and be 100% online in order to function. \nFor a program that does all of its work on the computer it's installed on. \n\nIt holds NO updated data on your subscription, so if you try to use it in offline mode and do have the ability to not have the watermark on there. NOPE you can't use that. \nCan't use it effectively in a 2 computer setup. \nCan't use it offline.\nCan't stream without watermarks without paying for subscription.\nStill a little bitter about how badly facerig was just dropped like a scalding rock.\nThe 'quick calibrate' (ctrl+c) doesn't seem to work super well and there's no calibrate button like facerig had for easy and omplete clibration.\nThere's apparently an app but it's only for ios, and I don't have apple I use android...\nI was super excited for the improvements that Animaze offers. I would have happily paid for the program in the way I paid foor Facerig... (several times, I bought it at launh for a friend too and later on, bought a license for them) \nBut having to rebuy the program just to get the basic function that it's intended for... having to put it as a subscription yearly, just for the VERY basic functionality... I didn't mind the licenses facerig had  'the base program can be used for small streamers who aren't making money but if you're using our program to make more than x than we do deserve our share through a license purchase; made SENSE\nI don't make anything with my streams. I never intended to, I just wanted to be able to stream comfortably. \nBut the fac that your program's all but unusable even if I DO pay for it over and over again?\nYou were so much better than this. You had such potential. \nI'm glad you took that stupid timer off. \nBut it never should have existed in the first place. \nThis program started off on bad footing and it's still stumbling. \nMaybe it'll get better later down the line but this loophole subscription thing is really really sleezy. The fact the thing can't work without an internet connection is shady as everything. And the fact you can't use it in a two pc set up even if you do actually cave and pay the subecription fee because BASIC FUNCTIONS are hidden behind a loophole in-game purchase?\nThat's super scuzzy and honestly... even if I hear that it's fixed I don't know that I'm willing to put trust and faith back into the company or program at this point because of these tactics. \n\nI had a lot of hope for this. I was severely let down from day one and even after trying again with the hope it had improved I'm severely let down again. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1636826948, "timestamp_updated": 1636826948, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743306875228881836", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1636913758, "developer_response": "Hello Asrya Kino!\n\nThank you for this feedback, we read it all (both positive and negative) and we always try to take that to heart and do better!\n\n\n1. On the replacing topic:\nAnimaze is replacing Facerig after seven years just in the sense that it will serve the ever-connected Metaverse avatar future, as a live service, far better than Facerig ever could as an offline tool.\nFacerig itself is not disappearing from your library: it is a standalone tool and can continue to be used just as before, (ideally indefinitely) in parallel with Animaze. \nAnimaze existing does not take anything away from the current FaceRig.\n\n\n2. Facerig's support ending after seven years.\nFacerig's fate took a dark turn three-four years after its 2014 launch when resources were running out in 2017-2018, it looked like soon there would be no way to pay for significant art and programming hours to go into it anymore.\n\nAnimaze dev. effort was started separately in 2018, helped by external investment from institutional investors on a different Metaverse-centric paradigm, to better serve the future and avoid the mistakes of the past. \n\n\n3. Simultaneous 2 PC Steam use is possible:\nWe hear you on the need to stream Animaze in parallel with a Steam game and solutions are in place. \n- On the same PC: starting a game and Animaze should work at the same time, by default.\n- If using two different PC's and the same Steam account on both: just start Steam in \"Offline mode\" on the Animaze PC, and Animaze should still start and work with all its sub features available (if you are a sub). If you join the Discord we can walk you through those steps.\n\nIn the future, a non-Steam version of Animaze will exist too, to make things even easier. \n\n\n4. Last and not least: we cannot legally \"sell to own\" if we do not have the legal right to do so. \nA lot of technology layers and libraries required to bring the best avatar experience for the Metaverse, particularly face tracking ones, are also being licensed to us as a service (very few organizations in 2021-2022  license key technology like high-end face tracking to users \"to own forever\" - things were a bit different in 2014). \nThat is one of the reasons why legally we may only license these tech libraries to you as a service; on the flip side the service does have a free tier though, and the paid tiers are optional and inexpensive.\n\nWe are always available to discuss all these things, including calibration tips and tricks, on our Discord (check out the Steam forum for Discord join data)."}, "102697376": {"recommendationid": "102697376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043638542", "num_games_owned": 805, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 18004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1695789384}, "language": "english", "review": "So far I have not had issues related to animaze itself.

I want to be like the cool kids. But when I finally am ready to transcend I realize I'm not cut out to be anything in the world. Same with everything I do in life. Obviously when I found Animaze things began to finally look up for me. Finally I was able to stream my gaming skills to myself via Twitch (no one wants to watch me). So with Animaze I was able to be a cool kid, and to be confident enough to live stream an entire hour of a shitty game that I sucked at. Either way, Animaze works great. It's got a lot of great features and if you set it up right you'll find that maybe you really are the cool kid on the block... and that maybe the others dont talk to you because they are intimidated by how badass they think you are. \n\nMAYBE THE WORLD ISNT WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS YOUR WHOLE LIFE. MAYBE GIRLS DONT TALK TO YOU BECAUSE THEY ASSUME YOU ALREADY HAVE A G/F BECAUSE HOW COULD YOU NOT? F**KING STUD, GET WITH IT. Animaze  opened my eyes to a whole new way of perception-based introspection. I've always felt that I wasn't good enough, wasn't hot enough, wasn't happy enough, wasn't drunk enough, wasn't high enough, nothing was ever good enough and the world was so damn bleak that I forced myself into an awkward state of existential disappointment. All of those dark, suicidal thoughts and psychotic demonized views I had of the world are gone, thanks to Animaze.\n\nSo before you knock it, go for it, and you might just find that you're actually the chosen one and that the universe actually was created with you at it's core. Perhaps maybe you are the hero of the deepest dream ever dreamt, the hero who will finally awaken the the God who desperately needs you... Wake up the sleeping monad... Save this universe from eternal sleep-state.

Not to mention the fact that the tracking isn't all that great, and I've done everything possible to improve it.  I also hate the way they just abandoned FaceRig. It used to be great.

Here is what most likely happened:\n\nWhenever you install a new webcam driver, the Windows OS by default assumes that this latest one is the one you want that as your \"default webcam\",  that communication apps will use by default. You can change what the \"default Windows webcam\"  is via the Control Pannel.\n\nIn your case, after installing Animaze,  the last installed webcam driver was the Animaze Virtual Camera driver, so that's why Zoom was using it by default (nothing was forced though - you could have picked a different camera with the Zoom camera selector at any time).\n\nWhat maybe threw you off was the  Windows \"one-app one-camera limit\". In Windows, to prevent hackers to spy on you via your webcam,  there is this limitation at the OS level: Only one app can access a camera device at a given time. So if you were already using your real camera as a tracking source in Animaze, no other software could access that physical webcam too, as it was already in use. If you had first closed Animaze, then the other apps should have been able to again access the physical webcam.  \n\nAll the above assume that OS webcam access permissions were correctly set up.\n\nNow after uninstalling Animaze, it could be that the Animaze Virtual Webcam driver is still on your system (for some reason the uninstall script did not remove it). \nYou can easily remove it manually, using the Device Manager. \nYou just need to look for the Animaze Virtual Webcam Driver, most likely under \" Imaging Devices\"  and right-click and hit uninstall. \n\nHope the above is helpful! \nIf you need more help please write to support[@]animaze[.]us"}, "97934346": {"recommendationid": "97934346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271941081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1629483966}, "language": "english", "review": "i spent a little bit on the customization side of this software since this was the feature that made me download it. it's really easy to personalize your avatar and make it unique and the fact that there are a lot of props to choose from adds so much more to this feature.", "timestamp_created": 1629484553, "timestamp_updated": 1629484553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97917910": {"recommendationid": "97917910", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126961196", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1294, "last_played": 1641480761}, "language": "english", "review": "WHEN I TRY TO LUCH THIS software BUT IT DOSENT ASLO I DONT HAVE TO LOG FILE", "timestamp_created": 1629463749, "timestamp_updated": 1629493071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014469861984253", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1629465554, "developer_response": "Hello! \n\nPlease go to Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Animaze\\Data and get the Animaze log from there.

Adjusting the light sources in the room.\n2. Adjusting the advanced tracking settings related to eyes in the software to filter more (or flat out ignore) eye-tracking and use procedural behaviours like \"look at camera\" instead of tracking (that's how most software is dealing with \"unavoidable\"  glare on glasses).\n3. If most of the glare comes from just one source such as the monitor screen:  using a simple layer of inexpensive polarised film on top of the webcam, rotated to filter out the glare works wonders (and a large enough patch of polarised film should cost only a few dollars - no need for expensive photographic polarised filter lenses).\n4.Using iPhone TrueDepth tracking, Tobii Eye tracker or infrared tracking instead of regular webcam tracking. (Animaze works with all of the above)  \n5.Using anti-reflective lenses.\n\n\nMore glasses related advice and motion capture set-up advice, in general, can be found in our FAQ section on animaze.us\n\nCheers!"}, "97347911": {"recommendationid": "97347911", "author": {"steamid": "76561199088230225", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1698046861}, "language": "english", "review": "hi", "timestamp_created": 1628678086, "timestamp_updated": 1628678086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483677566051483154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97325892": {"recommendationid": "97325892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107471245", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1628642221}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you have a fetish of being held hostage over petty things?

Which are both 100% free. Go to an artist to make your models/props/scenes and you only have to pay once. Not monthly/yearly. Don't use this white washed, over priced, OVER USED crap they're trying to sell you here. ITS NOT WORTH IT. You can get the same stuff, direct from an artist on Fiverr, for a fraction of the price. DM me for recommendations.\n\nEdited response to the developer: \nSo, what youre saying is, that your program doesnt accept .vrm files. And i have to use another portal to convert it first? \nThats just another reason no one should be paying you a SUBSCRIPTION FEE.\n\nIf im paying you monthly, youd better be providing any related service i need, directly through the app. Including LOADING A DAMN FILE THAT'S WIDELY USED IN THE COMMUNITY YOURE TRYING TO TAP INTO. \nYoure clearly cutting corners and over charging. \nFor the price of 5 years of animaze, i got my avatar, 7 outfits, and infinite revisions and he will edit my model however I like, within reason, indefinitely. And no one else has an avatar even remotely like mine. \nYour models will be whitewashed and re-used hundreds of thousands of times each, if people are gullible enough to fall for your scam.", "timestamp_created": 1625411652, "timestamp_updated": 1625488639, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499598920345306396", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1625422810, "developer_response": "Hi KreJaxTV,\n\nGood news!

It works great. It even feels smoother and has less impact on my PC's performance compared to facerig, which is a huge resource hog. I didn't feel like I was hurting my framerate as much as I did with facerig.\n\nHere are the problems. Here is how to fix this in one fell swoop and regain confidence in your users. There are many reviews that are negative, rightfully so, but I want to be a little more... constructive.\n\nFirstly: the coin system is useless and no one cares about anything in it. There's nothing meaningful. I have the 1500 or 2000 or whatever from registering and having facerig I guess, and I bought a few things to try stuff, but... it's meaningless. I understand if it's being expanded upon regularly, but there is no reason to want to pay money for these objects that don't have any character, any aesthetic, are cookie cutter, when you can literally just use the money you'd pay for the subscription, cash shop, whatever, on a real avatar and use any of the other software available, or just facerig itself. \n\nLiterally the only reason I could see for having a cash shop coinsystem like this is if the devs were releasing ~licensed content~, in partnership with some other intellectual properties, so that you can curb the cost of the licensed materials. I could see it being justified in that case. Only. \n\nNext, the convenience-heavy subscriptions I have tried to explain why each one is useless. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/CgGNgXM.png\n\nHow to fix this? After all, complaining with no suggestions is simply whining. \n~ I want the convenience to be built in. \n~ I want the subscription fees, or cash shop things, to be something you ease into- for instance, how pretty much the rest of this sort of market functions. They should be features and tools that advanced users can take the most advantage of, and not being any sort of expert in this software, I can't tell the devs what that should be, but asking the advanced users is the best way to start.\n~ The fully functional, non-annoyance base software should be like the 'plus' subscription. From there, you can add in ways to pay so as to enhance what you are expressing to your viewers- after all, that's the entire point of this. Not funny video calls, not funny videos. It's about streaming, and for those of us who do not feel comfortable with a facecam to be able to express ourselves more thoroughly through our actions. Watching myself play a shooter was incredible; I didn't realize how expressive I was, how serious I looked, how smug I looked after good shots or good kills, whatever. How I look when I get confused. It's all different from real life, and it makes vtubing very fun and very intimate with viewers you previously may have only been able to connect with with your radio voice. \n\n~ Streamlabs is a good example of ways to monetize 'convenience' content without making you pay first to not be annoyed, then afterwards for materials.  (Maybe not. Updated 12/26/21))\n\n~ If you don't have enough content made yet to fill up the shop, then stop wasting development time on the customizable awful looking avatars, and work on more effects, backgrounds, scenes, transitions, things that can be adjusted and edited. I really liked the little effects- the hearts and stuff are things I definitely want on my avatar. I would pay for a whole set of things like that. I see...  six? And two are terrible. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/oxxByrN here are examples of why I think these are great and should be expanded on. I know I can do this myself with OBS and other tools. But THAT'S the sort of feature that can be monetized, artist time can be spent on, is nondiscriminatory of avatar types since they could be for anyone, etc etc. \n\nThere is a lot of potential being wasted in this software because of how it is being presented. \nI give this a pre-recommend because I am optimistic and hope in the future I won't have to change it. I will surely come back to this review in 6-12 months and then see where Animaze has gone. \n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1621707031, "timestamp_updated": 1640524984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 115, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874485373497009277", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92119555": {"recommendationid": "92119555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424302249", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1620936850}, "language": "english", "review": "knk", "timestamp_created": 1621194122, "timestamp_updated": 1621194122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92036713": {"recommendationid": "92036713", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044092081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1678542086}, "language": "english", "review": "nice and helpful", "timestamp_created": 1621080343, "timestamp_updated": 1621080343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490066230297088623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92028352": {"recommendationid": "92028352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198228526304", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 21516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1687196321}, "language": "english", "review": "everything works now, amazing support! can recommend!", "timestamp_created": 1621068061, "timestamp_updated": 1621617076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1621245154, "developer_response": "Hello Schmilley,\n\nIf you would like to disable any kind of tracking, you can always do so by going into the \"My account\" panel and then the options to disable each of them separately is under \"Advanced Configuration\"\n\nBy doing so, you can choose to track only your head or just one eye for example.

Second, be aware streamers and content creators, if you make more than $500 a month you will have to pay an additional fee for commercial rights (lol), so *** ridiculous.\nThe first reason is actually the one holding me back from a subscription, such a basic vital feature locked behind a paywall, not a business modell I will support.\n\nFurthermore, the face tracking is horrible, in 5 minutes I had to recalibrate more than 10 times because everytime I itch my face (or anything blocking the face) or turn my head to far the calibration fails to go back and a calibration must be done.\nThere's no way to have a casual pose or turn of head tracking so just be aware of some really weird animations and avatar bugs.\n\nIf you ask me, for a free app it's mediocre.

This, by no means, constitutes an additional fee since they were using the program for Free until then. \n\nIn regards to the face tracking, it is important to remember that one must have good lighting and that the camera should be placed level with the streamer's face.

We have an FAQ on tips and tricks on how to get the best out of the tracker: https://www.animaze.us/faq/animazedesktop/tipsandtricksfortracking\n2. We've rolled out an update a few days ago which solved a lot of sensibilities with the props and customizations and other sensibilities with the new features. If you're still encountering crashes, you can always write to us on the Discord channel or mail us at support[@]animaze[.]us.\n3. I think this is tied to the Steam Overlay. If it's not active, then you won't be able to see the purchase screen: Open the Steam client and navigate to the Steam > Settings/Preferences > In-game tab. Check the box next to Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game.\n\nRegards,\nDavid"}, "91780306": {"recommendationid": "91780306", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975074324", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1620753676}, "language": "english", "review": "Spent the past hour just trying to get the app to open, it finally did after I had to re-install graphics drivers.

Oh there are certainly improvements needed. It's not very fluid, small movements can be extreme, don't get me started on glasses tracking (yes I know, try to remove glare.... you're looking in a monitor, there's only so much you can do for glare). But it works and is fairly decent. There's an option for custom uploads that I haven't explored to have an opinion on. I Don't even know where to look for custom avatar options. However, it needs a LOT more options.  Hats, body shapes, face shapes.

MICRO-TRANSACTION!\n\nThe silly micro-transaction options need to be allowed to be previewed.

We don't care about the business side of things, we know how it hits our wallets, and that is what matters to us, the money spender.

GET RID OF THE MICRO-TRANSACTIONS. Loose the silly coin currency, Full buy or sub. Pick a model your customers will like and eliminate the uphill battle of trust that you've lost from the start b/c of your business model. You're a face tracking software, not a shitty mobile game that needs to die before it was made b/c of those damn dollar me to death micros. So stop it.\n\nIn it's current state as of 5/5/2020 it's usable if you hate yourself and have 0 self respect. I'd explore other options first. Literally anyone that has a more consumer conscious business model. If the pay model is fixed to NOT feel like a miserable and trashy mobile game, and you feel like taking the time to hunt for and figure out the custom uploads then this might be the product for you.

The watermark never goes over the center of the screen - easily croppable. \nAlso we didn't put a time limit on the tracking on the free version - the broadcast timer is just on the vcam driver-  but you don't need the vcam driver if you use  OBS window capture.  \nWe do think all the dev work eventually deserves payment, but you can, if you insist, stay on the free tier forever as a power-user by using OBS.\n\nThe free tier is meant for more casual users, who just want to join a class as an avatar for the lul's, they usually don't mind the watermark or the time limit. \nYou seem to be more of a power-user who wants to use Animaze for streaming, and we think a paid plan is fair for power-users."}, "89725661": {"recommendationid": "89725661", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095730232", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 548, "last_played": 1652655503}, "language": "spanish", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1617567082, "timestamp_updated": 1617567082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89619709": {"recommendationid": "89619709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019961146", "num_games_owned": 436, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1697599184}, "language": "english", "review": "This really should've just been an update to FaceRig to make it better.

To list a few:\n-> iPhone tracking (via Wifi), \n-> Better webcam face tracking (that can even see when you're sticking out the tongue)\n-> Persona Avatar Creator (allowing for thousand of avatar creation combinations),\n-> Hybrid avatars ( new technology, never available in FaceRig),\n-> Animaze Editor Tool (and avatar artist documentation).\n-> Live2D animated backgrounds with overlays.\n-> Two types of audio-based lip motion.\n\nSoon to be released:\n-> VRM support\n-> Freeform Live2D parameter remapping.\n-> Emotes support (also user-editable)\nAnd more (stay tuned for the next update :)).\n\nAnimaze is still in Early Access (more things are being added each month).\n \nAnimaze like FaceRig supports importing your own characters too, it is an open creation platform  (the pool of avatars will grow as time goes by- Animaze has only been live for a few months, but you don't have to rely only on the stock avatars). However, the importing tools and documentation for Animaze are far superior to Facerig's.\n\n"}, "89229016": {"recommendationid": "89229016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057950512", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 2603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2012, "last_played": 1642622647}, "language": "spanish", "review": "gratis aun que no se si se pueda poner mas personas al mismo tiempo", "timestamp_created": 1616907057, "timestamp_updated": 1616907057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89228504": {"recommendationid": "89228504", "author": {"steamid": "76561199143605838", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 80632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1207, "last_played": 1679448875}, "language": "english", "review": "so easy to use.", "timestamp_created": 1616906270, "timestamp_updated": 1616906270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89212430": {"recommendationid": "89212430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387058805", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1625364698}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1616883062, "timestamp_updated": 1616883062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89208268": {"recommendationid": "89208268", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966754799", "num_games_owned": 974, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1616219531}, "language": "english", "review": "I've tried to give this new app a shot, but this is a worse version than the original FaceRig, ruined by its business model.

If you want to go higher you need to set the base value to be higher, and you can do so when importing through the Animaze Editor.\n\n\nThe reason that is happening is because Animaze does use the best practice of reading the recommended render size set by the original artist from the Cubism Editor and does not by default override it with 8k (which is what is happening by default in other apps). \nSome software suites have chosen by default to ignore this setting and just override it with 8k, and that is why many artists now forget to set it, but the recommended best practice is to use this artist-set value.\n\nYou can edit it in Animaze too, but you need to import your avatar through the Animaze Editor path  do so (rather than use the fast lane direct-to-app import )"}, "88854660": {"recommendationid": "88854660", "author": {"steamid": "76561199032150402", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1606761130}, "language": "english", "review": "E BUNA", "timestamp_created": 1616362025, "timestamp_updated": 1616362025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452302634716033936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1616421316, "developer_response": "Multumim!"}, "88843792": {"recommendationid": "88843792", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026622788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1624910970}, "language": "english", "review": "its good", "timestamp_created": 1616348878, "timestamp_updated": 1616348878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471698105335235596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1616421416, "developer_response": "Thanks!"}, "88816287": {"recommendationid": "88816287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087091464", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1673493863}, "language": "english", "review": "very good, overhated, free version is more than enough for most uses and paid version is decently priced", "timestamp_created": 1616315451, "timestamp_updated": 1616315451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1616421491, "developer_response": "Thank you for your support! :)"}, "88802731": {"recommendationid": "88802731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198945093993", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1616293079}, "language": "english", "review": "it dosent even launch.", "timestamp_created": 1616293231, "timestamp_updated": 1616293231, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1616407756, "developer_response": "Hi, \nWe'd love to help you with this.

Many of the casual users never feel the need to upgrade to a paid plan.\n\n\n\n\nIt is understandable how for power users the Free Tier might feel more limiting (like a trial), but for most casual people, it is a fun free product that they use when attending a class, or having a laugh with friends/ on a short stream. This even extends past the gaming world, for instance, grandparents who haven't seen their nephews in a long time due to Covid, wanting to read stories over Skype video-call as a character from the story via Animaze. \n\nPower users' use-cases (streaming longer hours / making a living out of streaming) are indeed better suited for a paid plan. \n\n\nThe claim that Animaze is not different enough from Facerig overlooks a lot of features and facts.\n\n- An in-app human character creator (Personas, nothing like this ever existed in Facerig) \n- A different, better tracking engine with far more tracking parameters\n- 64 bit infrastructure (Facerig was always 32 only)\n- Two distinct audio tracking methods (Facerig only had one)\n- Radically different artist tools \n- Brand new render engine (OpenGL based, better suited for future cross-platform than the FaceRig DirectX approach)\n- Brand new animation engine\n- Hybrid avatars.\n- Live2D animated backgrounds and overlays - with elements that can be tied to the tracking.\nwill stop here (but the list can go on, and not even starting the listing on the in-progress initiatives that are almost done & will be launched in March, like VRM/Vroid  support)\n\nThe fact that there are some old avatars popular with the community that our team has worked extra hard to port over from the old Facerig, and tried to make them look feel familiar is no reason to be dismissive of their efforts. You can ask anyone who tried porting their 3D avatar over themselves without assistance from our team - jumping from one engine to the other is not trivial - in spite of the significant work we put in simplifying the process). \n\nAnimaze is not a copy of Facerig, any more than (to use a gaming comparison) the Witcher 3  is actually a copy of Witcher 2.\n\nOnly someone who only briefly looks on the surface before passing judgment might get that impression.\n"}, "87422808": {"recommendationid": "87422808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343193160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1668856720}, "language": "english", "review": "Aftrer the last update, everything is running sweet as a nut - great tracking performance, love the range of characters available - I took part in a Microsoft Teams meeting as Donald Trump last night, good for a giggle.

Writing to support@animaze.us is the best path for that.\n\n\n\"It's kind of fun. But facial expressions are extremely limited...\"\n\nThis is a common misunderstanding occurring when people are using the software without a calibration, or with a wrong calibration.\nIt sounds like either a proper calibration was not performed, or the audio-based lip tracking was turned on but configured wrong in terms of background noise threshold (or there is a new bug that is occurring in very particular situations - but so far the cause for that has almost always been improper calibration)\nAlways calibrate properly, and set the proper noise gate for background noise for audio, otherwise, it can misbehave as you described.\n\nMore details and tips and tricks on mo-cap setup are in the FAQ section on animaze dot us (writing it this way as web-links are not allowed here) \n/faq/animazedesktop/calibrateinanimaze\n/faq/animazedesktop/tipsandtricksfortracking\n\n\n\"The avatar closes its mouth only when there's nobody facing the camera...\"\n\nAssuming a proper calibration was performed, this occurs only when you have audio lipsync turned on but with a really low, or no noise threshold, so all background noise from the microphone generates some lip motion/lip opening.\n\nIt is easy to get the avatar to fully close its mouth: all is needed is proper visual calibration and good audio tracking settings, (if audio tracking is also used). Alternately you can turn off audio tracking completely and rely on visual only (but a 60 FPS webcam providing a 60 fps input and 60 FPS tracking is almost mandatory for good lip motion in this case).\n\n\n\"Also we can update textures, but we don't have access to the obj of their avatars or at least a flattened wireframe. So it's basically impossible to do anything nice and pro. \"\n\nThe in-app texture edits are indeed meant for more beginning users who are just learning the ropes. \nImporting fully custom avatars, from all professional tools (via common formats) is possible via the Animaze Editor. Full documentation is here.\n www . animaze . us / manual\n\n\"And export as obj / fbx for paid users would have been nice to be able to really customize those avatars. \"\n\nThe run-time avatars are there for people with limited 3D knowledge who really want to use them as they come, and at most some minor edits.\n \nFor people who can edit fully OBJ and FBX models, and would know where to begin on how to generate a mathematically correct normal map for a pre-existing tangent space from a run-time model reverse-engineered into an editable OBJ/FBX source,  those people are very very few, and we always assume that had their own models to import rather than work on derivative assets.\n\nIf you are in that group, you can always contact us at support@animaze.us and tell us which models you would want the sources to, (because that's the exception rather than the norm so we have considered spending resources to build such a feature in the app  - that very few people would use -  would best be avoided). \n\nWe love the ideas. Please drop by our Discord channel to chat! \n discord . gg / e53h99z\n\nWill provide some feedback just to one of them (because using high FOV on the render camera is possible, it just takes a bit of extra work as it was not the default).\n\n.Ideas :\n\"- an option to change the camera's focal so that when the avatar bends forward, we can get a more powerful effect. As it is the camera nearly feels like an isometric viewport. \"\n\nEven our team is not necessarily of one mind on the matter of the default camera FOV. Artists building the 3D models were the ones that pushed for a low default FOV for the camera to have less perspective deformation (almost isometric). \nYou can in the Animaze Editor create a background that uses a higher  FOV camera instead of the almost isometric look. (so you can get this effect).\n\nThank you again for all the feedback, and we can't wait to talk with you on Discord!\n\n\n\n\nOn the Edit: EDIT : \"I paid for a year. My credits went up to 2000. After using the product for about an hour ? My credits went down to 1500. But I did NOT buy anything. Please advise.\"\n\nThe yearly subscription system for access to the more advanced tech features is not connected with the avatar marketplace and its currency system.\nAs far as I know, subscribing is not meant to award coins. I will double-check with the product team- maybe we had a recent development.\n \nArt content purchases in the app are one-time purchases funded by gold coins. Gold coin purchases allows us to pay the artists.\nProviding and updating/maintaining more advanced tech features is separate from art- that is an ongoing body of engineering work, funded via subscriptions - (and does not use gold coins). Subscribing to this service, allows to us pay the engineers.\n\nNot sure what else can generate temporary gold coins increase up to 2000 from the default 1500 free coins, but we do award 500 free gold coins if you make a free Animaze account, so maybe it had something to do with that, rather than anything subscription related.\n\n"}, "86580668": {"recommendationid": "86580668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168867919", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1614488240}, "language": "english", "review": "This mofo keeps dieing and not starting anymore, you  can use ifor a bit, and then it will break and you cant start it again, Ive re=downloaded it mulitple times", "timestamp_created": 1613256811, "timestamp_updated": 1613256811, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510816991329193115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86565925": {"recommendationid": "86565925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110653736", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1613754559}, "language": "english", "review": "so cool software", "timestamp_created": 1613242281, "timestamp_updated": 1613242281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86534188": {"recommendationid": "86534188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290366402", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1671882807}, "language": "english", "review": "meh not bad", "timestamp_created": 1613213972, "timestamp_updated": 1613213972, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492892473936080933", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86508083": {"recommendationid": "86508083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019821261", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1613181876}, "language": "english", "review": "This sucks so much ass", "timestamp_created": 1613181916, "timestamp_updated": 1613181916, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507107555866241455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86503153": {"recommendationid": "86503153", "author": {"steamid": "76561199094815888", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1611781018}, "language": "english", "review": "It's alright, though I'm sure there are better out there.

I assume you are using Animaze as webcam view, so the view is already small.\n2. use a lower setting in the game you are streaming, after all, you are basically streaming two games (resource wise)\n3. use window capture instead of Animaze Virtual Webcam and disable Broadcast.

Then Holotech anounced that animaze would be free.. that made me woried how it would be monetized and what would be free to use limits. I was right to be worried since the free to use lets you use it just okay for random group calls to mess around with it, for anything else its bad. You need to pay monthly subscription in order to get rid of watermark that is randomly jumping around your avatar, there is no customization for your backgrounds (since i use wolf avatar with 1 green and 1 blue eye, i was using pink screen background behinde it, but in animaze i cant do it or even recreate my avatar properly) you could not import or export your avatars (which was changed since i last used it, from what i know) and if you want to use it while you are streaming for a long time you will need to restart it every 2 or so hours.\nNot everything is bad. Avatar customization is better but lacks some features from facerig, hardware usage is a lot better from what i tested, avatars look lot better and have smoother animations and face expressitions, you can customize your avatars clothes colors and thats it.\nThere is probably more things my brain made me forget about just so i would not become insane from trying to make this software work.

I understand that people tend to have a different perspective on where they should be putting their money, but with a software with a near perfect face tracking programming (imo) I feel as if the cost for this is an investment for the people that are using this to become Vtubers or something similar. I've tried researching alternative softwares to Facerig in the past due to their original software 'Facerig' had an issue with picking up my face while I'm wearing glasses half the time, and discovered that there isn't a broad variety of alternatives for just a PC and webcam, most of them are solely dependant on an iPhones face tracking camera features. Ontop of all this the cost is only $20 for a whole year! so what if you have to sacrifice like what... a single takeout meal to afford it, it's a whole year at that price, if Vtuber or whatever is something you really want to do, it's not bad to invest in quality. \n\nI'm not sure what the devs reason for the subscription might be but from my perspective it's an attempt of a consistent stable income for a dev team that needs a consistent income, if Facerig is the only software they've done in the past and that's what they're best at, their sales have probably dropped a considerable amount by now, it's a 5+ year old software now and most the marketting for that softwares probably eaten up by now, things can only trend for so long... I could be wrong on this part but I do see where the devs are coming from, I'm not sure if they were just unlucky with getting the target audience they were looking for but it all just seems all the flak it's been given is quite harsh to me.\n\nonto actual product review, The software works great, I've had no issues with the tracking, or with any imports, in which I must say I'm greatful for the amount of import support it has, after tampering with alternative apps they tend to be a bit strict on what's usable and what's not, this software seems to have quite a wide amount of file support. I've already written about the microphone input to mouth feature would be nice and read the devs response, thank you very much devs. The only other issue I had but have found a fix for is using this while playing games, I've noticed I get a considerable frame drop on Animaze while I'm playing high end video games (I'm using a nvidia 2070s if anyone's considering my card might be the issue) but I have figured out 2 fixes, \n1. frame lock the game, I play on 144hz uncapped most times I play games, but if I have animaze open I lock the frames to 60fps, it seems my PC prioritises pushing all it's resources into the videogame otherwise. \n2. Set the Animaze executable proccess to High Priority, because of previous statement.

While getting rid of that hasn't solved the entire issue, I can at least say that this puts the software in a position where it's friendlier to the average user. My recommendation now is to get and use the software, and show your support for one-time payments by only importing models and downloading from the workshop. I am still happy to pay a one-time purchase for this software instead of this business model instead of this premium currency nonsense. So, while I now can whole-heartedly recommend this software, I urge anyone and everyone to voice support of abolishing the premium currency model in a way that's constructive and devoid of harassment. Do not, and I repeat, do not buy any of their premium currency. The studio will follow where the money is.\n\n\nOUTDATED REVIEW:\n\nPlease let me start by saying that there is some real true potential here. I had the first facerig for some time, and it took me hours to calibrate it to something workable. I nonetheless found it to be a remarkable piece of software, and still do. The work and effort put in by all the developers of this software cannot go understated, and I truly do thank everyone's hard work for making this software.\n\nI have now tried this software and the setup was vastly more simple. The UI is extremely clean and intuitive, and the facial tracking algorithms feel absolutely cutting edge. Even with no calibration at all, it was miles better than the first facerig, and after a bit of fine tuning it was practically 1-to-1 with my own facial expressions. This is a truly remarkable achievement.\n\nBut, alas, I cannot recommend it, and the worst part is that it was due to a decision that likely were not even the developer's fault. This was a business decision. And make no mistake, anyone who throws shade at the developers who had no control over this business decision are just as big of a problem. The business decision in question is, of course, making this free to play with premium currency. The business decision made here could only have come from one of two possibilities: Either they didn't know that it would generate such awful PR, or they simply didn't care. Whatever the case, there is no excuse for it.\n\nCharge me $30, Charge me $40, Charge me $50, I don't care. The truth remains that I (and clearly many others) would much prefer to give a one-time payment than this heinous business model which should never have left the mobile gaming industry (and in my opinion shouldn't exist there either). Some may think it generosity to start us out with currency, but that is exactly how they get you: enough for a few models, but leaves you wanting more. It's so much easier to justify all those smaller purchases over a longer period of time, and this is not even including the subscription service. If locking those features behind a paywall really means so much to the business reps at Holotech, at least do us the decency of having a standard and pro version of the software instead of this.\n\nI have followed the development of facerig very closely and was very excited for Animaze, but this is a complete let-down. I can only apologise to all the developers who worked so hard on this, only to be let down as much as I was by greed.

But they support you doing workarounds to having to pay and making it free. \n\nWant to import your own models? It costs $1 per model which isnt very much. HOWEVER, they also present you with the option to upload your models on the workshop for free, some people may be put off to sharing their models and creations though. The catch, and they dont make it very advertised, you can make your workshop item private. Which leads me to then wonder. Why charge $1 at all? The only reason is to take advantage of people not familiar with how the workshop works.  \n\nThey also restrict how long you can stream/broadcast using the software and make you pay to unlock this. HOWEVER they also support for free, bypassing this if you use OBS or something. Again, this only preys upon people less technically savvy or that dont know how to do this. WHY make something PAID but also support it as being free if you figure out the workaround that you claim to officially support? VERY QUESTIONABLE business practice. \n\nFree content available is minimal. And content you need to buy coins and then purchase is rather low quality as well. If you want to see hoow this does with 2D characters anime and such, its locked behind spending coins to get the extra people.  \n\nAnd then we have subscriptions. $10 or $20 depending if you own the previous software with annual fee. You will never own this software in any capacity and honestly I hate this type of sales model. Especially with something that just has bad UI and doesnt offer much content worth a subscription cost.

Just make sure you have a powerful computer, otherwise performance is going to be the bane of your existence.\n\nThey've since fixed many of their glaring issues, and have reached feature parity (if not, gone above and beyond) the original FaceRig app.\n\nFrom the original review, they have since:\n1. Added perpetual; one-time purchases to their yearly version updates/releases\n2. Removed some of the annoyances that made their software hard/impossible to use without paying\n3. Ironed the whole thing out, and made it better.\n4. Not applicable anymore. Also, one-time purchase is around the same price as if you had the license. Just that it was a terrible value proposition two years ago.\n5. With those blots removed, I'd say it's worth it to pay to not have to deal with 'jank', especially when you're a stupid idiotic end user (us devs are smart; I managed to get to their baseline as one person then gave up two years ago; didn't have the will/bother to become a competitor).\n6. You can now bypass the pay-per-avatar model by buying a one-time purchase pass, or obtaining one by staying on the subscription. Think of it as JetBrain/Atlassian's rent-to-own model (you get a perpetual license after staying one year continuously).\n\nAt the time of the original review; I should've just wait.\nAnd at the same time, they made the mistake of rushing and releasing software with terrible restrictions/monetisation BEFORE it was even ready for prime-time.

Menus are moved off screen\nThis might happen because Animaze remembers the absolute position you placed the panels. For example, if you open the app at default size 1280x720, and maximize it, it goes to 1920x1080. Then you open the avatars gallery, move it to the far right of the app screen. Reopen the app, it\u2019s now at 1280x720, if you click on avatars, it opens at the position saved for the 1920x1080 size of the window app, hence you don\u2019t see the gallery at all, and need to maximize it again. \nThe workaround is: go to Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Animaze\\Data\nand delete AppPreferences.json. Note, this will reset some app options to default.\nWe will add a better fix in the coming releases. Thanks for bringing this bug to our attention.\n\n3.

Yeah, you could use it for free, but all of the features like importing a model are locked behind this wall. You want the models in game too? You have to buy them with in-game currency and micro-transactions. It just feels like FaceRig with a brand new coat of paint to capitalize on not only the sales of FaceRig but the subscription based service.

But I'm a tech person, so maybe that's why.\n\nLet's see with my tech eye what others have said:\n> subscription plan + fun features hidden behind it\nYou don't have to buy it. You get most of the features for free.\n\nSubscription is pretty normal in those times - Adobe does it, Microsoft does it... - do you really expect to pay once and get updates for literally years? And get superduper new features for engine that was revolutionary at its time but cannot be easily extended? (Someone actually did say in their review that there are features devs \"promised\" \"for years\"...)\nSo base product is for free, and superduper features are for subscribers - that way you get your superduper stuff and devs and animators still get paid for it. Sounds fair.\nThe subscription is literally 4 dollars for a month. And less than 2 dollars a month if you pay for a whole year. You get one year for the price of Facerig+Live2D (Animaze has Live2D build-in). And half that if you had Facerig. Again sounds fair.\n\n> can't stream for more than 90 minutes without subscription\nFacerig was always like that - because you paid for it anyway. And professional streamers (earning more than x amount) were always meant to buy the extended license for use. But now you can also use it for free if you don't need additional features. Seems like a good deal.\n\n>can't install their own avatar without sub or one-time payment of $1\nWorkshop is still free, you pay only for avatars that are only yours. And it's logical - if you have your own private avatar, you're a pro user, so you pay for it.\n\nAlso, did anyone notice that most negative reviews have 0.1-0.2h on play time? That's 10 minutes, it seems like judging by the cover...\n\n-----\nMy own reviews:\n\nLet's start with the fact that I watched Facerig when it first was developed. I wasn't a follower, just sometimes someone posted about it and I would binge watch/read new info. Facerig was revolutionary at its time.\nIt wasn't until years later that I could buy it and play with it (money doesn't grow on trees and I wasn't planning on using it a lot, so I waited till I had some spare money).\nAnd now I have the new shiny product, still work in progress. Fun to compare.\n\nAnd as a dev myself, working mostly on backend, I understand that technology changes fast and old code can't always be adjusted. Writing new version from scratch is tiring and you don't do everything the same way (because what would be the purpose of rewriting it?). I can see that the team managed to do this well. \nOf course it's still Early Access, it released as EA literally today, but I see a great potential for it (newly written code with all the knowledge you got through years? easy to maintain and extend).\n\nComparison:\n\nGraphics:\nRevamped avatars. With revamped and fuller customisation. Colours and shadows are adjusted, allowing for more freedom - Facerig got me playing with a lot of bright colours because clothing shading was always \"on\" - now the default colours are more muted and their parameters play a role in shading (making full-saturated colours really neon popping, which wasn't doable in Facerig)\nProps - so far we only got some head props, but the level of detail is very nice. They sit very nicely - all default setting feel really natural, even though I'm putting hats and glasses on canines... Although I noticed some weird behaviour with scaling on some props - but it's normal in EA. The advanced options allow you to adjust the position basically in any way you want (you basically adjust image's position matrix itself - you couldn't have more detailed settings!).\nBackgrounds - also smaller number, some new, some similar to Facerig's. What I noticed is revamped lighting. In some Facerig backgrounds, the lighting was either too low (why was avatar in classroom so dark, comparing to the bg itself?) or too bright (why was photo studio bg literally glowing?). And unnatural when moving avatar around (shift+right mouse button for turning the background). Now it feels right, you don't have to adjust the light.\n\nFacial recognition:\nI have droopy eyelids. My eyes always look small. And that made it hard for Facerig to see them.  Facerig would literally flicker my eyes - not even blink because it was so fast. Animaze doesn't do that. Even with default capture, without neutral face calibration. Even if I squint my eyes. Even if I shade my eyes from light - as long as they stay visible, it works!\nIf face is partially obstructed or even sideways(!), it's still well recognised and followed.\nOH MY GODS. I found the tracking settings. You can change range of tracking and current reading on that scale is visible - so you can just make a face and adjust to that (eg jaw opening - even when my jaw is hurting, I can't make it go to the default upper bound). The number of options here is breathtaking. Eg separate settings for brow down and up, separate settings for smiling, frowning, side-to-side, only mouth corners... so this also mean the animations for those can be different for avatars, making the faces more natural. \nI noticed another difference when playing with mouth/jaw settings: lips vs teeth. It's not just mouth tracking. Select avatar with nice teeth (coronavirus Cory has seemingly healthy teeth and really flexible mouth to test all faces you can make) and open mouth with lips covering your teeth vs open them normally vs open them with showing as much teeth as you want, look how the upper lip of your avatar changes.\n\nPerformance:\nAnimaze, no matter what I do (without recording), takes around half a gig of RAM (up to 650MB). I lauched Facerig for comparison (and to add some details above) and it uses less RAM (~450MB with more when switching avatars) but more processing power (2x more CPU usage for me when doing basically nothing when writing this, Task Manager in view). This means, the new tech and optimisations are amazing. And that it shouldn't lag you.\n\n-----\nIn short:\nNatural lighting and animations, tracks your face well.\nGood UI (I hated Facerig's UI, it was so weird!)\nFree version will fit most usecases, especially in today's times of casual video calls to \"meet\" with friends despite pandemic.\nWorks well even for Early Access.", "timestamp_created": 1605733802, "timestamp_updated": 1605733870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454985707998275757", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79476279": {"recommendationid": "79476279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198994682508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 68, "last_played": 1605648639}, "language": "english", "review": "I found it a funny application for children or for those who have children.

As expected with FTP software, the functionality of the software is very limited. Users start with a handful of usable models and a small allowance to purchase more. Importing your own models costs 99 cents per import (unless you purchase a subscription) and currently doesn't have an option to use in-software currency to import. Without a subscription, the broadcast feature is measly 90 min, laughable by standards for both streaming and video call. Further, any broadcast in the free version includes a roaming watermark. It would be easy enough for someone to crop this out in obs, but for those using this for video calls, this is a big deterrent. \n\nAside from the abysmal business model, I have a few issues with the workflow and organization. My biggest gripe within this category is the fact that the software install an additional 3 audio drivers for use with their in-software voice modifiers, a feature that I never intended and never intend to make use of. For some people this may not be too big of a deal, but as someone who has both a VR headset and an audio interface (and as a result 6 different drivers), having my default driver overridden by a bloat driver (even after uninstall) drives me up the wall. As for the UI, some may find it clean and simple, I find it dumbed-down and stifling. The controls are divided into 3 separate sub-windows (one for output, one for input, and one for models and voice) and are freely movable throughout the preview window. They are not however, dockable nor do they collide with each other. I much prefer the menus of a program like PrPrLive or VUP as they provide more functionality in their UIs. Another thing to note: the default font size is [b]ENORMOUS[/b] and makes the space feel cluttered.\n\nI'll cede that this application has great facial tracking, however I cannot recommend this given what other software is freely available. I would much rather use a one-time payment software as opposed to a subscription for how sparingly I would end up using this. I never owned FaceRig and I'm glad. Do not get this software.

El otro problema es que el fondo verde es problematico con algunos personajes como el mismo gato y algunos props como los cascos ya que los ojos del gato son verdes y los cascos tienen unas bandas verdes que al aplicar el chroma key en los programas de video se elimina parte del verde de ojos y de los cascos generando transparencia en zonas que no interesan. \n\nCosas buenas: Me gusta que los personajes tengan animaciones propias activables mediante teclas como rascarse la cabeza y dem\u00e1s.

I am not moving.\n- Terrible lip and tongue recognition.\n- Still no hand/arm animation (So... what's the point of using Animaze then?).\n- Does NOT allow you to add or remove facial tracking points.\n- Microphone does not work with the recording (I have a $300 webcam), despite it being the default via Windows.\n- No ways for you to modify the input in Animaze itself for the recording.\n- Playback HAS to be modified to your actual speakers afterwards \n   since Animaze changes it to dummy Animaze speakers when Animaze is in use.\n- Microtransactions (Because of the above, seriously? If it was a better product, I wouldn't mind as much).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nI don't know who they were listening to honestly when they said they listened to the user base. This is NOT better than Facerig. It's the same thing in a better looking UI which works well and is intuitive if anything. Unless they improve the functionalities radically, stay away at all cost (not too hard to do at zero dollars). I was planning on creating a character with Animaze... that is until I started using it. \n\nInstead, I will use actual live props instead (featuring yours truly).

It's great to see how far this program has evolved and where it's at now but again, the subscription system is going to piss off a lot of people and in return might turn away people than make them use it more. Also the coins system in this is another obvious cash grab, something that most mobile games would do to \"boost your experience\" with a specific app.\n\nWhat really baffles me is that you can't even stream in the highest quality even for 30 minutes without you paying for a subscription. You must pay to stream your avatar full time and to broadcast it to wherever you're using it on, specifically SLOBS or OBS since some streamers, including myself will use that as a replacement for our facecams (No proper camera, not comfortable with showing face, etc.). Also should note you can't stream anything from this app in 60 fps unless you PAY to do it.
