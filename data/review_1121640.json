The game itself is quite flexible, from relaxing and peaceful but can also keep your mind working.  Sadly the only real problem one can have with the game is how limited it is in \"capacity\" currently.\n\n  Keep in mind it is still relatively new, and the Devs work hard on it ceaselessly, you can truly tell how much this game means to them.  Storyline feels more like an extended tutorial than anything else, so far because the Devs are currently more focused on Content at the moment.\n\n  At it's most difficult, the game can still be somewhat relaxing with a steady \"rolling on\" feel to it where the changing environments are constantly keeping you adapting your town back and forth based on what the current \"biome\" provides for survivability.\n\nAbove all else, the music is beautiful, relaxing, and very well done.\n\nDespite being severely lacking in plot or storyline, this does tend to make the game quite short-lived. (can be beaten in a handful of hours by an experienced gamer.  \nOverall i would highly recommend this game if you are looking for a fun, relaxing, engaging, and immersing game full of fun and quirky elements.

Frostpunk has RNG deciding who falls sick, and it's still a perfect game. The difference is that RNG needs to be applied in big numbers, making it predictable.\n\nFor Example, I don't have a problem with the RNG in the wandering Village that decides who get's poisoned, because I know that if I have 15 people in certain housing and at a certain workplace, 5 to 7 of them are gonna fall sick. The fact that the RNG is applied not just once, but 15 times, is what makes it predictable.\n\nThat's what's missing from the Onbu and Map RNG. If your onbu walks into a wrong biome early in the game, or if you have a hornblower but there just is no good biome to walk into, that RNG is applied only once, meaning I have no chance to predict it, and that in combination with the fact that being unlucky can destroy your entire run makes it very frustrating to play.\n\nHonestly, I don't know how I would go about fixing this, I have the privilege of being a player that can complain in the comments without having to find a solution.

The gimmick of building a city on the back of the six legged turtle is a fun idea, but it really has almost no actual gameplay impact - the world map seems interesting at first, but it surves no real purpose and doesn't really add much to the game due to everything being so random and so repetitive. If there was a larger view, maybe you'd have to think and consider going to a forrest for a few years or something like that, but the way it's now it's just 'pick the path that doesn't lead to a biome that will hurt your people' and that's it. Any interaction with the overworld also quickly turns into a mindless chore - send out endless exploring parties who with almost zero interaction return with resources you don't really care about and repeat, over and over.\n\nThat would be fine if it was an aspect of an otherwise good city builder, but that's just it - the base game is not a good city builder. It gets the mechanics right, but its like a soulless bureocrat was told about city builders and designed one - gather wood, gather stone, build homes, gather food, get more people, build farms, improve wood and stone, research better buildings. If someone held a gun to your head and forced you to come up with the most generic city builder, this is what would come out. None of it is done badly, it's just very bland and in no aspect have I seen anything inventive or interesting to set it apart from other games in the genre.\n\nAt $5 I would probably still have been left somewhat disappointed.

I played the demo of \u201cThe Wandering Village\u201d sometime ago and have been waiting to purchase it after some development.  I truly enjoyed this game but always have concerns about the content of any early access game.  Were my concerns founded?  Let\u2019s Discuss!\n\nOn the backs of Giants:  At a quick glance this is a typical city builder, albeit with a very unique art style.  You gather resources, build housing and prepare food and even research newer and more efficient ways of doing these things.  You do have to mitigate the toxin that will poison (and kill) your populous but more on that in a moment.  The art style adds to the unique nature of this game too, a cell shaded 2.5d style that gives the game a unique character and a timeless nature.  The music is also very enjoyable and even my podcast heavy ears stopped to listen to the different tracks throughout my journey.  So, what we have so far is a typical city buider with great music.  Well, that all changes when you meet your best friend, the Onbu.\n\nBestest Boy:  The game truly becomes unique when you meet your greatest companion and walking island, the Onbu.  A giant creature big enough to transport your entire civilization and supply materials for your beginnings but more importantly allows your civilization go where the resources are.  Creating a never ending traveling city, one that not only provides but must be provided for.  You need to establish trust (or servitude) for your Onbu, guiding it from biome to biome, feeding, resting and treating any toxins or illness that it gets.  Onbu doesn\u2019t always do what you want and sometimes makes decisions that not only hurt it but also your people.  You can \u2018force\u2019 it do what you want and even harm it for resources but I could not push myself to even try these devices, not for my loyal Onbu (maybe that\u2019s the dog person in me).\n\nLoyalty is Earned:  There are some issues with the game, resource management being one of them.  I would like to see filters and customized organization for each resource group.  I\u2019d also like to know the trending and production of each of my resources.  Finally, it would be really helpful if you could create limits (both bottom and top) for resources, too many times I ate my final fish that should have been used to grow more fish.  Speaking of, I understand biomes have to change things up to keep you on your toes but if what is planted is going to just decompose why can\u2019t I just tell them to stop growing kelp until the temperature goes down?  It is a bit to micro, which I don\u2019t mind micro but unnecessarily so.  I will also say that scavenging is more or less the same, at a certain point I should be able to somewhat automate the process.  Finally, I will say that collapsing structures is a bit annoying and might need to be toned down a bit.\n\nPlaying this game gave me actual joy, from watching the Unbu\u2019s head swaying, which I decided was it being happy, to the occasional tail wagging this game put a smile on my face.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand how anyone could harm this precious creature and I actually felt an attachment to my digital friend.

There are some approaches to gameplay I didn't care for, but the moments of triumph made it worth it and difficult to put down. At the core of this game's appeal for me is Onbu- a dynamic character whose back doubles as the canvas by which you'll be designing your village. Watching them go from untrusting and uncooperative to trusting, gleeful, and thriving is satisfying. Their behaviors, animations, and just the whole nature of the character is reminiscent of Trico from The Last Guardian- a grand beast to get to know and want to protect. Traveling through the world's map is an exercise in protecting Onbu and assessing hunger and sleep levels.\n\nI'm the type who likes building things. Designing towns and watching the inhabitants enjoy life and improve over time. Anno, Against The Storm, and the Two Point series are some of my favorites. I also like structured play with clear cut goals to work toward. The Wandering Village does have all of those things but there is a marked preference toward survival.\n\nWeather effects can call for drastic changes to the inner workings of your village. Food can become scarce in a flash. So can water. Knowing when to have Onbu run through dangerous areas or circumstances is key. There are so many little things to pay attention to and small errors to make that carry big consequences. Many players will love that but the cute exterior and beautifully rest-inducing, zen-like music can set up different expectations. I found myself saving often lest some painful developments over as little as a ten-day period render my village empty and desolate. The auto saves are numerous though.\n\nEventually, I got the hang of things and played smarter. When it clicks, it really clicks and is so rewarding to play. The population grows, resources are abundant, and even Onbu does a cheerful jig as things are going well. Failure is a teachable moment. But I think people who are chiefly interested in a survival sandbox will find this title more enthralling.\n\nMy hopes for the future would be as follows. Here are some things I would like to see.\n\n- A sprawling campaign- something like the tutorial but long form and involved with more frequent actions to take. This game is a sandbox and I think it could be that while also offering opportunities for people who enjoy finishing a bunch of objectives. More events. More random things to have happen on the world map.\n\n- Easy mode for lazy and forgetful, accident-prone players. (e.g. myself) the tutorial doesn't elaborate on every single button at some point throughout and probably should.\n\n- Little things to do during \"downtime.\" Perhaps the townspeople could have requests or preferences. There are too many moments where I was waiting for resources to finish being prepared or researched topics to reach 100%.\n\nOverall, a hearty thumbs up for how much fun the 7-8 hours I've played have been.

I bought it around when it came out and even in such early access was obsessed. Onbu is an adorable lil guy :) The graphics are great, I love that you can zoom in super close and watch your villagers work. I think I may remember it being harder before, but currently playing on easy mode has been a pretty chill experience. I haven't tried it with hostility modifiers or harder difficulties yet, because I prefer to just relax, but I sense it would add a lot more to the game if that's what you're looking for. I love that there's plenty more buildings and research than before, because that was the only way I felt it was lacking. It's similar for me to a lot of games like prison architect but way more chill. I actually like that all the villagers are the same and I don't have to spend a long time making sure I have every person assigned to the most efficient building, that takes a lot of the relaxing out of games for me. \n\nAll in all, fantastic game. Devs should be really proud of themselves. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a cute, relaxing, village building game. The only things I'd suggest is a way to assign or block specific villagers from specific buildings. My farm stand worker continues to run across the entire continent to grab some food instead of going to the kitchen next door lol. Also, the elder's guide could use way more information, it's not really helpful at all.

I've played civilization and other more strategy-based longer play games and do not have any issue. I think my biggest problem is the resources. Like any game and IRL, there are never enough resources. I (maybe?) made the mistake of clearing a lot of my trees early bc of a poisonous fog and I just fully couldn't find the poison spots bc of all the trees and now I'm on day 66 struggling to do anything bc I don't have any wood. I have a sawmill and nursery (researching the forester) but nearly every in game day onbu breaks my sawmill (and my air wells) so I'm using more wood to fix the thing to get me the already extremely limited resource. I'm doing the scavenger exploration to every wooded area I can find to try to help but its just never enough. \n\nWhile wood is my biggest issue in this play through, its not the only issue. Water is also apparently impossible to find.... IN THE OCEAN. How in the world is the air dry on water?? C'mon now. I'm sure this is built in for the mechanic of using the sea-water based functions (not super sure again only 66 days in). And again, when Onbu breaks my darn air wells every day that makes collecting the resource even harder bc it will be down for so long due to lack of resources. \n\nI'm sure things could be different in another run now that I know a bit more what not to do and to simply hoard every resource I have indefinitely but truthfully, I don't actually want to play another run if the tutorial is getting me this frustrated. Maybe it's just user error on my part. But honestly if they just tuned the breaking of buildings to be less frequent I probably would not be complaining but I buy a game to have fun and at this point it's just not enjoyable.\n\nEdit: Tutorial proceeded the same and 5 days after the guided \"tutorial\" ended Onbu died. Tried a second run Onbu died day 68 (?) and everything broke same as the initial run. I full uninstalled and requested a refund (it was denied bc time played). Decided to reinstall and give it another go, NOT A SINGLE THING BROKE IN 118 days and resources have been plentiful. I think the only things different I've done in this run versus the first two is not really mess with Onbu at all (no bile or blood things and minimal feeding/guidance). And since nothing is breaking really my resources have been able to stock up nicely. \n\nLeaving review as still not recommended for the simple fact of how the tutorial went.", "timestamp_created": 1691898751, "timestamp_updated": 1692035081, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493421077728271484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144032086": {"recommendationid": "144032086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037496501", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1691874154}, "language": "english", "review": "Delightful little city builder\nOnbu best boy\ndo not harm the onbu", "timestamp_created": 1691873553, "timestamp_updated": 1691873553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144030640": {"recommendationid": "144030640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203040562", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3388, "last_played": 1692943101}, "language": "english", "review": "Wholesome village building game; great introduction to the genre for newcomers.

There's definitely a few mechanics to learn and get good at.\n\nI do however think that it still needs some balancing to its economy, resources, number of villagers you encounter on your way and some villager AI tweaks.\n\nFor example, a game requires you to build a few essential buildings in order to prevent poison from spreading when you walk through the poisonous clouds & forests. You do however need to research a few buildings and then craft more resources to then build those other buildings. Depending on how lucky you end up at the start of your run, you might not even manage to build those essential buildings.\n\nI'd either like to see those poisonous areas appear much later during the start of the run or tweak the amount of resources required to build those buildings faster / sooner.\n\nThe number of villagers you meet during the run is a little bit low, I\u2019d say as farming alone requires a lot of (maybe even too many) people to keep everyone fed & store some food as well when you enter areas with different climates. Also, when you\u2019re in arid zones, the cactus produces too little water and too slowly. Both of my runs basically were ruined even though I had two full farms producing the cacti. Or perhaps the villagers just eat way too much.\n\nAs for the villagers overall, I do feel like they get a bit confused when they\u2019re assigned to take care of multiple things in a row. They start building a portion of the road, then go to finish the building, then harvest and many days later I have to ping them to finish the portion of the road they had started building.\n\nOverall, there\u2019s some very solid foundation for a city builder but it does need some tweaking in my opinion.

Let me tell you how this game sticks to the mold before I tell you how it's breaks it. \n\nCity Builders are all the same.  Build a farm for food, build a warehouse to store goods, etc.  There is nothing incredibly new in this game.  You have individual citizens which you see marching all over, but they don't have names or personalities, they don't go crazy.  This isn't RimWorld.  Wandering Village is a survival builder, with limited resources and dying villagers, but nothing as serious as Frostpunk or Banished. I normally don't like survival builders but this game I don't mind.  That's because of the \"Wandering\" part.  \n\nWhat the Wandering Village adds is a moving \"pet\" that your settlement rests upon. This has more personality then a game like Airborne Kingdom.  The pet mechanic allows you a map to see what biomes and weather are ahead of you, allows you to scout out in the world for resources, and gives you limited choices in what direction to go in.  Basically, you can plan ahead for some disasters, and there is more variety to the disasters then just \"winter\" and predictable cycle of seasons.  You also build a relationship with your pet, giving you some control over what he does, but you also live off the things growing on his back, and eventually you will need to become parasites, digging into his flesh for resources needed to weather the toughest biomes, so it becomes a balancing act.  \n\nAll this is contained in a rather chill game.

Your town must survive against poisonous spores, famine, and numerous environmental hazards in a post apocalyptic world slowly being devoured by nature. On easy settings, it is a fairly chill game, but on the more difficult settings, one mistake can easily spell ruin for both your townsfolk and the poor, brainless beast of burden you live upon.\n\nThere is no story, which is fine. All you do is try to survive day after day as you grow your village to make it more self-sustainable. With most similar games, there comes a point where the town is large and strong enough to weather any calamity, but in this game, you have to stay alert well into the endgame. This is what makes The Wandering Village so enjoyable: There's always something that must be done to keep your settlement from collapsing. And while there's no specific end goal beyond aimlessly traveling the world, the game is engaging enough that the journey itself is the point.\n\nAll in all, a solid, highly enjoyable experience.\n", "timestamp_created": 1690274236, "timestamp_updated": 1690274236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515957474708557129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142743394": {"recommendationid": "142743394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118750574", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1691777897}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game for 3 hours but still in tutorial.\nGame feels kinda relaxing in tutorial difficulty, I haven't started the challenging difficulties yet.\nIf you liked Frostpunk style of strategy, you won't regret playing this.\nReally consider that the graphic is mixed 2D and 3D, it might be unappealing for some people.", "timestamp_created": 1690262525, "timestamp_updated": 1690262525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142729207": {"recommendationid": "142729207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155772057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 725, "last_played": 1690402671}, "language": "english", "review": "fun and a challenge", "timestamp_created": 1690238234, "timestamp_updated": 1690238234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142726432": {"recommendationid": "142726432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121054598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1425, "last_played": 1690338551}, "language": "english", "review": "A village/city building game that is ACTUALLY different from the legions of sims out there.

As a city builder/management sim it's really shallow (everything basically boils down to \"what crop am I growing for the next 10 minutes\"). There's not really a major story-telling aspect aside from the initial \"world is toxic\" setting. The idea of a city building a symbiotic relationship with this titan (onbu) is a super neat idea, but...\n\nAt the same time it's also very shallow. Get a horn, feed it once or twice, and it will basically do most anything you tell it to. And there's no punishment (that i found) for doing the \"anti-onbu\" things aside from it basically ignoring your orders. Which ultimately doesn't really matter, because the city management is shallow enough that minimal planning is needed to prep for the next biome you're entering, and you would likely have had to make those preparations anyway. The only time I actually directed my onbu was when I wanted to figure out what was in a biome I hadn't been in yet. 98% of the time I just let it walk.\n\nIf you like simple and soothing city builder games, this game prolly isn't a bad pickup. If you were hoping this had a bit more strategy involved or the relationship with the titan was more impactful, at this point in time (7/24/23) I can't really say you'll have fun with this game.

The Wandering Village definitely wants to be a game in which the symbiosis between the creature and the people are key, so we totally agree with you there :)\n\nWe think we're on a good stable foundation now, as lots of people enjoy the current state of bonding with Onbu. But we're only just at the start and this is something we definitely have big plans on how to improve. While we have some villager updates upcoming next, Onbu will be the focus after that.\n\nIf you think that the game is too easy and you can breeze through it, I would like to highlight the \"Hostility Modifier System\". If you enable some of those, then you really have to be swift and clever and plan ahead to keep the villagers and Onbu alive. Especially on the higher levels, it's really tricky and people in the discord are exchanging strategies on how to beat it.\n\nMore in-depth stuff is definitely coming. If you get around to test the hostility modifiers, I would love to hear back if this added challenge works for you.\n\nThanks and cheers,\nMarkus"}, "142726005": {"recommendationid": "142726005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066532306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 910, "last_played": 1690233254}, "language": "english", "review": "If anyone uses the research that hurts Onbu you're a monster.

Unfortunately though I can't recommend it. Fair enough I got almost 8 hours out of it but with colony sims I really expect something more. And it wasn't necessarily a memorable 8 hours. \n\nI blew through more or less the whole tech tree and I never really broke a sweat. I played on the normal difficulty and I could switch to a harder difficulty, sure, but I feel like I already saw everything there is to see and it became very repetitive.\n\nGripes:\n-Scavenging is annoying micro management more than interesting decision making\n-No reason not to play on max speed\n-A lot of the buildings you just toggle on when you need them and toggle off immediately after if you want to play optimally. Or just leave them manned and idle because you can't be bothered anymore.\n-Biomes are rather short lived and repetitive\n-Biomes don't actually change the way you play. You just switch some crops around if you walk into a desert, and it's sad to see the core premise of a wandering village be solved by three or four mouse clicks once an hour.\n-Exclusively the ocean biome has unique tech for it that is only usable in the ocean biome. No other biome is like that. It's weird.\n-No events really caused any worry or concern \n-Most difficult part of the game was finding a spot to place my big end game decoration\n-Nothing shocking or surprising happened in the play through. You know... some dwarf fortress style \"FUN\"\n-No choices to make a run unique. I guess I can choose to be cruel to the animal or not but regardless I will still need to heal it, cure it and pet it and then harvest it's blood for food variety and it's bile for fighting the poison.\n\nAgain, I love the art and setting, there is so much potential.

Feeding spots, that you can reach to, that you will know about, not somewhere inside the fog-of-war. You can just place there more obstacles, more dangerous events.\nAlso, tornadoes are just irritating. Especially the fact that they are not disappearing.

Can you go into more detail what doesn't work in the tutorial for you? We improved the tutorial together with the community and got very positive feedback for it so far.\n\nThe game should be responsive and the tutorial should work. Can you tell me which system specs you have so we can see if there's need for improvement? If you're on a lower end system, in the options, please disable Antialiasing, lower screen resolution and texture resolution. This should let the game run on most computers. Also, if your inputs are not sensitive enough, we have options for this as well so you can increase sensitivity if for example the mouse scrolling is too slow/fast or keyboard movement is too slow.\n\nIn the tutorial:\nFor scrolling, use the mouse wheel or the shortcuts 4,5,6 to choose between the different zoom levels. With 1,2,3 and space you can modify timing/speed/pause. WASD or click and drag on the floor to move the camera. Click on the \"Elder's Notebook\" button in the top right corner to continue the tutorial if you missed it.

The poison was just too difficult to control.\nFast-forward to yesterday.  I tried again.  Despite claiming they've \"rebalanced\" things my Onbu ignored my wishes to run through it and fell asleep in poison.  I didn't mine its horns to anger it, its stats were all good, and I hadn't pissed it off in any way.  I had half the village trying to stay ahead of the trees and shrubs that turned into poison but the spread was too fast.  This was in the first 20 minutes of playing on the easiest difficulty.  A new player trying to learn the game would be pissed, I know I was several months ago.\n\nSome people have meta'd this and succeeded...which is great.  On the beginner difficulty I shouldn't have to meta anything.  Yes, you can toggle \"onbu/villagers can't die\".  That's god mode and I'm not interested in that.  I want sliders like, \"poison spreads 25-50-75% slower, villagers get hungry 25-50-75% slower, etc.   Dead in Vinland and Riftbreaker are fine examples of games with custom difficulty sliders.  I want the threat of failure but I want to fine-tune the difficulty to my liking.\n\nIt's a good game, but I've now been frustrated to the point where I hard quit, twice.  With many other games in my library, I'm content to find one of them to fill this village builder itch instead.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nGceSaC4FpI", "timestamp_created": 1689520393, "timestamp_updated": 1689520393, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52628248929977417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142182882": {"recommendationid": "142182882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165898178", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 126, "playtime_at_review": 5942, "last_played": 1700360982}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely calming.", "timestamp_created": 1689492125, "timestamp_updated": 1689492125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142160530": {"recommendationid": "142160530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970041202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1690230889}, "language": "english", "review": "very cute", "timestamp_created": 1689459487, "timestamp_updated": 1689459487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142100992": {"recommendationid": "142100992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122139623", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1689449759}, "language": "english", "review": "Just bought and played it; it was absolutely amazing and wonderful!

You can't really prioritize which buildings you want to have employed first, so you end up playing a game of musical chairs when trying to reassign workers from one building to another. Add on that your workers spend a lot of time dicking about, and it's a wonder anything gets done! I regularly feel like my villagers take the least efficient route to do anything. Your workers also just require a lot of micromanagement - you have to manually tell them to heal + feed Onbu, you have to remember to switch all your crops to different crops whenever you switch biomes, switch kitchen recipes, and so on and so on. \n- damaged/destroyed buildings from thunderstorms take forever to fix (unless you play the musical chairs game to move all your workers to worker huts and have them focus on building). \n- i wish there were more quality-of-life improvement upgrades for Onbu :( You can feed Onbu, pet Onbu, heal Onbu, etc. but I wish there were more things my villagers could do to improve Onbu's happiness so that when you build things like the bile extractor (which hurt and upset Onbu) you feel like you're making up for it somehow.\n- Maybe I just haven't played enough, but I think it would be neat if the game introduced other Onbu-villages that you could stop and trade with (seriously, I have so much wood please let me trade it for something else i am begging you)\n\nDespite the above, I do enjoy the game and I look forward to seeing how it develops and improves :)", "timestamp_created": 1688349120, "timestamp_updated": 1688349120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141139949": {"recommendationid": "141139949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274139898", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 176, "last_played": 1666053747}, "language": "english", "review": "its cute its boring ... only bought it cause they support Linux OS i like to try to support those who do .. don't get me wrong its really not a bad game i enjoyed the game.. but i'm a FPS person myself so my judgement my be skewed by that", "timestamp_created": 1688310343, "timestamp_updated": 1688310343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45267486572265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141102892": {"recommendationid": "141102892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302765917", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8436, "last_played": 1691210760}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!

want to like this game i just cant recommend it in its current state. its difficult to put into words but it feels like the balancing is just wrong. villagers move too slowly and aimlessly to deal with urgent tasks. for example, even on beginner difficulty it can take my village of 60 people days upon days to clear out spores from the second spore cloud in that save. the only way to get enough manpower to reconstruct buildings after a natural disaster is to shut down everything else including farming and cooking because if not villagers just wander around completely directionless and eat food instead of building.\n\nfor lack of a better description it also feels like villagers don't do as much work as they require. in other words, for every villager you take on, the amount of work needed to maintain equilibrium in your village goes up by slightly more than that villager can handle. the result of this is that the more villagers i acquire, the fewer villagers i have free for construction and the longer it takes me to get things built, maintained, and repaired, when it should be the opposite.\n\ni have a few suggestions that i think would make the game much more friendly for new players, quality of life stuff that wouldn't affect balancing in any way as i am certainly not qualified to talk about something that nuanced. \nfirst: add an option to control individual villagers. too many times i've seen a villager finish chopping down a tree, decide her work is done, and book it a mile back to base camp to have her lunch, leaving someone else to pick up the wood that SHE CUT and carry it literally 10 feet to the construction site, only for them in turn to leave and make someone else actually construct the thing. if i could tell a villager to pick up their own wood and construct their own tent it would make repair jobs much easier, faster, and less stressful than waiting for the goons at the worker outpost to get up and do their job.\nsecond: allow automatic harvesting. when the woodcutters run out of material they should go out and harvest their own, and when i have workers set to harvester they should know the woodcutter is out of material and go and harvest it automatically without me having to manually assign what they're cutting. i know this is not a unanimous opinion but i think it would make the gameplay loop much more enjoyable, especially since even when the woodcutter is out of wood and the workers are set to harvester AND i have trees highlighted the workers sometimes won't harvest for no apparent reason. \n\nlastly, though this is not under the changes section because i don't know how you would change it, i think the onbu is simply too large. workers need to shuttle back and forth from the head to the center to the tail constantly and i personally think it's silly to require two or even three individual villages on the back of one onbu just to staff the required infrastructure. i shouldn't need to assign half my population to dung duty and place a second woodcutter, stonecutter, berry farm, kitchen, farm, and pantry there just to supply the dung collector and compost heap.\n\ni think this game is excellent. the first forty days of the novice save file are genuinely enjoyable, i love the music, and the concept is all there, the balance just needs work to make it really shine.",

Every question does not need to be answered, but I would love love love to have more points of intrigue.

The interactions with Onbu in particular were very much a highlight! I enjoyed earning its trust and being able to feed and cure it of illness, or lead it through areas as harmless to us as possible. The addition of options for the scavengers was a very nice touch. I also appreciate the addition of technologies that will hurt Onbu, as my refusal to use it (probably not a luxury I could afford on a higher level difficulty) gave me a sense of control and leadership over the moral direction of the village.

I didn't have the heart to cause Onbu any pain, and spent the vast majority of my game time trying to keep Onbu healthy and comfortable. Seeing the message that Onbu's tail is wagging melted my cold, dead heart. Sprinting through toxic environments, making sure Onbu is fed so that there is no attempts at eating suspiciously mushroom shaped rocks, and sleeping in the soft fluffy bits. All for Onbu. You can't give me a six legged rocklizardpuppy and expect me to hurt it, I will love it until I die.\n\nThe concept of this game is incredible, and I love the potential of it. The ability to move to new environments is something that many games have attempted, usually through resettlement, and have generally failed or caused gripes in playerbases due to having to rebuild from the ground up again. The visuals and soundtrack help establish the setting and biomes, and the mixture of 3D and 2D sprites is lovely. While the paths that you can choose are linear, it makes sense in the context of Onbu being its own autonomous entity.\n\nThe game also progresses in ways that are logical. There isn't a lot of nonsensical additions, and essentially everything is focused on survival. Perhaps some entertainment buildings in the future to help boost productivity, even though it isn't too difficult to keep maxed at the moment. The decorations was a nice addition, especially as it is rare in games for them to also carry a practical purpose beyond simply adding aesthetics.\n\nMy issue with the content has mostly been remedied! The Ocean update added a lot of new things to do and research, which improved replayability significantly. Additionally the changes in game starting choices is adding challenge where there previously was little. While the gameplay is still repetitive, there is enough intrigue to keep going and try new things. However, game still struggles with the sensation of idleness for me, but that might simply be due to my preference to micromanage to a borderline unhealthy degree.\n\nAnd I feel like that is still my main problem. Once you learn how the game works, and what each new technology adds, the only thing left for you to do is cycle production whenever the biome changes, and click on the map every few minutes.\n\nBut I was correct in my last review! I have changed my mind about whether or not it is worth the price tag. The developers are extremely passionate about the game, and it was part their love for it that made me buy it in the first place. There is constantly new content, and they are active within their own community. I have faith in the developers, and am certain that they will continue to add content. I have essentially doubled my hours since the first review at the time of writing this, which should already be a good sign of improvement! I will keep checking new updates, and look forward to full release.\n\nKeep it up, devs!

The worst I can say about its performance is that I could tell when it was auto-saving due to a brief stutter... on 4x speed. It even ran as well on the Steam Deck, despite a handheld not being the best choice for a city builder. \n\nThat's not to say the controller support was lacking. It all worked great and was as intuitive as a genre that was so clearly set up for point-click-hover mouse control could possibly be. \n\nThere was also a complete game's worth of content, with enough variation in the technology trees and environment challenges to keep things all-engrossing until the game said it was over. That isn't to say you weren't perfectly allowed to keep playing the mobile mesa you'd built for five times as long, just that there wasn't enough new to discover or react to for all of that extra time to remain rewarding. \n\nEverything else about the Wandering Village experience is exactly as advertised, though I never did feel the need to zoom down to my villagers' eye line. The casual, nature-focused art style was supported by a New Age-y, lost-to-time soundtrack that I would have called repetitive if it didn't fit the mood so well. Together, they can almost convince you that the world's not so harsh after all.

I love the style and the animations and the gameplay is entertaining. However, after 11 hours, I reached a balanced economy and even though I still had some buildings and other materials yet to develop, I didn't see the need to dive into them.\n\nTL:DR: I love it but needs some improvements to keep my attention for longer.\n\nThings I liked:\n- Art, style and animation. So beautiful (just like Ghibli!) and colorful! I would also kill anyone who dares to hurt my Onbu. He's so cute!\n- Symbiosis: I love the idea that you can pick if you want to be a parasite to Onbu. Very original and I actually felt BAD losing Onbu's trust.\n- The unique gameplay is quite entertaining and has a reasonable learning curve. Changing biomes caught me off guard a couple of times but I got the hang of it and made sure to keep an eye on my crops and processed foods.\n- It gets you hooked right off the bat. If you like management games, this will keep you busy for hours on end. Can't really put my finger on it, you just want you village to grow and prosper!\n\nThings I didn't like:\n- No replay-ability: Once things stabilized and I didn't need to micromanage as much, things got a bit boring. I knew how to handle change of biomes, poison and events so it became repetitive and I didn't need several late game buildings or materials for my village to be sustainable. I started a new village to be more organized from the beginning but felt more tedious than fun and didn't continue.\n- Storage is weird. I had NO clue where all my sand was until I followed a worker to the Scavenger Huts. I assigned so many carriers to move all materials to storage units but I never got them emptied. Also, Food stands didn't work for me. The worker brings 3 or 4 processed foods at a time, they run out immediately so everyone keeps going to the kitchens or pantries anyway.\n- Goals or objectives: Someone mentioned how 'survival as the main goal' wasn't enough to make it fun. I might agree. I'm not a fan of sandbox games. Stardew Valley could be considered sandbox but it has LOTS of tiny objectives and goals that kept me coming back to the game even after I finished the main goal. Might work for Wandering Village!\n\nOverall, its a great game with opportunities to improve.

At the moment, my review is negative, but I intend to change it when more improvements are made.\n\n1. As other reviewers have said, the lack of an overarching goal beyond \"don't die\" isn't doing it for me.\n2. Villages die *WAY TOO EASILY*. No food for a few in-game hours? Boom, your population is cut in half. These people have the energy reserves of mayflies. In fact, as far as I can tell (not scientific), being poisoned takes longer to kill them than not eating.\n3. I don't like that I can't zoom out to see more of the village without going into the \"See the Onbu\" view. This tripped me up dozens of times when I was trying to apply priorities to harvesting over a wide area.\n4. I *hated* having to micro manage harvesting rocks and trees. This is something that should be happening automatically.  Either make harvesters at the workpost auto-harvest, or make builders that need stone go get stone, or make stonecutters who are out of stone go get stone. The villagers aren't stupid, they aren't going to sit on their thumbs and say \"Gee, i really need stone, but that rock that i'm looking at hasn't been marked as harvest-able by the village leader, so i guess instead of building the granary that we need to not starve to death, i'll just chill\".\n5. I very much did not enjoy having to manually set priorities after setting something to be harvested. Make it a single click-and-drag.\n6. Double clicking on something (e.g. poison plants, rocks, trees, so on) should auto select all of the things of that type that are visible on the screen.\n7. There is no UI indicator on how much the Onbu trusts the village, major information gap, and the player may not even realize the Onbu isn't following commands like which direction to walk in. Took me 4 times before i even realized.\n8. My Onbu decided to sleep in the middle of a toxic storm within 5 minutes of starting the game.  Really? That's not OK. The Onbu shouldn't be suicidal. It's one thing for it to refuse to run through something dangerous, it's an entirely different thing to have it literally lay down and take a nap while it's being actively harmed. At worse it should slow down to a crawl, but never sleep.\n9. I randomly had my Onbu go from 100 health to 20 health without any kind of UI indication, or explaination. I could not figure out if it was caused by environment damage, or something that I was doing, or what. The game needs to make the health of the Onbu significantly more in-your-face. Any damage at all should cause a noise and UI ping, and lots of damage in a short period of time should force the player to pay attention.\n10. My Onbu walked through a thunderstorm, and half of my buildings were destroyed. Unacceptable. Something that took me 20+ minutes of real-world time to put together demolished in under 20 seconds with no warning. I literally shut the game down when this happened because I was forced to go find every building that was destroyed and click \"rebuild\". Buildings need to be able to survive no less than 3 damaging events before being demolished. Add a repair and/or maintainence mechanic to give the player flexibility on \"fix\" verses \"rebuild\". But just demolishing half my buildings, and then requiring several minutes of busy clicking to ask for them to be rebuilt is rage-quit level of bad design.\n11. I unlocked huts, an upgrade to tents. I clicked two tents to be demolished to make room for a hut. It took 10 minutes for my villagers to actually demolish the tents, they were apparently off doing who knows what. Demolishing buildings is very short time cost, so it should implicitly be prioritized above other tasks.\n12. Allow the player to place buildings over other buildings, with a confirmation box asking if they're sure. I should not have to *first* destroy the existing buildings, wait for the villagers to get around to it, then remember to check back to see if i can place the new building.\n13. I absolutely do not like the \"Change out your crops when the Onbu moves to a new biome\" mechanic. If you're going to keep this mechanic, then allow me to set a schedule that tells the villagers what crop to plant in which biome. The player should *NOT* be needing to micromanage this.\n14. Kitchen produces 3 polenta for 3 corn. Am I not understanding something about the food mechanic? as far as I can tell, this provides the exact same amount of \"food\" per crop, but by adding 1-3 villager's worth of labor to it. Change it to be like the other crops early, 3->5.\n15. I don't like that the Herbalist is it's own stand-alone building, when it's literally just a farm with a different name. The healing herbs should be just a different crop to pick from in the list.\n16. Same with the mushrooms. The mycologist should be merged into the farm building. \n17. Add dirt crops. One to start the game with, and then another set of researched crops that can be unlocked.\n18. I hate the cactus farming mechanic. It's a very labor intensive solution that can be easily worked around by building a crapton of air-wells to tide the village over.\n19. Why can't I tap into the Onbu to get water? We can get blood to make blackpudding, but not water?\n20.

In some ways the colony you build on top of your Onbu is a little more socialist, a little more sustainable than that, but more because of arbitrary conditions set by the game than because of any fundamental change in approach to the means of production. You can harvest berries forever, not because you exercise any restraint in how you harvest them, but because they are programmed to be infinite. Saplings will always continue to grow, but not because you altered your consumption levels of wood or lumber, rather because you simply exploited more mother trees to produce more saplings. It almost looks like an ecological approach, but you're really only ordering the production of more trees for their exploitation. They serve no other purpose, and they are as limitless as the berries. (And why are we planting crops that are horrible for soil retention like corn and wheat and in general adopting unsustainable agricultural practices?)[list][/list][list][/list]You are put into a symbiotic relationship with your Onbu, in the sense that you need to feed it and heal it and it provides you with safe land for your colony in exchange, but this has very little bearing on the overall philosophy or design of your colony. Like an Olympian god, it will smite you if you displease it, but your day to day mining of the land on its back otherwise is a distinct and distant exercise that doesn't involve it in the slightest. It won't even fill your granary on a whim if you hold a festival in its honor. There are two different types of games being played. One is the standard maximal exhausting of all useable resources for the benefits of production. The other is a tamagotchi minigame where you feed your Onbu and keep it happy so it doesn't shake its back. They are barely and only superficially connected, and the only restraint you have to exercise is in not ripping out too many of its rock spikes or sucking too much of its blood without petting it enough to balance out the exploitation.[list][/list][list][/list]Why does your colony have the option of turning the Onbu's blood into a resource? For more ways to interact with the animal and see the trust mechanic in play? It's insane to me that these people (the colonists) would think of harvesting the animal itself, and I find jarring to even have it there as an option.[list][/list][list][/list]The Onbu is introduced as an ancient, legendary creature who has presumably awoken from centuries of slumber due to the enroachment of poison across all the lands. This brings a distinctly white colonial flavor into your interactions with the animal. Without you, the Onbu would not survive in its own habitat. It needs you to find it food and keep it not dead. It can't even survive the heat of the desert, where it has been hibernating for eons, without you to bandage it up. It makes no sense that this wise creature wouldn't be the one showing you how to not get wrecked by the dangers out there, or teaching you a unique form of bending, or watching on as you wither and die pathetically because you didn't have a clue. Your colony (and it is a colony) doesn't die on the back of its own mistakes, it dies when the Onbu it claimed ownership over dies. I get that the animal is not entirely within in its element due to poison and the apparent disruption of ecosystems, but dear lord this thing is helpless without the settlers on its back telling it how to do the things.[list][/list][list][/list]I think there are some deep philosophical flaws in the current approach.

New research tree additions were definitely needed. Game still lacking in some aspects like any solid end game goal, or variety of playstyle options, or something to make it a little more different from all other city building/survival games. Onbu is great and has interesting mechanics in that sense but it needs to be improved and extended more. It is all somewhat still basic. Worker management and a sense of village still needs to improved as well. Right now game is still lacking on content and features a bit but I feel like it has lots of potential to improve and developers seems passionate about it.

Though there's two things I would ask of the Dev's to improve the game experience for me. But other than those two things, I can definitely see this game taking a LOT of my time and being very enjoyable for me. Highly recommend!\n\nDevs. I suggest the following. Of course, it's ultimately up to you, but I know that at least my experience would be enhanced with the following changes.\n\n1. Add an Onbu Trust Meter.\nBeing able to see how much trust I'm gaining or losing from certain actions would definitely help in the planning and the cost-benefit analysis of said actions. For an example, does giving a command reduce his trust? If so, I'll only give commands when it's necessary and let him do his own thing otherwise. Does feeding him before he's at 20% hunger give me less trust than if I waited until he was more than 20% hungry? How much trust is lost by extracting Bile or removing a spike? That sort of thing is what would be nice to know or at least see with a trust meter.\n\n2. Now this one I'm not sure if it was a bug or what, but I suggest having all hazards damage Onbu in some way, and that if Onbu is within a hazard area that he will refuse to sleep until outside the hazard area.\nI'm suggesting this one primarily because in my first play through, Onbu chose to fall asleep inside a medium storm hazard area after refusing to fall asleep before the hazard area when I tried to get him to. Plus, he refused to wake up or move until his tiredness was below 50% meaning that the storm passed over Onbu and the village 3x. This destroyed nearly everything I had built and there was nothing I could do about it since I was trying to do a nice playthrough where I never hurt Onbu or intentionally lose his trust. Mind, this was on the tutorial difficulty too. So I'm not sure if that was an intentional mechanic where Onbu takes revenge for causing his trust to go below a certain point, or if it was a bug of some kind, but it definitely detracted from my experience and caused me to stop having fun since it essentially forced me to rebuild everything.\n\nNow other than those two things, I think you've got an amazing creation on your hands devs, and I can't wait to see how it keeps improving from here!", "timestamp_created": 1675575529, "timestamp_updated": 1675575529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132229909": {"recommendationid": "132229909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015030502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1665090690}, "language": "english", "review": "I have to recommend that you don't buy this game unless you consider it an advance in faith on a game that could turn out to be lovely in time.

I always play on the hardest difficulty, and I can confirm on the hardest difficulty it does pose a challenge, my poor Onbu did die once. Of starvation, since I walked through too much desert. It was quite sad. \n\nI also had the misfortune of running into way too much poison too early on in one playthrough, so had to abandon when land turned into a poison plant nightmare. \n\nOnce I got the hang of things it really improved, especially with some of the end-game technology which makes the game much, much, much easier to survive. One hint I will provide is that decontaminators are extremely useful, so villagers don't have to harvest toxic plants themselves and get poisoned. Bile collection is super helpful (and doesn't require a villager, a major, major plus), though it does hurt Onbu a little, thankfully you can turn it off so only need to collect bile on as needed basis. Blood collection also similar benefit, for an endless source of food though it hurts Onbu so have to make sure there is enough herb production to heal. Having two scavenger huts once town has a bit more population was extremely helpful, there is always something for them to do and they are wildly productive when it comes to resources like wood, stone etc. Also the best way to get new villagers, most I've gotten so far is 5 from settlements, which is a game-changing boost, especially early on. Also love that there are side events / stories from scavenging, really liven up the game :) \n\nHerbs are a must, to heal your villagers and Onbu, too much poison creates a cascade & at a certain point it becomes insane to try to overcome it. Kitchens are very, very important for food efficiency. Once Onbu trusts you it becomes much easier to survive, can order it do all sorts of things like lie down so you don't have to walk through a poison cloud, tornado, sandstorm or thunderstorm, run to get through poison jungles and other nasty path conditions...also sleep in ideal places and more. Dung collection is so helpful for compost, or alternatively biogas (saves having to injure Onbu for bile). \n\nI appreciate how every advancement in tech improves survivability - E.G. the different crops are adapted to different biomes, and it is critical to pay attention to the poison levels, humidity, temperature etc. Nothing felt arbitrary. I especially appreciated the progression from tents to huts and cottages, huts are game changing. \n\nI very much look forward to seeing what the world map looks like with a scout tower once I finally get there, and also to future content, this game has a lot of room to grow, for an early access game I would call this a fantastic start!

The idea is quite nice, and so is the artwork. Will definitely keep this game and wait to see what will be added in the long run, as others have said that there isn't quite as much content there. \n\nThe start is quite easy and a tutorial guides you through it with quick tasks/quests. Soon, you will have your little town running and you get to pick what to research next. \n\nHowever, one thing that bothers me so far is the balancing (others have pointed this out as well): Once your Onbu walks through poisonous mushrooms, things will become stressful. Your villagers get poisoned, and that poison will keep spreading. If you haven't researched the incinerator yet (which will have your villagers burn poisoned plants), you may have a hard time. \n\nIt was quite funny: I played the tutorial on my first playthrough, my Onbu walked through poison, I had poisoned plants and villagers and then all my buildings started to collapse. Since you have to tell your guys to actually cut trees and gather rocks so you have resources to rebuild things, I suddenly felt like I was an overwhelmed juggler of chainsaws. \n\nAnd soon, since the huts and kitchen had collapsed and there was poison around, my village died due to starvation and poison. It wasn't fun to see all my tents collapse at about the same time... maybe an asynchronous decay would be better or more \"realistic\", where the timer is more random, so that not all tents you built at the same time collapse at the same time? \n\nOn my second playthrough, I didn't use the research suggestions, but went for the doctor and incinerator early on. Also, this time, the map was different so it took some time until I had to deal with poison. This time, it worked and I was at the point where I also was able to feed my Onbu and stuff. However... next stop for the Onbu was... a desert. Where I couldnt collect water. Which meant, my farms couldn't produce food. Which meant my citizens were starving. The Onbu then went to a crossroad. Right: Forest and water. Straight ahead: Yet another desert. Guess which way he went? At least he was asleep when my final citizen passed away. \n\nLesson learned: Build more water collectors. Maybe research Onbu controls earlier on. So... start over and I am looking forward to playthrough #3.\n\nThe first & second playthrough ended quickly (this was on the easiest difficulty), but I am motivated to start over and apply what I have learned. The beautiful design of the whole thing keeps me coming back, and I do hope that eventually, the devs will change the balancing slightly. \n\nTHis looks like a really fun game, the basic idea is really cool, and I hope they'll keep adding things and rebalancing it... the game does deserve some attention, it would be well deserved and I wish the studio all the very best! Will keep this installed and keep checking back to see the upcoming changes.", "timestamp_created": 1675077253, "timestamp_updated": 1675099111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527897000312805176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131848717": {"recommendationid": "131848717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799037725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1689480042}, "language": "english", "review": "a;slfikoj\nfass", "timestamp_created": 1675051298, "timestamp_updated": 1675051298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925341129302979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131834469": {"recommendationid": "131834469", "author": {"steamid": "76561199446396759", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1690262871}, "language": "english", "review": "its a fun relaxing game", "timestamp_created": 1675030336, "timestamp_updated": 1675030336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131821172": {"recommendationid": "131821172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030821243", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2806, "last_played": 1680761427}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1675016524, "timestamp_updated": 1675016524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131818891": {"recommendationid": "131818891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089640823", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 5128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1943, "last_played": 1696476541}, "language": "english", "review": ":)", "timestamp_created": 1675014234, "timestamp_updated": 1675014234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131813949": {"recommendationid": "131813949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369511890", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 538, "last_played": 1696300635}, "language": "spanish", "review": "buen juego. normalmente no me entretienen este tipos de juegos pero este me encanta. lo recomiendo por su precio \nsolo una cosa. el b01ud0 de ombu aveces no te hace caso porque le pinta aunque incluso ya sean amigos.\n\nes como ese amigos con derechos. no confien en eso pibes/as. despues de eso\ngracias ombu por dejarme vivir en tu espalda", "timestamp_created": 1675009726, "timestamp_updated": 1675009726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131779991": {"recommendationid": "131779991", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984873731", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1357, "last_played": 1674971962}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me about 30 hours to 'win' at the moment.

It is an unique city/base builder that is done in a cute art style.  \n\nThe major uniqueness to the game play is that instead of seasons coming and going, your creature (Onbu) walks through different regions that have different biomes, thus subjecting your villagers to different weather.   Along the way a blight will occasionally infect your trees, bushes, villagers and so on.   This blight if it hits you early on can spread quicker that you can contain it if you aren't prepared, as I clearly was not during my first game.  I still may be able to pull through but it isn't looking good.\n\nAnother unique part is that you can somewhat control the Onbu by having it potentially changing it's direction on the world map.  You can zoom out and see various paths, sometimes ahead you might see the possibility for new villagers or possible dangers.   Even though you can try to influence the Onbu, from what I gather it is not a given, just a possibility. \n\nAll in all the game performed great on an aging i5-7400 @3Ghz run 16GB Ram, 1060GTX and Samsung SSD.  I experience no crashes or bugs during my playtime.  That's always a plus even more so with a EA game that released not too long ago.  For the price I do recommend it for fans of the City Building genre.  \n\nIt is Steam Deck verified, I haven't tried it yet on the SD, but I will do so and report back on how it runs on said platform.

All opinions herein are my own. [/I]\n\nThe Wandering Village is a city building game that is set rather uniquely on the back of a giant, nomadic beasts. Its name is Onbu, by the way. Most of the challenge comes from managing resources when changes in biome force you to change up what is planted and how much water is available, but there are also poisonous clouds that, well, poison your nomads as well as cause poisonous plants to grow on Onbu's back and they'll take over if you don't deal with them quickly enough. This is an early access title, meaning it is subject to change as more updates roll out. \n\nTypical to the genre, you have access to a small pool of buildings to begin with and then you're able to research more. This includes things like kitchens to cook the crops you grow, stations that refine stone and lumber, structures that allow you to interact with Onbu, and so on and so forth.\n\nBecause Onbu is a living, breathing organism, your village is subject to different seasons and conditions based on where he roams. At first, you have limited control over this and are left at the hands of the RNG, but as you unlock more technology and gain Onbu\u2019s trust, you can\n\nDifferent biomes have different dangers and also weather that affects what can be grown. The rainforest biome, for example, is humid so you can collect water via passive structures, but it also has the highest amount of poison, which places both your villagers and Onbu in danger. The desert has no water, which means you'll need to actively grow cactuses in order to sustain other crops. It also has very little poison, but there are environmental hazards to traverse so there's definitely a trade-off there.\n\n[H1]Steam Deck compatibility[/h1]\n\nIt's marked as playable, but this game works extremely well on Steam Deck. Right joystick acts as mouse with the R2 trigger as a click and the D-pad can be used to pause, slow, and speed up gameplay, and the left trackpad brings up a radial menu for regularly used shortcuts like the building menu. This is all without any need to fiddle with any settings! \n\nA controller configuration was actually added in a patch while I was getting this review together and it works flawlessly. If you still want to play in mouse and keyboard mode, the above still applies.\n\nThe text is completely readable.\n\n[H1]Things I really liked[/h1]\n\n[List]\n[*]Onbu. I didn't expect to, but I grew very attached to the critter during my playthrough. I made the mistake of harvesting from these weird-looking spires of stone to support the growth of my budding village and the moment the message popped up that Onbu didn't like me doing that, I stopped. Never harvested another. Now my expedition team has to work twice as hard to gather stone, but I am fine with this.\n\n[*]The difficulty isn't particularly high at the lowest difficulty (Novice), but then I'm not playing to struggle. I just wanted a chill experience in which I could build a city on the back of a giant and I got just that. I'm sure at higher difficulties the game can be pretty intense.\n\n[*]The give and take of keeping Onbu happy and healthy versus benefiting from its suffering makes you strategize. Seriously, you can harvest blood and bile from Onbu (!) for the greater good of protecting your village from poison and whatnot. But at what cost?!\n\n[*]The aesthetic. The whole game is so pretty: from the lush fields Onbu likes to nap in to the villagers rushing about in their day-to-day when you zoom all the way in, The Wandering Village is just nice to look at. Seriously, check it out:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2921550709\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2921550835\n\nThe music was also a soothing accompaniment.\n[/List]\n\n\n[H1]Things I did not like [/h1]\n\n[List]\n[*]The inability to relocate structures. Now, I don't mean homes and more complicated buildings; it would be nice if I could move that badly placed storage bin that I didn't think out properly in the early stages of my playthrough rather than have to find the manpower to destroy and then rebuild it.\n\n[*]Poison plants and their spread. Gross. It was difficult to contain even when setting them to highest priority because my nomads wouldn't get to the furthest reaches of Onbu in time. I'm not saying remove them or anything, as I understand that's a big part of the challenge, I'm just saying I didn't like them.\n[/List]\n\n[H1]Some things I'd like to see in future updates:[/h1]\n\n[List]\n[*]More interactions with Onbu. What if your nomads celebrated Onbu on occasion with festivals, etc for being the biggest, good boi? Decorated his back and threw a big old party that granted some sort of buff to your village's productivity.\n\n[*]More variety in types of food you can grow and more types of cuisine you can make. There's only a handful of dishes you can make in the kitchen currently (four, not counting bread).\n\n[*]More biomes. The roadmap lists two already: Ruins and Water. Great. I look forward to seeing those fleshed out!\n\n[*]More ways to get food. Fishing, hunting, raising livestock. I'm not sure how difficult it would be to implement these things, but even if fishing/hunting were just random events that Onbu came across in its travels, that would be awesome. Or maybe you could come across fishing holes in the new water biome. \n\n[*]More random events. I saw the same handful of events\u2014recruit nomads, power on ancient saws, trade with slavers\u2014again and again. Some more variety would be nice. Suggestions: festivals/celebrations, crossing paths with other Onbu/giant creatures, learning tech from/trading with other nomad groups\n\n[*]A more personal relationship with your nomads. Maybe the ability to name them? Have them get into relationships and petty squabbles. Nothing that would require another layer of management or anything complicated, just something to give them greater dimension.\n\n[*]Better ways to protect against poison. Can we have some manufacturing buildings\u2014a tailor, for instance\u2014that allows you to build face masks or something for your nomads? Poison was one of the biggest challenges I faced during my playthrough and it was more of a annoyance than anything. If my luck was bad enough, Onbu would plow through several poison clouds in a row and I'd spend days trying to get everyone back to good health.\n\n[*]Different game modes. Basically just sandbox. I'd like to build without the threat of poison spores and lightening storms toppling my buildings, please.\n[/List]\n\nAll in all, another great entry by this development team. I'm excited for future updates and will add to this review with any pressing information.\n\nThanks for reading~", "timestamp_created": 1674333450, "timestamp_updated": 1674751353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48398202657699585", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131268464": {"recommendationid": "131268464", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087679974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1693846585}, "language": "english", "review": "it was a glitch i encountered during the game that set my difficulty to high i hope it gets fixed but much better now", "timestamp_created": 1674306573, "timestamp_updated": 1674482569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462783187627792358", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131252747": {"recommendationid": "131252747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127219999", "num_games_owned": 910, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 2940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1777, "last_played": 1695949956}, "language": "english", "review": "Super sweet combination of tone, ideas, and mechanics. \nLooking forward to seeing where this goes.", "timestamp_created": 1674282863, "timestamp_updated": 1674282863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131242001": {"recommendationid": "131242001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982084495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1674334500}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy games that the protagonist is nature.

Bottom Line is that I am equally as frustrated as I am happy with the game. \n\nUpsides:\nGraphics: a style of its own that is well done and pleasing in all views. \n\nMusic: relaxing and calm with most biomes I've noticed have a different track. \n\nGamePlay: Its adorable to build a village on the back of a dino. Who would not love that? You employ villagers to specific tasks which can be anything from farming to feeding Ombu to decontaminating your village of infestations. Most of the game is self explanatory and it's all trial and error depending on what the back of Ombu gives you as resources as well as how many spikes Ombu has on his back. Look for where the Berries spawn so you can start close to food. I've done multiple runs and find that planning my village in my head to make the resources I need the closest works best.  \n\nMenu system: this is where the game is easy to play for me.  Ombu has his own set of tools and menu. The basic building and prioritising has its own menu, which they have added to just today. Then you have an overall view on the top for the actual villager stats, Biom stats, and Ombus health bars.  Again, just nicely laid out.  \n\nReplayability : High since each loadout is different, maps are random, including some needed items like sand and Knowledge. Game currently has 3 endings. This is nice because it requires an entire new run with a different focus.  \n\nDownside:  \nWeather/Biomes.  Weather events are ALWAYS a negative. I have been hit by the same storm 3 times. There is no weather that helps or is a boost. Your map view makes it very hard to make a directional choice when you only see a tiny bit of biomes to start with. You can expand this further into the game, but it's something that is endgame and I have yet to need to complete it. \n\nWorker Post: Game needs clearer info on what each job does in the worker post. This took me a few runs to nail down and I feel explaining Carriers move things between spots which is so important. You want a building built? Those carriers move the lumber. Harvesters are your wood and stone guys but can be told to harvest farms you have selected to harvest. Builders, easy.. but General Workers ?? They seem to build roads and hang around. Again I wish there was a clearer breakdown of what each job does. \n\nFarms: difficult to manage, I found its best to have them plant only, then use the harvesters that get the boost and manually select the items to harvest. Keep water close to the farm as well as a tank, and use those carriers to transfer overfill over. \n\nStorage system: this was updated to give us larger food storage which is wonderful.\n\nBuilding: Now maybe this is because I am so far in, but It would be great if the game gave more than a flag on what you are waiting on to finish buildings, especially since it just has the same logo on each. I'd appreciate a view into what is needed for each other than clicking on each individually. \n\nIdol workers:  There should be an alternative task assignment where I can tell Ombus peeps to carry items from my scavenger posts or harvest berries when not actively working for Ombu. When The dung collector has no dung, then let him collect berries or carry water from collectors to tanks. Secondary jobs that allow them to be of use without me needing to lock and unlock each job one by one. \n\nWeather events: you get it piled on time after time and that gets just beyond frustrating. There are times I just stop repairing and let them stay down until I am out of the path of whatever it is. A single storm should not hit you 3 times before Ombu gets out of the path. There is no forgiveness. The game shows a block of red danger, yet if Ombus tail is still partially in or close, you get hit. And it's constant events after a certain point in the game. At one point I had stopped playing a run when I realised I was never going to get out from under the spores with 3 decontaminators and Doctors fully staffed. The environment never lets up. Spores, Desert, Coldspells, Heat Waves. Its just one thing after another. \n\nEnd Game: Not knowing that getting the statue is the end of the game no matter how quick your run is going (under 2 days of gameplay, about 12 hours). This should be clearer. \n\nAgain, I enjoy this game. I find it relaxing now to play versus in the beginning I was frustrated constantly. I do hope the game continues to expand with more to do than what is currently included. \n", "timestamp_created": 1674106226, "timestamp_updated": 1674106226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131121751": {"recommendationid": "131121751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123492165", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 723, "last_played": 1688491971}, "language": "english", "review": "It's so cute, makes me want to keep playing!

This game is in early access and took my breath away. As a fan of colony building games; I HIGHLY recommend The Wandering Village. The Wandering Village allows you to build a community on the back of a beautiful god-like creature named Onbu. Onbu needs to stay healthy in order for your village to reach its greatest potential to survive, where this symbiotic relationship is formed between your villagers and Onbu.\n\nThe game is innovative, unique, and simple. The art style is beautiful. The interface is easy to understand and the controls of the game feel great! There are three different game versions for those who are more familiar with colony builders. This game can be random with every new game- so don't underestimate the difficulty in the beginning. You don't have to have a hard core strategy at the start. The game is kind to the player in novice difficulty, when teaching the player the rules of the game. If you are someone who likes the idea of a colony builder but feels overwhelmed by the amount of rules, building, and planning it takes- try this game. If you are someone who struggles with strategy, again, this game might be a great fit for you.\n\nI will not spoil the end game, but even in early access, this game is exceptionally made and still provides an immersive experience (AND YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH ONBU!!!) I cannot wait to see what the developers push for the final game! I hope you all love this game as much as I did when I gave it a try!\n\nPS- there is a discord channel with a great community and even a kickstarter for plushies!\n\nNote for those who LOVE colony builders:\n\nThis game has a specific niche and may not tickle the complexity you enjoy in a city-builder. This game doesn't provide the option to simulate the feeling of the villagers, their factions, jobs, tasks, feelings, stories, etc. that Dwarf Fortress excels at. However, even if you enjoy more of a controlling type of city-builder, this game maybe a great escape from something hardcore to something relaxing to play.", "timestamp_created": 1673675532, "timestamp_updated": 1673675532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130802667": {"recommendationid": "130802667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835501468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1058, "last_played": 1692165291}, "language": "english", "review": "such a nice game, calm, good story but i think we need food for cold places like potatoes and a place that can grow any food without the need of temperatures.

[/b] Some devs abandon wonderful concepts and some far exceed your wildest expectations. I'm not going to debate how much games should cost per hour of play, small vs big studio pricing, etc.  \n\nThere's no real end, (except that around day 100, [spoiler] you can build a monument. [/spoiler] ) It would be neat if there was some major change in gameplay once [spoiler] the monument was complete. [/spoiler] The difficulty modifiers make for a much more challenging experience and add a lot of replayability. [b] I've enjoyed the challenge on the second and third times around. [/b] I like what the devs have done, so I'm happy to support their development.  \n\nThis is a fun city builder that shakes things up with its addition of the onbu that carries your village. It would be nice to see more goal-oriented navigation, so that there's something bigger to look forward to. On the easier difficulties, you hardly have to worry about the onbu, it seems. It's a novel dynamic to either hurt it or not, but I saw no point in doing so. It would be interesting to have more factors at play with it, such as iron being something that is mined from Onbu. To be clear, I'm glad that it's not necessary. I almost feel like it shouldn't even be an option; it just feels too messed up. (Maybe it's a metaphor for us living on the earth and that's the point.) Rocks definitely don't need to respawn - that could help make the resources more scarce. Speaking of resources, trees could also grow much slower. (There's a difficulty modifier for this now.) \n\nIt'd be nice to see dynamic changes to the land, based on biome or that how you utilize the land could affect the onbu's terrain. (That or multiple onbu to choose from, each with different terrain.) It would also be cool if Onbu had multiple altitudes that had slightly different temperatures. (Colder, but windy high zones or warmer but toxic low zones?) Finally, it would be neat if the way you built your village affected Onbu or the world a bit more. (Letting more trees grow made Onbu healthier or the world less toxic, or not enough plants would cause issues, etc.)\n\nMy only real complaint is that the music got pretty repetitive. It's good, but I ended up turning it off after a couple hours. It either needs more tracks or less frequency. I think it's a bit too noticeable, if that makes sense. Then again, this makes a great game for listening to podcasts or such.\n\nOverall, it's pretty fun! The art is great and the idea is cool. I hope to see more world-building! (the devs said it's coming.)\n\n[strike] 13 Hour Update: After 13 hours, I'd say that I'm pretty done with it for awhile. There's not a whole lot of incentive to keep playing, since the world seems to just be random forever. [/strike] The difficulty modifier anti-perks make for more replayability. \n\n21-Hour Update: A main issue I have is that the village never feels self-sufficient. Maybe that's part of the point, so you don't get bored? It would be nice to have workload balance or preset modes, so that when you change biomes or get hit by infection growth, you can automatically, or with one button, switch crops or decontaminators. Additionally, it would be nice if there was a way to get iron and sand without relying SOLELY on scouts. (perhaps deep mining gives iron - a tradeoff, and sandstorms convert tiles to sand temporarily, like infection. This would also make the desert more dangerous as currently, it's my preferred biome due to lack of infection.)\n\n32 hour update: The new difficulty modifiers definitely make it more challenging and engaging. The colder world setting make it so that you really have to stockpile water, herbs, and mushrooms. Not knowing if Onbu was going to doom the whole civilization by disagreeing with my path recommendations was tense. I had to resort to doctors using placebos, causing my villagers to die a lot. I really like the difficulty modifiers. I'm not quite done with my monument on Adept +5 difficulty. I hope that it unlocks something, besides the option for harder settings. (I don't quite understand why the modifiers can be used on Easy/Adept, but they're hard enough on Adept.)", "timestamp_created": 1673641393, "timestamp_updated": 1684088425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130757202": {"recommendationid": "130757202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055276426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1673610315}, "language": "english", "review": "The game art is very cute and the music is quite calm and relaxing. Love the hand drawn animations for the buildings and villagers, Onbu is a sweety too. Have not encountered any bugs during my playtime.\n\nHere are the reasons why I would not recommend the game currently:\n\nIt's not a hard game but if you get really unlucky early on your run might be killed off. If Onbu wanders into the desert for example, because you can't control him because he doesn't trust you yet and you can't grow cacti and you can't send out explorers yet or there is no oasis to collect water from - your people will starve and you really can't do anything about that.\nSo you will learn to start your village in one specific way every time \u2013 which I don't think is fun.\n\nHarvesting poison plants should be high priority always, I do not want to click through 30 individual plants to set the priority high. It's good that their offspring will keep the priority you set tho.\n\nI feel like there's a lot of just watching the game instead of doing something. The game feel overall very slow and I am playing in x4 speed at any time.\n\nA bunch of the research things are basically ways to profit from Onbu by physically harming him. As in taking gallbladder fluid, blood, feeding him things that upset his stomach or drilling into his skin to take stone. \nAnd it says it will decrease his trust in you and you will have to also constantly heal him so he doesn't literally die because you abused him but overall I didn't feel like I was being punished for harming him. And I think these things SHOULD be punished by the game as you are hurting the thing that protects you, you shouldn't be able to easily get away with hurting Onbu just because you also gave him a snack and a pet. Maybe he should refuse your food and pets while you actively or just recently hurt him? \n\nSadly, I am not really having fun while playing, it makes me sleepy in fact.\nIt might turn into something more fun but right now I do not recommend buying this for 25 Euro.

Even if it was limited and the player fully had to manage it, it'd be very helpful.\n>> A more micro-manage way of handling how and where people are working. I often found they'd just pick a random place to work rather than where I probably want them to, and I know you can lower how many required people but having to go through that at mass can be annoying.

A relaxing game for the genre's veterans, helps you to empty your mind while dealing with challenges. With still being under development I believe it will have cool stuff added. As we have access to the developers on dc.  Definitely must play...\nYou need to make saves, game doesn't autosaves so if you think you messed up,  back to your prev play...\n\nCoffee and Read Version::\nWhen I saw this game review on rockpepershotgun website I found it interesting, it was before the launch I guess. But I noted it down as the symbotic city survival management including a mobile city with an opportunity to send scavengers sounds awesome.(Well I wasn't aware of all the concepts till playing it actually)\n\nThis reminding me Terry Prachet's Discworld a legendary life form, gigantic drifting over the lands instead of space. \nUI and gaming experience is fine after 8 hours, I almost lost my %35 to poison due to constructing onbu's doc before the village doctor; the population of 23 villagers were down too 17 which wasreally annoying, had to micromanage and move villagers over buildings to keep it functional. Then I found survivors and 51 strong now. \n\nI directly dived into the matter,t population is your main artery that's why. So as a veteran of Banished, Frostpunk, or other city sim & survival games since lovely Settlers, Settlers 2, Settlers III & IV (turned back to 2-anniversary edition naturally) Simcity, Fragile Allegiance(must try if you didn't hear it before), Caesar III, and Pharoah I have developed an affinity and certain taste for this genre.\n\nThis game has great potential as it's still in Early Access, I have 8 hrs of play mostly on a slow speed to keep an eye on stuff and the map. Due to constructing 3 research huts, I had chance to search essentials when I had the poison or drought or winter hit to my settlement. \n\nAs our lovely Onbu wanders around the land we enter mountain biodome(cold), forest (normal and humid), desert or barren land(hot or arid), and grasslands(spring).\nSo this affects our farming and crop rotation, each one of them has its own required climate. \nBesides that, we need to be wary of poisonous spores or )gas clouds, typhoons, tornados etc.) - which got 1/3 of my land and I have to extract bile from our Onbu, not good for our mutual communication. It took a quite long time to get rid of that - a good lesson learned there -.\n\nSo population is important, but feeding and keeping them healthy as well. You have to keep an eye on your food stocks, and variety(later on in the game as you get population your settlement level increases with new necessities you can find affinity to Anno games as the population cast increases they want more and different supplies)\n\nLeft aside the population, if your Onbu eats stones looking like his favorite dish he has constipation for 1,5 days. His belly rumbles too much that several of your building collapse. You not only keep your village healthy, well fed and protected from weather elements you keep an eye on Onbu's health, poison, hunger, and sleep requirement levels. \n\nSo even with core survival requirements and wandering around it's a fun and relaxing experience.  You will find it soothing (unless you are underpopulated and without necessary buildings to handle the crises :) ).\n\nI will suggest anyone who likes the genre to give a try to this gem. Since it's still under development I see good potential for it. \n\nStray Fawn Games did a marvelous job  and I am looking forward to send some suggestions on discord.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1673096956, "timestamp_updated": 1673096956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130313385": {"recommendationid": "130313385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118139383", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1677925216}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing!

The Wandering Villages is fun, playable, beautiful, family friendly, challenging, exciting, and succeeds at many, many things. Though at this time, the project is 'in development,' The game is playable, totally solid, and fun. Because it is already great, being actively improved, and has a clear roadmap of additions and updates, the omens are indicating a prosperous career for this title, and the folks at Stray Fawn putting it out.\n\tOne of the stand-out achievements of this game is with the story. Though simple, the story encapsulates a deep and broad set of  histories, beliefs and perspectives. Thematic Elements represented in the narrative of The Wandering Village include Eco-Consciousness, Compassion, Community Interdependence, Intentional relationships, Nature and Weather Cycles, Consequences and Risk-management, Sustainability vs. Depletion, and of course, so much more.\n\tPlaying through this game, I came away feeling inspired, relaxed, and reminded of simple joy. I learned many things along the journey, such as; Beets like to grow in cooler weather, where tomatoes like warmer situations, and; If you hurt an animal, it will lose trust in you, but you can learn to communicate and work together, and; If somebody isn't getting what they need, they will not produce as much and may die, and; If you decide to honor the mystical Mother Tree, she may surprise you more than you were asking for!\n\tThe developers and writers seem to whole-heartedly believe that with some knowledge, wisdom, love, and hard work, we can imagine and create a new culture who respects the Earth, surviving the pollen storm and thriving through it, too. And I believe it with them! The world may look how it is, but When the Powers that Be no longer continue to Be, what will we Be? And, how will our communities thrive among the crumbling remains of an empire passed? What does resilience look like in the time of plastics, frackcking, and mega-storms? We can imagine, design, create, and play anything in life, so let's imagine cooperation, design compassion, create diversity, and play games that help us talk about what matters in life, and how we can best support the Earth and delicious Polenta!@\n\tThank you, Stray Fawn Studios!", "timestamp_created": 1673025526, "timestamp_updated": 1673025526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518563210964202881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130269030": {"recommendationid": "130269030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100404917", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1663513011}, "language": "english", "review": "needs more content, still good", "timestamp_created": 1673011853, "timestamp_updated": 1673011853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130240999": {"recommendationid": "130240999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137349289", "num_games_owned": 2276, "num_reviews": 866, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1665502539}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1672977165, "timestamp_updated": 1672977165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130238480": {"recommendationid": "130238480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066114541", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1671317387}, "language": "english", "review": "The art style, music, and immersion are really great, but the gameplay leaves you wanting. Firstly, there is NO organic pop growth, because people just stop breeding in the apocalypse I guess, so you can get yourself caught in a death spiral with no way to pull yourself out. The only salvation is to luck out and get a crop of healthy nomads to fill any vacancies that are keeping you from getting ahead.\n\nThere can be unfortunate strings of events that are fun to navigate and you feel accomplished coming out on top, for example the Onbu can get sleepy in a toxic forest, leaving you basically effed unless you can fight off the toxic plants before they infect your food and starve/poison your people. And because there's no pop growth, if you're stuck there long enough, with no sites to have a chance to find wandering nomads and replenish your population, you just die.\n\nIf you do manage to survive, you'll be charged with constructing a \"monument\" of sorts, a testament to your will to thrive, and that's the ultimate goal of the game at present. Once you do that you can keep wandering, but there's really no point unless you want to get all the techs, which to be honest, are quite gruesome.\n\nI don't know if this product is some sort of social experiment, but this game forces you to commit animal cruelty. For instance, you may run out of stone deposits, but you can harvest a spike from Onbu's back, which harms him and lowers his trust toward you, but you get lots of stone from it. This is the same whether Onbu is awake or asleep (though you should be able to get away with it when he's asleep). Onbu's trust and health become a sort of exploitable resource, which, looking at the development team, is probably diametrically opposed to their political beliefs. On top of that, later technologies involve harvesting blood and bile from the Onbu, which quite frankly, is just gross. You can also harvest poop to make compost and flammable gas to combat the toxin, but that's just poop. The fertilizer doesn't seem to have any effect from what I've noticed either.\n\nOverall, the game is ok, but for its price and current state I could not recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1672974351, "timestamp_updated": 1690593732, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130231452": {"recommendationid": "130231452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060912732", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1690151708}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Nausica pero en la espalda de un animal cretino", "timestamp_created": 1672966055, "timestamp_updated": 1672966055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130156777": {"recommendationid": "130156777", "author": {"steamid": "76561199053612648", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 471, "last_played": 1698868409}, "language": "english", "review": "friend shape :^)", "timestamp_created": 1672886932, "timestamp_updated": 1672886932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130122747": {"recommendationid": "130122747", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994969847", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1674169385}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a beautiful and relaxing game while still having a good level of challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1672852328, "timestamp_updated": 1672852328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130117229": {"recommendationid": "130117229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383512024", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 565, "last_played": 1672848292}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1672847394, "timestamp_updated": 1672847394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486618012189865112", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130104215": {"recommendationid": "130104215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427388231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 3766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1276, "last_played": 1685024929}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello all.

The game has much improved and it's slightly easier to avoid RNG-based unavoidable death spiral situations; I went from a relatively stable population of 64 entering a starvation mass death event, bottoming out at 6 people (which was just barely sufficient to operate at the absolute minimum with tons of micromanagement) to a current population of 103 with no foreseeable problems.\n\nSomeone, it seems, took notice that having a toss of the dice at game start resulting in unavoidable game over conditions an hour or more later was a bad idea.\n\nThere are still some oddities at present, mind you; I'm still seeing situations where people perform one task, go eat, do another single task immediately next to the food supply, go eat again, repeat ad nauseam. I followed a Decontaminator walking to a single poison plant and then stopping to eat SEVEN TIMES IN A ROW during my recovery. I still think whether someone is \"hungry\" is determined with a coin flip instead of some actual meter; it isn't rare to see people starving to death while walking next to kitchens full of food, ignoring eating entirely until they're done, and then entering the eat-pretend to work-eat cycles.\n\nThere's also absolutely no task optimization. A decontaminator with full gas tanks will burn one plant and then travel to the opposite side of the map to burn a second instead of dealing with the stuff locally. This means that a lot of buildings are LESS efficient with more workers, which is frankly absurd. Storage, for example: it's possible to put yourself in trouble by building a new storage structure, because people will try to fill them up, which will drain resources from essential tasks. Example:\nYou're established and have built every tech building. Blood and bile extractors hurt your beast, but they have limited storage and produce things you don't use constantly, so the beast recovers. You build one storage structure, and before you know it, the beast is nearly dead.\nSimilarly, the new aquafarms. Producing fish requires fish. Producing kelp requires kelp. It's entirely possible (and in fact nearly unavoidable) for production to stop itself; you use the fish in the kitchen and the farm, kitchen cooks all the fish, the farm goes derp. Same thing with kelp.\n\nThe game is ALL micromanagement. You want grilled fish? Cross your fingers or keep a close eye on how many fish you have saved up so you can keep making more. If you run out, wait for the next ocean to catch more fish.\n\nIt'd also be nice if there was some degree of automation for production buildings, like \"grow best suited\" for farms, \"cook everything\" for kitchens, \"get fish and kelp\" instead of either building two fisheries for each or manually switching between the two, and \"produce everything\" instead of having THREE labs making medicines. Nope, it's all about having more population of micromanaging everything. People won't even manually rebuild destroyed structures, because someone thought you might want to just dismantle them instead. You might, *but there's already a button for that, why stall auto-rebuild for the unlikeliest need ever?*\n\nIn short, there's still some work to be done, but it's FAR better than it was. High hopes for the future. Day 439, 3,185.71km traveled, 'morning appetite' difficulty adjustment.

Your not just managing your villagers and village you also have to keep in mind that the giant rock dragon ur on is important to ur survival.  Maintaining trust by feeding him and healing him so you can help direct him around the world, and avoid storms.  Also the fact your on the back of a giant dinosaur means you have to put way more thought into managing space and resources, since their not quite infinite.  While resources can be gain by scouts going out into the world to gain resources from off dino sights, its never going to be as much as you gain from the back of puff the magic dragon.  Its a super cute, and interesting idea that is embodied brilliantly.  The game is still early access, and i only see it getting better, as of now its definitely a great game that i recommend, with a higher difficulty if you need that.  definitely a solid 20 hours of a few runs and even more if you want to seek those achievments and such.  Im excited to see where this game goes next!\n\nGreat game, would definitely recommend.\n\nEdit: \nHOLY SHIT I TAKE BACK WHAT I SAID ABOUT DIFFICULTY\nwell sorta\nbut im coming back to update this bc i felt like this recent expierence contradicts what my statements on difficulty say.  Poison dude.  Poison.  Some games have enemies, invading armies, storms, nah, this game its poison, half of my villages population, desolated.  I wasnt properly prepared for the poison clouds, i wasnt paying enough attention to Onbu's route, right through 2 clouds, and my island is covered in infested plants, and in a desperate struggle to build decaminator's, produce more herbs, and cut down as many infested growths as possible while loosing more and more population, making this all harder.  It looks like this may cause the death of what was a 50+ pop village.  Its worth mentioning that in terms of food, ive been breaking mostly even, never having an overwhelming surplus, and this has worsened due to the current poison issue.  I imagine on Veteran these issues are way more difficult and one would encounter them earlier on.  Next play through i think will be on veteran, just to see.  \neven better of a game, honestly what an indie gem", "timestamp_created": 1671944784, "timestamp_updated": 1671950929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736508965492248535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129160480": {"recommendationid": "129160480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158765804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1668490636}, "language": "english", "review": "Really love how chill this game is and fun to play.

It took some micromanagement but my people always had enough food, Onbu was always topped off. Noone was sick for long. I never had to gather stone, blood or bile from Onbu. Trees respawn, berry collectors never deplete their bushes, even the small stones respawn. Water collects itself outside the desert. One herb garden is enough to supply all your people and Onbu.\n\nThe only real moment of fear was my first infection, but you dont even need the flamethrower guys. You can just unemploy everyone, harvest everything infected and re-employ.\n\nAdditionally, exploring the surroundings gives a bit too many resources. Yielding 60 water from one oasis in a few hours does not compare to the time my farmers need to grow that many cacti. Two teams of explorers was enough to never really gather wood or stone from Onbu.\n\nAlso researching is pretty bland. It only takes time and Knowledge points your explorers bring home.\n\n\nSummary: As of now it has a lot of potential. The limited space, having to explore the surroundings for resources. balancing needs of your villagers with those of Onbu. But it does not yet deliver, since the state of the village and Onbu is too stable (too self-sufficient). It needs to enforce more strategic decisions, which in other games is nicely achieved by ambiguity of goods. Make it that some food items are needed for medicine.

Do expect regular survival elements such as maintaining food and water sources, coping with illness and natural disasters etc. The game is short and sweet. Skilful players can probably complete it in 10 hours. \n\nThe strength of this game is no doubt the graphics and art. The 4 camera perspectives is particularly smart and flawlessly designed. Each perspective associates with a different level of management - map view for deciding your pet dino and villagers' destiny, dino view for managing its basic needs, and village top down view for city building. The village eye level view is fun to watch! Yet I don't see micromanagement options of individual villagers' behaviour or mood. They don't make babies even when I put two of them in one tent.\n\nFor the simple gameplay and lack of story, the current price is steep. If you are looking for a city building/ management game with depths and widths, or room for your own creativity, this might not scratch that itch. Otherwise, this is a perfect light bite in the city builder genre . And consider the effort and talent that the artists and designers inject in this game, they well deserve a decent paycheck.

I'd also recommend to have a Worker Post with at least 2 'Carriers' in it to make sure goods are being transported from A to B!\n\nDid any of this resolve the issue?\n\nCheers,\nPhilomena"}, "127230192": {"recommendationid": "127230192", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990629253", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 567, "last_played": 1669741990}, "language": "english", "review": "Save onbu, big hairy lizard needs glasses", "timestamp_created": 1669559300, "timestamp_updated": 1669559300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127208943": {"recommendationid": "127208943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163466659", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 768, "last_played": 1677745381}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty cool game, I really like the artstyle of the game.

It's your classic city builder, collecting resources, building, processing resources for the higher tiered buildings, and deciding the most optimal places for your buildings. The dangers of poison, heat waves, and cold snaps are easily taken care of later on, but when you first start out these things can ruin your run. Especially if you accidentally run into a large poison forest without being prepared, your little village can be wiped out before you know it. \n\nYou can always go up a higher difficulty in order to test your skills at the game, and the availability of moral choices (being able to harm Onbu) can make every game different if you so wish. The developers have many updates in the works, and I personally can't wait to see them.\n\nBeyond the gameplay, the music and art style are absolutely amazing. I like the way the buildings look, and it's especially fun to get all the down to your villagers' level and take screenshots of the village as it spans onward. The music fits this game perfectly. \n\nAs it's in early access, the content is few, and as many have mentioned the price isn't exactly the greatest for an unfinished game. But I'm sure there are great things ahead for The Wandering Village.\n\nEdit, Ocean Update: The game has added upgrades to buildings along with even bigger and better stuff. Decorations! Finally! One of my favorite additions aside from the new ocean biome and all the connected buildings. You can put plants and arches and more Onbu-themed decorations. Due to these additions to the content I'd say the main complaint I had was fully addressed, and this isn't even the end of the updates.

It's an interesting nuance having to care for and take from, an entity you're riding.\n\nThe game has the usual blend of food/comfort/resource gathering that city building games possess but also adds in a disease mechanic that, caught too early, is really devastating and from which a recovery is difficult.  The creature you ride, Onbotu or something, is not too needy and is pretty hardy.  \n\nOne of the interesting mechanics is the ability of the creature to randomly pick a direction that leads you right into a poison field and then may decide to nap while the air is at it's most poisonous; therefore, it behooves you to quickly gain its trust and give it commands.  This process is not nearly as difficult as I was thinking it may be, but I really could not figure out how to gauge its trust other than sometimes it would listen and sometimes it would not.  Not a real complaint...the gamer in me wanted a min/max dial I could watch but I appreciate why it wasn't present.\n\nI did not find the farming very clear.  There's a variety of crops you'll plant, based on the season, and you'll need to research those to have variety for environment and people pleasing, but i found i had to dedicate a farm to one crop, despite having many plots.  The plots were the farms way of dividing up its circle of influence, and my early game was spent trying to share one farm between multiple crops which didn't seem to work -- or maybe it did, it wasn't real clear.  The other thing that maybe wasn't really working right, was a harvest/farm button...which if I'm being honest, I just need the farmers to handle, that's why I hired them.  And in fact, if I selected neither button, they managed it on their own.  Maybe the button was a way to override their behavior but if it was, the buttons seemed to behave backwards to what was happening. if you selected harvest, the Harvest word grayed out and made me feel like that was turning Harvest off...not sure.  Either way, that brings to me another annoying point/recommendation.  I found it best to not only devote a farm to a specific crop, but also kitchens which make the raw food into a refined version.  But there are no recipes of combining ingredients and the kitchens aren't smart enough to just make food out of whatever raw food is available.  So people starved and died, despite options because my kitchen wasn't making any food that i had selected as that raw resource was not available.  So I found it much simpler to have a farm and a kitchen devoted to the ingredient (beets, corn, tomatoes, wheat -- no meat options), which brings us to our next nuance, water.\n\nWater can be skimmed from the air if humidity is high enough and you really need to build a ton of water collectors as your farms will move through water VERY quickly.  The tutorial has you build 2 water silos making you think that's the recommended but I had 10 and still ran out easily with the farming and consumption.   \n\nAll-in-all, the alpha is totally playable.  Something did feel missing as I felt I had mastered the game fairly quickly.  The risk of failure was not the real other than bad luck with a poison event.  I even found the scavenging options to be a viable (and necessary) alternative to a lot of my own stone/wood farming and did not find much draw back to having a large colony, although some of my water/farming issues would have been less an issue -- but who wants to let nomads die on road, right?\n\nScavenging is something i would call necessary and to my knowledge, the only way to get sand for your glass needs as well as knowledge which was fairly unclear at first but ends up being its own currency of sorts you spend on advanced research, collecting it here and there from explorations.  The exploring is fairly basic and text adventure-esque, likely to expand in the future.\n\nI'm going to give it another shot on normal, sans the tutorial and make sure I didn't miss a big part of the game's replayability...which is my only real concern about the game.  will I play it more than once or twice?  I'm not sure it'll get three plays, but we'll see.", "timestamp_created": 1669322163, "timestamp_updated": 1669322163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529411792755126953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126684293": {"recommendationid": "126684293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008284324", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 976, "last_played": 1669692954}, "language": "english", "review": "A year or so ago I found this game here and the dev team offered a demo. After playing the demo I followed the game because I planned to get it when it was available. \nSteam notified me that it was available and I bought it. No demo anymore, but since that was pretty janky and needed work it makes sense to not have it there because the early access game will be more polished, right? \nRight?\nNope. This is the exactly same as the demo, crusty, busted, lazy AI and all.\nYep. I paid $25 for the same demo I played for free previously, with the addition of an \"end-game\" building for the win state, a Wonder if you will that you are rewarded with after you travel to a certain point, which can happen accidentally and for me at around 7 hours into the game. Other than that, it's no different from the demo, not any longer than the demo, and not enough of a game in its current state to warrant the price tag.\nThe good. \nIt's cute, and the concept is interesting and unique. Onbu is pretty cute and the idea of building a symbiotic relationship with your world is right up my alley. \nThe bad, \nthe AI is garbage and you're literally riding around on the back of the village idiot. \nThe UI is slightly less garbage. \nYou start the game handicapped by a negative 25% to productivity because the Onbu doesn't come with pre-built homes on its back. Onbu has zero sense of self preservation and will lie down for a long sleep on burning sand, in the middle of a poison forest, or in a thunderstorm/tornado. No matter how much poisoning it takes or how much actual damage it takes it doesn't run unless you manage to earn its trust enough to convince it that it'll burn less of its feet away if it picks up the pace a tad bit.\nSick villagers will stand around waiting for the doctor, a hundred miles away, forcing your medical staff to trek across the entire map, heal one sick villager, then walk all the way back to the doctor's hut. Farmers will stop producing for no reason as will berry huts and despite having a bonus to overall productivity it takes 3 sawmill operators 2 game days to get me 2 planks.\nThe game is incredibly unbalanced, not just in resource management but in the parasite vs non-parasite aspect of play. One tree gets 3 wood, but it takes 5 wood to make 1 hut to house 2 villagers. Then you get to the woodcutter where 3 logs gets you 2 planks and it takes 5 to build a hut. Stone is the same when it's needed as slabs, it's also a non-renewable resource if you play symbiotic and don't mine your ride for materials, Between the increased cost of buildings and the damage that will always happen from wind or thunderstorms, or when your totally full-up Onbu decides those rocks look just too tasty, you're always scrambling for resources. The line between incident and total fail state comes fast when your workforce loses productivity to the loss of housing or the kitchen and it starts the downward spiral.\nIt's sad but my attempts all ended with the same feeling. I feel like I got robbed.\n\nThe devs don't seem to plan for much in the way of fixes. They have mapped out a balancing fix and an AI fix but the planned introduction of an Onbu punishment building (hope that's some kind of joke) suggests that it won't be much.\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1669319539, "timestamp_updated": 1672641845, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547693133354187012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126681226": {"recommendationid": "126681226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367012215", "num_games_owned": 1079, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1699390063}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El Bicho nunca hace caso, me arruina las partidas xD", "timestamp_created": 1669318492, "timestamp_updated": 1669318492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499445050954818726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126675191": {"recommendationid": "126675191", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999122925", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1695730898}, "language": "english", "review": "Good city builder, very early access, devs have let the success go to their head, insufficient support since release\n\nresponse to developer:\n\nIn a similar timeframe, another early access citybuilder \"Against the storm\" came out, and has been delivering bi weekly patches and content updates, I can compare these two games for similar scope and genre.  \n\nI don't expect the same amount of content or labor from a smaller team, but it feels like the game was released and hasn't gotten the early support it needs.

If you want to just lean back for a while you can play on normal Speed, or if it isnt fast enough there are sliders to speed up the tempo to force events to happen more early. Even an implemented difficulty Setting helps to get a more preferred Gameworld.\nAnd for sure the best Part are the interactions with the giant Creature. At the Beginning just a low amount, but over the course of a Game the relationship between the Villagers and the Creature lead to more options like letting it know when it can safely rest or to feed it or healing it etc.\n\nFor this Game i will not count negatives at the moment, because it is still in an Early Access state.\n\nSo far tho i can say, that i am already impressed by it and i am looking forward to future updates in the hope that they implement even more Biomes and Buildings and Gameplay-Options.\n\nI recommend this Game to People who like to enjoy chillig Strategy-Survival Games and who also love simple Graphic, but still artistic style.\n\n---------------------------------\n[h3]Points i give this Game (Average: 7,04 / 10):[/h3]\n8,7  / 10 graphics (Nice choice to go that 2D Drawing Style in a 3D World, it really gives it a nice artistic touch)\n 8,5 / 10 Gameplay (Easy to get into the Game)\n6,4 / 10 Story (The Main-Story is good so far, but i would like to see a little more sidequests and unique Side-Character Stories to tell a bite more about the World they life in)\n7,4 / 10 City-Management and variety of Buildings (City Management is easy, the Building variety maybe a little bit low, but that is likely to Early Access state and i hope they increase the amount of possible Buildings)\n4,2 / 10 Soundtrack (There are a few Tracks, but for the Playtime it takes for one Playthrough i would like to hear a higher variety of Tracks to not getting the same over and over)\n", "timestamp_created": 1669145952, "timestamp_updated": 1669145952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604439675807952881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125998073": {"recommendationid": "125998073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174749026", "num_games_owned": 632, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1669145698}, "language": "english", "review": "...", "timestamp_created": 1669145816, "timestamp_updated": 1669145816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125994444": {"recommendationid": "125994444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131157152", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1670293330}, "language": "english", "review": "is cute", "timestamp_created": 1669145465, "timestamp_updated": 1669145465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125992982": {"recommendationid": "125992982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054872428", "num_games_owned": 2155, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 879, "last_played": 1663462285}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game with a nice twist to the usual survival strategy game, makes it fresh.

It would be awesome to see some scenarios apart from endless mode. Particularly curious to play a mission where first people board the Onbu, how people encounter with first spores, certain scenarios in each biome and more. Also, as for now you can't neither relocate building, nor rotate and it is a bit annoying to demolish and rebuild all the time.  More food variety would be great, too. Planting beets all the time is a bit annoying.

You can also guide the creature to specific biomes.\n-Can control the speed of the creature to help avoid \"disasters\" on the map you'll encounter, like speeding up or slowing down to avoid an incoming storm across your path.\n-Beautiful to look at. Love the art style.\n-Soundtrack is great. Pleasure to listen to.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Not a ton of content. You'll reach the end of all there is to offer approximately 5-6 hours.\n-I don't really get the itch for replayability right now. Nothing makes me want to come back and do it again other than really listening to the soundtrack again.\n-I really wish you could rotate buildings. I think this is locked because of the art style, but cannot do so. I find myself having to build weird road structures because of this which annoys me.\n\nOverall:\n\nI liked it.

if he can't find stuff to eat or gets sick you can help him out (or it?) and thus gain his trust.\nit's all comming together quite brilliantly. the traveling giga creature, you tiny villagers, the need to adhere to their needs, build and expand and explore. \n\nfurthermore this is one of the prettiest games i've seen for quite a while. the 2D art-style is quite unique and animations are stellar. the level of detail in the enviroment and buildings is not just destinct but great to look at. 3D models like Onbu and 2D models like your villagers, colors and effects just blend together. it's a great approach to art-style.\nsame goes for the music: tribal beats, somber almost arabic sounding melodies just fit perfectly.\n\neasy recommendation, especialy looking at the already low price-tag.", "timestamp_created": 1665596847, "timestamp_updated": 1665596847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123733770": {"recommendationid": "123733770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054447610", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 839, "last_played": 1665608150}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun gameplay interesting idea , excited to see what comes", "timestamp_created": 1665595407, "timestamp_updated": 1665595407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123728639": {"recommendationid": "123728639", "author": {"steamid": "76561199140411963", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1682125560}, "language": "english", "review": "it is really fun just dont play on the begginer mode unless u want to die cause it sets u up to fail. play on adept or highrer", "timestamp_created": 1665587988, "timestamp_updated": 1665587988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123701618": {"recommendationid": "123701618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081098406", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2334, "last_played": 1695517407}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is creative and fun to play!

It's honestly a very refreshing take when it comes to city builders since there are unique challenges that arise depending on how you care for your land and how you choose to interact with Onbu/the general environments. \n\n People who are complaining about the price really aren't considering the fact that this game is still early access, and the developers have definitely delivered what they have so far promised. The $25 price point is more than fair considering that \n1. This will eventually likely be a $50+ game after more development. \n2. That money goes to supporting further development. \n3. There is tons of opportunity for the community to contribute to the development and direction of the game. \n\nThe early access so far does not really have a story line or endgame. Its more just experimenting and playing with the basic mechanics/concepts. If this game has sparked you curiosity, I recommend buying it to support the team. There are tons of ways to contribute to the early access development via discord as well.\n\nIf you're looking for a finished, polished game, than I would say to wait on this one.

Though a fairly short game as the game technically \"ends\" at day 100 but you can continue to play for what i assume is forever. But despite being relatively short, i have no doubt it will be beefed out throughout development and i cannot wait for what the devs have in store! I have played this on all difficulties and I feel like the difficulties need defining and tuning more. Beginner and intermediate feel the same and the hardest difficulty is only hard until you have 30+ villagers and the main essential buildings researched, the late game seems the same on all modes.\n\nPros:\n. Wonderful immersive music that change in each biome.\n. Onbu is adorable and its fun looking after his needs and keeping him safe.\n. Good AI\n. Very stable game, never encountered any bugs or crashes.\n. Outstanding use of 3D and 2D assets resulting in an adorable art style.\n\nCons:\n. Early access always has its risks.\n. Relatively short game.\n. Fairly easy difficulties.\n. Some crops wont be used as much as others as some need very specific biomes that I never seemed to be in that often, so villagers always complain about their diet.\n. Sometimes the villagers wont build or harvest something until you make it a priority even if there is a low workload.\n\nSuggestions: \n(I understand that some of these might even be in development already)\n\n. Greenhouses so you can grow crops in all biomes.\n. Barns/coops and livestock.\n. Make difficulties more distinct.\n. Villagers age and have kids.\n. Schools for kids giving educated villagers boosts.\n. The ability to do more with mushrooms (eg. mushroom soup for your villagers)\n. Be able to make more foods with a combination of crops (eg. Berry pie: wheat + berrys, tomato & mushroom soup etc)\n. More crops (eg. potatoes, onions etc)\n. Meet other Onbu and maybe make Onbu caravans were you use balloons for villagers to get from one Onbu to another. \n. Bandit raids on your Onbu + a barracks/garrison building for soldiers to defend Onbu.\n. More biomes and more varied random encounters.\n.

game has quite an interesting take on city building, requiring a lot of micro management to deal the environment you're passing through. The game is at its best when Onbu (your kaiju city) either refuses to listen to reason and parks itself in a very inconvenient place, or takes a wrong turn and you're forced to quickly shuffle around your meagre workforce to keep everyone healthy, fed and housed. Onbu will usually listen to you unless you've done something to upset it, but even then there's some fun trying to avoid hazards on a beast that only knows how to go forwards.\nMostly the gameplay revolves around trying to gather/farm food, upgrade your infrastructure and keep Onbu and your villagers healthy. Each biome has a different climate, resources to gather and hazards. Climate is very important in TWV as it determines whether or not you can collect water, which crops you can grow and whether or not the atmosphere will accumulate toxic spores in your village (and Onbu itself). Changing biomes usually involves making tough decisions about who goes where, and which crops you will grow. Tomatoes grow quickly in warmer climates, but are inefficient when cooked, beets won't grow in hot or cold climates but have a better yield when turned into soup. Toxic environments also require you to grow medicinal herbs, which need to be grown and then distributed to both Onbu and your villagers, and can spawn spores on Onbu that need to be controlled with more villagers. These spores multiply very quickly and are a very real threat as they poison your villagers, Onbu and destroy crops and infrastructure.\nLosing villagers to poison or hunger is also a problem, because the only way to get more is to find them in the overworld. Running out of food is one thing, but having villagers die whilst moving to a toxic biome with a different climate can really put the pressure on to make every villager you have count.\nThis makes for a pretty good gameplay loop where you're constantly praying for Onbu to take your advice and planning what you'll do to survive regardless of what happens.\n\nTVW also has a really nice visual style, zooming in on the villagers hard at work (or not) adds a lot of character to the world that I usually find missing in city builders. Onbu is also very charming when he isn't falling asleep in the path of a tornado/spore cloud.\nContent feels a little bare bones at the moment but I'm willing to excuse it for early access and because the core gameplay loop is so engaging. If you played Timberborn and enjoyed the drought mechanic you'll probably feel right at home here, although TVW starts easier than the first few droughts it can throw you a lot more curveballs and challenges than Timberborn's drought mechanic ever will on hard.\n\ntl;dr game good, play on normal or above, micro intensive, very engaging", "timestamp_created": 1665121608, "timestamp_updated": 1665121608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123468726": {"recommendationid": "123468726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035699176", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1665113727}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!", "timestamp_created": 1665116446, "timestamp_updated": 1665116446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123467294": {"recommendationid": "123467294", "author": {"steamid": "76561199246424539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 579, "last_played": 1666408133}, "language": "english", "review": "addictive lovely game !!!  :-)", "timestamp_created": 1665113338, "timestamp_updated": 1665113338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123463260": {"recommendationid": "123463260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095450565", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1523, "last_played": 1690935133}, "language": "english", "review": "I require onbu plushies.

You indirectly control your villagers by essentially pointing out the things you want done and then giving that task a priority.  Villagers also work at structures that they build, which takes away from your fluid labor force (general workers).  While you're checking on them, you're also riding a freakin' giant walking animal because your only other choice is a life of poison and death on the ground.  So you also need to keep Onbu--the creature you ride--alive.  You do this by feeding, healing, and curing.  But you can also guide Onbu when you gain it's trust, which is especially important when it comes to the biomes you will come across and what you feel prepared for.  You could also choose to forego the trust and simply take from the beast and deal with what comes.  In short, you have to juggle a lot of important matters, sometimes a few all at once.\n\nStarting out, the tutorial does a good job of explaining what needs to be done, but I feel it could emphasize the trust mechanic with Onbu better.  Specifically explaining the benefits of valuing trust vs. ignoring it.  There is a lot to learn, so it's possible I missed a few details as well, but the nice thing about the game is how it rewards patience and being observant.  You may eventually answer your own question about something just by continuing to play.  I find it challenging to manage, but extremely satisfying and relaxing when things just work out.  But they don't always work out and you can easily cause a lot of problems for yourself if you're not careful.  I managed to avoid dying a couple of times, but even now at 16 hours, I'm in a tight spot again.  The challenge doesn't let up, but I actually appreciate that.\n\nMy biggest problems are mostly related to it being in Early Access.  I want more content, more dynamic systems (why even have worker huts, really?), and I'd like a bit more story.  I'm also finding that stone is a difficult resource to keep stocked, particularly in the late game.  There are some random encounters you can experience along the way and I found out that they seem to repeat more often than I'd like.  I'd definitely appreciate more variety there.  And lastly, while I don't hate the price, it is pretty high for what you get.  But, to be fair, if everything on their Early Access roadmap is implemented, it's easily worth that price.\n\nOverall, I have had a fantastic time being awake until 2 am on multiple sessions because there's always more to do and more to improve.  It really sucked me in for a good while.  I highly recommend it if you want a more unique take on managing a small civilization.  \n\nAlso, I'd die for my Onbu.", "timestamp_created": 1664779817, "timestamp_updated": 1664779817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.771050989627838135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123262446": {"recommendationid": "123262446", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961739057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 507, "last_played": 1665017519}, "language": "english", "review": "Nicely done.

Initially it looks simple enough. You gather berries, you chop wood, you dig stones. After initial phase, things starting to complicated and I find myself actively managing the village. You build farm but you need to watch out for weather, current Biome and the next coming Biome so that you know what to plant or what to harvest now.. There is no sequential weather. Your weather will change depends on where Onbu is heading. \n\nYou will get several disasters. Most annoying will be poisonous air which not only make your villagers sick, also create spores and your crop will be in trouble. There are tonados, heat wave, and cold snap. I read that the developers are planning new Biomes including water world, which I assume flood will be next.\n\nIn the core of the gameplay is Onbu, the big turtle with child like minded. You need to take care of him or else your whole village won't last long even you do everything perfect. He will sleep on poisonous area coz he is sleepy.. He will eat stones that look like mushroom coz he is hungry. He hurts himself walking in the hot sand.\n\nAlso, you can either hurt him to survive your village or decide not to do that but will have disadvantage in the long run. Example, you can drill him to get blood out, which you can make blood pudding as food for your village (no kidding!)\n\nAll in all, I love this game and I never thought normal simulation can give me so much stress and always on the edge of my seat. Early access is very much refined and I can even consider completed game. With the new updates roadmap, I am excited to see what more the developers can bring to already perfect survival simulation game.", "timestamp_created": 1664712396, "timestamp_updated": 1664712396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123195576": {"recommendationid": "123195576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253406247", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1664456990}, "language": "english", "review": "something good to turn your brain off to", "timestamp_created": 1664685452, "timestamp_updated": 1664685452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123190336": {"recommendationid": "123190336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062668316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1664678007}, "language": "english", "review": "So, i don't do many reviews.

This game is such a delight to play and to think it's not even finished!\nFirstly, it looks gorgeous. I absolutely love the style the devs went for. Looking at my villagers doing their things around the village is like watching an animated film. I find it so much fun that when you zoom into the village the houses sort of pop-up like in a pop-up book. Too cute! This gives me so much pleasure! And the Onbu design is so lovely as well. \nI hope the feel of the core gameplay remains pretty much unchanged as the game gets completed. I love the chill vibes. It's just so nice to play; further, I like how it balances how much \"action\" you get in different biomes: you can lounge in the desert but stay there too long and you will be needing water, making you want to go into the jungle only to have to maneuver around poisonous clouds and toxic forests. I love how the game keeps you engaged and yet remains relaxing and fun.\nI also absolutely adore the sandbox-y and open-ended thing the game seems to have now. It's such a mood. It's so destressing and pleasant and nice. \nLastly, and I can't overstate how important and I find this: there is no violence in this game. This, to me, makes it from an absolute delight to play to chef's kiss hands down amazing contender for fave game ever. <3", "timestamp_created": 1664238924, "timestamp_updated": 1664238924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122893427": {"recommendationid": "122893427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002923540", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 2276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1282, "last_played": 1664756889}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Colony Sim, definitely try it.", "timestamp_created": 1664238578, "timestamp_updated": 1664238578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122889332": {"recommendationid": "122889332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059475992", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 941, "last_played": 1679027718}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is weird.", "timestamp_created": 1664230540, "timestamp_updated": 1679027758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122886533": {"recommendationid": "122886533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023083559", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 1388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1387, "last_played": 1664836125}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing an Early Access version as of September 2022.\n\nA vary slight thumbs-up.

Once you've figured these things out, although each replay has (apparently) random elements, I don't think there'll be much replay value in the game, so my thumbs-up is only slight.\n\nSome of the ideas are unusual.  For instance, your villagers never have children.  To increase your population you have to attract them from nearby settlements or just encounter them on the road.  There's no combat.  Well, actually there is: your village can get infected with something and you have to to get rid of it.

The most difficult part was knowing what type of infrastructure to prioritize to tackle the conditions the game throws at you.

It's supposed to be a post apocalyptic, dying world. But aside from infections while unprepared, which only really happens once or twice, it's pretty smooth sailing. So the whole concept is confusing. Is it supposed to be a chill city builder with a few outside influences guiding your progress or is it supposed to deliver the challenge of struggling to survive? The whole theme of a symbiotic or parasitic playstyle isn't there either. Parasitic just doesn't pay off. \n\nThere do appear to be a few minor bugs. Like getting notifications about Onbu losing trust because you mined its spikes which you didn't even do. Also balancing issues with certain buildings seeming quite bad. \n\nWas a good time overall but for 25 bucks and after the game plays its full hand you are left with meager content. Starting a new game makes little sense because it's exactly the same again.\n\nThere is more planned on the roadmap. Which is sorely needed. Definitely should have launched much cheaper.

I love the game! \na few ideas, whether good or not idk\n>the ability to assign tasks to individual people (honestly only matters once you get past a population of around 80-90, even with specific tasks highlighted), \n> a \"poisonous plant\" specific highlight on the harvest menu, \n> visualize statistics a bit more (specific/expected food IN and food OUT is mostly my goal. or like, expected processed food  - visualizing what I have vs my population needs without opening the villager happiness menu. Housing too, making it more in-your-face or at-a-glance), ESPECIALLY I would love the option to see a list of tasks with their priority in order. For example, say I have a ton of stuff I want harvested/built but then there's building's that need rebuilt or poisonous plants needs dealt with, I would love to be able to see/reassign priority. I get that that may make it too easy because then you're not looking around and individually prioritising things, but yeah. \n>ability to set priority level (level 1, 2, 3) with the priority tool, not just it bumping it up one. Or stacking priority clicks, instead of capping at one. It can get rough prioritizing each individual little poisonous plant. I get around this by having extra people/assigning and unassigning decontaminators as needed, but it is still tedious when you need to do it.\n>please for the love of this game give better indication that scouts are back. A popup, a sound, \"would you love to send this scouting party on another expedition?\" or whatever, it would just make that whole part of the game easier to stay on top of.\n>could make \"family dynamics\" a thing. Specific homes for families, say it gives a popup of \"blank and blank have decided to be in a partnership, they will need their own [marital home? idk] to add to the population.\" I'd make that it's own branch under the research tree, why not. Then you've got useless villagers for a sec while they grow up (draining food stores but not doing work, adds a challenge temporarily - could make it harder and need kids to have a place to go like a Nanny/School Hut or their parents can't work further reducing your workforce until things are remedied) then once they're grown up they can do work. Could make it a requirement to have like 90% happiness level or something before [Marital Homes] and [Nanny/School] are available. Idk I'm spitballing.\n\n Obviously my suggestions would make the game easier, but with that and the limited space on the Onbu it could make it hard to lose the game. I would love for the size of the Onbu to be upped, doesn't have to be by much, but you know. Or! Some way to expand the size of the Onbu, like a good vs evil way. Evil would be cheap and easy, say cheap knowledge points to forcefully add space, expanding ethically without harming the Onbu could be like related to a new scouting location/trust bar/love bar (could make the relationship with the Onbu more critical and measured and then boom reward of more space, like how you have to build trust for it to listen to you). Or maybe picking up baby Onbu's that eventually grow, so then you have a train of Onbu's to take care of and keep the populations happy on. The more space you need to manage the more challenging the game becomes is the idea.\nI did not expect to write a novel here but I do really enjoy the game and I would love love love to see it expanded/adding content. \nYou guys did a great job!

My main feedback to devs so far is to make it so you can zoom out further before it goes to Onbu view to see your whole town.\n\nDay 3(?) Feedback:\n\nStill really highly rate this game. I like that the complexity of the game increases at a manageable level, though if you slack off and don't invest into research eventually you'll be regretting that you can't manage problem X or Y. I've beaten the game now in probably about 12 hours without really trying to min max, built everything that can be built and I think seen every type of situation. I know there is a roadmap for more content but I worry even that is not THAT much more, you really are limited by the size of his back in terms of how you can scale out, and given it's all done now I wonder why I would need to keep playing as well even if I could.\n\nThings I think can be added to improve QOL (particularly at late game):\n - Some sort of unlockable auto for the feeding and healing of Onbu and the scavenging - at the end it really does just become a 'wait for cooldown and click again to make sure Onbu is ok and my scavs aren't slacking off' simulator as the village is on autopilot. It's good to have to do that at the start, but once you've done it... you've done it? Not much fun or value in repeating so many times\n - Ability to see which villagers are assigned to which task at a macro view, like a dashboard for managing them. Again, as an unlockable (maybe a building called Control Tower or something) would work, so you still play that part of the game, but then no longer have to go keep clicking on buildings to see what they're all doing or managing multiple beet farms at once etc\n - I really liked that there is no 'bad guy' persay, but rival villages competing for resources or trying to invade you could make it a bit more exciting once you've done it all\n - If you put something on the absolute highest priority, given there are 4 different levels of prio, that should be cue for villagers to literally stop whatever they're doing, even an assigned role, to do that thing. Someone minding a beet farm off the corner of your map while you're desperately trying to take out the poison shrooms is pretty frustrating, needing to click on every building is also a pain, and there would be fair trade-off because your village would essentially stop functioning for a while\n\nI did recommend this game to a couple people but given it's so short I'm not sure that I'll keep doing that, I know it's an alpha as well so I'm not ignorant to the fact it's an incomplete game, it is just.... very short, even for an alpha.

I'm not one to spoil things by watching dev videos (though I should because it shows support) and prefer to jump in blind with things. After a quick-to-learn tutorial, the rest is easy.\n\nThere are going to be moments of mild frustration where you're not sure how to progress - just give it time, expand your village, and enjoy the peace while it lasts. You'll face off against spore storms, thunderstorms, extreme heat, extreme cold, and sudden panic (but fun panic, if that's a thing). \n\nWhat I liked about this game:\n1.) Minimal list of base resources - there's plenty to be varied and specific, but you won't be drowning in menus of [i]metals, ores, wood, crystals, etc[/i]. \n2.) I also loved the color pallet! There's no clashing colors, nothing is overbearingly bright, it's all very soft and pleasant.\n3.) There's always something to do. There's going to be times where it feels like you're not doing anything - that's fine, it will come and go but never be present for too long where it's annoyingly present.\n4.) You can pet the Onbu. Give it plenty of pats and have a happy village!\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n1.) Currently, there's no representation of Onbu's [i]trust[/i] that I could find. Maybe it's there and I was just blind, but all I could go by was whether or not Onbu [i]looked[/i] happy or not - this may be by design and if so I may revise if this as a positive.  Again, I don't watch dev videos so this could have already been mentioned.\n2.) Camera is very linear. I would like even a 5-degree swing on the camera. Sometimes you just can't click something because there's too much layered in front of it. You will sometimes NEED to cut down your prized trees [spoiler]Mothertrees[/spoiler] to get that thing [spoiler]spore infestation[/spoiler]. \n3.) I can't seem to get Farms to grow out to as far as you can grow plants - my radius is only 2 grid spaces but the plot size can far exceed that. Could just not be in the right climate (even at green productivity), but I've maxed my water storage units and just could not grow a full farm plot. It's not that this was ever a REAL issue - I always had more than enough food. But I would have to build three farms to produce what a single farm could potentially grow.\n4.) The way items are stored and the lack of a \"placement\" sorter. I would like to be able to store specific thing closer to specific buildings or gathering locations. It would be nice to be able to configure what is stored where or some sort of [i]priority[/i] sorting. But this isn't so much as a negative as it's more of a personal want.\n\nOverall, 9/10 - would recommend to anyone wanting to play or thinking of getting this game.

I can't wait to see what the devs have in store for this game over the next year or so.\n\nSpecifically, I'd like to see the following improvements:\n1. Better difficulty pacing. Right now it just seems to ramp up linearly and you just never get a break. Maybe decrease the time that sunny/snowy areas are active or have the game check obstacles in the pervious area before populating new areas with obstacles.\n2. More \"static\" upgrades for buildings or actions in research. You max out research pretty quickly and there's only so much room for new buildings, so increasing the buildings'/actions' effects or offering further specialization will further vary gameplay and give the player more tools to solve problems.\n3.

These are all great, and the idea of a village on the back of a behemoth is super cool for a colony sim management game.\n\nBut then you start playing, and after a certain point, things get frustrating. Resource management is important as your village grows, especially the simple In / Out tracking for each resource you generate. I.e. I generate 3 berries a day, and eat 2 berries a day. The game lacks any features to track this information outside of the most broad examples (total food in/out for example, but no breakdown as to what foods are being eaten and in which quantities). This makes managing those parts of the village very annoying.\n\nSecondly, worker tracking is almost nonexistent. You can assign workers to different jobs and buildings, and unemployed workers will supposedly follow the generic orders you give to harvest, build, transport, etc. But there is no broad overview for your worker placement, so when your village grows in pop size, it again becomes extremely tedious trying to figure out where your workers are assigned, which ones can be unassigned, etc. All you can see is a total number of employed vs unemployed, which isn't helpful when you need to make large decisions or rearrange worker assignments on a larger scale.\n\nThird, the task queueing is a mess. There are 4 prio levels - none, low, medium, and high. This is supposed to make it so you can more or less dictate which actions happen first, second, third, fourth. But without an explicit task queue that you can manage, it's difficult to track exactly what workers are going to do before they do something else. This becomes very frustrating when you are dealing with a crisis situation (poisonous plants that spread very quickly and need to be removed ASAP for instance), and your workers just seemingly ignore your high priority tasks for some unknown reason.\n\nI really like the game's aesthetic, I just think it needs some serious QoL features in terms of gameplay before I can actually enjoy it, which is why for now, I can't recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1663778424, "timestamp_updated": 1663778424, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482120811939239502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122589131": {"recommendationid": "122589131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198975081233", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1053, "last_played": 1664195892}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and unique gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1663777562, "timestamp_updated": 1663777562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122586762": {"recommendationid": "122586762", "author": {"steamid": "76561199238032482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 330, "last_played": 1691746638}, "language": "english", "review": "incredibly good although its hard to keep villagers alive in the desert", "timestamp_created": 1663774283, "timestamp_updated": 1663774283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122585139": {"recommendationid": "122585139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065951386", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1663852593}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first game I've played in quite a while after watching video's on youtube.

Because it is really, really stupid. Amicable, but boy is it stupid. But let's start at the beginning:\nThe game basically drops you with a little background story onto Onbu. Further story has not been implemented yet. So you ride this big doofus and try to make your living while satisfying its frankly quite humble needs.\nWith a catchy nice soundtrack and decent UI the game is entertaining while new research achievements keep you interested in exploring new options. While this is going on, although you have been the nicest you could ever have been to it, Onbu basically chooses to not obey you in the worst possible situations, running directly through every poison cloud and tornado he can find. It's like it's trying to get rid of you, but you hold on, you keep petting it and hope for the best.\nThe game is not too hard on easy, but you have to prepare for harder times. With mediocre decisions, you can lose and  poisoned plants can overwhelm you if you are ill prepared or not reacting quick enough. After all, it was not too hard to progress on easy mode and explore the game in its entirety.\n\nBeing in early Access, the game has it's flaws. While some production lines seem very unnessessary (Tree Nursery and Forester, you really don't need that much wood), other resources seem extremely hard to get by (for me it was stone, harvesting spikes and deep mining both hurt Onbu which at some point I really stopped caring about since the imbecile dinosaur doesn't listen anyway). The Onbu Constipator seems useless and just a bad tradeoff in comparison to the Energy Booster. The food pump really does not seem to give you any advantage since it's really not that hard to stack food and mushrooms while just flinging the food into it's kisser improves its mood. These are probably easy-to-fix issues.\n \nAfter 10 hours on easy mode I came to the point where I discovered all useful research, built everything I wanted, built the endgame milestone and the game had no further objective other to maybe research everything else. So i did that, 5 more hours went by and i am done having seen everything in the game. While having enjoyed the time, that's a bit too little. But it's early access and there's a roadmap, promising some story, better interaction with Onbu and I am really looking forward to it!\n\nAfter all, I loved my asinine Onbu (even if it didn't love me) and look forward to play it again when it's a bit more polished, since the gameplay was good and fun!\n\nPS: I love my Onbu, no Onbus were harmed in the making of this review.

It is kind of expensive, it took me 10 hours to play, NOT rushing, and I was mostly repeating the same experience I had 1 hour in. \n\nFor some reason a recent development with games, that they have a wonderful idea, and world, but they feel like a little snapshot with no lasting gameplay. That are just atmospheric and artsy get the mind going but ultimately just seem to provide an empty base for fans to imagine more upon rather then a fulfilling game.\nWell it's quite laid back but there's just not enough for a construction sim or make-your-village-perfect type play. And there aren't many events and there really aren't many onbu animations or other interactions for it to be more action oriented either.\n\n-No story mode. \nI think my biggest let-down feeling is there's sort of a lack of lore. In fact I built a monument and the elder popped up and said THX 4 PLAYING EARLY ACCESS, talk about breaking my bubble of immersion. I thought if I was going on it'd get harder as I went, that was the feeling I was getting anyway, and that survival would be rewarded by finding out a linear story. There wasn't any, and the game has low value to time played.\n\n-Low worldbuilding (Some spoilers)\nThere's not much interaction with your lil guys, you don't get to see any different outfits and art of them or pictures of them doing their adventures when you send them scavenging. Lots of potential for it to be so cinematic and feel like I'm playing Nausicaa or witnessing an epic. Also every \"secret\" I come across is vaguely onbu related, what about other creatures and worldbuilding? It's more like somebody said \"hmm what's in this world.. oh yeah, onbu, that's it\".\nI love the elder's design with his lil beard coming out of the mask, I would love so much to see more character, learn more, see them develop vehicles, know if they go scouting with gliders or something, or even have more land on the onbu's back, encounter more interesting other groups of people, you know what I mean. Scout tower was even unimpressive, it's not really taller then some of the other buildings. Maybe push their alternate world tech further..\nNot really any moral choices, gain nothing really from saving extra people etc, people don't have events or do anything interactive or just unique either. They're not really simulated people. You could be totally evil and nothing would happen except maybe the onbu is a bit mad. No options to choose to try enslave it, or commune with it (Just make it happy, it doesn't speak or have any spiritual significance beyond what you pretend to give it.). No villager thoughts, births, marriages, celebrations, you know. They don't do anything funny or random or cool or atmospheric like Rimworld or other games you might imagine them similar to.\n\nThat said I do enjoy it but similar game that came out and I had the same issues with, atleast had much more content to burn through/collect then this one and a more cohesive aesthetic vibe with more music and cutscenes and variety of graphics... so it's kind of an in-between recommendation from me. I waited sooo long for this game, I was so excited and I want so hard to support them and like this! But there isn't even a lot on the roadmap and it was all stretch goals.\n\nThe short;\nNo reason to hate it, love the idea, get it! But don't expect much bang for buck. It isn't buggy but still lacking a lot of content, character or story.

Gives it all kind of a whimsical paper-doll look amid the 3d rendering of Onbu itself. The art style was what caught my interest first.\n\nOngoing Development: Early access games get a bad rap sometimes, I think. This game has a great dev team, and a solid roadmap. I believe that when it's finished, it will be fully worth its price tag.\n\n***The Meh***\nStory: Currently nonexistent. There's a little lorebook that explains game mechanics, but no real depth at this stage in development. (More story is planned, however)\n\nGameplay: Honestly? It's a little thin. Solid for what it is, but once you've figured out a decent priority system, it only takes 1-2 hours to really get rolling. Many colony sims have an early-mid-lategame staging for development, but right now The Wandering Village kind of goes from early to done. There's no real 'endgame.' I hit a point where I had no interest in further research because using the buildings would hurt trust with Onbu, and I was able to survive just fine without them. THAT SAID -- the devs are very communicative, with a clear roadmap.\n\n***Pricing Fairness***\nAt this stage of development, I probably would have priced this at $20 max, not $25, but bellyaching over $5 on what is clearly a labor of love with a great team behind it seems silly.

The mechanic to basically keep your mount \"alive\" is interesting, there's a lot of different buildings you can utilize and the \"world map\" feature in which you can basically send out scavenger squads to harvest resources (like in frostpunk, for example) is good and fun and. The building system is also quite simple and not very complex, which might be a plus for many people, personally, I'd prefer a little bit more depth.\n\nI did have a lot of fun with the game, but there's also major gripes:\n\nFirst of all, while the \"keep your mount alive\" part is interesting, it's also unnecessary - you have to feed the thing once every 30 minutes and that's it. I've build the doctor hut for it and not once did I have to use it besides healing a poison once, and I could've just not done that. It's a badly balanced mechanic that doesn't really serve any purpose and just occupies a handful of villagers, you have to manually turn the buildings on and off to free them so they can do something more useful.\n\nSecond, the graphics. While they are not bad by any means and the creature you're riding on is gorgeous, the village and the villager itself are all 2D and this vastly downgrades the visual fidelity. I don't know why they made the decision to create the game in 2D - potentially because of a small team and not enough resources to create a 3D or at least 2.5D game, but it's a major factor that really rubs me the wrong way.\n\nThe last problem is simple - content. You can finish a run in about 3 - 4 hours. Your last task is to build a big statue that costs a few advanced resources (which you should honestly have at the end of the run) and then it basically transforms into endless mode. The problem is that every run feels roughly the same. The map doesn't change, the biomes don't change - you start the same way every time and there is no variety. That's vastly different in other games in the genre - again, I use frostpunk as example. Frostpunk has edicts, so you can alter the ideology of your town. You can be a highly christian authoritarian that basically creates the nazi-vatican that forces children to work in coal mines or you can become the benevolent mayor of your little ice city.

The way Onbu chooses to go, the map, the events, and the layout for the top of Onbu will all be different. When you start a run, you get to choose from three difficulties. Bringing me to my first tip, choose novice if you are unfamiliar with colony simulators.\n\nThis is a fun game, but it can be challenging. Poison sucks. It spreads quickly, and you need to get rid of it fast. There is a way to stop the spread, but you must research the necessary things first. My second tip is to start researching as soon as possible. There are three categories to research: Village, Resources, and Onbu. The more you play, the easier the game will seem.\n\nMy third tip is to pay attention to your colony and Onbu. My first and second runs ended because I paid attention to the poison spreading on Onbu too much. I thought that my first run would end because of the poison spreading causing all of my villagers to die, but it did not end that way. My second run felt a lot easier than the first run.\n\nI also tested this game on the Steam Deck, which works and looks great. Many. if not all, of the controls, are already configured to work with the Steam Deck. The touchpad and all of the buttons do something in-game. If you choose to play this on Steam Deck, you will have to play around with the game to get a feel for it, but then you should have a good time.\n\nMy last tip is to follow the directions on the right side of the game. It will teach you how to play and advise you on what to do. This is not a tip, but I like to start by setting up a road from the start of Onbu to the front.\n\nOverall, this game is fun challenging Colony Sim Roguelike. The visuals and artwork are great. You can zoom in on the map and see the village in its full glory, which is one of the coolest things in this game. It is also in Early Access, and I expect the game to get better.\n\nFind more reviews from me on my Steam curator page:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/41065644-Jimi-Reviews-Games/\n\nFind more Steam Deck reviews from me on my Steam Deck curator page:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/42800057-TreeofEmber/\n\nHere is the YouTube video of my first impressions of the game:\nhttps://youtu.be/_pfCchR2f38", "timestamp_created": 1663579957, "timestamp_updated": 1663582122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122474444": {"recommendationid": "122474444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056215932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 946, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 515, "last_played": 1692522559}, "language": "english", "review": "Please make a way to confirm spike removal to avoid accidentally hurting Onbu and feeling awful!!\nI'M SO SORRY ONBU\n\nHad a great time with the early access game, crossing my fingers for more content/achievements/story line in the future.\n\nP.s.

Worth the price of admission at this time but will be curious how the developers manage to provide a lengthier experience having more or less shown their cards at this stage in a ~10 hour experience.\n\nI think this game has some great ideas and I was quite entertained until the end. It's in early access but it hardly trips over itself at all and, importantly for me, it's very easy to just open and play without needing to go find youtube tutorials or anything. Gameplay wise I thought it was a fun mix of frost punk and other colony management/survival games like rimworld. There are some interesting ethical situations that feel akin to some aspects of the child labour frost punk narratives: unfortunately I never felt like I was forced to make any truly hard decisions or compromises  as the game seems to pull it's punches and provide alternative mechanics which allow the player to just avoid these entirely.\n\nHaving said that, there are some decently interesting decisions that you have to make and the process of balancing 3-4 different systems triggered that colony sim enjoyment part of my brain.  I'm not sure how much they could add to lengthen the game experience and have it be different enough to be interesting so I'm curious how feature-full it is at present vs their vision of the end product. Overall I'd say it's worth a buy and playthrough if you enjoy games in this space.\n\nPlayers with a deep background of playing colony sim games who are curious about innovation in the genre will have an enjoyable experience but are unlikely to replay this.

"review": "This is a great city management game with other game aspects sprinkled in. You manage your people, resources and buildings like many other city builders...but in this game the very land you live upon is alive and must also be tended to. Your living vessel named Onbu must be taken care of; he has a health bar, can be poisoned and it gets tired and requires rest. As such you have a symbiotic relationship with your host and you can perform actions such as mining giant rock spikes to gain stone, at the cost of hurting Onbu, thus lowering its trust in you. If Onbu has high trust in you then you are able to give it commands, telling it to walk, run, sleep and more. This is beneficial in many cases, especially if you need to get through a dangerous area quickly.\n\nThere are currently several biomes with more planned to be added. Biomes affect many things including crop growth/decay speed, humidity (for water generation), poison level and more. It can be challenging pivoting between which type of crops you are growing and how you obtain food & water based on your current biome.\n\nThere is a researchable skill tree that is currently modest but will surely grow as this game is in early access. \n\nAnother feature I like is you can create a scavenging team that will visit more distant POIs and can acquire resources for the city. This also sometimes allows for \"side quests\" where you get to choose from a list of options that can affect the outcome and resources gained.\n\nCurrently I have a little over 12 hours into the game so far and have not seen a single bug. \n\nAll in all this is a very well made game and you can see the love that has been and continues to be put into it. 5/5 from me, as far as an early access game goes.

Having to take care of Onbu as well as your villagers puts an interesting twist into gameplay. \n\nPros:\nI really enjoyed the toxic plants effect, since it can get out of control very quickly and requires you to make quick, sweeping decisions to control the spread of the infection. Things can get very harrowing very quickly depending on how unlucky you are - I had a toxic plants effect then an earthquake right afterward in the early game which was definitely a fun challenge to recover from. I also never ran into any bugs or performance issues, and the art style is absolutely beautiful and unique.\n\nCons:\nMy biggest gripe is that the game could use some balancing. I played on the hardest difficulty and never really had too many issues. The hardest part of the game is getting established within the first 1 - 2 hours. Once you build a couple decontaminators + blie extractor, and get Onbu to like you enough to always listen to your commands, then the game gets pretty easy. Berry collectors/farms are ridiculously productive and I never felt like I was desperate enough to harvest blood or do anything to make Onbu lose trust in my decisions. To challenge myself, I just completely stopped using the hornblower because being able to fully control Onbu's actions is just too OP right now. There's also some sound issues - I noticed that the background music will sometimes just end abruptly rather than smoothly transitioning when you move into a different biome.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall a really unique, well put-together game with a ton of potential.

So you can imagine my initial apprehension to The Wandering Village, but I was tempted by the truly unique mechanic of having to coexist with a giant beast for your colony to flourish. I tell you now I was not disappointed. \n\nI began my first playthrough focusing entirely on industrial colony growth, the Onbu's needs became secondary and initially I had no problems with that. However, as the game progressed and I began exploring new biomes, it very quickly became apparent that the Onbu directly and indirectly affected the growth, quality and difficulty I encountered with my colony. At around day 50 my colony was lost to a massive infestation of poison plants despite dedicating most of my colony to decontamination. During my second playthrough I focused on Onbu-related buildings and by day 50 I had a flourishing colony. \n\nI've noticed that Onbu trust and overall happiness seems to directly affect the events your colony encounters, I noticed during my first playthrough I had knocked out a few of the Onbu spikes (sorry buddy) and the Onbu seemed borderline suicidal, meaning that it had skipped over a poison-free sleep spot despite being half full on the tired meter. The difference is subtle but vitally make a difference for your colony. \n\nThis mechanic is well-designed and well-implemented despite the cheeky difficulty change.

Back then when the very first time I saw the concept of the game I knew I was going to buy it on the first day. It contains already quite many things I like about such games like micromanaging, map and exploration constantly changing, food and population management of a sort, weather management etc. The game for me was a fresh air in the midst of recent survival games. The graphics is just OMG, I loved it from the moment I saw these tiny little hand painted creatures. \n\nThe only downfall I experienced is the length of the game. Since the new game menu clearly suggest to start with the lowest difficulty the game itself took like roughly 4 hours to complete... kind of disappointing. I mean I know what would I expect from a survival game? Just that :) A story, more lore, more twists and turns but this is an absolutely lovable baseline already!\n\nThis game can be turned to be quite an epic one! Later on maybe a multiplayer mode or multi Onbu mode should be introduced like you have to move the colony from one Onbu to another? Make a huge world map which you can see where you roamed the land already? Maybe a cartographer trade to follow your path? Adding continents and maybe a water based turtle like Onbu story part to transfer your colony? A storm that chases you to push you to a direction?\n\nHope this game will be a huge blockbuster on the long run! All in all I loved it! Don't let haters fool you!

I think it's very fun!! I have been playing this several hours a day for these past few days. There is a tiny bit of learning curve that was very fun to get through (for me at least). It totally reminds me of that one mobile game that I forgot the name of-- where you manage villagers and make them advance-- however!! The Wandering Village is SO much BETTER (for obvious reasons). I still get to get that satisfying itch of managing a village but now with better graphics, music, and a lovely new concept!

The villagers and architecture really adds to the world-building of the game, reminds me a bit of Nausica from Studio Ghibli. The diorama-like presentation gives a unique and easy-to-look-at perspective when playing the game.\n\nNow, as a city builder, the game isn't much different from other city builders aside from the travelling titan (Onbu) that you rely on to live. The research tree is bare bones and the world map doesn't have much to it which should be a point of emphasis since the travelling Onbu is the selling point of this game.\n\nBut I did enjoy my 17 hours in game. Achieving 100 days and 100 pop after a couple tries and restarts after understanding the mechanics better. The graphics are eye candy and pace of progression is great unlike other city builders/resource management games that tend to just snowball during late-game.\n\nOverall 7.5/10. I think the game still has room to grow but I'm keeping my expectations for early access low.\n\nJust an idea for devs if you see this. It's a long shot but make an End Game that has the villagers seek out a \"paradise\" in a treasure hunt-style system. Like the movie Wall-E or Waterworld where the characters must find habitable land in a post-apocalyptic world. But this would require a big overhaul to the map instead of being just North-South. The Onbu could also backtrack it's path so the player might have to run around in circles. The map should be big enough that the player doesn't accidentally just stumble upon the paradise. There should also be clues around the map that scavengers could seek out and a cartography system to document the path the player has taken. Like a said, a long shot but I think this would be my dream version of this game. Also veteran is too easy.

I will still recommend this game but it does need more content for me to play anymore. \n\nUpdate: Finished a 2nd game at medium level in 7 hours. Nothing new content wise just slightly harsher weather at higher difficulty.  Built a watch tower this game and wow! MUCH bigger range to send scouting parties. Had to build three scouting parties to keep up because range is so big. Collected all sand and mines from scouts and building monument was easy. Much easier 2nd time through with the learning curve over .. even at higher difficulty.\n\nInitial impressions: It's an ok game for early access. Hope this game keeps improving.  Do not regret buying it.  Built a monument which I consider \"winning the game\" within 14 hrs at beginner level. It's basically a research and resource gathering and allocating your workers game (wood, stone, food, etc). The twist with the game is that you are on top of a moving beast so your environment keeps changing (temp, water, poison). Once you figure out what buildings and workers do what it's not a hard game. If you prep for what you see coming there are no big surprises ... like run through the poison clouds and tornado areas so they ain't so bad.  Placing  buildings for efficiency so workers do not have to walk too far seems important in this game. Try and build up good stockpiles of water and food early to get you through the leaner times. Being able to control your ride becomes more and more important later in game (run, sleep, north or south). There is a little lag in giving orders and when the workers get around to doing what you want so you have to be planning ahead a little.

And that's how I reached 800 km, discovering my first big toxic forest, followed immediatly by a small one. I didn't think much of it at first, and just thought \"well, buddy will run through it and everything will be fine\". but I forgot to check how tired he was, and... well, long story short, he fell asleep in the second forest. and no matter how friendly you are, if your giant is exhausted, you can't ask him to get up to keep walking. So I could only watch as my entire map was getting ravaged by toxic plants. and that was the end of my first game. My previous save was back into tutorial...\n\nSo of course, my bad.
