At certain unlocks you gain \"cosmetic\" options, but until you get the wardrobe in your house you have to stop the session to swap your skin; also saw very little point in renaming the Princess, the Dark Lord renaming is \"meh\", and a lot of unlocks change your name posthumously so its nice that you eventually get to change your name yourself too. Oh, and I hate a certain jump in the game, it basically requires the stacking of a couple of enemy corpses and hoping that you either have as few items as possible (ie, just the sword to kill them) or that you manage to stack 3 corpses against a wall to reach that jump. Mandatory that you make this jump at least 2 times.\n\nAnnoyances aside, at 33% and 66% you unlock a compass and map (in that order) which work with the hint system, so you're not likely ever to be completely stuck in how to get more endings if you're not braindead.

It's an interesting, novel and somewhat humorous take on the puzzle genre. You're an epic hero, on a grand adventure to save \"The Princess\" from \"The Dark Lord\", a typical satirical, metanarrative about knightly damsel-in-distress narratives, which is not all too uncommon these days.\n\nReventure does little to reinvent the wheel in terms of themes, mechanics or video game narrative, and what it does, with it's boasting of 100(+) endings to discover is rather compelling and smirk-worthy... for about 2-3 hours, after which, the game becomes more and more obscure and the road to getting the remaining 50-60 (or so) endings becomes longer and longer, and the tedium sets in more and more as time passes, as you do the exact same things over and over again, sometimes make a mistake after having already played another \"run\" for five minutes and have to restart the whole thing by exiting to the main menu and getting back in again (or killing yourself in some way).\n\nThe game's humor is, as I described, only \"smirk-worthy\", never did I laugh or even chuckle. Though this, of course, is subjective. The game's main faults are with its tedium. At the beginning you get 25+ endings in about 40-50 minutes, and the sheer volume of them is funny and, again, novel. Novelty, however, is not quality. Adding insult to injury, the game does very annoying self-promo of the developer's promo Kickstarter campaign, and not stating what it's actually doing, before its too late and you've been tricked to driving up engagement with their page. I also find the boastful description of the game on the Steam store page poor taste at best, simply and purposefully egregious at worst.\n\n[h3]I Wish Pixelatto All The Best With Their Future Ventures.

And while there are unlockable shortcut/item to reduce repetitiveness, the unlock condition aren't easy or take some time.\n- Few endings and secret ending have very difficult requirements.\n- The trailer promise dynamic story. And while it's technically not wrong, the story feels barebone and it doesn't reflect that much of ending you've unlocked and other actions you took.\n\nThe ugly:\n* Rather than 100 endings (along with some secrets), actually it's 100 ways to die, doing crazy stuff or doing exceptional things. I also have mixed feeling about each endings, some gave me laugh, some surprised me while the rest isn't really interesting.\n* While the game is fun at the beginning, it gets boring after some time where i start to use guide/walkthrough after unlocking about 50 endings and stop playing after unlocking 71 endings.\n* Average pixel artstyle/visual.\n\nUnless you're being very patient and like repetitiveness to try new stuff or discover secret, i cannot recommend this game.

Reventure is a parody of Zelda, but don't get carried away by this, because although the game pretends to be a parody, it doesn't have the remotest similarity. Reventure has 101 endings which are achieved by dying, yes, dying, what did you expect?\n\nIn Reventure your objective is mainly to die in all possible ways, you can die by drowning, by carrying a lot of things, by a rock, by starting a revolution, even by a DRAGON and etc. In the game there are many secrets and you can even run into the developers. To progress in the game you have to die in some ways to unlock new items and routes that will unlock more ways to end your life or get an ending without dying (something very rare). Every time you die you will unlock a related skin, if you die by a rock you will unlock the rock skin and like this there are many such as a princess skin, a cat, an old man, even a link with an anvil head and more.\n\nI had 100% of this game, but they updated it and I forgot to get the last achievement, but I assure you that I will take it back because it is truly worth it, if you want to laugh for a while and die in a thousand different ways, this is your game.\n\nEdit: Doing the review made me want to get the ending 101 and I already did, I have the ending 101 and all the extras done, I really recommend the game, you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1688200520, "timestamp_updated": 1689734707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515598416328430176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140995887": {"recommendationid": "140995887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075763042", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1695480001}, "language": "english", "review": "muito bom", "timestamp_created": 1688153120, "timestamp_updated": 1688153120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140873967": {"recommendationid": "140873967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105070055", "num_games_owned": 1519, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3170, "last_played": 1687991823}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little indie game!

I think going for the goal of saving the princess once is probably a good way to end. It was also very enjoyable to discover more of the world while I hadn't fully explored it at first, and it does feel cool to become an expert of navigating the world as I collected endings.\n\nThe mechanic of having items take up a weight is very interesting as you have to think about how you'll navigate in a session to get a particular item combination you need. Sometimes the order you grab these items will be very important too. The issue with this mechanic though is once you know how to get a certain item combination you know you need, the act of getting those same items for a new session is basically the same. \n\nThis issue also applies to general world navigation as you always start at the same point. It's not fun to repeat the same exact actions just to get to a certain point, to do something slightly different just so you can collect a new ending which had a journey with exactly the same steps as another ending.\n\nThe game gives some useful shortcuts and conveniences as you collect endings, but one I especially found useful felt like a grind to get to. The ending themselves are funny little paragraphs which is perfectly fine given the number of endings, but some of those useful unlocks could have came in earlier to reduce some of the padding.\n\nRegardless of some of my negative points, this was a unique and memorable experience, and when I was getting to new parts, of the world, finding new items and solving certain problems, the game was really fun.

Aside from that, it sorta kinda feels more like running to different endings and decisions in a choose your own adventure. As you play there are new coats of paint you can put on things, but it doesn't change that the game feels like there's little to no challenge aside from navigation.\n\nEven though these are flaws I had a very fun time playing just for the jokes and the 'I wanna try this' factor. As it stands while I write this, in the store it's like seven bucks which is almost fair.

Content warning for pixel blood and injuries played for laughs, and some language and mildly suggestive humor; I'd give it a PG-13.

There are also some jump scares, which can be toned down by choosing the game's Relaxed Mode; blood and other hijinks remain.\n\nThe game's aesthetic is all about lighthearted retro charm. Be aware that the actual music differs from that of the trailer; its instrumentation is reminiscent of Sega Genesis games, and its style suits a comic RPG well. The visuals are exactly what you see in the trailer. During the game you can collect different appearances for the player, both by way of endings that cause amusing injuries or character-changing plot points, and by rescuing characters from other games who make cameo appearances in this one.\n\nThe object of Reventure is to collect all the endings; there are about 100 of them.

Platforming is of pretty standard difficulty; the real challenge is puzzles/finding endings (You have to figure out how to get to certain areas with certain items to trigger various endings).\n\nYou can only pick up a certain amount of powerups (like flight, hookshot, bomb, sword, etc.) and every time you die you start over with an empty inventory. Each item you pick up makes you heavier (you can't jump as high) so you can't just pick up everything (you lose access to certain areas but there are often workarounds: instead of jumping, you use the hookshot to reach the same area).\n\nSome endings also permanently change the world (which allow you access to new areas and endings or create shortcuts so you can skip some travel). To avoid excess grind you may want to use a guide somewhat early on to do endings that give shortcuts and then later on to find obscure endings.\n\nExample endings:[list]\n[*] [spoiler]AFK in the

convierte en algo m\u00e1s entra\u00f1able, seg\u00fan la curiosidad del jugador, si tienes un mal d\u00eda o crees que tienes mala suerte, este juego te har\u00e1 cambiar de opini\u00f3n aparte de entretenerte.\n\n[h1]Destacado:[/h1]\n\nLa variedad de finales, la forma c\u00f3mica en la que se pueden obtener resulta algo absurdo, en el buen sentido por supuesto, nunca sabes de donde vendr\u00e1 el golpe, adem\u00e1s de disfrutar como todo se desbloquea a tu alrededor, los puzzles, los personajes que adem\u00e1s de los que puedes rescatar, el workshop te permite aumentar dichos rescates, la forma en la que todo se conecta entre s\u00ed, hasta romper el objeto m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o, el mundo de reventure es enorme.   \n \n[h1]Puntos negativos:[/h1]\n\nLo \u00fanico negativo que tiene a mi parecer es en cuanto a las mec\u00e1nicas de combate, al tener solo una forma de matar a los enemigos que no resulte en un final, podr\u00edas usar algunas de las armas que tienes por el juego y ver que resulta de ello.\n\n[h1]Resumen:[/h1]\n\nEs un videojuego bastante adictivo, me atrevo a decir incluso que cuando estas con ciertos pensamientos innombrables este juego puede ayudar a que se te pase de a pocos, el completarlo al 101% es otro nivel de genialidad, la forma en la que se te va dejando pistas de c\u00f3mo obtener todos los finales me hizo sentir en una b\u00fasqueda del tesoro,

"language": "english", "review": "A lovely game about exploring a 2D world and using combinations of items to trigger events before repeating the process (with a few things unlocking as you do more events).\n\nThe world is about the right size given the amount of time you'll spend going through it. Nothing is too spread out, but there is a lot in it densely packed. It's nicely designed in that it is interconnected, but different paths will be available, or inaccessible, depending on which gear you've picked up on the way.\n\nIf you think \"will doing xyz unlock an ending?\", it probably will. Half the puzzle is working out what you can do that you haven't already done yet. The other half is in working out how to do it, which is sometimes easy, but sometimes requires working out how to get from A to B with the right items, and not too many items, as the more you hold the less you can jump. There are usually multiple ways to get between places, but only one or two that make sense if you want specific gear (or lack of!) at the other end, or to be able to make the return trip.\n\nAs you explore, you will find hints that give clues about endings you haven't done yet. Some are more vague than others but they are pretty well done (plus some other things that you unlock, which I won't spoil) and mean you shouldn't need a guide in general (except maybe some of the post-game content).\n\nHumour is well done, and riffs on classic video game plots and logic in a fun way. All tongue in cheek and keeps things brief. The fun is in finding out all the endings, which sometimes have a twist to them.\n\nMy only criticism would be that you have to do certain things a lot of times, and sometimes aren't sure if it'll be worth it. Not really a problem at the start as you have lots of low-hanging fruit to do, but it can be a bit of a grind toward the end. I still enjoyed it and got did everything, playing basically non-stop in my free time since I got the game.\n\nI definitely recommend this, unless you hate the idea of what I just described, or don't like 2D exploration/puzzle games or hate jokes.

Indeed, the world and your possibilities evolve as you unlock new endings, and new items and new paths become accessible. Starting the game, I had fun discovering new endings every time I had a new idea in mind. The devs have a good sense of humour and use it openly at every opportunity. The level design is very well thought, so that each of your moves (picking up items, given interactions) opens or closes the available paths, and yet so many different endings/paths can be reached in this world that is, in the end, not that big.\n\nHaving hints dropping on a regular basis is really welcome to avoid the unnecessary blind search of remaining endings when closing in to the 100 endings. Although their helpfulness is really heterogeneous...\n\nBut I'd say at some point it starts to become a little bit too much. Yet another \"endless\" corridor that will either troll you or give you a new ending, yet another silly joke, yet another hill where you should have come with less items so you could climb it... The humour and the game design are ok for a few hours but towards the end I got an overdose. Additionally, the platform side of the game is very easy. Any difficulty you may find lies in finding new endings, or the ideas leading to them. So if you have an achievement guide, you won't have any problem reaching the 100%.\n\nSince Steam asks me blue or red, I have to say blue since I kept playing until I completed the game.

This is a pretty sweet game. Why, you ask? Mainly because it feels that almost no matter what you do, the game is prepared for it and gives you a coherent, bespoke response. That's why there are 100 endings.\n\nTo give you an example of the ridiculous stuff they predicted: you can stab the princess. You can become the king's hot femboy sensation. You can break the space-time continuum. You can have sex with the princess (this is an European game, no prudes here). You can engage in cannibalism. You can have babies with a rock.\n\nAfter a while, you will probably start running out of ideas - and in order to beat the game, you need to get all 100 endings. But no worries; there is a helpful hint system, which most of the time will give you an idea of what you're supposed to do, and where.\n\nOn top of that, the world is very interesting to explore, and coming up with ways to get past obstacles is very fun. Usually it involves figuring out how to get this particular item to this particular place - not as obvious as it seems. It reminded me a little of \"Dizzy\", an old game on the NES, or Jet Set Willy on ZX Spectrum. In fact, I'd call this game a \"Willylike\" - not quite metroidvania, but more than a platformer. Other Willylikes would be VVVVVV or You Have To Win The Game, so if you played those, this should give you an idea of the game flow.\n\nWhat's fascinating is that the game doesn't look particularly good - the pixels are huge! - and the soundtrack is pretty average. But the game as a whole still manages to be amazing, purely because of the creativity involved and the interesting world. I also noticed that the positioning of the platforms is actually very meticulous; the more you carry the lower you can jump, so it seems like it would be easy to get stuck - but the game is pretty good at preventing that from happening. There is always a way out.\n\nWith all that said, I have some complaints. Getting the final 10 or so endings was a bit of a chore, and I had to look things up online 3-4 times in total. A certain mechanic about jumping is never explained, I had to notice it by accident, and knowing it is crucial to beat the game. And finally, I had to write stuff down on a piece of paper - including drawing my own map (there actually is a map in the game, but it's not what you'd expect). But I had fun while doing it - although not everyone might.\n\nFor the asked price, this game is an absolute steal - and a very unique little gem to boot. Big recommendation from my side.

The inventory system is also clever, because the more items you have the less you can jump, adding another layer of strategy.\nThe map is small and a single playthrough is usually short, but this is where the multiple endings come in. The main objective of this game is getting all 100 possible endings, ranging from dying to different stuff, killing NPCs, interacting with certain objects, finding secrets, skill challenges, etc\u2026 It\u2019s a lot of endings, and most of them are funny. Also, every ending is tied with a Steam achievement!\nUnlocking endings unlocks some skins and makes small changes to the world, some cosmetic, others giving you a small advantage, so you\u2019re always feeling you\u2019re doing progress. After that, there\u2019s a nice amount of post-game content, where you must do various, harder tasks to get extra completion, and getting everything done will give you another bonus ending.\nYou can see it was made with passion, and there are a lot of jokes and references. There\u2019s even a mechanic where you save NPCs from cages, that will automatically unlock them by subscribing in the Steam Workshop.

Every location has it's own look and unic style, that emphasized with own colour palette.\n\nAnd the cons:\n[list]\n\n[*]Well, at one point, when the endings for which you have to do almost nothing will run out, there will be those for which you really have to bother and spend on an attempt for like 10 minutes. Naturally, it will be extremely disappointing if these 10 minutes of progress will go nowhere because you fell on spikes or like that. Briefly, I'm talking about the fact that there are no saves before endings, from which you could load and continue playing, and not turn getting the next end into a routine. In general, the game can become a routine, every time you go for a sword, then for a shovel, then for a hookclaw... it's unrealistically tiring. Of course, there are shortcuts that open when you do some specific actions, but they are not really save you from repeating same actions.\n\n[/list]\nSo that's it. There is nothing more to say, I think, so... my advise to you is play this game, c'mon, it's worths its 1.5$\n[i]Fun to play, good music. For several evenings, it's 9/10[/i]\n\nthanks for reading", "timestamp_created": 1656048348, "timestamp_updated": 1662437178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577099978923797607", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117494335": {"recommendationid": "117494335", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986997483", "num_games_owned": 832, "num_reviews": 307, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1688703672}, "language": "english", "review": "This reminds me a bit of the old Kongregate flash games.

You have to replay the first few screens over and over and over again looking for new ways to die.  That's basically what the puzzle is, you have to find ending in the game.  Most of them are ways to die, but there are a few others.  There are several different ways you can deal with a dragon, for instance.

It's not so bad after finding the first dozen or so obvious endings\u2014it's even really fun at first experimenting what you can get\u2014but going for the rest gets extremely tedious as their requirements get more complicated or farther away from where you start the game, and the cheap humor from each one isn't really worth it most of the time; it's even possible to mess up a \"playthrough\", making you start over completely to try again for whatever ending you're trying to reach.\n\nIn addition to the tediousness and mostly cheap humor, there's also the matter of the developers advertising their Kickstarter game to you every so often in-game to the point that they can open up your computer's web browser to advertise it.", "timestamp_created": 1653481675, "timestamp_updated": 1653487096, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49328574538230896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115893302": {"recommendationid": "115893302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040972093", "num_games_owned": 988, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1653513566}, "language": "english", "review": "1/25 very fun, only a little repetitive. \n", "timestamp_created": 1653309603, "timestamp_updated": 1653309603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115812849": {"recommendationid": "115812849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130562194", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1653868491}, "language": "spanish", "review": "11/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1653172392, "timestamp_updated": 1653172989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115704981": {"recommendationid": "115704981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254657627", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1653076139}, "language": "english", "review": "this is one of the funniest games i have ever had the pleasure of playing", "timestamp_created": 1652992978, "timestamp_updated": 1652992978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600442171096801758", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115652717": {"recommendationid": "115652717", "author": {"steamid": "76561199152838926", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 397, "last_played": 1681570616}, "language": "english", "review": "better than pizza", "timestamp_created": 1652898650, "timestamp_updated": 1652898650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115618829": {"recommendationid": "115618829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285851625", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 694, "last_played": 1652832064}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny, witty, and edgy.

Completionists will find a very rewarding experience for a low price, but players that aren't will more likely find a test in patience.\n\n[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Reventure[/i] is a comedic adventure/platformer about a wannabe hero who goes on a quest to rescue a princess from the fortress of a dark lord--or who gets himself killed trying to reach the princess, or does get the princess but gets her killed on the way back, or maybe just ignores the whole \"princess\" thing entirely and runs off to take on some other random quest and/or wreak havoc across the kingdom for no good reason. The game boasts an adventure with 100 possible endings, tons of puzzles to solve and secrets to uncover, and a world that can change with each new ending you discover. It's an ambitious concept for a game, and for the most part it's handled very well--but it's not a game that I think is a good fit for everyone.\n\nGameplay for the most part is rather simple, with the goal being to explore and interact with everything you can find in order to achieve those 100 endings I mentioned before. Some endings are quick and simple, mostly there to pad out the ending count--for example, there's almost a dozen that boil down to just \"stab these different NPCs with your sword\". However, [b]many endings involve some pretty inventive puzzle-solving, and unlocking all of them will require you to learn the game inside and out[/b]. Each ending also comes with a unique end card and (re)opening dialogue joking about how your last run ended and how you inexplicably wound up back at home despite it. It's good for a few laughs, especially when endings can also alter your character model in silly ways, like falling in a pit of spikes and coming back with a bunch of those spikes still stuck in your tiny pixellated body. Much of the game revolves around meta humor and parodying the adventure games of the past, and while the jokes didn't always land for me, it gave the whole game a certain charm that I found endearing. Games that focus mainly on this kind of meta comedy have been hit or miss for me in the past, as they sometimes focus more on making cheap jokes and less on making an actually fun game. I was hesitant going in because of this, but I'm happy to say that I was worried for nothing--[b]a lot of time and care was placed into [i]Reventure's[/i] gameplay/map design, and it shows[/b].\n\nDespite the small size of the world, the team at Pixelatto filled it to the brim with clever secrets such as hidden rooms, easter eggs, and many fun ways to abruptly end your journey. One of the things that stood out to me the most were how many secret paths between maps could be found, and how those became a critical part of late-game progression. One of the main gameplay mechanics is simple inventory management: you can only hold a certain number of items during a run, and most have weight that will reduce your jumping ability with each new item you grab until you practically can't jump anymore. Every path is designed in such a way that you must either stay below a certain inventory size to manage its platforming segments, or have specific items to circumvent them; and picking up any item has the potential to close off one path and open another. This created an element of strategy to later runs, as I had to carefully consider which of these pathways I could use with the combination of items I had so I could meet the requirements for a new ending. Because of this need for strategy, [b]I found myself really appreciating the subtle design decisions throughout each map, and it made the process of full completion feel that much more rewarding.[/b]\n\n[i]Reventure[/i] was fun, but my enjoyment did falter from time to time while playing. [b]My main gripe was the constant backtracking, which can make the core gameplay loop a bit of a drag at times.[/b] Every time you get an ending (new or repeated), you're sent back to your starting home stripped of all the gear you picked up in your last run, meaning you have to recollect any desired gear from its resting spot every single run. Much of the puzzle design revolves around being able to start fresh each time, but it does get tiring retreading old ground after a while, especially if you accidentally trigger an old ending while trying to work on a new one--a mistake you will make many times. Some endings unlock shortcuts that make this backtracking easier, but there's no way of knowing in advance which endings will provide these shortcuts, so you may only unlock some of these long after they would have been the most useful. It wasn't a big enough issue to stop me from finishing the game, but I couldn't fault you if the repetitiveness of the gameplay puts you off of seeing it through to the end.\n\nGetting all 100 endings, as well as completing the post-game content, took me about 10 hours to accomplish. While there are laughs to get out of the writing and artistic/mechanical design elements to appreciate throughout, most of the sense of satisfaction you get from playing comes from the process of unlocking all of the endings. I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard completionist, but I enjoy going for all of a game's achievements or that \"100% Complete\" save file if I feel that it's reasonably possible to do so. Getting the most out of this game requires that you go in with that kind of mindset, but if that's not your preferred way to play, I don't feel like this is a game that you'll enjoy quite as much. [b][u]Put simply, [i]Reventure[/i] is designed with completionists in mind--you will almost certainly like it if you are one, but may not be able to look past its repetitive nature if you're not.[/u][/b]\n\n[quote]For more game reviews, check out my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42524563/]Curator page[/url]![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1651453350, "timestamp_updated": 1656102326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114791342": {"recommendationid": "114791342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155580781", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 818, "last_played": 1649889140}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game!", "timestamp_created": 1651425775, "timestamp_updated": 1651425775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114790804": {"recommendationid": "114790804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202124704", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 641, "last_played": 1698881310}, "language": "english", "review": "Game good, game funny and quirky, very entertaining yes.", "timestamp_created": 1651425104, "timestamp_updated": 1698881372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114756735": {"recommendationid": "114756735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354493881", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1652070808}, "language": "english", "review": "a very fun game with a lot of funny endings and easter eggs that actually effect the game.", "timestamp_created": 1651376518, "timestamp_updated": 1651376518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114742912": {"recommendationid": "114742912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131933268", "num_games_owned": 662, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 152, "last_played": 1684019347}, "language": "english", "review": "i dont think i beat the game yet", "timestamp_created": 1651353373, "timestamp_updated": 1651353373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114696516": {"recommendationid": "114696516", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044612557", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1158, "last_played": 1651284710}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game worth paying full price and completing.

I've just paid you, to be fed your advertisements and improve your metrics.

The game is premised as a choose-your-own-adventure story where you are incentivized to find every possible ending - there is just as much challenge in finding all the possible ways you can lose the game as there is in figuring out how to actually win. The game's puzzle mechanics do a good job making you question what is and isn't possible - items weigh you down as you collect more of them, decreasing your jump height, blocking some areas from access, and eventually crushing you to death if you pick up too many. A large part of the game is figuring out whether there's a way to smuggle certain sets of items to a specific part of the map, which can often be a very interesting puzzle to work out in your head. It feels great when you can find a route that works because it rewards a thorough knowledge of the game world. There are a few mechanics that I felt could have been communicated more clearly - it would have been nice to have a visual component telling you how weighed down your character is, since it's not entirely clear which items increase your weight and which don't, and the fact that you can break leaves with the sword isn't terribly well communicated, but besides a few nitpicks like these, I found the puzzle solving to be very engaging.

Not a bad one, but not a great one either. As i wrote previously, i would rate the game as \u2018mostly positive\u2019.\n\nFirst of all, let me clear up some things because the tags and description on the store page are somewhat misleading. Reventure is not an adventure game or even metroidvania. Instead, it\u2019s more of a puzzle game with simple platforming elements. \n\nYes, the basic premise of Reventure is indeed that you play as the hero of the story, who has to rescue the princess from the castle of the dark lord, because the king requested your help in the matter. But that\u2019s pretty much as \u2018deep\u2019 as the story gets. \n\nMost of the gameplay resolves around exploring the in-game world, collecting different items and using those on different NPCs or to access different regions of the map. Ultimately most actions trigger an ending of some sort. The game will then play a short cutscene, you\u2019ll respawn in the hero\u2019s house and have to restart, more or less, from scratch. Some endings unlock new skins for your hero, others mildly change the in-game world or even unlock shortcuts. Most endings, however, have very little impact in the great scheme of things.   \nThere is a grand total of 101 different endings which you can unlock as the game progresses. Overall, this makes the game feel more like a puzzle platformer or collect-a-thon rather than a traditional adventure game.\n\nFor the first 5 to 6 hours of gameplay, this isn\u2019t an issue. Initially you will most likely enjoy the retro graphics, the catchy music, the snappy controls and so on. You will play around with different items and unlock various endings. \nThe Writing and humor are often on point. Reventure made me laugh out loud several times because of unforeseen twists or goofy endings. The game also breaks with genre conventions and lets you experiment to some extent.\nThis is the portion of Reventure, that i would rate as \u2018Very positive\u2019. I had lots of fun while unlocking the first 30 to 40 endings. \nAfter that point, however, it all went downhill, the flaws became more and more apparent (and also annoying), the simplicity started to work against the game or at least didn\u2019t do it any favors. \n\nAt some point, you start to realize that there isn\u2019t much depth to the platforming and the combat. \nThe \u2018combat system\u2019 is especially bland. The only enemies i encountered during my playthrough were little, purple minions and the Dark Lord himself. With the minions, the combat boils down to spamming your sword attack and killing them in the process. Or you can avoid them and simply jump over them, like you would in a Super Mario game. \n\nThe endings become more complicated and lengthy. Which isn\u2019t that bad, because you can kind of rely on the in-game hint system to give you... well, hints that point you in roughly the right direction. But they are also fairly cryptic, so there is still a bit of trial and error involved. \nKeep in mind that you have to restart from the hero\u2019s house every time you die or get an ending. Even if you unlocked it previously and only triggered it again by mistake.\nEffectively, this means that you\u2019ll lose 5 to 10 minutes of playtime every time you screw up. The fact that you have to repeat many steps several times for multiple endings, doesn\u2019t help much either. \nYou\u2019ll have to collect the same sword, traverse the same mountain, collect the same fricking grappling hook dozens of times. Just because so many endings utilize them in one way or another.\n\nThis is, combined with the simple mechanics, a huge drawback of the game. Most of the time, there is zero suspension while you are on your way to unlock the next ending. After a while you know exactly where all the stuff is located, which screen you will traverse and what awaits you on your journey. There aren\u2019t any moments where you think \u201cOh man, that one enemy is tricky, will i be able to beat him on this run?\u201d or \u201cThat one platforming segment is tough, how will i deal with that?\u201d. Most of the time you simply go through the motions, unlock a (more or less) funny ending and simply start the next run.\n\nAlso, Reventure has this mechanic where every item that you pick up lowers your jump height. So you really have to learn the layout of the map and which items you need to pick up in which particular order or you might soft lock yourself. Which often times means that you\u2019ll have to reset your run and start again, from the hero\u2019s home.\n\nMost of the NPCs are very bland and unremarkable. You can\u2019t talk to them much, they don\u2019t offer you any quests, you can\u2019t trade with them, the possible interactions are very limited. Overall this makes the world feel strangely static and somewhat lifeless. \n\nReventure isn\u2019t very challenging. Unless you go for achievement #101 which ramps up the difficulty big time. \nSuddenly, the game expects you to clear a tricky platforming section. You only get one shot at this per run. So if you mess up, you\u2019ll have to reset your run. In this specific case, this means you\u2019ll have to travel through half of the in-game world for each try, which takes 7 to 10 minutes of your time. \n\nI would recommend the game, but only to specific types of gamers. Obviously, streamers and youtubers can milk Reventure for a couple of streams and episodes and simply move on.\nIf you don\u2019t care about completing a game, it might also be worth your time and money.

I got roughly 68 of the endings in 6.3 hours, and expect it'll take another 6 or more to figure the others out without cheating.  Played using a game controller.  Difficulty is medium.  \n\n- Gameplay is pretty smooth.  You go around collecting items, and each item you collect limits your ability to jump higher but gives you different paths to travel.  On the game controller two buttons jumped and two opened things/swung the sword/did the thing.  \n\n- There are so many callouts to other games in the universe of gaming that it's hilarious in its own right.\n\n- The music is legit.  Get the OST.  It's got the retro gamer vibe.\n\n- At first everything started out a little repetitive.  That was until I realized you don't necessarily have to get the sword, or give a crap about your character, and then it turned into solid, sadistic fun from there on out.  \n\n- Reventure comes in, what, 12 different languages?  \n\n- The map of the game is insanely creative.  There are parts I want to discover that I haven't yet that I really neeeeed to reach but I haven't figured out what combo of items to do it or path to take yet.  \n\n- After playing a copious amount of time, hints become available that help you find endings so you don't have to cheat using a guide, you cheating wannabe cheater, you.  \n\n- There are different pallets to play with later in, but only two didn't nuke my eyes.  \n\n- The game comes with five million sprites for your character to unlock.  Or however many.  it was a lot.  \n\n- Got it on sale for 2 bucks (and the ost for another 1 or 2). Unsure if I would've paid the full 8 bucks for a satire game.\n\n* Epilepsy warning - The game comes in two modes at the start.  Choose the less scary one.  Most of the game (in safer mode) I had no problem.  There was one ending or glitch or something with minor black&white fast/scattered pixelblinkies that I came across, that I didn't have the wherewithal to write where outside of 'this happened'.  \n\n\n\nI like that Reventure exists.  It's the sort of game you play when you want something different than the atypical 2d platformers out there, and is especially fruity ripe when you've played many other popular 2d games on steam and understand all the cameos.  The layout is genius-level creative.  It does start out a little repetitive, but if you play without giving a crap to the order of things and just doing whatever to explore (and wreck your game using) the area/items around you'll have a better time.  But that said, I did eventually burn out after a few hours and need to take a break.  Unsure if I'll come back later and make the attempt at all the endings.  Probably?  Maybe?

Las colocamos en un bol grande, donde luego vamos a mezclar con el huevo y a\u00f1adimos sal al gusto. Removemos bien y reservamos.\nElegimos nuestra sart\u00e9n m\u00e1s grande y antiadherente.

El tema del grosor de las patatas tambi\u00e9n va a gustos. Hay quien prefiere cortarlas a trozos muy peque\u00f1os, en l\u00e1minas muy finas que casi se rompan al fre\u00edr y o m\u00e1s bien grandes.\nMientras se est\u00e1n friendo las patatas, en el bol donde luego vamos a echar las patatas batimos los huevos, reservamos. Pelamos la cebolla y cortamos lo m\u00e1s fino posible.\nEn otra sart\u00e9n calentamos aceite de oliva y a\u00f1adimos los trozos de cebolla. Pochamos hasta que tenga un color dorado, que tenga un punto de caramelizaci\u00f3n pero sin llegar a quemarse.

Si ten\u00e9is en la nevera cebolla caramelizada o la quer\u00e9is hacer, sustituid la cebolla pochada por la caramelizada. Quedar\u00e1 impresionante.\nQuitamos con una espumadera de la sart\u00e9n, dejando las patatas con el menor resto de aceite posible, bien escurridas. Si no queremos nada de aceite extra podemos emplear un colador grande. Las dejamos escurrir y luego las introducimos al bol con la cebolla y el huevo.\nReposamos la futura tortilla durante 15 minutos para que se junten bien todos los sabores. Pasados esos minutos esta mezcla ya est\u00e1 deliciosa, probad a tostar un poco de pan y a\u00f1adidle una capita con esta mezcla, incre\u00edble.\nEn la misma sart\u00e9n en la que hemos frito las patatas y una vez retirado el aceite.

I think I'm pretty qualified to write a review at this point. The game is great. The humour is lighthearted and silly, The puzzles are fun. The difficulty of finding all the endings is spread out well between easy,medium and difficult endings. And it doesn't just do some sort of \"1-30 easy, 31-60 medium, 61-100 hard\" type thing either. So you'll always feel like you're progressing but still have harder ones to chase. \n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple but that's ok since the game is constantly kept fresh with new areas, environment changes and items. I feel the store description might be a bit misleading though. This isn't a roguelite. I've  seen someone say that this is basically finding 100 ways to die. That's not true either. While death does play a large part in many ending epilogues, if you want to call them that, the methods in which you discover endings are quite varied and not just a matter of being killed/killing yourself in different ways (though you'd be surprised by how creative you have to be for some deaths anyways). \n\nNow, two important things about this game:\n\n1) So, the point of Reventure is to find all 100 endings, as it says on the store page. It takes a certain type of person to do that. One important fact about this game is it has highs and lows. An obvious statement as every game has these, but it is much more apparent [b]and important[/b] here. The speed & ease at which you find endings is going to determine how fast or slow (and consequently, good) the game feels. Initially it'll feel like you're zooming ahead at lightspeed, but that's only because you can't go anywhere without stumbling into an ending. And that feels great. You'll also experience this as you unlock new items and areas. \n\nBy contrast, the game feels notably slower when  you've seen all there is to see. It feels somewhat frustrating when you've done everything there is to possibly do.....except, of course, that's not quite true because you'll still have more to unlock. To be honest though, the frustration factor isn't too bad except when you're nearing the end. That's mainly because you have all item possibilities opened up to you at that point AND there's a very large space in which you could possibly go through to get the endings. \n\nThere's also a degree of repetition as you have travel more to gather items or enter areas and you try new things only to get an ending you already got (or lock yourself out of/in an area). \n\n\n2) The thing with Reventure is that the game world doesn't change. Well no, that's not true. It does change, but the change isn't too radical. You won't suddenly unlock a new map. You will, however, unlock new areas over time. Although there is definitely notable change as you progress, much of the game is static (e.g., the area where you find treasure #3 is going to look the same by the end of the game as it did at the start). Because of this, I don't think Reventure is the kind of game you can power through over a weekend. As mentioned in earlier there is a degree of repetition. [b]Reventure is best enjoyed when it is spread out .[/b]  I'd recommend doing it over a few weeks. Two or three hours a week (maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less) is probably ideal.\n\nThat's it. This type of game isn't for everyone. If you can accept the puzzle-platformer nature of this game and all that comes with it (as mentioned above, i.e., the latter part of this review), you'll find it is a unique, silly, fun game that's worth your time. \n\nFor those who buy it, I have one tip: Use general puzzle solving techniques to find endings when stumped.  Come back to it later, try looking at things from a different perspective, pay attention for any possible clues visually, textually,etc.", "timestamp_created": 1640485763, "timestamp_updated": 1640969733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106534655": {"recommendationid": "106534655", "author": {"steamid": "76561199032157641", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1653864525}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si", "timestamp_created": 1640477768, "timestamp_updated": 1640477768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106461410": {"recommendationid": "106461410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240274862", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 799, "last_played": 1640394115}, "language": "english", "review": "nice little short game. for 1,50$ it is an absolute steal.

So that makes you have to find multiple paths to get around this small world.  The result is the perfect size when mixed the game mechanics because it makes the world bigger. There is a lot of repetition at first, but a lot of that goes away as you unlock more stuff and shortcuts. The game also has a good sense of humor.\nI didn't know I wanted this game until I played it, and I loved it (I got it in a bundle and so I checked it out). I texted my friends to tell them about this game while I was playing it because I couldn't believe how good it was. I like short games (because I can actually finish them). This one only took me about 10 hours to beat, but then I spent extra time unlocking skins. I wish I had something like this for the GameBoy Color or the GameBoy Advance back in the day.

It has you running around a vibrant and quirky world looking for various \"endings\" the player character Tim can experience. That's why it's called Reventure: After getting an ending, you start back at your house and start searching for the next ending. There are 100 endings in total and so many secrets that it would be a serious hassle to list them all here.\nThe endings that you can get are so varied and often pretty hilarious, and I am amazed by the level and world design of the game. As you explore the world you discover new paths to go, new items to use, which in turn make new endings and paths possible. That and the more items you carry, the lower you jump, meaning there is a certain puzzle element to the game as well! It's incredible how the devs were able to cram so much content in this little world. Also, the world actually changes when you get certain endings!\nWhile you do have to backtrack a bit to get certain endings, the game does an awesome job giving you shortcuts and new paths to cut down the time to find new paths. The music itself is basic, but does capture the vibe of the game very well.\nOh, and if you can't find certain endings, there's a map and a compass that can help you, although the compass doesn't really help at all sometimes, only the hints that you can find scattered across the world.\n\nI do not know what this game could have done better.

The humor is chuckle worthy, no doubt, but the way the game presents itself in this aspect is kinda exaggerated. There are jump scares, unexpected endings that made me laugh, but some of it was just internet lolz jokes we've heard 1,000 times.\n\nThe 100 endings are mainly finding ways to die or approaching a discovered ending with a different item or strategy. After a few hours the game became stale and I lost all interest in progressing. It started off strong, but just became tiresome and mundane. Unlocking skins and being able to change your name isn't enough to save the situation, and the puzzle aspects of item usage come down to simple trial and error which isn't very satisfying for my preferred style of game play.\n\nDespite how much I'm ripping this game apart, I'm sure there are plenty of people who would love exactly what this game sets out to be.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1625619060, "timestamp_updated": 1625619060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543217122554779053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95178897": {"recommendationid": "95178897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198894525288", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1003, "last_played": 1655933400}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1625577308, "timestamp_updated": 1625577308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95151109": {"recommendationid": "95151109", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122094001", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 407, "last_played": 1625784034}, "language": "english", "review": "is fun", "timestamp_created": 1625540511, "timestamp_updated": 1625540511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95135467": {"recommendationid": "95135467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073411042", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1625854223}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and funny", "timestamp_created": 1625519805, "timestamp_updated": 1625519805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95068540": {"recommendationid": "95068540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158452809", "num_games_owned": 747, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 679, "last_played": 1625439490}, "language": "english", "review": "Certainly one of the funniest games I have ever played!

I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.\n\n\n\n\nI fucking hate JoJo. Every subreddit I go through has a vermin-like underclass of JoJo fanboys. They all just have to say \u201ciS THat A JOJo ReFErEncE??!!!1\u201d on every fucking post that contains a single word that may have been used in the shitty comics. Oh, a suspicious link? Probably a rickroll. NOPE!!! They\u2019ve ruined that, too! One of the oldest goddamn internet traditions shat on and ruined by JoJo fanboys. Thunder Cross Split Attack! So fucking funny, right? I\u2019m wheezing! NO. SHUT THE FUCK UP. Nobody cares about your shitty comic series. Dio is a stupid character from a stupid comic series. I downvote every post and comment that mentions JoJo, out of pure bloodcurdling rage. I want to detonate a MASSIVE thermonuclear warhead right on top of whatever godforsaken studio publishes that stinking-pile-of-trash comic. Frankly, I don\u2019t even care for the civilian casualties, either. At least they died for a good reason. Unlike JoJo fans, I actually contribute to the betterment of mankind, instead of spamming shitty references on the internet. Every JoJo fan that dies a slow, painful death is a win in my book. I have claimed over a dozen of them already, too. I annihilated their skulls with my fists. Their stupid ice attack didn\u2019t do shit for them either. They dies like they lived, pathetic excuses for humans. I hope more people hear my message and declare war on JoJo. If nobody helps me, I will do as much damage as I possibly can before I die.

The humour was for me the best thing of the game and the creativity went into the making of this game is astonishing!\n\nYou can tell that a game is incredible when you put 17 hours total to unlock ALL endings, even the hardest ones! I never bother to get all archivements with any game but it was different with this one! I got all endings and it felt amazing!\n\nYou can complete all endings without a guide. Some are reaally difficult and you will need so much \"out of the box\" thinking but that's amazing! This game has so much love! It was such a nice surprise!\n\n(skip to the other paragraph to avoid minor spoiler here)\nShort spoiler alert: I only needed to search the solution of the Wisdom room challenge in the climb of the highest tower and one ending in the Protoventure mode! So really minor moments aside I think if you try enough you will be able to archieve all endings by your own. PD: Use the hints and all the further tools that the game will give you (map, compass)\n\nContinue HERE to avoid spoilers:\n\nIn conclusion I think this hidden gem is a really masterfully crafted one! I don't have any complain. It's a fully enjoyable ride! We need more games like this one today! With great humour, increible level desing and the most important, with love and fun from the beggining to the end!!!! \n\nOne of the nicest surprises in my 2021 towards gaming!

And as you go on, more stuff unlocks for you to bump into, where there may have been nothing before, some random object or creature may pop up there.\n\nOh yeah, this game has some jumpscares too, thankfully the devs were kind enough to include an option to turn these off & and a few other things such as flashing colours and so on, A very very nice thing to have and im sure alot of people will really appreciate it being a thing you can toggle\n\nFor playtime you will probably get 5-8 hours of playtime for 100%ing the game, theres quite alot to do but when you learn where things are, it can start to speed up a little!\n\nThe gameplay overall is fantastic, With few few things to complain about and new content and interesting things popping up all the time, You never know what you may find or accidentally bump into, you can really pour HOURS in just, running around and seeing what you can find!\n---\nA few more smaller things\nMusic:\nVery nice catchy tunes that don't get repetitive\nEfficiency:\nThe game runs very well with lag non-existent runable on nearly any computer!\nPricing:\nFor $5~ you get great value! A nice game to pickup if you want to try a new game for a low price, Really worthwhile to get this game whenever it goes on sale\nMisc:\nAlso includes twitch integration for streamers!\n---\n\nOverall review:\n9.2/10\nEverything about the game is amazing, from the art, to the music, to the jokes, with little to complain about.\nA really fun little game & i'd LOVE to see a sequel someday!\nHopefully this review helped deciding wether you will enjoy the game or not : )\nThanks for reading.\n", "timestamp_created": 1619744904, "timestamp_updated": 1619744904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870843231678009033", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91141294": {"recommendationid": "91141294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204747327", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1619867266}, "language": "english", "review": "just get it", "timestamp_created": 1619738872, "timestamp_updated": 1619738872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499999970197677612", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91139688": {"recommendationid": "91139688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198428604820", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 91, "last_played": 1619742489}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u2874\u2811\u2844\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u28c0\u28c0\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28c0\u2840\n\u2838\u2847\u2800\u283f\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u2874\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28e6\u2840\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2811\u2884\u28e0\u283e\u2801\u28c0\u28c4\u2848\u2819\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c6 ta bueno\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2840\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2819\u281b\u2802\u2808\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u287f\u28bf\u28c6\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u287e\u28c1\u28c0\u2800\u2834\u2802\u2819\u28d7\u2840\u2800\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u282d\u28a4\u28f4\u28e6\u28e4\u28f9\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28b4\u28f6\u28c6\n\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28ee\u28fd\u28fe\u28ff\u28e5\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2882\u2814\u289a\u287f\u28bf\u28ff\u28e6\u28f4\u28fe\u2838\u28fc\u287f\n\u2800\u2880\u285e\u2801\u2819\u283b\u283f\u281f\u2809\u2800\u281b\u28b9\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cc\u28a4\u28fc\u28ff\u28fe\u28ff\u285f\u2809\n\u2800\u28fe\u28f7\u28f6\u2807\u2800\u2800\u28e4\u28c4\u28c0\u2840\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847compralo\n\u2800\u2809\u2808\u2809\u2800\u2800\u28a6\u2848\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28e4\u28fd\u2879\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2832\u28fd\u287b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28dc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28ee\u28ed\u28fd\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28c0\u28c8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff", "timestamp_created": 1619736103, "timestamp_updated": 1619736103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91128493": {"recommendationid": "91128493", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994870098", "num_games_owned": 1056, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1619731588}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for crude humor, retro game satire, and lots of achievement hunting, this might be for you.

What makes this game different from Super Mario Bros is that there are 101 possible endings in the game, which are extremely varied, creative and funny. You unlock them by exploring and interacting with the game. Each time you unlock an ending your character changes their appearance according to the ending. The environment changes too, allowing you to unlock new endings, or simply saving time. For example, after getting the sword a few times in the mountain, someone leaves the sword in your house so you don't need to go there for it. The gameplay is solid with zero bugs and loads of secrets, the art and music are enjoyable too (the ost is 10/10).

Saving the damsel and bringing about world peace by slaying the evil overlord? Reventure does what it does best, subverting the standard tropes and boiling them down into one-off jokes that evoke a hearty chuckle when you stumble into the obvious endings. Or a tiresome groan as you shoot for the last obscure endings that require specific steps and tools to find.\n\nBefore I point out my own gripes with the game, allow me to mention the good bits. The hundred endings are all unique and some of them did make me laugh or were fairly obvious to find. The pixel art style, while simplistic, is pleasing to look at. The many visual design choices like lighting and colour helped a lot in creating an atmosphere for several locations. The controls were fluent and accidental slip-ups or falls were mostly due to other mechanics making it difficult to navigate the terrain or my clumsy hands slipping from the d-pad.\n\nThe mechanic where picking up an item lowered your jump height was a nice touch, if not some source of frustration at certain points in the game.\n\nFinally, for a cheap dollar-store game the world is oozing with content. Not just the standard endings, but a prototype game with its own eight endings, an optional climbing challenge to unlock said prototype and other post-content discoveries that were actually fun to get.\n\nNow on to the weaker elements of Reventure.\n\nThe \u201ccomedy\u201d is hit or miss. Using a mixture of referential humour and surface-level observations to spark a laugh. Some jokes managed to make me chuckle, others left me with barely a smile.\n\nGiven that the game has a total of a hundred different endings to find not all of them can be a breeze to get. About a third of the endings require a specific route, which means travelling and collecting the necessary items in a specific order and hoping you don't mess any of it up. Or, as is sometimes the case, stumbling into a different ending by mistake.\n\nMany of the endings also require similar elements, such as facing the dark lord with various items or saving the princess in a variety of ways. And while some of these endings aren't too bad to get to, having to walk the same path just to interact with the same NPC but with slightly different gear made it a bit of a chore.\n\nIn the end Reventure isn't anything revolutionary, but a nice time waster if you've got a buck to spare.", "timestamp_created": 1619183794, "timestamp_updated": 1619183794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90665088": {"recommendationid": "90665088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198449971170", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 579, "last_played": 1618904389}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a comedy puzzle game based around finding all 100 ways to fail at a short quest.

Your next character is technically the same character, except he's now a boneless mass of flesh that flails about through sheer willpower alone.  There are no new abilities or gameplay differences depending on your current look, sadly, which I think is something of a missed opportunity; still, it's worth finding new endings just to see what it does to you next. \n\nFor only $8, Reventure is definitely worth your money; people who are into secret hunting or 100% completion will get the most mileage out of the game, but even if you don't intend to plumb every secret the game has to offer, it's still fun trying to figure out what kind of outrageous bullshit you can pull off next, and whether the game will treat you to it with an ending that shows the developers knew you would try that outrageous bullshit.", "timestamp_created": 1616964417, "timestamp_updated": 1616964417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89192794": {"recommendationid": "89192794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322796665", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 795, "last_played": 1623508214}, "language": "english", "review": "Two words: Amazing game.\nThis game is amazing.

Nobody draws pixels this sharp and chunky unless they genuinely intend to, it does not happen by accident. I didn't always enjoy the game but it delivered absolutely everything it promises.\n\nSo, you wake up. You're a hero. You go get a sword from the local cave. You decide to stab the old man who gives it to you. That's an ending. You get a unique cutscene.\n\nYou wake up. You do not grab a sword. You grab a stack of bombs instead. You plant a bomb and sit on it. You die. That's an ending. You get a unique cutscene. You wake up as an ambulatory pile of ash in the shape of a man. New skin unlocked.\n\nThat's two out of 100 endings. I'm not spoiling any others. Every item you collect is a verb, to be rubbed against every noun in the game or enable you to get to other verbs you can bash against other nouns.\n\nThis is a frighteningly well-laid-out game, every time I thought \"Surely THIS is a softlock\" I discovered that, no, there was in fact a secret passage out of the jam I was in or a clever way to use items to bypass it. There's a LOT of secrets in this thing and if you want to genuinely complete the game you're going to need to become intimately familiar with them all.\n\nThe humor of this game can feel mean-spirited at times. Getting all the endings requires a lot of shameless murder, and a willingness to do absolutely suicidally stupid things for the sake of an achievement and some pithy text. Like old Sierra adventures, half the fun is casting about and inventing new ways to die, or seeing what the latest game over animation is. That's great, I respect that. I didn't always laugh at the joke but I loved the process of getting to each one, mostly.\n\nI say mostly because by the time you're down to the last, call it 25-ish endings you'll probably know exactly how to checkbox each one OR you'll be completely in the dark as to what the game wants from you. Happily, collectable hint scraps are plentiful, and there's a wiki off-site if you really need it.\n\nYou can also grab new skins from the Steam workshop or find them dangling in cages around the game world. (Even ones that, uh, are playing a bit loose with copyright. When I wrecked one of these and the Black Mage from Final Fantasy dropped out, I had a very \"what?\" reaction. Still cool though.)\n\nI feel like this game would probably appeal most to explorers and achievement-hunters. When you're down to that last clump of items on your checklist and you're facing the slog of walking around the map doing things in a particular order AGAIN just to get another stamp on your card, it can be fatiguing.\n\nStill... yeah, on the whole this is pretty great and I'm looking forward to whatever this team does next time.", "timestamp_created": 1615570274, "timestamp_updated": 1615570274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708643853664398193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88287538": {"recommendationid": "88287538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196285734", "num_games_owned": 1213, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 728, "last_played": 1617090726}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the most amazing, fantastic, and funny games I have had the pleasure of playing.

I felt I needed to give an unenthusiastic positive review because it\u2019s exactly what this game needs. I really can\u2019t give it a negative review, that would be dishonest.\n\nReventure has a really good humor. I laughed way more than I usually do when playing a game. It\u2019s filled with cute references and homages to gaming.\n\nThe goal of the game is to find all the 100 endings. The length of a run from the start (waking up from bed) to an ending is between a few seconds and a dozen of minutes.\n\nIn a way, it\u2019s a puzzle game where you have to figure out what could constitute an ending and how to trigger it. This sounds frustrating, but it\u2019s really not: all endings are very easy to figure out, and the game gives you  hints (albeit sometimes very obscure.) You\u2019ll basically have to think a few seconds before every run and plan how you\u2019ll get to the end, which path to take, which items to take etc. There is no skill involved, the game is better for it, since this would have removed from the great focus of the game (the humor).\n\nThis is much closer to a DLC Quest than a Rogue Legacy. Though it\u2019s way longer and more subtle than DLC Quest.\n\n[b] Problems [/b]\n\ntl;dr too much repetition, some confusing puzzles.\n\nThe iterative nature of the game has problems though: You\u2019ll end up going through the same 1-2 minutes paths dozen of times. You get shortcuts, but depending on the order you unlocked the endings, it will be way too late and you won\u2019t need them anymore. Plus, the shortcuts are only of relative help, because most of the time you\u2019ll need specific items to get new endings, so you\u2019ll have to go get them before using the shortcuts.\n\nOn top of that, there is always one or two puzzles that will baffle and confuse you, even if the puzzles are all easy. Which will be frustrating.\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\n\nI maintain, this is a good game. Although it expectedly deteriorate the more you play it. I\u2019m satisfied and had a fun time playing it. But I won\u2019t 100% it because the late game is more tedious than fun.", "timestamp_created": 1613380627, "timestamp_updated": 1613386641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

y combinarlo con un juego de \u201c100\u201d finales distintos, puede salir algo muy memorable, veamos de que va Reventure.[/i]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]+Contexto del juego: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Desarrollado y distribuido por Pixelatto, un juego popular en streamers, tiene un gancho atractivo que es los 100 finales distintos, esto atrajo muchas miradas.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]+Historia: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Es la t\u00edpica historia de un h\u00e9roe que tiene que salvar a la princesa del villano en turno, pero con varios cambios, depender\u00e1 de ti c\u00f3mo ser\u00e1 la historia (los finales que obtengas afectar\u00e1n a la partida).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]+Gameplay: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Es un juego de plataformas y puzles, con muchas combinaciones y decisiones, a partir de aqu\u00ed veremos los 100 finales, todo depende de ti. Ahora les dir\u00e9 algunos ejemplos: si agarras la espada y matas al rey\u2026obtendr\u00e1s un final, si agarras la espada y matas a un guardia\u2026 obtendr\u00e1s otro final, si obtienes la pala y cavas en un sitio prohibido\u2026obtendr\u00e1s otro final; entonces de esta forma obtienes muchas opciones, adem\u00e1s como ya mencion\u00e9, algunas afectar\u00e1n a tu partida, tambi\u00e9n puedes desbloquear varios skins.\n[*]\u00bfJuego de puzles?

This is what keeps character development awesome and entertaining in this pixel world. \nThough I would like to play the game in real detailed graphics, I totally understand and enjoy the point of the decision to keep it pixel art. And the Devs did a really great job to play with it. \n\nAt the beginning it may look a bit frustrating with \"all that options\".

But nevertheless always funny and interesting. \n\nI dunno if there is a map in the guides. And I would give the advice not to use it if so. Because - like I mentioned earlier - the world is changing. And knowing about all the secrets will greatly take some fun away. Probably it would be good to have a finished map later in the game, when you are looking for the very last few endings. I did not play this far yet, so I don't know.

Unlike other metroidvania games which focus on slow forward progress, the goal of Reventure is instead to die over and over again. There are 100 different \u201cendings\u201d to the game, most of them involving humorous ways to get the hero killed. I have gotten about half of the endings so far, and have enjoyed the game thoroughly up to this point. The game does start to slow down somewhat as you progress, as the different endings start to get more and more obscure. It is very interesting how they chose to balance items in this game. You have a maximum amount you can carry at any one time, and the more you are carrying the less jump height you get. This prevents you from accessing other areas, and encourages the player to be efficient in carrying as few items as needed at any time. Reventure does quickly get repetitive, but it can be argued that is the entire point of the game. Overall I have thoroughly enjoyed playing Reventure thusfar and would recommend it to metroidvania fans with a sense of humor. Now if Pixelatto were to make a real metroidvania game with this same style, depth and sense of humor they could have a fantastic game on their hands.", "timestamp_created": 1606165713,

It's pretty short but sweet!\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\nThe central gimmick of Reventure is that you get a different ending for doing almost everything. Kill a soldier, get an ending. Jump off a cliff, get an ending. You get the idea. Obviously every ending can be considered a spoiler, so I'll refrain from telling any more.\n\nIt's a very, very simple platformer with incredibly easy controls. All you have are two buttons and the arrow keys, that's all! I played it with a keyboard and it was perfectly fine since the platforming does not require the precision and fluidity of a controller. Except for a few tricky sections, you can generally breeze through the game.\n\nThe real challenge is the trial-and-error method by which you have to play to discover various endings. Technically the game has very high replay value, since to unlock the 100 (or is it 100 at all? :P) unique endings, you need to play it at least 100 times. What makes each Reventure run enjoyable is that you're not inclined to do the same thing each run, so every run is as unique as possible.\n\nUnlocking various endings will also unlock some shortcuts, which will accelerate your quest to hunt MORE endings!\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\nIt's a simple story about rescuing the Princess who has been kidnapped by a Dark Lord. Or is it? I cannot say too much because that would (at least partly) spoil the fun of discovering the entire story. NPC dialogs and the endings themselves are smartly written, with the occasional dose of dark humor. With a game like this you kind of expect it to break the fourth wall, and in that front Reventure does not disappoint.\n\n[b]GRAPHICS[/b]\nInitially I was a bit put off by the 'big pixel' style. Admittedly, this style works very well for the game. A visually dense, cluttered style would detract from the fast-paced gameplay, because once you get addicted to Reventure, you will perform many, many playthroughs in one go!\n\n[b]MUSIC AND SOUND[/b]\nThe music is fine. By the time you 100% this game, you can hum almost all tunes in the game.\n\n[b]OVERALL RATING: 8.5 OUT OF 10[/b]\nTotally worth it if you like short, gimmicky platformers.

World is changing according to what your endings have been. New paths and items become available. You accidentally nuke stuff.  You reach the princess and.... weird stuff happens.  Luckily there are still laughs to be made but logistics is starting to be really something now as items need to moved long distances. \n- Endings 75+ it seems very few go this far. At 69% completed i see that only 14.6% people have got this far according the game stats. \n\nSo basically here is an indie game that is as indie as it can possibly get that gives you lots of good laughs but will put your stamina to test as it progresses. Don't even think about unlocking 100 endings just like that. It is a big chore but in small sessions it is worth it. I like the 'what happens if i try this/go there' thinking that the game forces you to do. I also personally like the world design.

After playing for 11 hours and getting all the endings/achievements, I feel confident in my decision to give it a negative review. This isn't to say it's a completely worthless experience, as I did rather enjoy my early hours of the game, but it got less engaging the longer I played, almost exponentially so. \n\nReventure starts out almost like a puzzle game, where you end up trying every wacky action you can think of in order to seek out different endings. Eventually, you get to a point where you can predict many of the actions which will provide new endings, and there's a clever hint collectible system which helps speed along this process. However, once you achieve a good mental layout of the map and start having to grind very specific actions to get the remaining endings, the game really begins to drag, becoming tedious and even obnoxious at times. I'd say I noticed this changed around the 75% completion mark. It was at that point that I was no longer having fun and only continued just out of an obligation to finish, with my opinion of the game rapidly diminishing. It was just too long for the type of game it was, and many of the endings required the same repetitive series of actions over and over.\n\nThe game is interesting, but never actually challenging until you start the grind for that last bunch of endings, trying everything you can think of within reason, at which point it's no longer fun. From the very start, the actual gameplay is absurdly easy, being more focused on comedy and exploration more than anything else, but when the jokes start to lose their effectiveness and you run out of new paths to take, it becomes a chore: a dull 2D retro platformer where you walk through the same screens hundreds of times to attempt some arbitrary task on the other side of the map. Eventually I was just begging for it all to end so I could move on to a game that actually requires focus and/or skill.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I can't blame those that like this game, and I'd probably recommend it myself if it were less bloated, but I strongly advise against playing it if you feel the compulsive need to finish your games, as you'll probably end up gradually despising it like me. You can add all the clever jokes, pop-culture references, character skins, and continuity details you want in your game, but after all those lose their charm, you're just left with another boring fetch-quest walking simulator. I'm glad I got it for free, otherwise I'd certainly feel ripped off.\n", "timestamp_created": 1600642908, "timestamp_updated": 1600642908, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639630317687988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76300273": {"recommendationid": "76300273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097035260", "num_games_owned": 1934, "num_reviews": 214, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1600651928}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the funniest games I've ever played.

To a large degree, that's exactly what Reventure is. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself drawn in by the surprising depth and level of craft behind the gameplay. The initial overwhelming nature of being presented with a (relatively) large world to explore where seemingly every action leads to a humorous ending begins to give way to a more strategic game where you have to pay attention to which areas can be accessed with which items, how to circumvent restrictions that would normally keep you from having a certain item in a certain place, how to use unlockable short cuts to your advantage, etc. The constant-restart nature of the game lends itself very well to experimentation and exploration without failure ever seeming too punishing, and the constant stream of new skins you unlock add a bit of visual variety that keeps things interesting.\n\nI had a lot of fun with Reventure. The hundredth ending was a great way to wrap up the experience, more so than the additional content that leads to the 101st ending. In fact, unless you're a real completionist I wouldn't recommend putting in the effort for that last achievement as doing so was one of the only frustrating parts of the game where tasks felt a little too drawn-out and punishing for their own good (when I unlocked a prototype version of the game with its own set of endings to unlock I started to feel like the concept was wearing out its welcome a bit).\n\nBut for the most part this was a pleasant surprise and an enjoyable experience with more than a few laughs.

It conveys to me that the game is some form of rogue-like. It's not. It's a Fail-simulator, like Kindergarten, or the Henry Stickman browser games. The goal isn't to die and retry until you find the right way to get to the end, its to discover all the wonderful ways you can fuck up royaly for shits and giggles, doing all the ridiculous things you originally try your best to avoid while playing a video game, \n\nNow that that's cleared up, this game is hilarious. The writing and comical execution of the.....executions, is laugh out loud funny. Gameplay isn't difficult or deep, but does require some exploration and out of the box thinking to get all of the endings, Some of which are admittedly tedious to get due to repetition and time. None are particularly difficult to figure out (Except ending #95 for me because I was overthinking it). \n\nThe only particular stain on this game is the tower of Screw You (my name for it). It too isn't insanely hard, but more so arduous to complete, being one of those \"you fail at any point, and you have to start all over\" type challenges where the challenges are deliberately made so that they can be easy to mess up. Thankfully it short, and again, not too hard, and at least the reward is somewhat worth while compared to other games that pull this BS.\n\nOverall this is a fantastically funny puzzler solver Fail-simulator with great exploration and writing, lots of secrets to find, and an endearingly pleasant art and soundtrack. I got this as a part of a bundle on Fanatical for 4$ that I wasn't even getting for this game, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it as I didn't realize I was getting such a great game.

And I'm going to keep coming back each day to get all the endings. This is such a well thought out design! In a nutshell, you have to find all the endings, to do this, you have to think outside the conventional box that is common to mainstream games. It's this breaking of the convention that makes me giggle. \n\nThere's a lot to say for such a simple, yet so ultimately impactful title. You will learn the world on a very personal level and begin to learn the mechanics and rules of the world all while learning about all the endings. It's cleverly worked out. One example of this is [spoiler]the weight mechanic.[/spoiler] The developers know that you're going to be greedy, so they know that 99% of players will find this ending very quickly. Once the player does it teaches them through failure (IMO the best way to learn anything).\n\nThat brings me to something so unique to this title. Failure is success. If you die, that's a good thing, as you've likely unlocked a new ending, which means you're closer to completion. Mind-blowing stuff, but again, the system is so simple, and I adore this!\n\nBuy it now! And begin failing to succeed!\n\n\nSeriously! If you want a laugh and a few hundred giggles, this is the game for you.

You are tasked with discovering all the different possible endings to your story.\n\nAlong the way, you discover items that can help you overcome certain obstacles, like a shovel to help you dig, a sword to help you fight, etc. The gameplay is mostly platforming oriented with very little combat. Outside of the first 10-15 deaths, each ending is similar to a puzzle, where you need to discover all the ingredients for this specific scenario. While this can begin to get frustrating, the game avoids this by randomly spawning hint scrolls for you to find. They give a short hint about 1 undiscovered ending. It ensures that each hint is useful and progresses the game, without completely spoiling the fun of discovery. There are some items you can find that give you new ways to explore levels, giving some variety to the platforming.\n\nEverything in Reventure is centered around finding new ways to die. Visually, this manifests in the form of certain deaths unlocking costumes that thematically fit with the outcome. The art is fairly simplistic pixel art, but the gameplay tends to distract from the graphics, so it doesn\u2019t really hurt the overall game.\n\nThe sound design isn\u2019t anything special, but it does its job. The sound effects and soundtrack are decent, but fail to stand out as good work.\n\nThe game\u2019s writing is often funny and interesting, even if it falls flat a couple times. The plot is essentially one giant, branching storyline, and surprisingly, it all fits together pretty well.\n\nRepetitiveness is Reventure\u2019s biggest strength and weakness. At its best, the game has you exploring new, yet related, ways to end the game. It\u2019s fun to see all the different possibilities. Yet the big problem is that doing for this for too long makes it boring after a while. This game is best played in short bursts over a long period of time. You always start the game the same way, so you never need to get caught up with what you forgot.\n\nOverall, Reventure uses its unique idea perfectly, creating a great adventure loop. The presentation isn\u2019t the best, but the gameplay makes up for it easily. Strongly recommended to adventure game fans who are looking for a fresh take on the genre.\n\n8/10\n[quote]\nVisit our [url=https://www.mmmreviews.com]website[/url] for more in-depth reviews and recommendations\n[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1596377736, "timestamp_updated": 1596377736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53399956226348877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73634939": {"recommendationid": "73634939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246789932", "num_games_owned": 1654, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 2087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2041, "last_played": 1606078468}, "language": "spanish", "review": "INDESCRIPTIBLE CON PALABRAS, se explicaria con sensaciones\n\nel amor que agarre por este juego es inmenso <3\n\nReventure es de esa clase de juegos que no te das cuenta la cantidad de horas que jugaste hasta que miras el contador en la biblioteca, y cuando dejas de jugarlo, disfrutas recordar lo EPICO que fue y porque duraste tan poco para jugarlo :C\n\nes un juego que es tan extenso como vos tardes en encontrar los finales, que cada final es un logro\n\nfue tanto el cari\u00f1o por este juego que es uno de los primeros que complete al 100% \n\nel punto fuerte del juego esta en el trailer: 100 FINALES! y cada final tiene una mini cinematica que tiene la mejor clase de humor que vi en un juego, y cuando volves a reiniciar, aparece otra introduccion, igual o mejor que la cinematica del final, asi que tenes 200 momentos en los cuales (por lo menos a mi) me dolia la panza de reirme\n\nDISFRUTE cada final! pero mas disfrute el camino que me llevo a encontrar ese final, la mayoria de los primeros por serendipia (de casualidad), algunos son por intuicion; aunque es cierto que llega un momento en el cual ya no sabes que mas intentar... pero ahi es donde el juego reta a tu paciencia y tu perseverancia: CUAN PORFIADO PODES SER POR CONSEGUIR UN FINAL!? en mi caso muy mucho jajajaja\n\nel final numero 100 es UNICO! uno de los mejores finales que conozco, pega un giro en tu perspectiva que al dia de hoy todavia me sorprende lo bien pensado que esta\n\nel JUGABILIDAD es sencilla: saltar y usar un objeto a la vez, solo dos botones y la palanca del joystick o las flechas, pero lograr alcanzar todos las plataformas y secretos es tan dificil como si tuvieras que usar 10 botones\n\nlos graficos, obviamente pixelados, no son el punto fuerte de Reventure, pero ver personajes o referencias a otros videojuegos/series/peliculas hechos TAN bien en TAN pocos pixeles es gratificante. los paisajes no existen, los fondos son minimos.

Easy puzzle game in the form of an indie platformer. It's not super challenging since there's barely any combat, and so what that translates to is the game largely being about rewarding exploration and finding solutions to mild routing puzzles. Every time you start the game you start with nothing, and if you get an ending you restart from that static beginning. Different items allow the player character to reach different areas and different endings, but most items have a weight that reduce jump height, meaning there's a tradeoff and you get to have fun figuring out what combination of things can let you achieve the ending you want. Good graphics, mostly good humor, good music, and as you run up the ending list an appreciable but still pretty gentle difficulty curve that won't leave an interested player bored. My only real complaint about the game is when you're a bit deeper into it is that it paradoxically feels repetitive when you have to run and get the same items but for a different ending. You can't save before an ending, get it, reload, and go for a different ending either, which is a minorly disagreeable design choice.", "timestamp_created": 1596213857, "timestamp_updated": 1596213857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73525943": {"recommendationid": "73525943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143866538", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1597016518}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Yep", "timestamp_created": 1596133211, "timestamp_updated": 1596133211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73518474": {"recommendationid": "73518474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031619497", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 355, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1634880748}, "language": "english", "review": "enjoyable", "timestamp_created": 1596122513, "timestamp_updated": 1596122513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462724953889846802", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73462726": {"recommendationid": "73462726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156870634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1102, "last_played": 1597589875}, "language": "english", "review": "So much fun!

(which should give you an idea of how many people have sought to beat the game in full, or tried to.)\n+ there are no real \"failure states\" in this, which I don't think is inherently a good or bad thing. you could say that the failure state is getting the same ending over again, cuz that's a waste of time, but even when you \"die,\" you've made progress by finding a new ending. at the end of the day, I think that this is what's right for this specific game--it's more of a laid back, chill affair where you drop in and mess around with various item combinations.\n\noverall, I think this game is one of a kind, and very enjoyable. will definitely be attempting to find all of the endings over time. it's fun to jump in, find five or six, and then see you jump into a whole 'nother percentile of players.", "timestamp_created": 1595697587, "timestamp_updated": 1596311788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498480260372161865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73241664": {"recommendationid": "73241664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210649287", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1013, "last_played": 1595649581}, "language": "english", "review": "Reventure is most likely the best game I've played in a while.

"last_played": 1594012213}, "language": "english", "review": "Reventure is the kind of game you binge in one or two nights and then remember pleasantly, filled with fun references, a simple storyline and a \"do whatever you want\" style from the start that can be a little intimidating at first, but that with each final you unlock gets more and more easy to grasp and master. \nThe gameplay at it's core its extreamly simplistic and it's just a facilitator to get to see the different finals, which, at first, are extreamly easy and intuitive to get but get grindy and a harder as the number goes up. Getting the 100 finals is VERY satisfying and it actually kinda wraps things up pretty well if you get them in order, and i've yet to play the extra gameplay after the 100th final, so I cannot comment on that yet. \nAnother thing to note is that one would think that the game gets repetitive after a while, after all, it's the same map, the same npcs and the same storyline each time, but each final leaves it's mark on the map or on the player, making it a surprisingly diverse adventure from start to finish (the size and complexity of the map helps with that too, I've yet to fully understand the layout and ALL the secret tunnels and passages from one location to another). \nIn terms of art, the graphics are just your good ol' 8 bit adventure with 4x4 pixel faces, but that matches up the \"adventure kingdom\" aesthetic surprinsingly well. Good music that doesn't get anoying even while being the same 5-6 songs over and over again, and a pretty fun story with intelligent and witty writing.\nNow, on the donwsides, it can be really easy to get stuck because some endings rely on the player interacting in slighty different ways with the same npcs to the point where you're not sure if you've tried every interaction with every single npc and that can be a little taxing. Also the game doesn't explain anything, it expects the player to figure how everything works by themselves (wich you may expect, involves a lot of trial and error), this is not always a bad thing to some players who enjoy the challenge but for more casual people it can be a bit irritating wasting some time conducting experiments to see what works and what doesn't with the high amount of moving pieces the game has. Lastly, and in my own opinion, some of the \"longer\" finals felt a bit underwhelming after going through a lot to understand how to get them, as in, I would've liked bigger implications with getting certain finals whereas it felt like going through some trouble just to get a steam achievement.\nAll in all, fun experience, props to the devs for doing something fun and unique and recomended to anyone with 7-9 hours to just play a fun indie adventure game. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1594013569, "timestamp_updated": 1599068699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669443905353546143", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72135561": {"recommendationid": "72135561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063276964", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 118, "last_played": 1695398433}, "language": "english", "review": "Me: *Laughing my head off*\n\nMy Bro: \"Are you okay?

There are many different endings to this game, with the game \"restarting\" after each enging. Restart is in quotes because the map changes slightly after different endings. \n[h1] What I Liked [/h1]\nFirst of all, this game is pretty, The art style is cute and sort of retro. Also, after most endings, the player sprite/name may change. For example, Tim might drown in one ending, and in the next run you play as his son, Tim Jr, rocking a smaller version of the Tim sprite. Aside from the art style, the gameplay is also very fun. The gameplay loop goes like: \"Choose what gear to get around the map, Visit one of the many locations of the map, discover something you didn't see before, ending, repeat\". This gameplay may not be for everyone, but I personally loved it. It is so satisfying to plan a run and reach the ending you wanted to. Speaking of the endings, each one has individually written splash text describing your demise. This works really well. I mean, really well. The humor of this game is definitely one of it's strong sides, from funny dialogue to elaborate jokes across multiple runs. Another great part of this game is just how many options you have. If you find an item, and have a crazy idea of what to do with it, try it, because it is 99% of the time going to be an ending. For example, eventually in the game you get an item that lets you hug things. Yep, you can hug pretty much [i] anything[/i]. Also, it isnt like after you reach an ending, the map resets. For example, if you fall to your death, in future runs, blood can be seen at the point where you hit the ground. Despite all these positives, there are some negatives, however.\n[h1] What I Didn't Like [/h1]\nAs far as negatives go, I think they are few and far between. For one, there are many endings that involve \"doing everything for X ending, but change one thing at the end for Y ending\". There aren't many of these, so it isn't a very big issue though. As I mentioned earlier in this review, this style of game definitely isn't for everyone, and i'm sure many will find the gameplay repetitive, but I and many others loved this game, and I'm sure anyone who buys it will enjoy it too", "timestamp_created": 1593625356, "timestamp_updated": 1593625356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461689591407775879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71817548": {"recommendationid": "71817548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880486619", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1615575997}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely loved this game.

This is a \"completionist\" type of game, where you try to do literally everything there is to do in the game. This obviously attracts achievement type people. The game was finished, with 100 different endings, and by getting them all, you 100% the game itself. The problem is, now, months, if not years later, they added an extremely minimal amount of content, in the way of one \"final\" ending, #101. It's not simple to get, and requires you to be quite familiar with the game. But since I already beat the game a long time ago, and put it away, I don't remember it at all at this point, and there's no way I'm going to get back into the game, and memorize the whole map again, just to get that little one last bit. It's more annoying than anything. Adding content is great, cudos to the devs for continuing their product when it's been released for such a long time, but to ruin everyone's 100% completion of the game, just for that tiny bit of content, and then making it annoying to get... It just makes me hate everything about this game now. So know that, if you're planning on getting 100%, this is the type of dev that will ruin your completion of the game.\n\nEDIT: I'm now actually trying to go for the last achievement, and it's absolute garbage. Definitely not worth returning to the game. It seems part of it is literally walking around the ENTIRE MAP, cutting all the stupid grass... What is wrong with the devs here?
