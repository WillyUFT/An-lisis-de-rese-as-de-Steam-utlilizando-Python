There's also a lot to dislike, most of which comes down to the RNG. I know this isn't a new complaint about DD by any means, but I really thought it wouldn't bother me, since I've played a lot of tactical turn-based games and roguelikes. Oh, past self, how naive you were.\nThe best incident to sum this whole thing up: on the easiest difficulty setting, in two not particularly challenging dungeons, I lost two grave robbers to bad RNG, back-to-back. Losing a unit in DD means losing hours of grinding and fine-tuning, not to mention the gold you've spent training that unit up. In the end it just feels like a waste of time. I understand that DD is meant to be challenging and stressful, but at a certain point it no longer seems worth the time and effort. \nI respect the game for what it is and I appreciate that my friends really love it, but I'm not going to recommend it to anyone.

Darkest Dungeon is one of my favorite games of all time.  This is a game with depth, difficulty, character, and atmosphere.  The gameplay revolves around delving in to dungeons, managing the psychology of a rotating cast of characters, and turn based combat, but it feels a disservice to describe it in so few words.  Some of the greatest gaming moments I've ever had have come from this game.  Whether its admitting defeat and fleeing a dungeon, to conquering one that I felt impossible, the stakes are always incredibly high.

Los gr\u00e1ficos en estilo de c\u00f3mic g\u00f3tico dan vida a los personajes y entornos de una manera que es a la vez hermosa y perturbadora. Cada trazo y sombra contribuye a esa atm\u00f3sfera intensamente inmersiva, sumergiendo al jugador en un mundo donde la desesperaci\u00f3n y la oscuridad son palpables.\n\nSin embargo, lo que hace que \"Darkest Dungeon\" sea m\u00e1s que un fest\u00edn visual es su enfoque innovador en el estr\u00e9s y la cordura como elementos fundamentales del juego. La dificultad aqu\u00ed no solo radica en las batallas desafiantes o en la gesti\u00f3n de recursos, sino en el manejo de la salud mental de tus h\u00e9roes.

Hard games are fun when they feel fair, and you feel rewarded for overcoming the challenge. There's none of that here. Only a smidgen of relief when you finally get lucky and don't get screwed over by unlucky 'randomness'.\n\nFinal straw for me was losing an entire party of max level heroes, to back to back crits from a basic mob enemy.

I pretty much knew this going in and waited 7 years before I got the game heavily discounted to finally see if what I saw was true. \n\nMy biggest gripe with this game is it is incredibly slow and this is coming from some one who has invested tons of hours into many video games. The game has heavy theme and not much else its dark depressing which is not something I mind but if your going to make your game long there has to be more than just that to keep one playing. \n\nSo many things in this game have arbitrary constraints there is close to zero creativity allowed from the player making you start to not care one bit about your characters in this rpg at all. The theme menu system is total garbage and Im guessing they changed it alot in their sequel game.\n\nThe game is littered with bad RNG design and Bugs I consistently put my team in order only for them to be out of order which matters alot in this game. It all feels very early access as if there is a big beginning to the game that was planned but never made it to inspire you to go through this gruelling marathon of monsters etc but there isnt.\n\nJRpgs in recent decades have come a long way addressing issues like status effects not mattering and there are now many great ones out there. It feels as if they were attempting to focus on status effects in a big way here gameplaywise but in a way that feels they have never played an rpg before in their lives because it ignores so much of what the gameplay industry has done right in the past. \n\nIf you get this game for free I still would not recommend as its a massive time sink for very little reward, I'm pretty surprised theres a sequel to this but it has become a trend where ego centric devs desperate to save face endlessly go back to fix there first child just like no mans sky. That kind of redemption is not going to happen here because I think overall this game reminds up why status effects should never really be the core of any game its just not fun simply put even if you are a goth gamer.", "timestamp_created": 1699714968, "timestamp_updated": 1699714968, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407905697822570801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149938173": {"recommendationid": "149938173", "author": {"steamid": "76561199046677778", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 82, "playtime_at_review": 748, "last_played": 1699723647}, "language": "english", "review": "team died on first quest :(", "timestamp_created": 1699714580, "timestamp_updated": 1699714580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149923057": {"recommendationid": "149923057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068119788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 417, "playtime_at_review": 853, "last_played": 1699747571}, "language": "english", "review": "NICEEEEEEEEEEE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1699696742, "timestamp_updated": 1699696742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149916453": {"recommendationid": "149916453", "author": {"steamid": "76561199128320581", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 618, "playtime_at_review": 1040, "last_played": 1700778146}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes Depression feel like Light Work", "timestamp_created": 1699686273, "timestamp_updated": 1699686273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149915626": {"recommendationid": "149915626", "author": {"steamid": "76561199481246954", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 611, "playtime_at_review": 687, "last_played": 1700520603}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing dungeon crawler, you will die repeatedly, 100% worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1699684955, "timestamp_updated": 1699684955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149897064": {"recommendationid": "149897064", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972004436", "num_games_owned": 1072, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 4796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "playtime_at_review": 4754, "last_played": 1699659466}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes.

Some things are too RNG dependent.\n- You finished your mission with 0 stress on anyone? Nice, here take a bunch of negative quirks and diseases out of nowhere;\n- You put a mark on yourself hoping that enemies will attack this character? Nah, they will decide to attack random targets anyway:\n- You boosted your dodge to ridiculous numbers like 140 dodge? It's fine, but you will be hit anyway. Probably it is unfair talking about it, because the game doesn't show us accuracy of enemies in percentage, but I suppose that here is a fixed chance to land a hit in any case;\n- You also can crit almost every hit even if your crit chance is lower than 20%, same goes for enemies. And you can easily do misses the entire round even if the chance to hit is more than 80%. This game, similar to XCOM, often makes you doubt what real chances actually are. Same goes with Death Blow resist, where 87% (cap) is nothing. and where you can send 0 level rookies to their death, and they just won't die for few rounds.\n- The dice roll that is added to character's speed (1d8, I believe) is just straight RNG trash, it makes you to not care about speed stat at all, because it doesn't matter. \n\nAnother annoying thing is the Shrieker. If you will lose randomly 1 hero with ancestor relic, without possibility to recover it, it will be not lost, but insteat stolen by Shrieker. And you can't take it back until it steals 8 of your trinkets (which is silly), so you HAVE to give 6 trash trinkets to rookies and send them to death in order to trigger Shrieker event. Otherwise you will just finish the game and still will never regain your items. It is tedious to say the least. Before Shrieker was implemented, you just lost those items and had to obtain it in another long 5 lvl dungeon.\nAlso, there is a smaller bug where the number of week in graveyard will be always incorrect if the person dies after you already was in Farmstead at least once. Annoying, but it wasn't fixed in years, and seems like players don't care either.\n\nAs an old player in this game, I also miss times when Jester wasn't so finale-oriented, where his solo was actually useful, where Grave Robber didn't have useless stealth and instead she had her dodge boost with ONE step back, where Leper/Plague Doctor/Man-at-Arms didn't have one-time-use skills and could stack them... Also, in Farmstead one-time skills don't work properly, because game thinks that the entire bar at the top - is one battle, so you end up never using them.\n\nAs for Endless harvest... Man, I feel so many missed opportunities. It could be something similar to Torghast from WoW, or Simulated Universe from Star Rail...

There are no runs and every quest you go on WILL have an affect on your next one. Whether it be a character getting stressed out and needing to unwind back at the estate, having a party die in a dungeon and losing all them AND their equipment, getting a negative quirk, etc.\n\nHonestly, I love this game's aesthetics and battle systems, but oh my god does management of the estate and the long-term consequences of runs suck. I honestly love the idea, but it makes bad RNG and experimentation so much more punishing.\n\nThe fun of roguelikes is being able to fail a run due to your mistakes, yet being able to come out of it stronger for the next run because you learned something new from your past mistakes. Here it feels like you have all the downsides of a loss in any other roguelike and MORE without any of the plus sides of it (okay fine, maybe you'll learn/discover a new thing or two in a run, but it may not be enough to leave you wanting more). \n\nThis game is waaaaay too punishing. Some of you may like it, but believe me when I say, that if you don't have much time on your hands, this game will do nothing but make you want to tear your hair out.\n\nHonestly, if you like something like X-com and want something like that, but the characters can go insane, the combat is turn-based and on a way smaller grid, and you personally don't care if a game repeatedly kicks you when you're down and occasionally spits on you while it's at it, I think you'll definitely enjoy this game.\n\nEveryone else though, proceed with risk. They murdered some of my favorite characters in the blink of an eye and left one party member live to tell the tale. On one hand, it wasn't like it was a scripted event, it WAS partially my fault, as I could've just left the dungeon to escape with them (even if it would've given them more stress/I would've missed out on some rewards), but dang it they all died in like one turn...\n\nNOTE: Traits and quirks are fun, as having a character's only way to relieve stress be time in a brothel, only to then develop \"deviant tastes\" banning them from said brothels is hilarious. If I end up losing that character I'm uninstalling this game and never playing it again (i removed the quirk limiting them to brothels but left their \"deviant tastes\" just because I find it funny), though, I'm sure the devs probably know that and are probably dying laughing at the fact that the game is as punishing as it is. I just wish managing party members wasn't so tedious, though, I've heard that they've changed the second game to be MORE like a roguelike, so I can't wait to check that out some day.\n\nI hope some day I'll come back to this review and change it into a recommendation, but for now, as someone with not as much time as they used to have to just themselves and with games that I generally just find to be more fun, I'll just leave this as a \"don't recommend\" for anyone who has heard this game is great, but not enough of the people telling them that this game is actually pretty grindy and not that much like a roguelike.\n\nFeel free to tell me to go die in the comments though.

The gameplay itself is addictive as hell (I'm 20 hrs in, and I literally can't stop playing). It has interesting combat mechanics, and a huge amount of different character classes to choose from. The game encourages you to try different party combinations as quite often your characters become stressed out and need to take time off, forcing you to try other character combinations instead, so it keeps the combat interesting. There's no SAVE feature here either, so if one of your characters die, they are dead for good, which really adds to the tension when you are exploring the dungeons. When it comes to investigating objects in the dungeons, like opening treasure chests or looking inside a bag, there's a risk that investigating something might harm you, but it could potentially benefit you too.

There are some nasty surprises in store in the early game, and nastier still in the late game that will have you pulling your hair out.  RNG-sus will drive your party to madness and mutilate them one by one.  It's hard.\n\nYou can get good, though.  Your growing roster of varied heroes will improve in skill and through careful management of their afflictions and quirks.  Trinkets and baubles in careful measure will pull the party through the tightest situations.  Your decisions in supplying the party will make or break each foray into the darkest dungeons, and you will learn to mitigate the losses.\n\nHoly shoot, it looks good.  All the grisly beasts, fungal growths, bloodthirsty marauders, shadowy shamblers, and spooky scary skeletons are illustrated and animated just right in a sharp comic book style that just oozes with that eldritch charm one might seek out on the brink of madness.  Our heroes look just as good whether they're losing their minds or experiencing a sudden pulse of courage, and in your respective rage or relief you'll feel those swings personally.  The level design visually fits right in, against the backdrop of a rundown hamlet to serve as your upgrade-able base camp, as your parties delve into a handful of impressively oppressive areas, all beautifully rendered, each with their own slew of specialized hordes.\n\nStory's got some good spook to it.  Check out the trailers for a taste, though I would have liked to see some more storied animation within the game, it's still a great tale, mostly delivered through our ancestor's narration during the occasional loading screen.\n\nIn conclusion:  It's hard.

The difficulty curve on the experience can be rough at the start and smooths out over the course of many estates. Each character feels unique in its archetype and sub-archetypes that form from the combination of various skill, other champions, and trinkets that you discover over the course of a run. Risk often translates to a tangible reward in the dungeons where \"push you luck\" can line your pockets with gold, trinkets, or crests, or you may wind up with four fresh graves in the graveyard. After a few estates, it can be a wholly different experience upping the difficult from Radiant to Darkest to Stygian (Bloodmoon with the Crimson Court DLC). You may have to re-imagine how you fought previous encounters when life limits, darkness increases. or a time limit are imposed. All of these factors helped shape Darkest Dungeon into a memorable experience that I come back to every year.\n\nIn addition to the base game, I suggest grabbing [in order] The Shield Breaker, Color of Madness, and Crimson Court DLCs. Shield breaker adds an incredibly useful and powerful companion that has a unique interaction in the dungeons. Color of Madness adds an optional 'endless' dungeon grind that pauses the normal time progression while keeping some of the risks. And finally Crimson Court adds in the powerful Flagellant companion, multi level mega dungeon encounters, and a ramping difficulty to the base game with bloodsucker infestations and the withering crimson curse itself. I think this order provides the best evolving gameplay experience in difficulty; however, this is not the order of my personal enjoyment. Above and beyond I personally enjoy the difficulty added by the Crimson Court the most. However it is very much not new player friendly. If engaged with too early you can feel overwhelmed with wasting champions and the punishing mega dungeons. And if engaged with too late you will miss out on incredibly powerful trinkets and be bogged down by repeated stress relieving activity reduction events in town. Color of Madness feels lacking to me, but I enjoy the trinkets before I get to the mid game. And the Shield Breaker can sometimes feel borderline busted near the mid game to late game. \n\nYou will lose. The game will feel like it is picking on you. You will get overwhelmed. This gameplay style isn't for everyone and its okay if its not for you. But if you like this kind of challenge I promise that when its all said and done and the last champions head into the final layer of the Darkest Dungeon, you will feel rewarded.", "timestamp_created": 1698267191, "timestamp_updated": 1698267191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148870315": {"recommendationid": "148870315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149824978", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6372, "last_played": 1698263184}, "language": "english", "review": "slowly paced and painfully repetitive. fun in the same way endlessly scrolling social media is fun", "timestamp_created": 1698263432, "timestamp_updated": 1698263432, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433070838451385498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148869948": {"recommendationid": "148869948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251075720", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3913, "last_played": 1698321263}, "language": "english", "review": "imba", "timestamp_created": 1698262965, "timestamp_updated": 1698262965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148869194": {"recommendationid": "148869194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174456306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8593, "last_played": 1698433617}, "language": "english", "review": "This game gives me intense anxiety and I have nightmares about the screams of my damned fools entering into a battle, too weary to fight off the creeping malice which infests the corridors of this game and falling one by one until it is but I who stands alone, watching their corpses draw in maggots and monstrosities alike\n\n11/10\nWould suffer again", "timestamp_created": 1698262004, "timestamp_updated": 1698262004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148833658": {"recommendationid": "148833658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272378159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30745, "last_played": 1644456916}, "language": "english", "review": "Just taking a look at my hours in this game probably tells you how much I enjoy it.

Dread and hopelessness without the generic horror genre cheese. Wayne June, you are a god, \u2018nuf said. Expect several runs figuring out how to build good parties, and that thrill of victory when you win\u2026on easy. Strategy and planning will carry you a long way, but the excessive randomness is why I need to put this game down now for good. It was a great run though.\n[hr][/hr]\nI hate to start off by calling [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] a wonderful thematic experience because that [i]usually[/i] implies other elements are mediocre at best. [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is a near masterpiece because it is a great game that is [b]also[/b] deeply entrenched in Gothic horror.   It\u2019s dark, moody, filled with your nightmares\u2026and yet never relies on gore or cheesy jump scares to make you feel hopeless, desperate, and out of your depth. Surely this must be a full immersion VR, right? Nope\u2026side-scrolling exploration with turn-based combat and town management. The thematic elements are simply [b]*Chef\u2019s Kiss*[/b].\n\nWayne June as the Narrator also needs a special shoutout. He is the *[i][b]perfect[/b][/i]* voice to set the game\u2019s mood. The Narrator is the only voice in the game and he is your dead ancestor, heralds your accomplishments and failures, and even narrates combat. Despite being the only voice in the game, playing for over 200 h, and having only 3-ish dozen routine lines\u2026I will literally [b]never[/b] tire of hearing Wayne June shout [i]\u201cExecuted with impunity!\u201d[/i].\n\nGameplay is overall good, but very hard\u2026at first. Be prepared to lose several games just figuring out the system. But this is eldritch, Gothic horror set in an ironman style roguelike game. If you are getting into the setting, it wouldn\u2019t be right if you beat the game on the first go\u2026or second\u2026or fifth. Also, you have to know when, and be willing, to abandon the dungeon because things just went really badly. And you will feel that loss, because you won\u2019t come back with the resources to recover\u2026much less make any improvements.\n\nI put 40 h into the game before I had figured enough out to take my first real crack at it. Even then, I was still missing some key pieces. There are lots of ways to build fun and very effective adventuring parties. Once you understand how all the pieces come together, the roles your different party members can take on, the game becomes\u2026not easy, but winnable.  \n\nYou are constantly trying to make the best of a bad situation. Heroes are frequently stressed to the edge of insanity, and you still have to put together an effective roster for the next dungeon. After you pay to give your heroes some much needed downtime (they can\u2019t adventure), you have to make hard decisions about what to do with the little remaining gold. Buy one hero better armor? Upgrade a few skills? Make future healing cheaper? I love it.\n\n[i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] isn\u2019t perfect. There are a handful of minor gripes about mechanics I don\u2019t like. Ambush, for example. If you get ambushed, it\u2019s super bad\u2026especially when you are still learning, avoid it [b]at all costs![/b] Then when you ambush baddies you go first, which seems good\u2026but then they get 2 turns in a row. To me, that is a penalty. I would rather manage spread out damage versus spending the rest of the fight recovering from getting the ever-living shit kicked out of me (ambush fights frequently take [i]longer[/i] than regular fights because of this).\n\nThe game also indexes [b]very[/b] heavily into randomness\u2026and virtually everything in the game has a random element. Want a Jester so you can reduce dungeon stress? You might not get one for 6\u202612\u202620 weeks (week = game turn, one dungeon per week). Need your Crusader to come back from the bar for the next run because he\u2019s your only tank? Too bad\u2026no telling when he will get back from his bender. Randomness is what ends up being [i]Darkest Dungeon\u2019s[/i] Achilles\u2019s heel, and prevents me from putting it in my top tier of games.\n\nOnce you are an expert or master of the game, you figure out how to cope with the randomness. Mostly by making sure the worst situation is still within the capability of your party. And if you chose to take a risky run into a high-level dungeon, you do it knowing that you already have the resources to recover. At this point I can guarantee a finish on Darkest difficulty run within a reasonable time frame, and without much angst or hand wringing\u2026and because of that the game has lost a bit of magic for me.\n\nAnd this is where the biggest problem comes in.  To increase the difficulty, you not only get tougher dungeons, but you get a limited number of deaths (12) and game weeks (86).  This is bad because the randomness might prevent you from getting the things you need to succeed. I went 10 weeks without getting a healer in my recruitment tent. Plus, the final dungeons become so hard that a single crit on the wrong guy will one-shot them. There are builds that help negate this\u2026but that relies on getting the right trinkets to drop\u2026.  In the end, you might spend all your time and you literally cannot win, even with the right builds and playstyle.  That\u2019s ok for a game that is 2-3 hours a run\u2026not 20-30.\n\nDespite how much I do like this game, I have to set it down now forever. The lower difficulties no longer feel like [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i], and the higher difficulties rely too much on randomness for the win/loss.  But I do have to say\u2026[b]man, what a ride.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1697399363, "timestamp_updated": 1697399417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148291304": {"recommendationid": "148291304", "author": {"steamid": "76561199062889067", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1689940286}, "language": "spanish", "review": "En general no hay nada nuevo que la gran mayor\u00eda de rese\u00f1as,  recomend\u00e1ndolo o no, digan.

Crafted by the enigmatic minds at Red Hook Studios, this interactive experience serves not as a mere game, but as an eldritch tome chronicling the frailty of human sanity and the cosmic horrors that imperil our feeble existence.\n\nMuch like the ancient and forbidden texts that I have often written about, Darkest Dungeon is not for the faint of heart. From its outset, one is thrust into a macabre tale of ancestral sin, wherein the player becomes custodian of a forsaken hamlet and its doomed denizens. Each foray into the labyrinthine catacombs, the profane warrens, or the eldritch weald tests not only one's strategic prowess but also the very limits of human resilience.\n\nThe art, a phantasmagoria of grotesque designs and despair-inducing landscapes, evokes a chilling sense of foreboding. The twisted visages of the heroes and monsters alike are reminiscent of the incomprehensible beings that haunt my own tales \u2014 embodiments of unfathomable cosmic terror. Furthermore, the narration, delivered in a grave and haunting timbre, underscores the ceaseless dread that permeates this dark digital domain.\n\nYet, where Darkest Dungeon truly excels is in its exploration of human fragility. Heroes, though valiant in their endeavors, are by no means impervious to the psychological traumas of their quests. Stress, paranoia, hopelessness \u2014 these are as palpable foes as any tentacled monstrosity or undead marauder. One must navigate not just the external threats, but also the internal demons that threaten to unravel the very fabric of one's party.\n\nCritics may decry its punishing difficulty or the merciless RNG that can cast even the most well-laid plans into the abyss. But it is in these moments of despair, where all seems lost and the void beckons, that the true essence of Lovecraftian horror is realized. In confronting the incomprehensible and the inevitable decay of hope, one is forced to reckon with the inherent meaninglessness of existence in a universe that is at best indifferent and at worst, malevolent.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Darkest Dungeon\" stands as a digital testament to mankind's eternal struggle against both the known and unknown horrors of the cosmos. It is not merely a game, but a journey into the very heart of darkness, where one must confront not only the external monstrosities but also the innermost fears and frailties of the human psyche. Those with a penchant for cosmic horror and a tolerance for despair will find it an experience unparalleled in its chilling authenticity.", "timestamp_created": 1696784183, "timestamp_updated": 1696784183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147878547": {"recommendationid": "147878547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007806403", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1262, "last_played": 1697154742}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried uncovering the secrets of my ancestors and all I got was severe mental illness. 101/10, would lose self to madness again.", "timestamp_created": 1696783763, "timestamp_updated": 1696783763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86401134729385376", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147876669": {"recommendationid": "147876669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145242007", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 7207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7207, "last_played": 1633045233}, "language": "spanish", "review": "T\u00fa depresi\u00f3n de puto adolescente no es nada comparado a jugar esta shit.

The biggest issue with getting into Darkest Dungeon isn\u2019t the \u2018difficulty\u2019, which is really just excessive RNG, but how much the game relishes in wasting your time. Whether it\u2019s crawling back through 7 rooms/halls of a dungeon you already explored cause you picked the wrong fork in a path, wasting turns in combat chewing through corpses \u2018cause none of your characters can attack the remaining enemies, or wasting turns re-arranging characters \u2018cause they don\u2019t have abilities to dynamically re-arrange, or needing to wait for the stage coach to bring you a new healer after the one you\u2019d almost got to max level died to a ridiculous cascade of RNG you had no opportunity to react to, or worse yet, having your entire party wipe and having to start grinding new ones up from square one. It\u2019s Roguelite, so a degree of repetition should be expected, but the scale to which you have to repeat things, whether over the course of the entire game, or even in a single dungeon, and the slow pace at which the game runs to \u2018build atmosphere\u2019, is a painful combination. Not masochistic, \u2018oh this requires a grand strategy\u2019, not masochistic, \u2018oh this requires razor sharp reflexes\u2019, not even masochistic \u2018oh I made a mistake and now I\u2019m set back for it\u2019, it\u2019s masochistic because once you feel like your time is being wasted all immersion is gone and all that\u2019s left is frustration\u2026 and yet I played over a hundred hours regardless, thinking back on my time with it I fondly remember the striking visuals, and dismal setting, and I do recommend the game, all because my time wasting gripes can be mitigated enough by workshop mods that increase the speed of dungeon movement and combat animations, among other things. Darkest Dungeon\u2019s community has supported the game well, and I honestly think if you\u2019re going to play it, you need at least the move and combat speed up mods to make it playable, but if that\u2019s not to your satisfaction, there\u2019s a world of mods from additional variety in graphics, to new character classes, and there\u2019s even an overhaul mod that has its own store page, plenty to tailor the experience to your preferences.", "timestamp_created": 1696677176, "timestamp_updated": 1696677176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147788864": {"recommendationid": "147788864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251413618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1593408142}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly ain't even that dark in there, just turn up the gamma, smh", "timestamp_created": 1696668344, "timestamp_updated": 1696668344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147775894": {"recommendationid": "147775894", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180164369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1671749315}, "language": "english", "review": "I have dark on my dungeon, i got lotion on my darkness, i been stroking my dungeon", "timestamp_created": 1696645678, "timestamp_updated": 1696645678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147774503": {"recommendationid": "147774503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315377415", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 128, "playtime_at_review": 698, "last_played": 1699745289}, "language": "spanish", "review": "un muy buen juego que mezcla la estrategia con el combate por turnos y el cl\u00e1sico rpg, a su vez la dificultad que tiene aun en modo normal es incre\u00edble te plantea un desafi\u00f3 sorprendente y por muy peque\u00f1a que sea la misi\u00f3n no debes relajarte ya que algo te puede cambiar las tornas de la excursi\u00f3n.", "timestamp_created": 1696643385, "timestamp_updated": 1696643385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147769646": {"recommendationid": "147769646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209340536", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 539, "last_played": 1696757720}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me cry for my lost soldiers...\n\nGreat Graphics but the combat sadly becomes pretty boring pretty fast", "timestamp_created": 1696635282, "timestamp_updated": 1696635282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147768556": {"recommendationid": "147768556", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994273761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 4139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4134, "last_played": 1697429282}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game, but it's absolutely impossible to make any progress.

antiquarian). team building is probably the best thing in this game aswell, planning what dungeon you are going to and the team to bring (for example if your going to ruins, should i bring plague doctor for stuns and potent blights? arbalest for good backline damage? or maybe even shield breaker for blight, ability to hit every rank and prot piercing?), planning who you are going to use, what trinkets to bring, what moves to have those characters use is great and alot better than the planning you put into other similar games like persona or xenoblade chronicles.\n\nI recently beat the game

Amazing selection of heroes with great abilities focused around certain party compositions\n\n2. Ancestors narrations pull you into an incredibly atmospheric world of certain horror and mind numbing insanity\n\n3. DLC is so much fun and so well done, easy to get into and hard to master\n\n4. Turn based combat revolving around dice rolls, much like dungeons and dragons or other roll 20 games with a unique stress mechanic \n\n5. Artwork and Soundtrack are beautiful, dark and horrifically interesting. \n\n6. PVP mode for those willing to endure the pain for personal glory (The Butcher's Circus)\n\n7. Large selection of skills and trinkets allow cool variations of the same hero (minus Vestal, she's stuck healing)\n\n8. The poor miller, thrice a victim. The seasons took his livelihood, I took his land. And now, uncountable years later, the comet has taken his humanity. My only regret is I did not live to see that shoddy mill smashed to pieces by the miraculous bounty I reaped from beyond the void..

The Butchers Circus PVP mode is heavily RNG reliant and many of the best trinkets are locked behind leveling making your first games completely miserable\n\n3.

All of the classes feel useful in spite of some definite stand outs. They also all feel fun to play. The sound design is top notch. The music choreographs foreboding, but mostly safe havens, tense treks through threatening hallways, uneasy firelit reprieves, and desperate battles. The stand out feature of the game's audio is the inclusion of the narrator, Wayne June, who brings flavor and injects some meaning in all that you do, filling in the blanks where the game might leave empty spaces or undefined ideas. The art direction and design is an endearing marriage of pop up picture books while also having a dark fantastical edge that makes it visually memorable and enjoyable to look at.

Heroes will die, quests will fail. The one constant is your hamlet, from which diligent upgrades will make those losses irrelevant. Utilize the idle stress reduction between weeks, constantly bring fresh recruits, and send them in screaming with minimal supplies. Don't worry about letting broken heroes go.\n\nUpgrading the stagecoach to supply level 4 heroes will allow you to quickly fill your roster with max level characters, and losing them doesn't feel quite so bad. Level 4 heroes come with weapons, armor, and skills already upgraded, saving thousands in gold. I would not waste your resources on upgrades or stress reduction until you have them. Apart from that, tons of content to explore and conquer, and a free mod that essentially feels like a perfect sequel to the base game.

Developed by Red Hook Studios, this masterpiece of gothic horror and strategic game-play demands your attention and rewards your perseverance in ways that few games ever manage.\n\nFrom the very moment you step foot into the grim hamlet surrounding the foreboding estate, you are immediately ensnared by the game's mesmerizing atmosphere. The haunting art style, replete with detailed character designs and eerie backdrops, works in harmony with the haunting musical score to create an atmosphere that is dripping with dread and unease. The feeling of being perpetually on the brink of catastrophe never dissipates, keeping you in a state of constant tension.\n\nHowever, it's not just the aesthetics that set \"Darkest Dungeon\" apart; it's the brilliantly designed game-play mechanics that truly shine. At its core, this is a game of calculated risk and resource management. Every expedition into the depths of the estate brings with it the potential for great reward, but also the very real possibility of utter devastation. The mechanics of stress, afflictions, and quirks serve as a stark reminder of the psychological toll that dungeon delving takes on your party, deepening the connection between player and character. The result is an experience that is both punishingly difficult and exhilaratingly satisfying.\n\nWhat truly sets \"Darkest Dungeon\" on a pedestal, however, is its unabashed commitment to challenging the player's decision-making skills. With the ever-looming threat of permadeath, each choice you make, from which heroes to recruit to which upgrades to prioritize, carries monumental weight. This unforgiving nature can be daunting, but it\u2019s also what gives the victories a sweet taste that few other games can replicate. Triumphing over a particularly harrowing encounter or defeating a menacing boss elicits a euphoria that's difficult to match.\n\nThe narrative elements in \"Darkest Dungeon\" are masterfully woven into the fabric of the game-play. The narrated passages by Wayne June add a layer of gravitas to the events unfolding, and the snippets of lore you uncover as you progress hint at a vast and terrifying world just beyond the scope of your torchlight. This world-building, coupled with the personal stories of your heroes, creates a sense of immersion that is profoundly engaging.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Darkest Dungeon\" is not a game for the faint-hearted. It's a journey into the darkest recesses of human nature, a relentless test of strategy, and a tribute to the indomitable human spirit in the face of overwhelming odds. Red Hook Studios has crafted a timeless masterpiece that will undoubtedly be remembered for years to come. If you're seeking a gaming experience that challenges you on every level and leaves an indelible mark on your psyche, dare to venture into the abyss of Darkest Dungeon \u2013 your sanity may be tested, but your gaming library will be forever enriched.", "timestamp_created": 1693260483, "timestamp_updated": 1693260483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515923559665679932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145219011": {"recommendationid": "145219011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061328972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 7426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2218, "last_played": 1696359576}, "language": "english", "review": "The most fun experience of being stressed out I've ever had!", "timestamp_created": 1693253620, "timestamp_updated": 1693253620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492102056741714478", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145218705": {"recommendationid": "145218705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034242213", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 8274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8103, "last_played": 1693813006}, "language": "english", "review": "Of the games I revisit this one always feels fresh.

I do not say this lightly, because if you play the game as if you're trying to spite the developers, it is somewhat easier.

At times, it'll feel like the game doesn't make any sense, or like you're not making any progress.\n\nBecause Darkest Dungeon HATES you. It wants you to fail. It will punish every single mistake you make, and will refuse to praise your victories. As you progress, you will be micromanaging well over 20 characters - that's 5 full teams! - in order to get their stresses down, their bad quirks removed, their equipment somewhat passable, and their skills in optimal position for success. This is an absolute logistical nightmare, since to do any of these things, you need money - lots of it, which you can only get by going deeper into the dungeons. You will lose characters. You will lose progress. The real currency of Darkest Dungeon is not artifacts or gold, but the hard-learned lessons of every mistake you make along the way. You will learn your lesson, or your future expeditions will be just as doomed as the one that taught you.\n\nAnd I'm playing on EASY!\n\nBut it can be done. Stick with it. Make mistakes.

This game is a merciless master, demanding every ounce of strategic brilliance and iron-willed determination, and I'm not sure whether to praise it or beg for mercy.\n\nFrom the moment I inherited my ancestral estate, I knew I was in for a punishing experience. The game's dark and gothic atmosphere enveloped me like a shroud, and the narration, delivered with eerie gravitas, served as a constant reminder that despair lurked around every corner. The game's art style, a hauntingly beautiful blend of Lovecraftian horror and medieval darkness, only deepened the sense of foreboding.\n\nThe core gameplay in \"Darkest Dungeon\" is a relentless test of survival. Sending a party of heroes into the twisted depths of the estate is a game of risk and reward, where death is a constant companion. The need to manage stress, monitor health, and deal with the ever-encroaching darkness adds layers of complexity that can be both maddening and addicting.\n\nOne of the standout features is the permadeath mechanic. Losing a beloved hero, one who's been through countless battles and faced unimaginable horrors, is a gut-wrenching experience. It's a testament to the game's storytelling that each loss feels like a tragedy.\n\nThe character progression system is a double-edged sword. As heroes level up, they develop unique quirks and traits, which can be both beneficial and detrimental. It adds depth to the characters but also introduces an element of unpredictability that can turn the tide of battle for better or worse.\n\nThe game's difficulty is off the charts. Every decision, from party composition to resource management, carries consequences that can lead to disaster. It's a game that punishes mistakes with ruthless efficiency, and the learning curve can be brutal.\n\nFurthermore, the game's narrative, delivered through journal entries and cryptic hints, adds an element of intrigue that keeps you pushing forward, even as the darkness threatens to consume your sanity.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Darkest Dungeon\" is a masterpiece of masochistic game design. It's a game that pushes you to the brink of despair, yet somehow keeps you coming back for more punishment. Whether you emerge victorious or succumb to the horrors that lurk in the shadows, one thing is certain: \"Darkest Dungeon\" is an experience that will haunt your dreams and leave you questioning your sanity.", "timestamp_created": 1692762938, "timestamp_updated": 1692762938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144821372": {"recommendationid": "144821372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165337293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8939, "last_played": 1693676647}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tengo 150 horas de juego y aun no lo pude terminar...

Se trata de juego de ensayo y error, pero cuando cometes un error, duele much\u00edsimo. Tiene una curva de dificultad muy vertical.\n-En numerosas ocasiones el juego es injusto, porque se basa mucho en el azar y la probabilidad. Puedes tener un buen equipo y estrategia, que si al enemigo de turno le sale un cr\u00edtico puede eliminar a un h\u00e9roe tuyo de un par de golpes, lo que puede llevar a frustrar y hacer que abandones el juego. Menci\u00f3n especial a cuando se muere uno de tus personajes en la puerta de un boss porque ya estaba \"tocado\".\n\nASPECTOS POSITIVOS\n-Una vez que pasas por el bautismo de fuego y no te has rendido, el juego te lo agradece. Una ves tienes montada la maquinaria es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil reponerse de los h\u00e9roes que van muriendo (que no ser\u00e1n pocos), mejorar r\u00e1pidamente su equipo y seguir hacia la victoria.\n-Cuando empieza a funcionar es muy gratificante, efectuar sinergias y darle para el pelo a los enemigos que antes te met\u00edan en l\u00edos.\n-La est\u00e9tica de juego es muy llamativa y est\u00e1 muy conseguida, como un c\u00f3mic l\u00fagubre y oscuro, con criaturas infernales y de conexto de terror.\n-A pesar de haber pocos niveles, que se generen aleatoriamente le da un plus de originalidad, para que nunca te conf\u00edes, porque incluso la misi\u00f3n m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil puede torcerse si no vas bien preparado.\n-Hay mods que son una delicia, permiti\u00e9ndote jugar con personajes nuevos o cambiar skines. Destaco el personaje de Kratos, Geralt de Rivia o el Cazador de Bloodborne (mi favorito), con su propio set de habilidades, objetos y skines.\n\nEn resumen, no es un juego para todos los p\u00fablicos pero cuando te atrapa, no te suelta hasta que lo terminas.

But honestly, thats something that makes this game a lot better, the feeling that your decisions really matter, when u have to choose if u want to take the chance of getting amazing loot with the risk of getting ur party wiped out.\n\nI love the battle mechanics, the bosses look amazing and their battles encourage the player to learn their mechanics (stupid Wilbur lol) and think about the right party composition. Sometimes u get the enemies surprised and get a full wipe without getting any damage or sometimes u get ur party surprised and struggle to not get everyone dead or afflicted. The Stress mechanic sometimes is very hard to manage but it is possible, even in high difficulty dungeons, which btw are also amazing, every one of them with different types of enemies, which also have different types of mechanics and resistances that reward the player for building a good team for them.\n\nAnyways, the game is amazing, and im glad that i buyed, bcs i have a lot of fun playing it and now i know very well that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.", "timestamp_created": 1691842497, "timestamp_updated": 1700694894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51530611515045166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143981223": {"recommendationid": "143981223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064925886", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12047, "last_played": 1692118802}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!

Its super satisfying to maintain your favorites and a big deal if you lose them.\n\nDarkest Dungeon doesn't baby you, its the Dark Souls of dark dungeon games. It tests your strategy and creativity. Sometimes it can feel daunting if you want to sit back and relax, but you can always grind low level dungeons then.\n\nIn short, Darkest Dungeon is a must-play for anyone seeking an immersive dungeon crawling experience.

The gimmick of the game is that you cannot prepare for everything (unless inordinate quirk locking be considered a virtue), the trinkets always have some kind of downside (or kind of useless when they don't), but the good thing is that having stuns, lots of damage, speed, accuracy, some healing and some stress healing and camp skills to heal stress makes the game a lot more managable, so the conclusion is that you want to look out for heroes that have the aforementioned things and don't interfere with each other's positioning and always can do something useful in case you get surprised or shuffled. Another factor is more related to your personal blunders like forgetting some provisions like Blood or shovels and what not, or starting a fight you can't finish (Shambler, Collector) or having to abandon the mission because your team comp couldn't get to the boss room with little damage, or letting a hero get an affliction (this usually causes a domino effect and you'll probably abandon the quest soon).\nOnce you harness the game mechanics and RNG to some extent, the game becomes really enjoyable. The only feasible downsides are probably grinding level 6 heroes and RNG screwing you over on a rare occasion (like your level 6 Flagellant  with 87% deathblow resist dying on the first death's door check, have fun spending an hour or two grinding a new hero with good quirks!

I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a roguelike, but it has permadeath once one of your heroes dies in combat is gone [spoiler] most likely [/spoiler] forever, this makes the game incredibly punishing. One bad dungeon expedition can set you back hours of gameplay towards the end of the game. The game makes an incredible emphasis on the positioning of your heroes some abilities are only available in specific rows so keeping the position of your heroes and messing up the enemies position it\u2019s a key part of the gameplay. \nThis game highly rewards knowledge and using the right tool for each situation. There\u2019s a highly armored pig with poison resistance then bleed it to death, an annoying witch stressing your heroes bring it to the front so she can\u2019t use their strongest attacks.

"language": "english", "review": "To be clear, I'm only recommending this if you are totally and completely ready to be disappointed, because you will be. Sometimes, you just lose. Everything will be fine, you'll go into a perfectly normal fight, and get such poor rng that a guy you invested a lot of money into just straight up dies. From full health to totally and irrevocably dead. This will happen over and over again until you decide to leave this game behind prematurely or finish it and leave on good terms. Unless there is something major I am missing (which after 39 hours would shock me greatly), then you will unavoidably have incredible setbacks because you can not just make the right choices to avoid death. The best you can do is try and tip the odds in your favor, but at the end of the day, luck will decide the fate of your every character. The best thing you can do is run away, which is kind of lame to me, but that's me. I love the aesthetic. I love the theme. It's so cool. But if you prefer a game where your decisions are what matters, then this isn't the game for you. This game is a gamble at every turn.

When I first heard of Darkest Dungeon, the phrase I heard that stuck out most was \"this game HATES you\". After 90 hours, I'm not sure I'd agree. Rather, I'd say this game will take every opportunity you give it to screw you. DD is unquestionably mean, but not unfairly so. When things go wrong, the source can often be traced back to something you did -- characters' skills or gear is underleveled, you forgot important supplies, bad team comp, overconfidence, etc. -- and the game will happily punish you for it.\n\nDD is a vast departure from what I normally play; I usually stick to fun, chill indie games that don't make you shake your fist at the heavens. There were times my sole motivation for finishing this game was spite. Even so, I'm glad I played DD. It drips with Gothic atmosphere, Wayne June is at the height of his powers, the breadth of viable teams adds to the potential replay value, and of course the memes are nigh endless. Even if I never touch DD again, I am part of this game now -- bound to it.

I did NOT enjoy the game until I turned it down to 'easy' and turned off ALL additional difficulty options - THEN it became a fun game for me (others might of course like the punishing gameplay). \n\nThe main downside - which is of course an intentional aspect of the game - is the loss of characters. So don't get too attached to them. You should, however, get attached to your hamlet (city upgrades stay, while characters die) but it feels a little weird / annoying. I think I generally like people more than buildings.\n\nA smaller issue is how the effect of the various abilities are explained and shown.

I've played it quite a few hours, which by itself might seem thumbs-up recommendation, but it really isn't.\n\nI like the battle line style games (by which I mean the array/position of your characters in a turn-based combat has meaning).  A front line, a back line, support, damage, looking for synergies.  Nifty. Engaging even.\nI've read/watched the guides and tips.  I didn't find any of it particularly of use, I've been playing these sorts of things for a while.\n\nThe reality of this game is... frustrating.  At anything higher than the easiest level, the RNG is cruel and punitive.  At the easiest level... some mild challenge (which ramped up _sharply_ for the final dungeon).  The designers should note there is a significant difference between challenging and just mean.  Not to mention a nuisance factor.  \nI'm okay with taking losses if it achieves my goals.  Slogging to earn enough money to make the characters viable so they can complete the only challenges available, watching them get crushed, oft with a series of crits from the enemies and misses on my part, in the first one or two meaningless fights in a run?  When there are likely to be 5 or 6 more fights plus maybe a boss?  Ugh.  The challenge is high enough that losing even one of four characters on the way to the boss is a death sentence (in the boss fight, that's fine, I've lost 3/4 and still won, dicey though).  \nHealing, especially stress healing, is sparse enough, and defenses low enough that one might think that the all damage is the way to go, but attrition will quickly show the error of that thinking.  And, ofc, the decent support classes mostly don't do enough damage &/or tank enough to make them viable on their own (as it should be, but there is a balance to be achieved in there somewhere).\n\nOh, and the money grind.  Painful, right up until you are flooded with it.  But did I mention the building upgrade resource grind?  Which is dependent on the RNG?  And your limited space, competing with money at every turn?  Choices matter and all that, but you truly need _everything_, right now, no exceptions, or you die trying.  Repeatedly.  Over and over.  Which might be okay...

The heroes plunder the depths, go crazy and get injured, you have to nurse them back to health and in the meantime send out an alternate set of heroes.\n\nWhile this loop is very fun as you go on expeditions and micro manage your different teams of adventurers, the problem is that there's a limited number of times you can run a given dungeon because the dungeon itself levels up. Combine this with heroes that can perma-die and you can end up with a bunch of level 1 heroes that can't explore anything and not enough high level heroes to be of use.\n\nIf you go into the game knowing that you can play yourself into a corner lets you set your expectations accordingly.

You will lose, and you will suffer setbacks. However, through experience and carefully planning out party comps you can begin to overcome the horrors pitted against you. \n\nWith 17 heroes to create parties from, in tandem with a choice of 7 skills per hero, there's an incredible amount of variation in party builds. Since your characters will suffer from the psychological stress of the monsters you encounter, it is common to find the characters you like are indisposed for some missions, leading you to fall back upon other heroes you normally wouldn't use. This is a great method for encouraging experimentation that the sequel fails to capture. \n\nThe art style, music, and narrator serve to create a capturing Lovecraftian tone that caught my attention and adoration instantly. Wayne Jude does an excellent job at adding tension to uncertain encounters, and grim satisfaction at the elimination of a particularly troublesome foe with incredibly memorable quotes.\n\nWhile the game may not be for everyone, it is incredibly well made, and I encourage those not afraid of failure to give it a chance. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1690236392, "timestamp_updated": 1690236520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142715737": {"recommendationid": "142715737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144812064", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1690220878}, "language": "english", "review": "KYS WITH UR BS GAME", "timestamp_created": 1690220897, "timestamp_updated": 1690220897, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427091240882873535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142709736": {"recommendationid": "142709736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076959834", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4147, "last_played": 1691201264}, "language": "english", "review": "Very dark, very dungeon", "timestamp_created": 1690214013, "timestamp_updated": 1690214013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142703694": {"recommendationid": "142703694", "author": {"steamid": "76561199071120399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2993, "last_played": 1691089666}, "language": "english", "review": "great", "timestamp_created": 1690206587, "timestamp_updated": 1690206587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142691870": {"recommendationid": "142691870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872925619", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 345, "playtime_at_review": 755, "last_played": 1700450193}, "language": "english", "review": "dd", "timestamp_created": 1690188660, "timestamp_updated": 1690188660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142686509": {"recommendationid": "142686509", "author": {"steamid": "76561199477981315", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10576, "last_played": 1693697014}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly moddable, great(ish) community.

I had heard that it is a sadistic turn based RPG that kicks your ass over and over until you are able to somehow luck your way through it or something. The megaten series came to mind, a series of extremely difficult turn based RPGs that I hate.\n\nI was convinced by a friend to actually pick it up with the promise that the game is actually pretty fair most of the time, with the big important thing being making sure to prepare and strategize for what is up ahead. As it turns out this is correct and most people just suck really bad. Not to say that the game is easy by any means, many enemy encounters will have you sweating, and even seemingly easy enemy encounters can do enough damage to cause trouble or hit you with an effect that will disrupt your plans, but the game can be conquered if you really put your mind to it. \n\nA good example: One of the late game bosses humbled me after I had approached him with a little bit too much confidence and lost a unit before being forced to flee. For several days, whenever I was doing some menial task at work I started to think about the best way to counter this boss, taking all of the classes into mind. Then after over-preparing I nervously fought the boss again, to utterly destroy it because my strategy worked almost too well. THIS is what Darkest Dungeon is all about.\n\nWhen you start, you won't really know the thin line between over-preparing and under-preparing, but if you really put your mind to managing your resources then you'll nail it pretty quickly and start doing pretty well. After that you can move on to figuring out which flaws are minor and which ones are major, figuring out good team compositions and formations, and finding a good balance of gold and relics to take home, and then like me you'll find yourself coming back every once and a while to push just a little bit farther.\n\nTLDR: If you are looking for a really decent, challenging turn based RPG that is also kind of an army management game then here it is. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1690134892, "timestamp_updated": 1690134892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142638830": {"recommendationid": "142638830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355841832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 8797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8167, "last_played": 1697200648}, "language": "english", "review": "So many unforgettable moments with this game, like my veteran Flagellant bled out and died, or one of my team on death door and triggered the chain reaction of panic attack and they all died, 10/10 will play again.", "timestamp_created": 1690112985, "timestamp_updated": 1690112985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142629925": {"recommendationid": "142629925", "author": {"steamid": "76561199088813222", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1690396777}, "language": "english", "review": "\u200c\u200c", "timestamp_created": 1690099477, "timestamp_updated": 1690099477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142628004": {"recommendationid": "142628004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068079510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 45158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40013, "last_played": 1694153378}, "language": "english", "review": "The task ahead is terrible, and weakness cannot be tolerated.", "timestamp_created": 1690096214, "timestamp_updated": 1690096214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142626910": {"recommendationid": "142626910", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005430454", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1682743392}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally fucking kill me I hate this game sometimes like actually I might as well go down my local dumpster and find a more organized group of hippies there than whatever the fuck goes on in this game LIKE WHAT???? good game i like mechanincs takes much brain to get through tough times and what not, the amount of characters items and thingies make very replayable  just play Fear and Hunger and get used to that so that this game becomes like a stress reliever", "timestamp_created": 1690094226, "timestamp_updated": 1690094226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142624658": {"recommendationid": "142624658", "author": {"steamid": "76561199196371610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "playtime_at_review": 636, "last_played": 1700715854}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1] Probablemente, tu pr\u00f3ximo juego favorito. . .

No te encari\u00f1es con tus personajes, puesto que si muere, lo har\u00e1 permanentemente. \nTambi\u00e9n tendr\u00e1s que administrar de manera inteligente el dinero que ganas, puesto que hay muchos gastos qu\u00e9 cubrir a medida que avanzas en el juego. \nPor otro parte, si eres fan de [b] H.P Lovecraft [/b] tambi\u00e9n te recomendar\u00eda este juego, puesto que existen infinidad de referencias hacia el autor. \nSin duda, una compra m\u00e1s que recomendada.\n", "timestamp_created": 1690090329, "timestamp_updated": 1690090329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142622640": {"recommendationid": "142622640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147193636", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 25207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24719, "last_played": 1695784686}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite teambuilding games.

Progression is as slow as molasses, both in the \"meta\", and during combat, so I felt like I was just wasting my time.\n\nPositives: the artstyle is great, the high difficulty sells the gloomy atmosphere and lore, and the combat is punchy and satisfying (when attacks land, which they quite often don't).\n\nNot recommended for full price, but *maybe* recommend on sale.

challenging and addictive even at the easiest difficulty.Almost every class is well designed and balanced out and have their use in some way maybe except the flagellant which is broken af.The bosses are also really well thought out and most of their designs are eye-candy.Overall 10/10, a unique and well crafted roguelike experience.\n\nFarmstead  dlc is a really good addition to the base game introducing a new mechanic with the crystal farming and 2 more beautiful boss fights + you cannot really lose your heroes in the dlc area which is a really good addition imo. \n\nUnfortunately,the same cannot be said about the awful experience that is crimson court (DLC).Sure some trinkets are good but that cannot save the horrible artificial difficulty that resides in the ugly mob design.The worst part of it is that it forces the player to constantly worry and play the hideous and huge dlc area(courtyard) to save his characters from the crimson curse that random dlc mobs infested them with.(The whole dlc needs to be finished to stop worrying about the curse).Point is it could be done in a more enjoyable way but its so annoying that i cannot rate it more than a solid 1-2/10 (the last fight of the dlc is really cool tho).\n\nOnline play is whatever\n\nIn sort , a must-play for roguelike enjoyers i cannot recommend it more (turning a blind eye to the crimson court dlc).",

And it lives up to that. Your \"heroes\" are lost souls and desperate nobodies at the end of their luck with nowhere else to go and the game really makes you feel.\n\nI've had my eye on this game since it first came out and it is somewhat unbelievable that I waited until 2023 to get it. I wanted to hone my turn based skills in other games before i got this. This game really rewards preparedness and I prepared. It was very satisfying to build teams with synergies and plan out my strategies. The game isn't for everyone. The games difficulty wasn't mindless dungeon crawling and is more geared towards putting meticulous purpose in every action you take.\n\nWhile the game is great by itself, the dlcs are a must have, and the modding community is phenomenal. With the community content alone you could pump in 10 times more time into this game with all the content. I personally am satisfied with having only have near 100 hours into the game, but I certainly could put in more since I haven't delved deep into modding beyond a few extra classes. Red Hook making the game so easily moddable was a really smart move that has kept this game alive relevant. I would even recommend enabling mods on your first play through. This and the fact the game consistently goes on 85% discount, this game is a must have for anyone that enjoys turn based dungeon crawling fantasy combat.\n\nAlso the art style and narrator are really great.

But after playing more roguelike style games lately I wanted to play another, plus the sequel to this came out which is a lot more roguelike. I found a deal on cdkeys and was like why not. And hey, this game is actually really good! It's a bit confusing at the start, but you slowly start to \"get\" the game over time. I did play on the noob mode, but I read after that it mostly just saves time on grinding. The game can be rough and frustrating, but the more you play the more you realize that losing a hero doesn't really matter anymore. You can get an exact copy anyway. There are a lot of different mechanics, the most annoying one being stress but it's something interesting at the same time. The corpse mechanic was fun..though also kind of annoying lol. A lot of the game comes down to that I suppose. It's also very easy to mod, specially the faster combat mod was needed because the game is very slow by default. I beat all bosses on the in-game checklist and did the final dungeon 4 times to beat the game.

The lore for this game is pretty cool as well with it all being told in a H.P. Lovecraft manor. The ending may annoy people but i quite like it. There isn't really any characters except for the ancestor and i must say that his voice actor was perfect for this game. \nThe Settings are really well designed and have a lot of variety to them in both aesthetics and enemy types. \nVisually, its so cool. Performance was solid throughout my playtime with there being only one crash throughout my playtime. The art direction for this game is very fitting and adds a lot of depth and mystery to the game. I really like the tiny details such as the characters not having visible eyes making the feel a lot more discomforting. \nSound and audio are amazing with the soundtrack adding a lot of intensity and glory to the game and the audio choices for things such as using an item or hitting a critical hit just feel perfect for this game. \nIn terms of gameplay, it is so infectious. Now if you aren't a fan of difficult games or games that heavily rely on rng then you might want to skip this one. Every choice in this game you make is important and the amount of micromanaging might be annoying for some but i have to say that it is really feels great to use and allows me to create the most overpowered characters possible. Everything can be customised into a comp that suits you. The one stand out thing this game offers is the stress mechanic and it can really change up the way you approach encounters and it is really well developed.

I love this game. The atmosphere, the design, the concept, the options, it's all great.\n\nBUT, the UI is rough, and the random generation is sooo flawed. Perfect example: it takes forever to rank up, upgrade, curate quirks, supply, and develop one character, let alone the 10, or 20, or 30 needed to win. And you can have a character INSTANTLY killed on the first room, or last room by simply: every enemy goes first, strikes your unit, causes bleed, or blight, and you get knocked into a \"Deaths Door\" status, and then before any unit can heal or return fire - boom perma death. This happens on all difficulties, and really doesn't matter how much you prepare. The game tells you heroes will die. That's fine. But to spend so much time, effort, planning, items, upgrades, to have a unit wiped that way nearly ruins the experience. I've uninstalled and ignored this game for months because of it, and keep swapping reviews. \n\nULTIMATELY, I would recommend this game, on Radiant difficulty. But know that it's got some critical flaws. And it's not like FTL, where you can re-load, or bounce back easy. \n\nALSO, the DLC's are absolute garbage.

Not today[/h1]\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n[b]Darkest Dungeon (DD)[/b] is a unique game, as I never played a game as punishing as this one. With the sequel recently being released, my interest was piqued to try out the first game that I happened to already own but never spent much time playing, and I'm glad that I took the opportunity to check out this gothic-themed experience.\n\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Interesting gothic based story\n[*]Fun but brutal gameplay that is very punishing\n[*]Upgrades for your heroes, town, and more\n[*]Beautiful 2D gothic art style\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Playing this game can be a chore at times due to the needed grind\n[*]There are times when you will be reliant on RNG and it might screw you over\n[*]Activating some of the DLCs on your first playthrough is not recommended\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story starts out with a man known as the [b]Ancestor[/b]; he learns of this special power that is somewhere deep in his mansion. He then uses up his family\u2019s remaining fortune to hire people to help him dig up this mysterious power. However, it turns out that this power was something worldly and he ran from the dungeon. Only the [b]ancestry[/b] survived and he wrote a letter to the next heir of the family, to fix the mistake he made. After he sealed the letter and before the angry mob of villagers that were mad for what he did could get him, the [b]Ancestor[/b] had ended his life.\n\nThe story for [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is not fully told to you directly, rather, it\u2019s told to you at different points in the game, mainly before you do boss missions. It\u2019s interesting at the very least and I like the gothic [b]Cthulhu mythos[/b] theme it has going for it. Although [b]DD[/b] takes inspiration from the [b]Lovecraftian[/b] universe, there are also different inspirations that are included as well. The heroes you hire also have back stories to them as well.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay for [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is fun but also very challenging and at the same time, it can be very difficult to grasp. There are many mechanics that you yourself have to try and get used to. You will be able to hire different heroes that each have different abilities for them to use. Each of them also may have a different mechanic that corresponds to them, however, they all do share the stress feature. Stress in the game is determined by what the hero goes through in a given situation. When stress reaches 100, that hero will have a certain negative Affliction inflicted on them, like them being fearful, paranoid, etc. \n\nHowever, there is a chance that some heroes will be given a virtue when they reach 100 stress, they get increased stats and will randomly heal themselves. So, while most heroes get afflictions and break, others will use their stressful moments as something to encourage themselves. If a hero gets to 200 stress, they will lose the virtue and go back to zero stress, while those with afflictions suffer a heart attack.\n\nDuring combat, your heroes can do certain attacks or abilities to buff/debuff allies or enemies. Each hero has a certain amount of health and it does vary, when their health runs out they will be put under a [b]Death\u2019s Door[/b] status. When they are in this state, they will suffer state penalties and they have to go through a test to see if they will survive the next attack. I should note that if your hero is at 1 health and the enemies attack them with a move that does a lot of damage, they will tank the entire attack except the one damage. The only way for a hero to die is by failing the [b]Death\u2019s Door[/b] test.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995283070\nIf a hero suffers a heart attack while at [b]Death\u2019s Door[/b], they will be killed immediately, when a hero dies, they are lost for good and will also lose the equipped charms they have. You can recover them if you lose a hero in battle but if it\u2019s outside of one, they are gone completely. So pray that your best heroes survive the attacks and that their stress does not get too high.\n\nThere are ways to relieve stress, like taking out enemies or using a camping ability at a campsite. If your heroes survive the mission, you sent them on, you can send them to a few stress-reducing activities like making them meditate, drink at the bar, gamble, pray, etc. There are also times when a hero will get a disease, so you must take them to the [b]Sanitarium[/b] for them to get cured. A hero can get a max of three diseases, if they happen to get another one, it will just replace one of the current diseases they have. Last I checked diseases don\u2019t necessarily work like that but who knows, I am not a medical expert.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995282569\nI should at least give a little tip/warning that if any hero happens to get stunned, for them to recover it will take that hero's turn. Enemies get the same treatment as well. In other words, [b]Red Hook Studios[/b] took some inspiration from the original [b]Persona 3[/b] game and wanted to bring back memories.\n\nCertain moves will also only be available for you to use if that hero is in a certain spot in the party. If they happened to get moved or pushed back, they will be unable to use certain attacks or support abilities. It\u2019s understandable for some attacks but for others it\u2019s absolutely stupid - like, the [b]Vestal[/b] can\u2019t use her [b]Divine Grace[/b] or [b]Divine Comfort[/b] abilities, which heal party members, if she is in the front. I understand that she is a support hero but it\u2019s still pretty dumb that she can\u2019t use those abilities if she happens to be pushed into the front.\n\nNow as much as [b]DD[/b] is fun, there are a few issues with the game that don\u2019t hinder the experience but can be a turn-off for some people. Playing [b]DD[/b] can be a chore sometimes, you will have to do a lot of grinding depending on the difficulty that you choose. This is normal for an [b]RPG[/b] like this game but it can get very repetitive for some people. To add to the fact is that the game also relies on RNG for almost everything that happens in it. Trust me, when your hero misses an attack you will feel pain.\n\nSome of the DLCs in the game are also not recommended to be activated on your very first playthrough. Ones like the [b]Butcher\u2019s Circus[/b] (which is online PvP) or the [b]Musketeer[/b] are fine because they just add features that don\u2019t hinder the experience for the player. However, DLCs like the [b]Crimson Court[/b] add stuff like more grind, a very annoying status debuff, and is just punishing to new players. Buy the DLC on your first playthrough if you just want an even more painful experience.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]\nThe art style for [b]DD[/b] is absolutely beautiful, I love the gothic-based art style that the game has going for it, and is very detailed. I experienced no issues while I was playing the game.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995283203\nI tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. \n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nThere is a lot that I haven\u2019t talked about with [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] as there are numerous things to uncover from the game. If you are someone who wants to play a very punishing game, then this is the right one for you and you will get your money\u2019s worth because a playthrough could go up to at least 50+ hours.\n\n[quote] Women and men' soldiers and outlaws; fools and corpses.

Once you understand the mechanics and some strategies for it, Darkest Dungeon is up there with Morrowind. Most people that try games with in-depth mechanics and punishment for bad decisions just tend to say the game is unfair and uninstall it after they refused to learn or play by the game's rules. This game gave me that feeling of \"eh, just one more dungeon\" after every completed quest. This game rewards you for being good at it. It makes you feel smart once you understand the basics and play under the constraints (rules) that the game explicitly warns you about every time you boot it up. It's nothing but honest to a fault.\n\nThe music, art style, voice acting, and tone of the game are good. The combat loop can be addictive and it never makes you feel comfortable with it. The moment you get cocky, the game slaps you across the face and staunchly reminds you to not be too confident simply because you think you've mastered it. Most of the time when your party dies it's because it's usually your fault. Some people don't like that and that's fine.

Despite having a pretty lackluster tutorial, once you start to understand the meat of the game with party composition, prepping, and all the optimal rng picks to make as you fight through the turn based battles, it can be a pretty engaging loop. It takes a different mindset than most games as you are bound to simply get wiped out at different points, often due entirely to bad luck, but it seems as though the game was designed around it. My only real gripes with the game are that too often it expects you to learn through trial and error on large scales, resulting in you unknowingly being party wiped at any given moment. It also starts to feel a bit tedious having only made it 20 hours in, and I think the novelty of the party mixing and matching is less effective once you reach mid game.

Nearly 200 hours! You must really like Darkest Dungeon, right?\n\nWrong. Darkest dungeon is a roguelite with a fantastic start, and a woeful endgame. A wonderful idea twisted into a horrible, bloated mess - which I suppose is fitting given the theme.\n\nStandard opening: Who the hell am I? I'm the guy who;\n\n-Likes a good indie RPG.\n-Likes a new mechanic\n-Is a working adult with a full-time job\n-Is not a 100% completionist\n-Likes \"Lovecraftian\" a little more than \"Lovecraft\"\n-But okay, 'Mountains of Madness' wasn't bad\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a turn-based, dungeon crawl roguelike, set in a Lovecraftian world. You are tasked with recruiting various classes of hero into your roster, sending them out to fight the darkness. Over the course of the playthrough you will likely see many heroes fall, but with (an awful lot of) determination you will see you town and heroes grow, and push against the darkness.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is incredibly well-stylised, and works its limited graphics better than almost any game I have seen. The artwork itself is extremely limited and the animation barely existent but time has been taken to make the transitions and feel right. This is complemented by an iconic narrator whose tone and extent of contributions meant that I never grew tired of listening to them.\n\nSuch is the commitment to the Lovecraftian concept, that your party members have not only a health meter but a sanity meter. In practice this means little more than juggling two health bars, but thematically it works well. Darkest dungeon is unusual in that its bullshit-o-meter runs absolutely off the scale - one enemy crit cascade added fifteen hours to my playthrough. However it all seems to tie in to the theme well.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is enjoyable, challenging, well-written and generally well-presented indie RPG. I have no doubt whatsoever that you will enjoy it.\n\nThe start of it, at least.\n\nSee, Darkest Dungeon expresses some quite astonishing delusions of grandeur about its own lifespan. This is a game that you can happily sink 30 hours into, whose \"abridged\" campaign will take closer to 80, and whose unabridged campaign is probably closer to 150. It has no business being as long as it is. The four areas have two bosses each. For no reason other than length you fight these bosses three times each. And you grind and grind and grind.\n\nWhen eventually the bosses are done, the end-game doubles down on the pain with the sort of level design they should teach out of you on day 1 of design school. Overly long dungeons that, should a character die (at which point your run is to all intents and purposes over) you must kill another character to retreat. Two enemies critted my full-health Vestal back-to-back, and she died from the resulting bleed. I retreated and lost my tank. Lacking another appropriate healer and tank (because characters can only take end-game dungeons once?!) I had to grind up from level 2 a new party. WHY?!\n\nI have finally completed Darkest Dungeon and now can put it to bed. An exercise in how to outstay your welcome.

Y no hay duda de que lo ha conseguido excavando hondo, hasta lo m\u00e1s profundo del g\u00e9nero.\n\nPuede que Darkest Dungeon no sea para todo el mundo, pero eso es exactamente lo que hace que si disfrutas de un juego con personalidad, lo hagas por partida doble. Pero es que este peque\u00f1o gran juego de rol y estrategia por turnos no tiene compasi\u00f3n por los m\u00e1s impacientes. Desde el primer momento te pide una concentraci\u00f3n extrema mientras sus tutoriales te explican lo b\u00e1sico y el resto ya lo aprender\u00e1s por el camino.\n\nEl argumento es aqu\u00ed menor protagonista, pero lo poco que se nos cuenta para arrancar la aventura es suficiente: un familiar nos escribe una carta donde nos revela que somos el \u00fanico heredero de unas tierras y la mansi\u00f3n familiar que en una ocasi\u00f3n brillaron con esplendor, pero que ahora est\u00e1n asoladas por un antiguo mal que ha despertado al intentar excavar en las ruinas sobre las que se construy\u00f3 el gran caser\u00f3n.

Todo en una distribuci\u00f3n bastante cl\u00e1sica de juego de rol por turnos, en los que podremos realizar todo tipo de ataques o hacer uso de habilidades \u00fanicas de cada clase. Y si algo tiene Darkest Dungeon, es una gran cantidad de clases entre las que elegir, que fomenta la rejugabilidad del t\u00edtulo y hace que cada combate se tenga que afrontar de distinta forma.\nverdadera mec\u00e1nica del juego es en su sistema de estr\u00e9s y cordura y en la necesidad de mantener a un buen n\u00famero de h\u00e9roes en buen estado mental. Estas criaturas de pesadilla est\u00e1n basadas en el horror c\u00f3smico de Lovecraft, y como muchos juegos antes que \u00e9l, siempre que se aborda este tipo de terror, se juega con la cordura y locura de nuestros personajes. A medida que vamos avanzando por las mazmorras ir\u00e1n acumulando estr\u00e9s y si llega a un l\u00edmite su determinaci\u00f3n se pondr\u00e1 a prueba, lo que dar\u00e1 lugar a sacar lo mejor o lo peor de s\u00ed mismos. Pero si alcanza el l\u00edmite ser\u00e1 pr\u00e1cticamente como haberlos perdido en combate.\n\nEste sistema lo envuelve todo, porque mientras que vamos aliviando a nuestros personajes en el pueblo, tendr\u00e1n que ser sustituidos por otros. Y esto significa que tendremos que utilizar a todo nuestro grupo frecuentemente si no queremos que los reservas se queden con poco nivel. Porque aqu\u00ed, una muerte es irrecuperable y si tus otros personajes no est\u00e1n a la altura, no podr\u00e1s continuar con la aventura.\n\nAs\u00ed que, mientras que unos entran en las mazmorras m\u00e1s oscuras, otros tendr\u00e1n que descansar y relajarse en el pueblo. Seg\u00fan su condici\u00f3n, algunos preferir\u00e1n la Taberna, mientras que otros querr\u00e1n rezar a entidades superiores en la Abad\u00eda. Todo ello har\u00e1 que disminuya el estr\u00e9s y est\u00e9n listos para combatir. Pero a lo largo de su carrera tambi\u00e9n ir\u00e1n desarrollando otro tipo de filias y fobias que habr\u00e1 que curar en el Sanatorio, pues si se acumulan demasiadas podr\u00e1n llegar a ser demasiado imprevisibles e incontrolables.\nTodo ello aparte de ir mejorando sus habilidades en el Gremio, para lograr que los ataques sean m\u00e1s poderosos o las curaciones m\u00e1s eficientes, y mejorar el equipo en la herrer\u00eda o las dotes de liderazgo para las acampadas. Demasiadas gestiones para el poco dinero del que disponemos en cada incursi\u00f3n, pues todo en Darkest Dungeon es tremendamente caro. Hay otra moneda de cambio: los bustos, emblemas, escrituras y cuadros que encontramos en las mazmorras nos ayudar\u00e1n a mejorar cada establecimiento y lograr que los precios bajen un porcentaje.\nY as\u00ed, van pasando las semanas en el juego, las mazmorras se van haciendo m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles y tendremos que ir derrotando a los jefazos que nos esperan al final de cada una de ellas; seguir subiendo de nivel, seguir cuidando de nuestros h\u00e9roes mientras contratamos nuevos en la Diligencia. Es por ello que quiz\u00e1 el mayor problema que hemos tenido con Darkest Dungeon es que se puede volver algo rutinario y acusa esa repetici\u00f3n de actividades al tener que ir con paciencia, poco a poco, donde las novedades van siendo cada vez m\u00e1s escasas. Es cierto que su mec\u00e1nica principal es tan atractiva que te mantiene enganchado al teclado y rat\u00f3n durante mucho tiempo, pero se echan de menos establecimientos y habilidades avanzadas que nos hagan replantearnos de nuevo toda la aventura, ya que mucho de su contenido se desbloquea en los primeros compases del juego\nDonde no hay pega alguna es en sus decisiones de dise\u00f1o. Red Hook ha sido muy inteligente al crear un sistema de exploraci\u00f3n 2D que le da personalidad propia con unos dibujos de gran calidad y, sobre todo, una gran contundencia en las batallas, en las que se siente cada golpe propinado y cada cuchillo o hechizo lanzado. A esta contundencia ayuda mucho el sonido, visceral y buen mezclado, junto a una voz del narrador atronadora y unos mon\u00f3logos fenomenalmente escritos y que ambientan a la perfecci\u00f3n. El juego adem\u00e1s cuenta con traducci\u00f3n a nuestro idioma, algo que se hab\u00eda echado de menos en los primeros compases del t\u00edtulo como Early Access.", "timestamp_created": 1687328950, "timestamp_updated": 1687328950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140420808": {"recommendationid": "140420808", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975648654", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7399, "last_played": 1690587398}, "language": "english", "review": "From the mechanics to the replay-ability to the art style and grim, feisty atmosphere just a simply solid game.", "timestamp_created": 1687316148, "timestamp_updated": 1687316148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140420045": {"recommendationid": "140420045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081088530", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 290, "playtime_at_review": 2135, "last_played": 1700781025}, "language": "english", "review": "Simultaneously challenging yet, simple if you already know role playing game concepts. it has simple turn-based combat with the keys being team composition, marching orders, matching strengths against weakness and supply selection.

dungeon, then if you leave the dungeon you lose those supplies and have to buy them again when you go back out. WHY? Why wouldn't I keep my supplies that I bought with my hard earned money, especially with such a miserly economy? It's ridiculous and feels like it just artificially makes the game harder and not in a good way.\n\nTo make the cheap economy worse, you can go 80% through a dungeon and still not have picked up enough 'loot' to justify the equipment you bought to make the dungeon run. So leaving before the end leaves you screwed. Do that a few times and you're so broke you have to start a new game. Then again continue with such damaged characters and someone or more will probably die. Not a good design IMO.\n\nNext you are always dealing with stress. And one enemy puts 17 stress on ALL your characters in one hit, but then your only recourse is a skill that ONE of your guys has that takes a full turn, but only cures A COUPLE of points of fear on ONE person. WOW. GEE, thanks for NOTHING. IF they survive the dungeon run, back at town stress persists and you have to pay a LOT of money for LITTLE stress relief. Again, stupidly cheap, intentionally frustrating economy.\n\nAlso you can't get attached to your characters because chintzy economy and worthless 'healing' mentioned above and practically forcing you to complete dungeons when people are badly injured and stressed.\n\nAlso adding to above, some of your characters just get focused like crazy no matter what position they're in or what aggro taking abilities you have on other characters. They all just INSIST on taking that one character out. Again, don't get attached to any characters.\n\nAnd by the way, who the heck are YOU? \n\nYou are supposed to be the owner of the land this desecrated castle is upon, but then you don't actually appear in the game as a character. Bizarre. Of course they had to go with such a weird design decision as YOU would just die anyway like everyone else in your broke impoverished healing-free party and the story couldn't progress. This decision ruins immersion and makes you as attached to the story as you are to the characters you pick, which is to say not at all.\n\nFrustrating and disappointing. \nArtificially 'hard' to impress elitists / masochists, all for all the wrong reasons.\nSorry but I suspect the majority thumbs this up, then plays a couple more hours then NEVER touches it again.\nCompletion rate is probably 1% and that is NOT a thumbs up game IMO.", "timestamp_created": 1687212310, "timestamp_updated": 1687262178, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140355178": {"recommendationid": "140355178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072396984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 15811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11503, "last_played": 1693434683}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una F por Dismas, que muri\u00f3 de una forma est\u00fapida en la semana 275.", "timestamp_created": 1687209449, "timestamp_updated": 1687209449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140315566": {"recommendationid": "140315566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140342396", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 2707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2707, "last_played": 1686100468}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is intent on wasting your time, and I do get it. It slaps you over the face with a through line that you're trading meat for knowledge and progress. They give you so many cute little options to do things like change your units\u2019 appearance name to ask you to care about them and it is a trick to ask you to waste your time. The core gameplay of dungeon delving is almost as horrifying in that every animation and move between rooms is excruciatingly slow. That means that not only is your time customizing the characters at stake, but the entire cumulative time of dungeons cleared and stress reduced is what you're risking when a character dies. This was genuinely intolerable for me when I first approached this game and I put it aside for later, presumably when I was better at video games.\n\nActual years passed, and I saw Black Reliquary release. It looked cool, so I poked around and saw it was a mod pack which was much more difficult than the base game, so if I wanted to engage with that fully, I might as well try this game. Looking through the mods of this game is very difficult because most of the collections arrange by users have completely unhelpful (predominately pornographic) imagery as thumbnails. Some of the quality-of-life mods are in all the most popular collections, and they are additionally bundled with cosmetic mods which may or may not be up to personal taste. \n\nAs an aside, it can be considered unfortunate that the only consistent reskins of the game's assets are nsfw. I suspect this is because all the work it takes to bring a complete 'character' to life, which includes specialized animation knowledge, demands more than a hobbyist engagement. While there is a way to fund indie projects where it is free for everyone once it is completed, that crowdfunding model structurally favors porn, to be blunt. That fact is clear, but the why is well beyond the scope of this review. Know simply that the mods for making characters and npcs look different which are sfw are few and far between and are likely to have disparate and incompatible art directions.\n\nWhat I did personally was download all the mods that steam marked my friends as having also subscribed to. I got all of the quality-of-life mods necessary to make most of the game's problems far more bearable, and it clicked for me. The game is a very tidy rpg if only it wasn't \"pretentious\" in hammering in the point of how brutal and high stakes it is precisely by wasting so much of your time. That said, my mod selection contained beastiality imagery, so I would strongly advise having more discretion than I did. \n\nAfter completing the first quest of the Darkest Dungeon, the game begins employing graphical tricks I would merely describe as 'cute' to try and emphasize a turn for horror. I won't be specific about what happens but suffice it to say I got tired of it over the course of two hours. I've had mostly negative things to say about the game and honestly, I probably should disown the game as a grindy piece of garbage which is intent on wasting your time, but that mod support really can salvage it. Mileage varies, but an assortment of \"speed increase\" and \"automatic save\" mods can go a long way in making the game accessible and breezy experience. If you have nostalgia for a difficulty implementation which resembles 'getting punched in the nads really hard and being told to go back and doing the entire section over again, perhaps with even less resources than before', the base experience and difficulty options remain.", "timestamp_created": 1687148611, "timestamp_updated": 1687236551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140288469": {"recommendationid": "140288469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198902467825", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1694823581}, "language": "english", "review": ":)", "timestamp_created": 1687107809, "timestamp_updated": 1687107809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140287305": {"recommendationid": "140287305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066757232", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1696455311}, "language": "spanish", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1687106404, "timestamp_updated": 1687106404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140283566": {"recommendationid": "140283566", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990449038", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1456, "last_played": 1687104151}, "language": "english", "review": "Great lovecraftian turn based game.

There are rooms that you move through each with a myriad of traps, monsters, or just nothing. You balance a party of four from a larger roster of fighters that you accrue. As with RPGs - weapons, potions, armor, position, skill, class all play integral roles in a careful balance between squad success or squad wipe.\n\nIf a game draws me in consistently on first play through then it gets a favored position in my library.\n\nEDIT: However, upon regular play through, the game is slanted towards the player always on the edge of a major threat. It feels forced and manufactured to create a tension heavy playing experience. To me, this is inauthentic as a mechanic because it becomes a game of finding the \"goldilocks\" zone rather than being properly prepared for each dungeon encounter. In fact, you might be better off being less prepared because then the game might artificially balance it towards your favor. \n\nOn my last playthrough I tried to intentionally wipe my party and that was harder than actually putting in an effort the time before that trying to keep them alive. That's when I knew something was seriously amiss with the balancing. \n\nI had high hopes that this was a true strategic experience and it falls way short of anything resembling strategy that could be impactful towards your playstyle.

So there is no perfect solution, as where I fit as a player. But besides that, the game is great. It's very frustrating and there is a learning curve. But I still would recommend.

[u]But my own thoughts on the game have changed,[/u] I do still enjoy it despite it's frustrations - namely overcoming them. If you enjoy a ruthless challenge and seek to triumph in the face of adversity, then I would absolutely recommend the game.\n\nOriginal review:\nThe game is fun, for the most part. But by the end-game a single mistake can cost you hours of work trying to make heroes resolve rank 6, which isn't helped by how evasive and dangerous enemies get in champion levels.\nIt's so unbelievably frustrating to, for example; [i]need[/i] a hero with the guard ability for the 2nd Darkest Dungeon, but every hero who reached high enough level to enter that location getting killed due to negligence and/or unlucky RNG, forcing you to re-train another one from scratch (even with all the stagecoach upgrades, the chances of specifically getting a rank 3 guard hero are slim, and still requires a ton of money and work to make them viable for DD).\n\nI've had the game since early access - back when it was a viable strategy to have four heroes with the abusive affliction and go on pure dark runs, as heart attacks didn't exist back then - but was never able to beat it. And my latest playthrough to cross that off my bucket list has been plagued by scenarios like those described above, routinely sending hours of work down the drain.\n\nThe game is undeniably good - great storytelling, music and nail-biting difficulty. But if you're like me, there's only so much frustration that you can take before your enjoyment is completely soured. (It wasn't helped by the fact that I accidentally loaded a save before my mods had been prepared, which outright deleted half my roster of modded heroes. That's my own fault, I'll concede, but its still hurts since there's no way to go back to an older save to fix that mistake).\n\nTL;DR: The game is good, but simply not for me.

Unbelievable tension, I don't think any game has kept me so tense in my entire life.\n\nWhat is Darkest Dungeon exactly, and what makes the game sucj a rollercoaster of stress and satisfaction?\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a lovecraftian turn-based RPG with beautiful (or frightening) hand drawn lovecraftian-inspired character, enemy and environment designs. And does the game inspire fear with more elements than just its graphics...the bleakness that surrounds the game is directly translated into tough gameplay, intrincated mechanics and tough enemies.\n\nDarkest Dungeon's most notable feature is the stress meter, which is a separate bar just above your health bar which will cause a trigger when it reaches its mid-point, with impacting consequences. Would the stress meter be full, your character could very well suffer a heart attack. It's just awesome, specailly in a game where you can continuously recruit new \u00bfheroes? but yet has a nasty permadeath mechanic.\n\nThis doesn't mean the game doesn't give you tools to go through its many dungeons: there are roughly over a dozen different classes to choose from and many combinations to try. Trial and error is vital in this game since it follows its own rules and mechanics, and experimenting with different party combinations made my day. Mercenaries can be upgraded when leveled-up and they can learn new abilites. Knowing who t chosse, or which abilities to pich depending on the different zones in the game, is crucial.\n\nAnd whil the learning curve is steep at the beginning, with enough effort you can more or less master the game and its mechanics, competently entering dungeons with a high chances of success. But all it takes is one unlucky fight for things to get ugly...enemies will not want to make this wasy for you, specially when encountering new ones, and while the variety is just okay, some enemy party combinations have the potential to trash your party depending on its composition and placement. Big shout to the area bossess which are all not only way tougher than regular enemies, but also possess their own, and very flavorful gimmicks which you will have to learn and master...or face death. And don't get me started with the final zone of the game...you thought you had it all under control but there's a good difficulty spike there (and also a highly impacting design decision that will irritate some...and make others clap in respect to the flaour).\n\nThis game is not only challenging but also lenghty enough, at about 60hours to reach full completion.\n\nFor its current price tag, I would totally give it a try, and would recommend people to see if the kind of tense, pseudo-masochistic fun that Darkest Dungeon provides its their kind of spice. For me it's a 9,5/10 masterpiece.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1686599432, "timestamp_updated": 1686599432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139959162": {"recommendationid": "139959162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115624561", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1687355479}, "language": "english", "review": "g\u00fczel garda\u015f al\u0131n oynay\u0131n\n", "timestamp_created": 1686594554, "timestamp_updated": 1686594554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139951271": {"recommendationid": "139951271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098145828", "num_games_owned": 894, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 6036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5467, "last_played": 1686947956}, "language": "english", "review": "(+)\n\nDeep, complex gameplay allowing for refined and variable strategies\nTough, challenging\nLots of content\nGreat art/sound design\n\n(-)\n\nThe UI is very unpolished.

DCC is an rpg where each player starts out with four characters, who all go through a level-0 adventure, called a Funnel. The game is extremely lethal and regularly unfair, and any character who survives that first excursion levels up and gets the privilege of being a main character. Darkest Dungeon is that experience in video-game form, you watch a herd of characters slowly grow and suffer over a protracted period, and it's really something special. The mechanics are frequently frustrating, but it feels deliberate. If the idea of having a bad time on purpose turns you off, you should probably stay miles away from DD. If you're a fan of pokemon nuzlockes, you're probably going to love this one. \nIf I have to levy any real criticisms, runs go on a bit too long. The game's very punishing, but it's bad at telling you when you've lost. I don't know if I've ever actually scrubbed out of a DD run, but I've conceded a lot of them.

These heroic badasses frequently swagger into labryinths, smash all the bad guys, steal all the loot, and when necessary, resurrect themselves with reckless abandon. But usually, these heroes are human beings. Humans can become frightened, they can have doubts, they can lose their minds and even betray their allies when their survival is threatened. They can succumb to post-traumatic stress after particularly harrowing experiences. These traits are at odds with the daring depictions of heroic characters, and so they are glossed over or sugarcoated. In Darkest Dungeon, they are an integral part of the game.\n\nBefore the events of the narrative, the player character's long-lost relative contacts them via letter, explaining that he has done something horribly wrong and paid for it dearly. He was a bored, jaded nobleman, and one day decided to investigate the rumors of an interdimensional portal underneath his castle. The rumors were true, and he unleashed a grotesque, terrifying horde of creatures on the surrounding countryside. The horrors were enough to drive him mad, and after summoning his estranged relative, he commits suicide.\n\nUpon arrival in the hamlet beneath the hills of the haunted family mansion, I was given a small group of adventurers and a bleak message from the game itself, informing me that bad things were going to happen. I collected my eager, fresh band of heroes and an assortment of provisions (no Xanax, unfortunately), and then descended into the darkness for glory and treasure. Well, that\u2019s what I hoped to find - more often I found derangement and despair. Every mission in Darkest Dungeon is randomly generated, with new rooms and hallways filled with curios, wealth, traps, and monsters. Whenever I reached a chest, corpse, or bookshelf to investigate, random effects would occur depending on my party\u2019s statistics and provisions. Sometimes we were awarded some gold, or a trap would spring and inflict a party member with a terrible disease. Most of these encounters are avoidable, but the fights are not.\n\nInstead of the tiles found in earlier roguelikes, Darkest Dungeon uses a two-dimensional presentation. During fights, my party of four was arranged to the left of the enemy party of 1-4, and opportunities are determined by the placement of a character within the formation. My arbalest-bearer, for instance, is better towards the back of the party, where she has enough room to shoot her crossbow. The healers like to be in the middle, and the paladins and shieldbearers belong up front. Party abilities can synergize with each other for tactical advantages - the jester can shuffle the party around and open up combo opportunities, while the bounty hunter can \"mark\" targets for big bonuses from other members. Of course, enemies can also do these things, and they have an AI capable of taking every possible advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the health of my heroes that I\u2019m concerned with. Some enemies, as well as the conditions of the dungeon, can inflict stress damage. Stress is a secondary form of damage that, if accumulated too quickly, will generate quirks, neurotic tendencies, and downright psychosis. My heroes would crack when the burden got too high and lose their nerve, suffering from masochism, selfishness, or other maladies, which can lead to lost turns and increased stress on their allies. One of my first paladins, Reynauld, is a degenerate kleptomaniac, prone to stealing treasure in the field and keeping it for himself. One of my healers has an obsession with sainthood and takes every opportunity to martyr herself. My favorite highwayman suffers from alcoholism, and so on and so forth. These afflictions, as well as the myriad diseases that can be contracted in these filthy environments, can all be cured at the local sanitarium - for a price. Stress can be reduced via religious devotion and nighttime revelry, but all of this is only possible for heroes who are actually able to survive the expedition, which is a tall order. Heroes who die are permanently lost, but green recruits arrive weekly in the village. Little did they know they would become just another resource to me, as expendable as the torches and rations that accompanied them on their forays.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a mixture of stylish comic-like characters and a dark, gothic environment. The fingerprints of Lovecraft and Poe can be seen everywhere, from the tentacled monsters of the cove to the iron bars of the asylum. The effects match the theme perfectly - during battles, fighters cut into the foreground when they attack, and their model switches to a horrified grimace when something bad happens, like losing their mind. Movement animations are simple, but the character models are very detailed in their 2D way.\n\nThe music was composed by Canadian musician Stuart Chatwood, who also worked on 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'. It is heavy on the strings and Victorian flavor, and like the gameplay, is deep, dark, and depressing. The narrator (whose character is the dead former proprietor of the castle) is the only voice besides enemy barks, and his pained, guttural delivery is excellent.\n\nIt's thick roguelike influences means that Darkest Dungeon is the kind of game that thrives when it is played over and over. Every dungeon is procedurally generated, every chest has a chance at strange fortune, and every new character offers a different set of abilities. Even when times are tough (and they will be tough, I assure you) upgrades can be made to the village facilities that slowly improve the heroes\u2019 quality of life and chance at survival. In turn, the dungeons also get more challenging.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is the rare game that gets my heart pumping while playing, not because it\u2019s scary (even though it is a little scary), but because the stakes are so high. One battle can make the difference between waltzing out flush with loot, and returning home defeated, with the party dead or completely insane. It will punish your mistakes and it will even punish your good fortune, on the rare occasion it happens. Despite all of this, or perhaps because of it, I cannot seem to stop playing Darkest Dungeon.", "timestamp_created": 1686160024, "timestamp_updated": 1688936940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139697236": {"recommendationid": "139697236", "author": {"steamid": "76561199062808433", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 4405, "last_played": 1700411700}, "language": "english", "review": "face your defeat.", "timestamp_created": 1686158583, "timestamp_updated": 1686158583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139690487": {"recommendationid": "139690487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054918148", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9582, "last_played": 1587058759}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing!", "timestamp_created": 1686149124, "timestamp_updated": 1686149124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139687106": {"recommendationid": "139687106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201186670", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3225, "last_played": 1683732680}, "language": "english", "review": "Ruin... has come to my party....

severe oversight. Economy/Base-Building Side is very satisfying.\n\nA game to recommend to someone for all of the wrong reasons.\n\nThis game should not be fun. It just shouldn't be.\n\nYou get punished for doing a good thing, you get punished for doing a bad thing, and occasionally, randomly, you get fucked because the game decided it's Fuck-O'Clock in the morning and you look ripe for the pickin'.\n\nSurprising an enemy sounds like a good idea, right? Well, not in this game. Because surprising an enemy doesn't net you an extra turn, rather just you all go first. So, if you can't kill all of them in one turn, the enemy now gets 2, 3, or 4 turns to fuck up your guys without any recourse.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the RNG is incredibly biased, or at the very least feels biased, towards the enemy. They will consistently crit and land low-chance hits while they dodge every attack aimed back at them. This compounds into the problem of surprising enemies actually not being a good thing, because enemies will line their ducks up, then proceed to double-crit a party member, promptly kill them, and all because you managed to surprise them, which is a random event in this game.\n\nMake no mistake, this game is very fun and satisfying when it wants to be. Landing hefty blows in the 30s and 40s of damage is incredibly satisfying when you've built a party or character for that purpose. But my god, this game is an even tug-of-war game at its fairest, and a suicide mission at its worst.\n\nAs far as the economy sides of things goes, collecting treasure and upgrading buildings and managing your party through the Hamlet, it actually feels fairly balanced. Everything is a decision, there is no willy-nilly buying upgrades. The upgrades feel well-priced, allowing you to usually upgrade one or two party members per run, with some money spent towards recuperation. The Trinkets, the Busts, Portraits, Deeds, and Crests, work very well as resources, requiring you to hold onto them as treasures in the place of gold or other valuable items, or adventuring supplies, like torches, food, or curatives, forcing you to prioritize expanding your town or resting, recuperating, and fortifying your adventurers. \n\nThe Trinkets as a system and as part of the Hamlet, are well-designed and play into the games focus on careful decision-making, even if that focus is shot in the knees by some odd design choices and really wack RNG.", "timestamp_created": 1686045436, "timestamp_updated": 1686045436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139630353": {"recommendationid": "139630353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398393047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4714, "last_played": 1688896053}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]The old road will take you to hell,but in that gaping abyss we will find our redemption.[/h1]\n\n[b]This game is definitely one of the best turn-based role-playing games for sure and a masterpiece at that.It is pretty stress inducing,but it is really immersive and beautiful in a way that I can't describe.[/b]\nThe story is interesting.You play the role of a heir who has to solve your ancestor's fucked up mistakes.\n[b]The narrator really did an amazing job making the game so much more immersive than it already is.So did\nthe soundtrack.[/b]\nThe gameplay is awesome.You can have varying heroes with unique abilities for each party.Monsters come in various sizes and weaknesses,so is the same for your heroes.You have to think about a lot of things,resources and state of your party.\n[b]The best part of the game is that it makes you feel a part of it.

I completed the first of three missions after losing 2 or 3 entire high-level parties (which, believe it or not, are incredibly tedious to replace-- note I say tedious, not difficult); I tried the second of three several times, losing as many if not more heroes. thematically the DD is amazing, but it just unravels the fun of the game up to it. so I considered that save done. really, it's that easy. you can do literally everything else in the game without so much as looking at the final quest, so if you end up feeling the same you can just not do it. I understand that's frustrating for some, so know before you buy that the very end is not the same as the rest.\n\ndespite that criticism, my only major critique of the game, I still highly recommend this title. I got this game on sale for 5$, but it's definitely worth the full 25$. I put nearly 100 hours into this game, with something like 90 of them being pre-Darkest Dungeon on my first save, and something like 5 being with the final missions. overall that's great value even at full price without considering just how excellent nearly every aspect of the game is.

I could not figure out what caused the black magic in the first place or the change in intro towards boss dungeons without watching a video after I completed the game. Then again you are not really playing this game for the story, but for the roguelike dungeon experience. Voice acting, music and sounds are top-notch especially during lower torch levels. It actually made me feel anxious about progressing.\n\n[h2] Graphics/Level-Design/World [/h2]\nVisually the art style fits the game and is unique, everything from the abilities, character design and the dungeon itself looked great. Each of the zones looked unique and you could tell what zone you are in without a name just from enemies and the environment. The only design direction I did not like was how some characters like the Hellion have a large head proportional to her body, kind of making her look like a Chibi. Enemy wise, they matched their zone with their resistances being relevant such as more blight resistance in the warrens. The only issue I have with the enemies is how their stats are presented, I understand this is roguelike but nowhere in the game glossary or hover is it explained the effect of value of resistances. For instance I have been able to stun an enemy with 50 stun resistance but in the 60+ hours I\u2019ve played I have not stunned 100, 200 or 300 enemies yet for blight I have managed to get it to proc enemies with up to 150+. It\u2019s the same for acc on enemies. Why do I need to use the wiki to find out a swine ability hit rate is 82.5, it should just show me that in game. It is actually convoluted how none of this is explained in game.\n\n[h2]Bugs [/h2]\nPerformance wise the game runs great, it is not an inherently demanding game with the art style. So you should not have any issues running this game. Bug wise I did encounter stat bugs such as acc showing 0 when it should be showing a significantly high number. It does update correctly after an action but it's too late at that point. Aside from that I have not experienced any bugs.\n\n[h2]Conclusion [/h2]\nIf you want to try out a roguelike for the first time this game is a great entry into the genre, the game does a great job at encouraging persistence when your hero dies. But I do think as a new player a lot of things can be better explained and presented in-game.
