The are a lot of aspects of the game that I didn't like:\n- Combat isn't all that interesting or challenging. The player character can fly and has a very short dodge cooldown, so enemies rarely ever felt threatening.\n- Player flight also means that there isn't really any platforming in Owlboy. When the game adds hazards that the player has to carefully fly around, it ends up being more tedious than engaging.\n- Stealth is stupidly simple. There's only ever one path forward, enemies don't have complex movement patterns, there's no distraction mechanic or any way to bypass by an enemy other than simply waiting for them to look away. It's more of a test of patience than skill. \n- It's seriously easy to get lost in Owlboy. Many sections of the game are designed like puzzles, and the game doesn't always do a great job communicating the correct path forward.\n- The game doesn't always do a great job of creating safe \"room\" transition points. This essentially means that, when moving between two areas, It's possible to get hit by an enemy you couldn't react to, since the camera was still transitioning into the new area from the old area. This could easily be avoided by making sure enemies are never anywhere close to the border between two rooms. Other platformers, even platformers made by much larger studios, do this same exact thing, but it still annoys the heck out of me every time I see it. \n- And, as a final note, the writing is painfully, obnoxiously cheesy in some moments. Characters don't speak like independently thinking people. So much of the dialogue feels overly-dramatic or out of place. It's the type of story that you skim through as quickly as possible, in the hopes that the story gets better later on.\n\nThat being said, why would I give the game a positive review if it had so much to complain about? Well to my surprise, the story did get better later on. In fact, Owlboy's endgame is actually really good. The last few bosses are seriously fun and challenging to fight. During the final level, the game becomes much less confusing to traverse and even removes the player's flight abilities to create some actual platforming challenges. The game's ending was unexpectedly emotional and beautiful, and I ended up finishing the game with a positive view of the game despite its early frustrations. Owlboy isn't a *great* game, and I couldn't recommend it to everyone. But, a stupendous amount of work and passion went into this game, and the ending in particular is good enough that you might just like it.", "timestamp_created": 1700447048, "timestamp_updated": 1700447048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514637887477874756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150296362": {"recommendationid": "150296362", "author": {"steamid": "76561199084099640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 288, "playtime_at_review": 1135, "last_played": 1699924687}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Entre por que el juego me pareci\u00f3 que tenia un arte muy bonito, pero las mec\u00e1nicas est\u00e1n muy buenas, es entretenido de juegar, otus es muy tierno, totalmente recomendado!", "timestamp_created": 1700247104, "timestamp_updated": 1700247104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150288583": {"recommendationid": "150288583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271718079", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 463, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1700691338}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me gusta la historia, y la mec\u00e1nica del juego 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1700239497, "timestamp_updated": 1700239497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150180278": {"recommendationid": "150180278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018591530", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 461, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1700069785}, "language": "english", "review": "I never before have encountered a minigame so bad that it made be dislike a game I liked quite a bit up until that point. \nThis one had one that managed it.", "timestamp_created": 1700070115, "timestamp_updated": 1700070115, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.440643459558486938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149984615": {"recommendationid": "149984615", "author": {"steamid": "76561199218939544", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1697437428}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate the silent protagonist trope", "timestamp_created": 1699772380, "timestamp_updated": 1699772380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485362112522125244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149860170": {"recommendationid": "149860170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021995199", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 156, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1699612981}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely wondeful game.

While not a neat finish for a game, piecing it together can make the game feel a bit better as a whole. It also takes the realization that this was a 10 year passion project that D-Pad Studio barely survived.\n\nThis is not worth $25 territory; however, it is definitely worth it as a game around $10-15 if you are up for a game with well written characters.\n\nThe primary part you are getting from this game is story. It feels like a book, not in theme, but in how it paces its story and wraps up fairly quickly. Each character is meaningful even if they can be somewhat 2D at times. It's not a very deep underdog story; however, it is decently executed.\n\nThe combat in this game is moderately ok. Not difficult by any means. You will find common enemies quite easy, but bosses in this game are actually quite balanced once you solve their patterns. The game makes up for combat with pretty decent stealth sections of the game. At first, it feels restrictive; however, it does not treat you being found as instant death. In fact, later on you have a few different options in how you maintain your stealth.\n\nThis game is completely linear outside of its overworld. You are pushed from key point to key point without too much say in the matter, and the game does use convenient metroidvania-like blocks to keep you from progressing where you are not meant to yet. This game doesn't seem to fit the mystery of exploration that metroidvanias have though. It only really takes the unlockable pathway concept.\n\nThe game's \"coins\" are a treasure hunter's completionist sink. If you like searching for the last bits of stuff, it has you covered. None of the coins are missable. \n\nThe payoff of the ending: I'm going to put it like this. This game had a ton of cut content. The developers did wrap together an ending that does work; however, it can feel a bit off if you don't pay attention to the main character's growth. I don't consider this a major spoiler as I believe this part of the game is best found before completing the ending. It plainly shows one to you in the first dungeon. This game has 1 bit of extra content that can be found by gathering 3 key items. You have to retreat before actually finishing the game if you want to explore for what it is. \n\nThere is no true ending to chase after. See this game for what it is.

If you, like me, wanted to check this out after having missed the hype train from 7 years ago, note that it was a simpler time for indie games when Owlboy released. If a game seemed to be generally polished, it was a HUGE success. Now that polished indies are the norm, we can be critical and truthful:\nThe Bad:\n- Story is awful. It feels like it was written by someone who saw Yorgos Lanthimos movies like the Lobster and the Favourite, but didn't understand what made those good. This is all to say that the story is full of cruelty but doesn't make a good point of it and doesn't even seem to be aware of how cruel everyone is. This is the clearest when seeing that the jokes are also cruel.\n- Gameplay is miserable. Seems to want to be a flying version of Metal Slug, but the controls are contradictory, there's no onboarding, and mechanics don't build on each other. There's no dodge with i-frames despite your character taking up a huge amount of the screen, and being around one of the many walls will punish you severely.\nThe Good:\n- Animation is beautiful\n- Music is multi-layered and cinematic\n\nThis would have been good if it were a screensaver instead of a game.", "timestamp_created": 1694452452, "timestamp_updated": 1694452452, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521609187126159668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146064698": {"recommendationid": "146064698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062154651", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 591, "last_played": 1694351122}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, I get why some people might enjoy this game.

The second are the much-maligned darkness sections. Yes, they're bad. Not awful, just... bad.\n\nThe plot tries to cram far too much in - it starts out with a great protagonist who makes mistakes and seeks to resolve them against a near-unbeatable enemy but tries to put a bunch of additional information and catastrophes that only really arrive in the 11th hour and completely change the focus of what you were doing. This isn't a disaster for a game like this but it's a shame to see all this interesting characterisation set aside in favour of a plot that ends up feeling shoehorned in.\n\nThe core mechanics are fun and good, though.

Really, in the time between buying it and playing it my interests changed. A semi-linear exploration adventure doesn't really work for me these days, and I don't have the patience for getting lost. The gameplay's a little clumsy but fine, though i think it leans too much on your companions for the Mario 2 thing to really be meaningful and worth the hassle; and it's probably too hard for the game's actual target audience? No control remapping is really unfortunate, and you can't use keyboard at all if your controller's plugged in.\n\nThe main reason I felt unsatisfied however, has to do with the narrative. I came away with the feeling that this game doesn't really understand its own heart: You start off as one of the loneliest, most hated people in the world, and gradually find companionship with other lonely and hated folks. You randomly stumble across a magic trinket that teleports friends to you, a pretty frivolous power in anyone else's hands, and gain the ability to cooperate like no one else. This *should* be what the story is about, but, instead it's just a really standard save-the-world story.\n\nYknow, to save the world that hates you. No attention is called to the irony, and Otus is never questioned on this. No explicit effort is made to forgive the world either. I know Otus is this incorruptible good boy, but this kid should be *deathly* depressed. I stopped talking to town NPCs pretty quickly because *I* was getting depressed. And feeling nothing positive for the world as you save it *really* weakens the climax.\n\nMeanwhile, this theme of loneliness and overcoming it is barely followed up on, and what little followup it gets is pretty weak in my opinion, so I felt like none of it came together in the end. Also, as one of the few likeable characters, I really wanted to talk to Solus more.\n\nThe thing that really drove me to downvote the game though is [spoiler]I'm just *not* interested in forgiving Asio, for frick's sakes. I think most people with an abusive parent would understand, they do not deserve to be heard. I don't care that it's the end of the game, there is no comfort in it.

This game is not a platformer game, not up until the last level. JUMP, GLIDE and CANCEL GLIDE button should not be the same. It's the main reason why I hated platformers with glide mechanics. And this game have these moves stuck to a single button with the addition of UP button to glide which makes movement on the final level a big chore to finish. I can't even fathom why people make this the standard. Separate the GLIDE and CANCEL GLIDE button people! Also don't make the UP button turn on the GLIDE mechanic. It's a movement disaster specially when using a controller.\n\nRant over let's review the game. The game is a twin-stick shooter mix with an old school JRPG storytelling. This combo is great and makes the impact of the story more compelling. You feel the sense of adventure with each dialogue. The story is this game's strongest asset, it's a kid going on an adventure with his friends and you can feel their emotions with the way it is structured.\n\nControls are great up until the last level. Some people might have a problem with tracking your character because another character pops up when you're shooting at targets. It makes it look like you have a bigger hitbox but I think only the owl can be hit(not sure on this one). And having the shooter bigger than the owl makes dodging a little tougher in some cases because your brain is focused on the shooter and not the owl.\n\nBosses are fine except for some which takes away the camera from you so you often lose track of where you are. \n\nPersonally I would rate this 8/10. 9 if not for the final level. \nP.S.

I think some players can be frustrated because you might need good sepperate left and right hand cordination. And most of the boss fights can be way more managable by getting distance, and hiding in the corner of the screen. you also need reflecses. the game does not train you to gradually get faster and faster reflecses. I guess you need that skill from having played other games. The music and art direction is fantastic.\n\nThe dungeons had some nice little puzzles and managable mazes. the main cast had a fun variety of abilities and the enemies had great variation in attack patterns and design. The story was decent, but the charm of the animation on the main character held up my interest for the most part. some of the story aspects felt solid, other a little rushed. (I wish I was more attached to the capital for example). collectible coins wasn't frustrating. (I didn't find them all, but I dind't need to either). You don't need a map when the world is so small. some has complained there wasn't but games are supposed to challenge you. I never felt completely lost.

The game kind of plays itself like a visual novel and doesn't offer much exploration - it's very linear. But sometimes that's just the kind of game you'd want to play. Just like watching a good movie, it offers a great journey when it comes to the graphics, drama and music. And it's great. At that. But the overwhelming greatness of what it does great is such that I'd definitely recommend this game. It nails a lot of subtle details such as conveying emotions even by prosody in the way text appears in text boxes. \n\nI really liked some of the hide and seek sections and the big variety of things that the game is experimenting with.\n\nThe most annoying part of this game for me, as others have pointed out, is some of the game mechanics when switching carried characters. You'd often accidentally throw a character, and when you end up on the ground, a spawned character doesn't end up carried whereas it does when you're in the air. This is particularly an issue during boss fights. \n\nMy other issue is that my mouse cursor would often end up outside of the window and pause the game, even during full screen play (I'm on multiple monitors). Honestly, I think the game could've worked better with a game pad than with mouse  for most part - I don't need a mouse to determine which angle to shoot in.", "timestamp_created": 1679434964,

This game, for me, was overall a joy to play. There were a couple frustrating moments and I really didn't like the optional cannon mini-game (But hey, I wanted to be a completionist) but all in all, this was a truly great game!\n\nFirst of all, its an absolute JOY to your senses, both visual and auditory!\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10 (Really, it's fantastic and I couldn't find one flaw!)\nPixel-Art: 9.8/10 (I held back just a little because there were a couple very minor imperfections)\n\nAs far as the actual game itself, it was a great game! Its not a masterpiece like say, Chrono Trigger, but it was a truly wonderful game! It's a nostalgic old-school side-scroller with its own take. There's not much platforming, technically because its designed around the fact that you can fly almost limitlessly. The world is beautiful and varied and it basically utilizes side-scrolling shooter combat where you aim, move around, and shoot. There's also a Dash attack and a spin attack that's mostly used for stunning or interacting with the environment. \n\nCombat: 7/10 (Hardly the shining strong suit of the game, but not bad.)\nBoss Design: 8/10 (These were mostly a lot of fun and varied enough to keep me on my toes. Certain bosses were much more fun than others though.)\nLevel Design: 7/10 (These were beautiful and a joy to explore with the exception of a little too many spots that were more frustrating than fun. That's what held it back from greatness. I'd still say it was good overall.)\n\nAnd last but not least, there's the story. I was surprised there was as much of a story as there was. Some have been critical of parts of it but as a whole, I really enjoyed every moment of it and heavily enjoyed the characters' interactions and dialogue so...\n\nStory: 9/10 (Outstanding and fun! Not perfect but close enough for me to care about it and feel invested in a short game. That's an achievement, I think.)\n\nOverall: 8.5 (It's a really great game that's easily worth experiencing at the very least, once! Its evident how much the developers really cared and as a work of art, I truly appreciated it.)\n", "timestamp_created": 1678475275, "timestamp_updated": 1678475275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134306028": {"recommendationid": "134306028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143616869", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 731, "last_played": 1678345178}, "language": "english", "review": "its good but why is there no fucking map", "timestamp_created": 1678295704, "timestamp_updated": 1678295704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472362518310546875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133717630": {"recommendationid": "133717630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000025966", "num_games_owned": 702, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 375, "last_played": 1677470398}, "language": "english", "review": "Game starts out very promising, but is a slog just a few hours in.

Second half is certainly not boring, but it highlights how clunky the controls of this game are. Otis, (the main character) does not exactly move as you want to, and partner swapping isn't as smooth as it should be.\n\nAt least this game has S-tier presentation to distract you from the gameplay. Pixel art and (most) animations are as smooth as silk, and the soundtrack to back up all of the pixel art environments is majestic. You could take a screenshot at almost any point in this game and use it as a desktop wallpaper. Beautiful.\n\nThe environments, while pretty, kind of don't make sense in the grand scheme of the story. You can move a couple screens and go from green meadows to an icy tundra. Kinda pulls you out of the whole story they spin about the environments. The plot overall is also sort of interesting, but it's extremely hard to focus on after the onslaught of crap gameplay. There are also a few characters that flip-flop motives and personalities, and it's quite jarring. \n\nI'd only try this game if you're a story-focused gamer.

RIGHT ?\nWelp, it wasn't. \nThe gameplay starts on a good premisce that begs for building great things around it, but it doesn't : every mechanics, combats, puzzles are kept to minimum and fail to raise any real challenge.\nThe game is meant to be linear, but tricks you into thinking you are playing a metroidvania while lacking everything a metroidvania should have like a map, fast travel points or replay value in past areas. It's painfull when you are trying to get all collectible you've missed and have to wander the whole map just to get to the area.\nTo sum it up the game design doesn't have any major flaws but stack quite a number of inconveniences like cameras hiding dangers centimeters from you because they are not in the same \"room\", hitboxe being so large it makes dodging nigh impossible in some fights, french texts being really odd most of the time...\n\nI know I'm being harsh, the game is really not bad but could/should have been so much more than what we've been given.

There is no map, and no reliable means of fast travel. You can open shortcuts in some places but this still doesn't make backtracking much less tedious, especially in dungeons. The controls can sometimes feel a bit wonky, most notably in fast paced combat situations when you need to cycle through characters quickly and drop them and pick them back up again, etc.\nSomething that I also personally disliked is that half of the achievements for the game are all locked behind completing a very very annoying minigame.\nI wouldn't recommend this game at full price, but under $20 is fair.", "timestamp_created": 1672473641, "timestamp_updated": 1672473641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129672855": {"recommendationid": "129672855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175851039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 594, "last_played": 1672564222}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun platform game, great graphics/animation, good music, tricky bosses.

I'll explain why shortly, but in the end, I feel like there were more things that turned me off, than sparked my interest in this game and part of it is probably how I usually play games like these - going for all steam achievements if possible. I also treat this as a way of checking the game's quality because the more I focus on achievements, and less on the story and gameplay itself, the less enjoyable those aspects are in my eyes. With that out of the way, here's the proper review.\n\nLet's begin with the good qualities of the game:\nThe graphics are beautiful, the animations are smooth and well-made and the music ties it all together very very nicely. The story starts off slow but it picks up the pace in the 2nd half, resulting in a good climax. My only grime with it would be the very final scene where the devs used a very cliche move that made me doubt my previous judgement about the quality of the story, but I'll say more about it in the 2nd part of the review.\nOverall, if I were to rate the game simply by the three things I mentioned - visuals, music and story - I'd give it an 8/10. If you're looking for a casual game to take in wonderful pixel art and not have to worry about difficult combat or hard puzzles, I think it's a solid production, although I'd wait with buying it until it's on sale.\n\nThe things I did not enjoy about Owlboy:\nThere's a lot. At first, let's focus on movement and exploration - the core elements of the game. If you want to move at any meaningful pace you have to constantly spam your dash button, which is not ideal to say the least. Some areas become off-limits after you've gone through them once, meaning if you miss a collectible, you have to reload an old save. Areas themselves don't have much variety. The dungeons are cool I guess, but the overworld is disappointing because every platform and background is almost identical but with a different denisty of shrubbery and thorns. Backtracking, a huge part of finding all collectibles, is a chore and a boring one at that because of this, and some tighter passages in certain hazardous areas can be rather annoying.\nThe combat. I know it's not a combat-based game but there is a combat system and so I am to rate it (spoiler alert: it's not great). You get to fight using 3 different characters, all specialising in a different thing. Unfortunately, for most of them it's only a case of one firing mode which gets stale very very quickly and by the time you finish the first major story sequence, you'll see each encounter with enemies as yet another thing to tick off, instead of a fun and engaging experience. Speaking of enemies, their designs are pleasing visually, but the attacks leave a lot to ask for. Getting hit by anything sends you flying as if you were playing Super Smash Bros and hitting a wall during that time leaves you temporarily stunned and unable to recover or do anyting. This gives enemies plenty of time to surround you, and since you drop your companions upon getting hit, by the time you pick them back up to shoot the adversaries, your i-frames disappear and you go ping-ponging around the room once more. Enemies can also gank up on screen transitions and while you can't see them because the camera is panning out, they can hit you and knock you back into the previous screen - very annoying. There were multiple very disappointing mini-bosses that were more like wave rooms where you have to fight one enemy, then two enemies of that kind and so on until you beat a wave of 6 enemies. Proper bosses are more interesting but they're also somewhat hectic because you can dash through some of their attacks but not all of them and also the attacks you can dash through sometimes still hit you... it's a mess is what I'm getting at. Not great, as I said.\nUnique powers. A staple of a metroidvania. There hardly are any and they only come in the form of a new companion. The game is surprisingly linear and so, new obstacles only appear once you already have a new companion that can help you through them. This takes away from the interest metroidvanias spark in you of seeing a place you can't reach. You know you should be able to get there eventually so you're just looking for a power or tool that would enable this and it makes for an interesting dynamic. Owlboy doesn't have that.\nCollectibles. There are a lot of them and they're all useless. Thousands of coins for upgrades that are negligable except for the final one. 9 upgrades in total, 3 of them are not even upgrades, 2 are borderline unfair for the game's standards, the rest are whatever.\nAchievements! This is what I meant with \"my specific playstyle\". I like getting all achievements in metroidvanias. You'd assume that in a story-driven game, there would be at least some achievements for finishing a story event or beating the game but not in Owlboy. In here you will find 12 achievements that have nothing to do with the story and include taking a random shell to a spot in the middle of nowhere to waste a minute of your life watching a pointless animation with no story implications. Fun stuff, I love wasting my time on useless interactions.\nFinally - the characters and some parts of the overall gameplay. The characters are all dull. One of the first people you meet is a jerk that you're going to hate for the rest of the game and said jerk made the final cutscene anticlimactic and dumb in my opinion. The rest of the cast is really generic and the only truly unique characters are Solus (someone who appears maybe 4 times in the story and yet is a crucial character), and Twig. I wish Solus was given more spotlight, maybe giving him some more backstory but oh well. I also mentioned story sequences. When you first boot up the game, you're met with one of those sequences. It makes up 1/3rd of the game's entire storyline. While it's still ongoing, you can't backtrack, you can't return to the shop to trade collectibles for potentially-helpful hp upgrades and you have to go through the entire thing to get some freedom. If you miss a collectible in one certain spot, you're screwed and have to replay around half of this story sequence.\n\nOverall, the game has more things that I dislike about it, than I enjoyed about it. They may seem like small details, but said details are what make or break a good experience, and for the majority of my time spent on Owlboy, I wasn't having a good time. It's not a terrible game, but you have to set your expectations low and only pick it up if you want to play casually for the story, not for the achievements.

Simply put, this is the best pixel-style 2D art you can find in a game. It's not just the art itself. It's not just the animations themselves. It's understanding how to use both in the context of presenting a video game experience. Interacting with it from from just walking around, to watching a staged in-game cutscene is nonstop awe inspiring beauty. Amazing what they pulled off. Despite being a 2D platformer, this is a cinematic experience more than anything. It has all the vibes of a modern AAA blockbuster with scripted sequences, while being a 2D retro/indie style. It's stunning how they made it all work. The visuals are truly bonkers good. You seriously cannot oversell them. \n\nThe gameplay that comes with the visuals is competent. The game leans heavily on a crutch of so-so storytelling. So the gameplay does limp at times because of that. The pacing of when you're actually involved can be a stop and go drive down a bumpy back road. The sudden swings in required tactics and interactions can make easy sequences turn into trial and error. Or easier bosses seem daunting at first. There's nothing wrong with the controls and tools at your disposal. They build up great and are fun to wield. You're just left wishing there was more flow to the when and where, as well as consistency, in which you got to use them.\n\nI called the story telling a crutch because while it's a wholly unique world and they present you fantastic lore that you're happily buying into... But the character motivations are downright silly. Maybe the writer's had a reason for it or people read deeper into the whole presentation than I'm willing to (or I'm the one reading too deep into it...) But the silly humor bled too far into ALL the characters. Nearly every character, including the ones of importance, had completely out of left field turns or redemption arcs. Every character had a moment that was completely cruel and one that was completely soft begging for sympathy. With nothing in between or any hint of nuance. Whether it was a boss or somebody in your crew; You had as many reasons to want to help them as you did to despise them. It could've just been all 'cartoon' fun if the game was gameplay heavy, but the game wanted to be a narrative first and foremost. You were reading dialogue and watching cutscenes as much as you were playing. It chose to be story centered. So it was really really off putting and harder to invest in with such wild swings of motivation for each and every character. It was already a repetitive annoyance quite early on and was a persistent gimmick all the way through to the end. Seriously. Every. Character.\n\nBut it IS just a 'light' and 'fun' indie 2D platformer game in the end, no matter what the presentation was doing. So I can just appreciate it all on face value. And my what a looker that face is! Stunning visuals. Fun gameplay when you're doing it. And an original enough world to overlook plenty else in the writing. Most definitely a thumbs up and full recommendation. Little disappointed, but yet intrigued, to see their next upcoming title is some sort of party game. This is definitely a crew to keep an eye on.

It looks and sounds fantastic. Those aspects are truly beautiful and stand out for feeling really hand crafted and like they were put together with passion. It allows the story to come to live in a great way, seeing some locations depicted with so much detail really activates your imagination.\n\nEverything else about the game is mediocre. The movement and combat feels weird, it felt so bad that the first time around I couldn't even play it for 1 hour before I decided I didn't enjoy it and dropped the game until recently. After coming back it does improve over time, but the overall gameplay just feels kind of boring and uninspired. The saving grace here is that the game refuses to sit still on 1 mechanic, every map you go through will have very different mechanics. That made me want to keep seeing what is next and how they would try to push the owlboy mechanic further. The further you go the more fun it gets but getting to that point can feel really boring. Overall its serviceable and enjoyable but nothing I would want to replay.\n\nMiyamoto said Mario doesn't need a story, and this is the first time where that statement really rung true with me. The story gets hard carried by the presentation, there are a lot of plot points here that never get resolved. A lot of characters that appear 1 or 2 times and then never are relevant again. It honestly felt like the story got in the way of the gameplay, so many times especially early on I felt like control was just taken away constantly. Even if you put in the extra time to finish secrets to get extra lore you still won't feel like everything is complete.\n\nTalking about secrets, the game has a lack of teleportation systems or a map. Its a pain in the ass to traverse the map to get 100 %. I eventually just gave up on the final coins reward because it was too much of a pain in the ass to finish and the reward I looked up was bad. Keeping track of where you might have missed secrets is too hard and a real problem with the game.\n\nOverall Owlboy is fine. The gameplay and story are mediocre and sometimes boring but not necessarily bad. The presentation is top tier. And the collectible aspect is whatever. Its by no means a bad game and something I can definitely recommend to others. But to me it didn't live up to the hype nor the quality I expected.

At the time of writing this, no other game I've finished showed such a lack of engagement, surprise, or intrigue. It sets out to be a simplistic, heartfelt do-it-all, and smoothes out every inch of the game to be an entirely plain surface, with a sparkling pixel art sheen. No doubt, the artwork is jaw-dropping in quality, and I have nothing but the highest of praise for the skills of the artists behind it, but the decision to use such talented individuals to create unending, empty hallways of rocks is a gargantuan disappointment. To help you appreciate these extremely high end boring rock textures, every. Single. Action that's taken in the world and moves anything whatsoever is shunted into a dreadfully long miniature cutscene, which in many places, slowly teleports each other character in your arsenal one by one, to line up with some inane, juvenile dialogue that made my tongue roll back up inside my head and itch my brain from the bottom. The story beats make absolutely zero sense, with the entire plotline resting on a single, massive, and incomprehensibly dumb decision by a single character, and an unsatisfying and downright disrespectful ending slapping the player in the face for daring to think there was any sort of payoff for playing this abomination of a game. Dull and lifeless platforming, cryptic and frustrating combat, obscenely boring environments, embarrassing progression upgrades, and linear mapping round out this horrendous experience.

Most of the time the player will be flying around the different areas and dungeons focusing more on shooting at enemies. The different characters you meet along the way act as an unlock to new abilities, which can be very fun to switch through and try out in different scenarios. There are a few sections where the difficulty ramps up unexpectedly, both for boss fights and for navigating through the levels, which can sometimes get frustrating. For players interested in the Metroidvania aspect of the game, I'd say it doesn't have much of an impact other than exploring to collect the Buccanary Coins and Golden disks, which go towards unlocking minor buffs to your abilities (as well as a few cosmetic items) and story elements, respectively. \n\nOwlboy's level design is generally pretty straightforward and most areas of interest are directly off of the main path. The dungeon design feels very similar to a Legend of Zelda game, with solving puzzles opening up the next section in the dungeon. One downside that becomes noticeable in latter half of the game is that there isn't a map, but this is really only an issue when backtracking to collect any coins or disks you may have missed the first time through. \n\nThe story of Owlboy comes across as a bit hit-or-miss. Some plot points seemingly coming out of nowhere as a contrived way to introduce drama, while the rest of the time the story is held up by its interesting characters and the interactions between them. \n\nOverall, I would recommend playing Owlboy as a casual experience that delivers on great atmosphere, with its art and music, and enjoyable gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1658118754, "timestamp_updated": 1658118754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118951864": {"recommendationid": "118951864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158739757", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 761, "last_played": 1633082574}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is beautiful, but I don't understand why it had to be a game.  \n\nAfter seeing some e3 footage, the game seemed to have a lot going for it. \nA minimalistic idea fully fleshed out in a very Zelda-esque world. A great sense of identity and a slightly unique twist on gameplay. This looked to follow suit on some other indie gems of the time. \nSadly thats not the case. \n\nThis game has very obvious strenghts. It focuses on the inscination: The visuals and the Soundtrack. \nIts all beautifully realised, with real attention to detail. The vistas are stunning and rich. The music is fully orchestrated and sounds at times mysterious and simple, at others very grand and impressive. \n\nThe weaknesses are similarly obvious. This is a game that you shouldn't play, but instead should watch someone else play. The game's unique mechanic is that you can fly, carry around others, and use them to attack (shoot) instead of attacking yourself. This seems oddly at war with the leveldesign, where you spent most of your times in caverns and caves being very restrictive of your movement and general game progression. \nSwitching out who youre carrying is rarely necessary, since the gameplay really never evolves , with you having to swtich to different characters. You can just pick one and stay with him, unless its one of the rare Situations where you can't use all of your characters. This makes it so that the different characters are effectively just different weapons (pistol, shotgun,...)\n\nThe enemies seem to be poorly designed as well. Some have unique mechanics that usually turn into a tedium pretty quickly. Others are just bullet sponges, which have no actual way of attacking you. \nBosses usually consist of 3 phases, that, all in all, display about 4-5 moves, with very simple bullet-hell-like dodging patterns. These bosses are spread pretty evenly about the game, and sometimes make pretty surprising introductions (Some of them making the game lag), but they feel largely disconnected to the world or the stroy. \n\nExploration is sadly almost never encouraged or even possible. The games levels are linear, and the world it's set in just gives a slight illusion of openess with a big hub-area. After you leave that hub area you will find yourself quickly gated, by some powerup check or other. This of course is all in service of the story, that has to happen in a certain order to make sense. This destroys a lot of the illusion of an open world very quickly, even though there are some hidden paths to collectibles. These can be used to get some minor upgrades and cosmetics. \n\nThe game seems to defy itself. \nThe art and music makes you want to explore and see the world, but the world is linear and closed, largely consisting of tunnels to fight enemies in. \nThe Story seems the centerpiece of it all, telling a simple engaging story with some deeper subplot.  But the game never gives you any insentive to interact with the characters, and goes off on random tangents for what feels like most of the game. \n\nThis game could've been something.", "timestamp_created": 1658055799, "timestamp_updated": 1658056135, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571014404296875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118776051": {"recommendationid": "118776051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217743901", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 600, "last_played": 1657761059}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hermoso juego, buena historia y mec\u00e1nicas para manejar al personaje principal y sus acompa\u00f1antes.\n\nTotalmente recomendado!", "timestamp_created": 1657760990, "timestamp_updated": 1657760990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118677751": {"recommendationid": "118677751", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989849833", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2085, "last_played": 1656269481}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice world to be in really.

And flying does not feel good, it removes physical feel of character and challenge in moving around. It is like that problem in 3D first person games where you feel like character is flying camera.

Shooting does not feel good and impact is pretty bad. Controls do not help, you usually have to press more buttons to do basic things than you'd like to. For example, healing: why not just add breakable healing objects? Nope, you have to align yourself and press 3 buttons to heal, one more if you need to drop character. Also using same button for shooting and grappling hook feels very awkward. \n\nSome bosses are bad, especially one specific gorilla boss. Overall idea of making boss shoot more projectiles or spawn more mobs with each new stage is not great design.\n\nPlot is too childish for me to be interested in it and characters are pretty shallow.

The non-recommendation all comes down to the game just being boring to play. You can see the potential for it to be fun, but the gameplay just turns out to be bland. The main character has the ability to fly, but the vast majority of the game takes place in cramped corridors. Why have a character that can fly if you're just going to put them in claustrophobic tunnels? On top of that, the screen only covers a small area around the character. So while you have this potential for fast movement, you instead have to take things relatively slowly because you don't know what you're going to run into that's just off the screen.\n\nThere are small puzzles in the game, but they are all rather simplistic. You have this utility belt of abilities and every enemy, puzzle, or obstacle you run into you just have to figure out which one of your abilities has been designed to overcome it and use that.\n\nAnd, at least for me, the story was also boring.

While the concept is nice, and ties in with the whole theme of Owlboy being about how cooperation and accounting for your weaknesses in a group makes both the individual contribution and the group effort that much stronger, in practice controlling Otus feels disjointed. This might've been just a 'me' problem, I chose to play the game with a controller so maybe playing on a keyboard alleviates this. I just felt like I could never switch between the characters fast enough in a boss fight, or the momentum of the game would stop for me to precisely aim at something. The design is clunky, but it's not sloppy. It just feels like there is some fine tuning to the core design of controlling Otus and his friends that could have massively overhauled the gameplay of Owlboy and made for a much more enjoyable experience.\nI want to like Owlboy. The decade or so of work put into the look of the game absolutely shines. When I first got to the Owl Temple, and the camera pans up to show the giant statue of the owl, with all of it's incredible detail and polish, I was floored. Some of the best pixel art I've ever seen is in this game, hands down. The story Owlboy presents is also nice. I wouldn't give it a fucking award or anything, but it's solid. I don't know that it's trying to be an award-winning story, now that I think about it. Character interactions also tend to be weighed down by the trope of being treated like shit by others, and it isn't helped by the fact that it feels like  problem that every character in Owlboy deals with. Though, by the end of the game, it's not really something that drags the whole experience down for me substantially. \nOne little thing I wanna say is that I appreciated the approach to the character Molstrum. He's a/the major antagonist set on acquiring some macguffins to end the world. He's not a particularly special character, but the game creates this air around him that he's so powerful and strong that all of the other characters would have no chance of defeating him. You never actually have a standard 'boss fight' with him (although you could argue the ending sequence to be the Molstrum's 'boss fight' but shut up), and, after thinking about it, I feel like that strengthens Molstrum's presence as an antagonist. He's so strong that the protagonists avoid direct combat with him, instead trying to collect the macguffins faster than he does, and steal the ones he has.\nI heard that the concept of Owlboy came about from Simon Anderson (the art director and creator of Owlboy) wondering what a game would be like if it was only the flying from the Super Leaf power up in Super Mario Bros. 3. I don't think that's a bad concept to make a game around at all. I'm not trying to say that this is a 'bad' game, although it is amounting to a lot more critiques than praise. It took the people working on Owlboy a lot of time, money and effort to make, and I'm happy that they stuck to it. I wouldn't want them to spend another day working on this game. Disconnected from all of that, the product that I played didn't feel like a solid experience. \nI didn't 100% complete this game (I didn't collect all of the coins and apparently didn't see all of the 'lore shit' [if I did, I don't remember seeing that, so fuck off. Don't worry about it.]), although I feel like if I did play it again I probably could have. I don't plan on replaying Owlboy, at least for the foreseeable future. It's gameplay didn't really feel tight enough to excite me for a second go around. I feel satisfied with the story that was told, although it wasn't anything special or standout. I appreciated this game for what it was trying to say in it's conception, and I think the kind of questions it asks about game design are important and should be supported, but the direction those questions took for this project did not amount to a particularly good game.", "timestamp_created": 1646849524, "timestamp_updated": 1646849541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497942358255386353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111679850": {"recommendationid": "111679850", "author": {"steamid": "76561199068932867", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1646505588}, "language": "english", "review": "Owlboy is beautiful, charismatic, emotional, has tight/responsive gameplay, the gameplay itself is rewarding and gives the player satisfaction.\n\nPlenty of things to love about Owlboy, but I have to admit, I just didn't like it.\n\nThe temple in Stratos (a location in the game) is the worst section regarding it's actual level layout.

Firstly, the game you can tell is a labour of love; the character design, story, music and the puzzles are well thought out (for the most part). The problem comes down to is the game \"fun\" and that's where I'm torn. Owlboy fundamentally is a watered-down metroidvania, with a lot of boring backtracking. For the most part, the game is more puzzle orientated than combat orientated. This is where the key problem lies - mechanically the game is poorly designed resulting in annoying action sequences and boss fights.

I often hear people talk about it as a Metroidvania - I'm not sure I would describe it in that way. You get pretty minimal upgrades, and the progress is quite linear. It plays more like a standard adventure game, with a few dungeons, a linear narrative, and pretty simple combat.\n\nI found the movement to be a bit awkward, with some sections of the game to have absolutely atrocious movement (no spoilers, but you'll know when you get to them). The combat was also pretty simple, just a dodge and spam kind of thing. Exploration was okay, but it is a bit of a grind to traverse the map if you ever want to deviate from the linear path that the story follows. I also found that sometimes I would go somewhere that felt clever, and it was a secret, but the payout would consistently be underwhelming. Hunting down all the coins was rather fun (except for the last challenge... see my complaint about the atrocious movement controls), and it was nice to have a reward that allowed you to move faster, but it was kind of too late at that point. A way to move faster would be helpful when still exploring the world - by the time you get that power up, you have already seen pretty much everything the game has to offer, so what's the point?\n\nIt wasn't a bad game, but it really felt like it was lacking some polish.

I liked the idea of combining elements of the most legendary snes games along with some amazing flying mechanics. I decided to get this game later because i am currently learning norwegian and wanted to play through games that i could find. i am so glad i picked up owlboy. I would love an addon to replace one of my characters with Bogvin because that is the cutest character of all time. i died laughing when he popped out of the shop with a little pirate hat on. I digress.\n\nIt is a very challenging and fun game. beautiful crisp movements, fun puzzles that take just the right amount of time. The story is great. Artwork, great. music, great. The only issue i found with owlboy was ironically the freedom of it. when not in dungeons you can fall and dash, fly, enjoy many optional interactions with signs, trees, NPCs. You have so much freedom for this type of game and it really is a beautiful experience. when you enter dungeons or central story plot lines, the level design forces constraints on the player out of neccessity. you have to learn to fly in tight spaces accurately and while aiming which is a heap of fun. however after awhile, you begin to feel a bit cramped. In all honesty, i dont think they could have executed this much better. i wish i had 3 hands so i could give it more thumbs up than 2. Thank you so much to the team at DPad for creating a game that is as good or better than anything you can find in the 2d space in Norwegian. It is the perfect learning tool for me and i have mentioned it to all my colearners to come aboard as well. thank you so much. 5 of 5 for this guy.", "timestamp_created": 1638050888, "timestamp_updated": 1638050888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611985325813293457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104352325": {"recommendationid": "104352325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291004927", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 447, "last_played": 1645468086}, "language": "english", "review": "a rly fun platformer", "timestamp_created": 1638021910, "timestamp_updated": 1638021910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104098421": {"recommendationid": "104098421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073734190", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1861, "last_played": 1643700586}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, just finished my second perfection run of this beautiful game.

It has a beautiful story, beautiful soundtracks, and a pixel art style that looks wonderful. I believe it's safe to assume that Owlboy is not for everyone due to the fact that there are so many dialogue in it. If you're thinking of buying this game for its gameplay alone, you may not get what you expect for the gameplay it offers is mediocre at best. You can fly, pick up your buddies to use them as weapons, pick up some objects to use them to your advantage and that's it. However, they managed to keep it interesting with various boss battles in my opinion. Puzzles are quite interesting, too. \n\nStory is where this game shines best. It has its own unique universe where owls used to be the most sophisticated species of the earth, but their arrogance caused the continents to get separated and float into the sky thus carried civilization with them. What if you're from a species that cannot fly? Well, good luck then. There are also hostile robots that call themselves \"Pirates\" and they cause trouble for the other people. I won't spoil anything but they have a motive behind their actions. \n\nThe protagonist, Otus, is the most interesting thing about the story. He was born mute and although he's trying his best, he is constantly getting blamed by his teacher Asio for ruining things, which leads him to have self-esteem issues. Now isn't that perfectly relatable for the most of us? The whole story revolves around Otus' struggle within and he wants to prove himself to the people and most importantly, his teacher Asio. Does he succeed? Well, that's left to player's interpretation, I guess.

Like enragingly bad. Or not worth $13 (I waited until it was on sale to buy, even!!)

I had to do a beta mode to even get my controller to work (I'm on a Mac with a PS4 controller, have never had issues with it like this). The game forces linear play, except there's stuff you could go back for here and there, or else know that you need to be so mind-numbingly thorough in each level so you don't have to go back (and sometimes you can't go back, it seems).Except....THERE'S NO MAP. What???? I know there's a joke early on about no map, but that's just...unforgivable. For a game with so many branches, and hidden areas that you NEED to complete to help you be able to move on...I just... I'm so disappointed. I've had this on my wishlist for over a year, and it's just Not Good. \n\nWhen you have to watch videos for every boss fight and some puzzles (and like..I'm not great at games, but I'm not bad!), just to get a clue of what the heck you're supposed to do, it's a bad game. Especially late game boss fights - a player should have competency of abilities by the boss fight to not need to look up wtf to do. \n\n\n-5/10, i'm mad i waited for this game and saved it for a day I could savor it, and instead found myself trying to rage-finish it so i never have to think about it again.

The player starts the game as Otus, a mute Owl, who lives in the floating village of Vellie. Otus' mentor, Asio is portrayed as the parent figure that gives Otus the toughest of love, for example, constantly bringing to light Otus' inadequacies . The adventure begins when robot pirates under the command of the infamous Molstrom unexpectedly attack a nearby city. Otus and newly acquired friend Geddy set of to understand the motive of the robot pirates. Owlboy takes a different approach to normal storytelling by allowing the player to discover for themselves through the silent storytelling.\n\nThis game looks damn good. The game is not restricted by the 8 and 16- bit style or its color palette. From the Vellie to the Owl Temples and Molstrom's pirate ship, the colors are absolutly phenomenal. Even when Owlboy was to pan the camera out, the pixel resolution does not miss a step and always looks fantastic.\n\nEven towards the end, when everything is looking bleak and the plot has taken a turn for the worse, Owlboy consistently delivers a beautiful and awe-inspiring game.\n\nThe controls are actually pretty standard. Otus casually jogs, can attack and can fly. It does get on the annoying side that Otus is pretty slow and rolling makes him pick up speed, so I found myself a lot of the time rolling to get along faster.\n\nOwlboy may have one of the best soundtracks in a video game. The orchestral sounds are perfect in every encounter and are pleasing to the ear. The drums heats up when situations are serious and \u00a0the flutes, piano are calming when there is a lull in combat. Jonathan Geer deserves immense praise for the work that he has done with the Owlboy.\n\nOwlboy was a joy to play. It contains a hearfelt story that tackles themes of disabilities and friendship without compromising storytelling or gameplay to get the theme across. The ten hours that I had put into Owlboy reminded me why I love these kind of games. I felt for Otus and I believed in the adventure that he went on. It made me feel when Asio consistently criticized Otus. When Otus and his friends triumphed, I felt like I had also won.

Certainly much better 2D pixel art game than any game out there. \n\nStorywise I have some gripes. While the game's story is good, it feels rather slow paced, as the game starts throwing explanations only near the end of the game while most of the game you are like \"Who, what, where?\" and even after beating the game you still have some questions. There are some holes that would have been probably explained more if they added some kind of archive or library. It's not bad it's just don't expect the greatest story ever told.\n\nGameplay. Okay, this is where it goes into \"some people love it some people hate it\". The platforming has a unique concept where instead of normal platforming you can fly. This concept seems good on paper but there is a flaw: every time you get hit, your character gets stun locked and gets thrown in a random direction. This is my problem. The devs did make it less annoying by adding temporary invincibility when you get damaged, but it still brings frustrations.\n\nBut probably my biggest problem of the game is collectables. The game has certain number of coins and there are limited number of upgrades in the game. For a metroidvania, you would expect a large number of upgrades, like Castlevania SotN or Ori and the Blind Forest, but this game has 6 upgrades. 6?! Only six? You get 5 upgrades as you collect coins but you get the 6th one after you collect all the coins which will take hours and hours of going back and forth in the dungeons... and its not really worth it, only if you want to have 5% rare achievement.\n\nBut do I still recommend this game? If you are a fan of metroidvania, yes. If you want something that will have a great story, I'd recommend Dust An Elysian Tail instead. I won't give \"Not recommended\" because I don't think the game is bad, I just think the game is decent, but just not mindblowingly good like every other comment here says so.\n\nAs a final note, I do not think the game is worth 23$. The game lacks more content, and there are other metroidvanias that are cheaper and offer more hours and better story pacing. If you want my honest price, it would be 10$. The game takes about 10-13 hours to beat.

You can see them carrying their hearts on their little sleeves as they cower in terror, lower their ears in fear or visibly perk up when happy.\n\nHere, pixel art is absolutely gorgeous and timeless in its execution and reminds me of Chrono Trigger, Metal Slug and generally the golden age of SNES/Megadrive level pixel quality.\n\nIt also has a downright beautiful orchestral music score which perfectly complements each level and scene. \nI wouldn't label it as 'catchy' in an earworm way, but it's definitely a soundtrack made for joyful and easy listening (except the boss fights of course).\n\nTrack Recommendations:[list]\n[*]Strato Theme\n[*]Mesos Theme[/list]\n\nAudio wise, sound effects of enemies being blasted away feels chunky and gritty, and collecting coins sounds like something out of Mario or Sonic - perfectly encapsulating the gaming era it's inspired by.\n\nThe unique aspect of this metroidvania is that you fly around and 'hot swap' party members you carry. Each one of them has a unique way of helping you both in combat and in accessing new pathways. Flying itself did not feel 'floaty' to me as pressing \"B\" performed a dash which was literally how I got around everywhere quickly.\nFor those wanting real speed and real use of the floating rings, give the cannon minigame a try!\n\nCalling this a Metroidvania is a long stretch however. There's very little to actually 'explore' other than along a fairly linear story progressing path. \nAnother way to describe it is that it feels like a platformer where all levels are made to lead you one way - the story way. Going off the beaten path is short and usually results in a shortcut or chest full of coins and not a power-up directly. Though it's worth mentioning that collecting coins is actually how you unlock new upgrades through the game's one store.\n\nThis is probably why there's no real map though, there just aren't that many zones to explore that you couldn't get back to quickly.\n\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Owlboy. It made me feel things, and so for that it's essentially art. Feel free to experience it yourself and see what you think of it.\n\nPet Peeves:[list]\n[*]First impressions can dissuade players, so bear with any initial bugs - First time I booted the game my controller wasn't detected AND the game wasn't in fullscreen mode. Fine - I restarted and got my controller working. Proceeded to set the game to fullscreen, now all music stopped! - Apparently a known issue? Why hasn't this been resolved already?\n[*]The game didn't like a lot of alt+tabbing, after the Nth time I got a system hang and had to restart\n[*]The single most challenging thing about this game is the awkward and janky at times camera movement.

Most of the combat, movement, Metroidvania discovery, that was really great, and the story was also a lot more interesting than I thought it would be. With all of those positive feelings in mind, I have two big gripes:\n\n1.) Frustrating sections of gameplay.\nThere were some unnecessarily punishing sections of the game, like an area where you have to solve a puzzle in less than 10 seconds or you die from poison gas and have to restart. Having such strict time constraints on a puzzle all of a sudden felt frustrating, not rewarding.\n\n2.) Asio. (Sorry, this part ended up being a lot longer than I meant it to be-- whoops!)\nI should clarify immediately: I'm totally fine with Asio being a jerk. I think a lot of negative reviews of the game have cited his behavior towards Otus as a bad aspect of the game, which I don't think is the case. In fact, I was excited at how dark the game got early on, since I think honest portrayals of mental illness and abusive relationships in video games aren't touched very often. And for that, I applaud the developers.\nWhat I'm frustrated with is specifically the very end of the game where Asio and Otus have their final conversation. In my reading of the game, I felt like one of Otus's main obstacles is poor mental health and self-esteem, which is personified in Asio, his abusive mentor who is the source of all of his self doubts. Quite literally every encounter Otus has with Asio throughout the game is negative and demeaning-- until the end when Asio suddenly flips the script and pretends like he believed in Otus the whole time. Personally, whenever Asio was on screen, I felt visceral anxiety and frustration (in a way that I think is intentional). So the fact that Asio was never confronted for his abusive behavior, or expresses any apology for his actions, made this inspiring conversation between Otus and Asio-- which ends the whole emotional arc of the game-- feel reeeeally hollow. Furthermore, this is the moment when Otus overcomes the other signifier for his poor self-esteem: his muteness. His inability to speak forces him to be a passive spectator in his own relationships, unable to express opinions about the people and events around him (this is mentioned many times, like how he can't express opinions about his new spider friend to their family). So in the ending, he's finally able to speak, and I'm thinking, \"oh, it's about to go down! Otus is gonna use his newfound gift of speech to really give Asio a peace of his mind and confront him and put a fitting end to that emotionally-charged relationship...\" but he's still a passive spectator! All he does is ask if his friends are okay! Which is a valid question for the plot, but unrelated to his emotional arc with Asio, or Otus's existence as an actor/character with opinion. So I think giving him a strong opinion about Asio and his behavior at the end of the story by denouncing him or forgiving him or even just saying that he doesn't care anymore because he has his supportive friends, would provide a really striking and gorgeous end for the story and wrap up the themes very nicely.\n\nThe reason I'm so stuck on this is because I'm trying to figure out what they're attempting to signify with this ending as it is, and I can't make heads or tails of it. That he only cares about his friends and doesn't even care about Asio? That doesn't make sense, because in its structure, Asio's assertions of Otus's value at the end is given immense importance, and Otus performs no actions indicating indifference. That he can only heal from his trauma now because he did the right thing and got Asio's approval? This is the conclusion I have to reach, and it's not one that I think is healthy or helpful-- in fact, I think this conclusion is in active detriment to the other themes of friendship and found family that were so prevalent in the rest of the game.\n\nAll in all, I think Owlboy is a great game that really missed the mark with its ending on the story it was trying to tell.", "timestamp_created": 1625589039, "timestamp_updated": 1625589039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95064969": {"recommendationid": "95064969", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992614617", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1032, "last_played": 1625503381}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little metroidvania.

You'll notice that bit of drift or agitating few frames after the spin attack later on, once the difficulty curve starts to ramp up and enemies deal a quarter of your maxed out health bar with each hit.\nBut the enemy variety is perfect for the length of this game and they don't hold your hand for many of them, which feels very rewarding when you get it straight away thanks to the stellar design.\n\nHowever, I feel much of the quality takes a rather staggering dip in the second act. The difficulty curve surges, but remains manageable, and the story beats take on a more frenetic pace. There's a sense of urgency from the character dialogue, but no mechanical reason to worry, and you're not really penalized for any of the choices that you make, not a large shocker in a platformer, but still worth mentioning. And, once you unlock the third companion, the difficulty nose dives to trivial. You can spend all your time flapping around like a loser or you can rapidly dash to almost any point on the screen with utter invulnerability while you do so. It's well that he joins the team quite late.\nIt feels very much like something got cut? The ending feels very nebulous, even with the additional lore from the post-game secrets the final boss feels tacked on and out of the blue. There's a relationship hinted at that the player doesn't experience so it might as well have not happened or it's blown well out of proportion.\n\nReally, it seems like I should have had more time to meet and learn about some of these characters, and, to their credit, I wanted that. I absolutely wanted more and it's completely detrimental to my memory of this game that I didn't get it. There's a whole cast of characters that are introduced after the first massive battle and it felt like I should've spoken to them before? \nThis may be symptomatic of a kickstarter game; characters created by contributors that don't have any bearing on the story, but nonetheless have to be featured and I hate it. Again, kudos to the design for seamlessly and naturally integrating individuals that I want to speak to, but my story completionist personality is doing tight, angry somersaults.\n\n\nOwlboy is suffering from its own success and a disconnect somewhere in the narrative team. I'm not sure if they ran out of time and needed to push it out of the door or if the ending changed drastically at the midnight hour, but while I loved 65% of my time with this game, the ending is an unpalatable, incomplete, and cheap bow slapped on to a game with amazing promise. And doesn't that make it worse? That you were promised the pony on your birthday and you got it between two buns with a side of coleslaw?\n\nDrama aside, do play this game.

(though there is one villain who is remarkably so, and it's lovely), overall it's what pushed me to keep playing, alongside the art. Overall the world is one that I genuinely was curious about learning more about, and I didn't feel disappointed. \n\nThe art is gorgeous, this game took 10 years to make, and I don't know why pixel art takes that long to make (albeit a small team, but how were games made in pixel art back int he day then??? Maybe it was a background project), but it's a very great to look at, especially the cutscenes that are sprinkled throughout the game. \n\nAlso this game really had some challenging enough but not impossible bosses that kept me on my toes a little, and they felt plenty varied enough to not be forgettable aesthetic wise, or gameplay design wise. \n\nThe last level leading up to the boss was a little annoying, but the pretty awesome boss and story progression after it made it worthwhile.\n\nOverall I'd suggest this game if any of the above sound good, while it does feel a little floaty (when you're not actually flying, which is most of it), it's a charming platformer that has some real pulls to justify getting it.

It has some of the best-looking pixel art I\u2019ve seen and great music that makes the whole experience really immersive.\nThe environments look great but there were still cases after 8 hours of gameplay that I would try to fly through a solid surface because I thought that it was a background. Maybe that\u2019s my fault though.\n\n[b][u]Story[/u][/b]\nThe story is simple but nice. It has enough depth and twists to keep it interesting but I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s among the best I\u2019ve seen. I could say the same for the characters. Most of them don\u2019t have complicated motivations but they have their own memorable characters. \n\n[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]\nThis is the weirdest part for me because even though I\u2019d recommend the game, this is where most of its imperfections come from. This game is a very strange mix of different elements that could be seen as an identity crisis. It\u2019s a platformer without much platforming because the main character can fly for 90% of the game. It\u2019s a shooter without very precise controls or satisfying combat mechanics. It\u2019s an RPG in the way it delivers its story and the upgrades you buy. It\u2019s an open world with only 3 main areas to explore and an artificial Metroidvania with no map when it comes to its level design.\n\nThose elements are not necessarily negative. They create an interesting combination that you don\u2019t see often and make it interesting to explore at first. But at the same time, they remain throughout the whole game at a very elementary level. You don\u2019t get to use your skills in new creative ways but only in the most basic and obvious ways that you\u2019d imagine.\n\nThe controls of the game work for the most part but they get messy really fast in situations that you have to do things under pressure. I'll provide some examples below.\nThe only moving character you get to control is Otus. You can carry one of the other characters that can shoot different types of projectiles. Then you can drop them or rotate between them.\n\nControls example 1: When carrying a character there are times that you need to drop them and pick up something else that\u2019s on the scene. If you happen to drop the character on top of the thing you need to pick up, you\u2019ll end up picking up the character you just dropped once again, and you\u2019d have to drop them further away so they don\u2019t block the object.\n\nControls example 2: If you try to carry somebody but you\u2019re too close to the ground, this character will appear next to you on the ground and you\u2019ll need to perform an extra action to carry him.  \n\nControls example 3: When shooting, characters do different things if you press the right trigger once or if you hold it. During some sequences doing one over the other can have serious consequences and well\u2026 it happens very often.\n\nExample 4: The jump button is a toggle for flying when airborne. Near the end, there was a sequence where you can fly only for a few seconds and you mostly have to jump. This is the only part of the game that you have to do that and it\u2019s really annoying, not because you\u2019re not used to it but because it\u2019s against the controls. It\u2019s pretty easy to accidentally start flying while you simply wanted to jump. And that part is quite punishing also because you can die by performing 1 wrong jump.\n\n[u]Stealth sequences[/u] are the messiest of them all. You can hide behind objects while walking. But sometimes you have to do the same while flying. Some other times you have to do it while carrying someone and some other times while using your web as a grappling hook. For some enemies, you can easily tell what\u2019s their line of sight but it\u2019s quite harder for others. I think that those sequences don\u2019t add anything to the game. On the contrary, they are designed against the flow of the game but not in a creative way.\n\nWhat saves the game for me is that all the things that I didn\u2019t like are mitigated by something else. The controls are bad sometimes and I lost because of it, but then there are quite many checkpoints. I could really use a map sometimes but the levels are not so chaotic and the main map is composed of 3 main areas. I hated stealth but in half of the cases, I could get past them by only avoiding a few enemies and then running like a lunatic. \n\n[b][u]Level Design[/u][/b]\nThis is partly covered before but I\u2019ll write a few words. The world of the game feels like a real place. There is a variety of areas that look different but I felt that the developers were running out of options on how to make meaningful levels based on the mechanics of the game. There were some nice puzzles and a few interesting gimmicks here and there but the level design never reached a very high standard. I think that it was the definition of decent for most of the time.\n\n[b][u]Summary[/u][/b]\nI\u2019ve seen critics giving this game 5/5 and 10/10 and honestly, as much I loved the game myself, I think that\u2019s false advertising. This is the most imperfect game with an 80-90 Metacritic score I have played in a while. It\u2019s a game that tries a lot of things and succeeds in a few.\n\nThis is an indie game that\u2019s really important for the industry. It was under development before most gamers were even aware that you can use the word indie and game in the same sentence. It\u2019s a monumental task by a really small team that gave everything they had and for that alone, I would recommend it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1616363901, "timestamp_updated": 1616365158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631714701652526855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88805005": {"recommendationid": "88805005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376951899", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 720, "last_played": 1562388264}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to like this game, and I still would recommend this game since a lot of people seem to really like it, and I get why they really like; but I just did not enjoy my playthrough.

There is so much to like and enjoy, but the enjoyment is harmed by bad design decisions and tedious mechanics. A quick rundown of my opinion on the game for those who don't want my in-depth analysis:\n\n[list]\n[*]Wonderful art style\n[*]Atmospheric sound and music\n[*]Smooth animation\n[*]All right story\n[*]Characters overreacting is a hit or miss\n[*]Tedious mechanics\n[*]Awful minigame, which is required for 100% completion\n[*]Mortifying cinematic gameplay sections\n[/list]\n\n[h1]It is good[/h1]\n\nOwlboy starts out very promising. The small little town of Vellie works well as an establishment to general movement and characters throughout the game. I enjoyed the character interactions that happen in Vellie, and I even had a chuckle or two here and there.\n\nOnce the first area had been cleared, I was excited at what might come next. I kept looking forward to the next area, waiting for one amazing, mind blowing level. However, here lies the first misstep in the game in my opinion. The Stratos/Tropos area is just a hub area mostly, but I found myself enjoying the game the most while exploring this mysterious vast space. The game brings forth many ideas, some very good ones like the ability to spawn allies to your grasp, but none of them evolve further from \"pick this thing up and put it there\". Some of the ideas are even outright horrible, but more on that later.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the story starts out very promising. It has its ups and downs (well, downs for the most part), but I cannot help but feel that some of the story moments are a bit clich\u00e9. Take that pirate captain for instance: he is just an evil prick for the sake of being evil. [spoiler]Which is why I thought it was a nice touch by the developers, that you don't actually need to fight him. That would have been boring in my opinion.[/spoiler]\n\nThe comedy in this game is really difficult to rate, because it truly is a hit or miss for the most part. Many times characters overreact in a bizarrely manic fashion, which either works or it does not. Sometimes it just came off as the developers trying to be funny, which took me out of the experience. Other times I genuinely laughed, because the whole situation was so ridiculous I could not react in any other way. Character interactions in general are either very good, or not believable. It is a very mixed bag.\n\nThe art style is simply majestic. It would seem that the developers really focused on this department the most of their 10-year development, along with general atmosphere. They even decided to put in day/night cycles, which I was not expecting at all. It gives a nice touch to the already fine tuned visuals. Sometimes the whole experience is truly magical, I cannot emphasize how entranced I was while exploring the \"hub world\" of Tropos/Stratos. It is unfortunate, that some areas are so fleeting; the best areas are not the places you are meant to spend most of your time playing, like the rather large but empty screen right before Advent.\n\n[h1]It is ugly[/h1]\n\nI found it so disappointing, that this game had to have as many problems as it did. As mentioned before, some ideas and mechanics are unnecessarily frustrating to deal with, or simply bad. One rather minor problem that grows into a larger one over the course of the game is the fact, that picking/grabbing objects uses the same key you use to pick up your allies. Countless times I had to move my allies aside, just because they were in the way of me pulling a lever or something. The hassle is what makes it so infuriating, and to me, one of the main reasons for my frustrations with the game.\n\nThe cinematic chase sequences are just straight up useless in my opinion. None of them are memorable (to me anyways), and they are a nightmare to get through. It is very difficult to see what is coming ahead of you, because the camera really wants you to see the thing that is chasing you. These moments also highlight the very clunky controls. Sure, they are very flashy, maybe even exciting and epic. But they are so very awful to play. I felt as though moments like these embody all that is wrong with this game. I wonder why the developers went through the hassle of including these in the game, when a straight up boss battle would have been more bearable.\n\nThe cannon minigame. Why on earth was this abomination devised in this manner? Mr. Owlboy keeps falling to the ground at ludicrous speed, and you better know the controls from the get go, or you will destroy the poor lad's skull (he keeps falling head first for some reason). Even if you did know the controls, it is absolutely terrible to control Mr. Owlboy. He steers like a tank and must return to his default position very slowly, before you can even think of turning him another direction. If you make ONE mistake, his coconut gets cracked. This one minigame wasted many hours of my playtime, that I could have spent more wisely elsewhere. I regret ever playing it.\n\nThe worst to last, the entire jungle stage. The whole gimmick of this level is that the jungle cave is very dark, so you cannot see without a light source. It would not be such an issue, if there was a competent light source available [b]at all times[/b]. The only thing you have available always, is one of your allies' gun that shoots a tiny flame while reloading the weapon. The flame is so tiny, it does not even light up your characters. Later on it gets better with light fruits and whatnot, but the entire stage is introduced with that useless flame that helps nobody. This stage almost made me quit the game single-handedly, because I was so frustrated with the dark corridors with no competent light source in sight. I am glad I persevered, because the final moments with the game are very good in my opinion.\n\n[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]\n\nOwlboy is a difficult game to recommend. On one hand, it gives such an invigorating adventure with beautiful visuals, music, sounds, even the story is very good sometimes. But on the other, it was clearly made visuals first: the game feels very clunky, some design decisions are questionable or bad, it is buggy on occasion, and they actually made the cannon minigame into a reality, the mad people. It is incredible, how this game is so polished on one side, and so unpolished on the other. I will give it a recommendation purely on the opinion, that I enjoyed my time so thoroughly in Stratos/Tropos, and because the final area and ending is actually epic, not just visually. Do keep in mind, however, that what I have mentioned previously may not fit someone else's idea of fun and enjoyment.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1613470739, "timestamp_updated": 1613479936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86666626": {"recommendationid": "86666626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138713811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 566, "last_played": 1613337759}, "language": "english", "review": "A side-scrolling action adventure with cute characters and a straightforward story, with added lore and a setting that could even lend itself to a sequel.\n\nFlying around, platforming and solving puzzles are great.

No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\n[b]Owlboy[/b] takes on an interesting approach by featuring a flying character in a platformer game. The game sets on a planet where flying is required to reach most places. You'll explore a lot of areas, seeing breathtaking visuals as you flap your wings.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- ~7 unique boss fights\n- Plenty of checkpoints to make the game easier\n- Secret places for collectibles for those who like to explore\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Clunky controls\n- Some areas are too dark to explore\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play platformer games with high detailed pixel art, buy this game when it's heavily discounted.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n[b]Owlboy[/b] surprises me with its stunning visuals. The high detailed pixel art reminds me of [b]Metal Slug[/b], especially with the use of [url=https://2dwillneverdie.com/tutorial/give-your-sprites-depth-with-sub-pixel-animation/]sub-pixel animation[/url], an animation technique to move some colors in a sprite to simulate movement. Animations are the core of [b]Owlboy[/b]; every scene feels lively with how everything moves outside - the characters, the clouds - even the grasses are moving. While the exteriors are filled with animations, interiors are filled with detailed backgrounds instead, making you fully immersed in the game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385843709 \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story in [b]Owlboy[/b] is brief despite it holding a lot of meaning. Most dialogues are simple and easy to follow with your best friend commenting about what is happening to both of you. However, it makes the story empty sometimes since you have to fill the important parts yourself. Some events also feel a bit rushed, especially with the introduction of villains. It took me a while before I can fully grasp the story because of this.\n\nDespite the straightforward story, the game doesn't fail in its worldbuilding. Detailed pieces of information are left hidden in several places and you must piece the story together to know what happened. The extra story only serves as additional information, but it's still an interesting read.\n\n[h1]The Game[/h1]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nPlatformer games are usually denoted by the use of platforms to reach other places, but it doesn't seem to be the case in [b]Owlboy[/b]. The flying mechanic makes the grounds feel useless, especially when the area features open spaces. There are some cases where the game disables your flying ability and forces you to either use your jumping or companion skills, but when you do, the control doesn't seem to cooperate since it's hard to switch between flying and jumping. Heck, it took me a while to realize that I can also jump.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385843743 \n\n[b]Stealth[/b]\nStealth areas are plenty but felt useless. The game offers some sort of warning at first where you have to clear an area without being seen. However, the warning seems to be gone as time goes and you have to figure out the stealth areas yourself. While this might work okay since most stealth areas have similar enemies, it's hard to figure out what you're supposed to do to clear the area without being seen most of the time. Surprisingly, you can clear the area faster by rushing your way through the exit, beating the purpose of a stealth mechanic in the first place.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nThe idea to implement different characters to clear different obstacles is clever, although it's ruined with its controls. Three companions will be available as you progress the game, each with its pros and cons, which can be summoned and carried whenever you like. However, having three companions that you have to cycle through to summon makes it hard to summon the ones that you want - I spent most of my time in boss fights just for this.\n\nIt wasn't easy to figure out how to defeat all bosses since you need to notice the safe spots from their attacks - some bosses will do an attack that almost occupies the whole screen for you to avoid. It took me several tries to beat all bosses due to their difficulty, but it felt satisfying to beat them. Some bosses feel unfair though, especially one particular boss where you must defeat it without taking damage.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385843769 \n\n[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]\nI finished [b]Owlboy[/b] in 11.7h and continued playing to check the secrets that I missed. The game feels more like a bullet hell at first, especially with the game featuring a flying character and a party member that can shoot bullets. It shows more of its platforming elements later on, despite the empty map. Although there hardly any health-restoring items, checkpoints are abundant and you'll always respawn at full health. It turns the difficulty down a lot while giving more challenge to those who want to try no death run at the same time.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nMost problems that I had with this game are due to the clunky controls. The game revolves around grabbing your companions before you can use their ability and it's hard to do it when you're standing on the ground. This affects greatly on boss fights, especially since it takes longer than your invincibility frame to last before you're ready to fight. Moreover, the game uses the left mouse button and hold the left mouse button to trigger different attacks - it was hard not to mix up both.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis game is a mixed bag to me. Most of my enjoyment comes from enjoying the beautiful-looking scenery. Exploration feels empty since it's easy to avoid enemies by flying while areas that don't allow you to fly has nothing in it, encouraging you to dash through them to clear the area faster. The clunky controls also hindering me to enjoy the game to its fullest. However, despite all that, it is still a good game, although I'm not sure if I can recommend it if it's not heavily discounted.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1612595306, "timestamp_updated": 1612953373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811628520488739014", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85978646": {"recommendationid": "85978646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266982167", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 698, "last_played": 1612627429}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game with lovely characters and wonderful music.

At times I would go as far as to say really good. The two problems with it in my opinion are the movement mechanics not really having a sense of inertia, (which can make the controls seem a little stiff) and the lack of punishment for death. There are quite a few parts that are really challenging, but you're never in danger of being sent back more than a screen. This takes the sense of stakes out of the game, and makes it feel less rewarding to complete a difficult challenge. I would loved to have seen multiple difficulty settings so players can customize their experience.\n\nWhile the physics lack a sense of inertia, I will say that Otus is very fun to control during combat. Swapping between allies is smooth as butter, and their guns feel great to aim and fire. Outside of combat, the game reminds me a lot of some of the more linear Zeldas. There's a small overworld with collectables that can help you upgrade your abilities and dungeons that use basic puzzles. Fun stuff! And unlike some of the Zelda games, the linearity works to this game's advantage. The game has small, satisfying moments of exploration, but ultimately it is designed to be a more narrative driven experience. And that suits it pretty well.\n\nSo yeah even though there are detractors, they didn't affect my experience *too* much. While there are other games that outclass this one when in comes to satisfying gameplay, I can't think of any other games that look and sound this gorgeous. And while the story isn't the most original thing ever, it's very well executed. The character's emotions really come through. You get a strong idea of what each of the main character's struggles and fears are, and it hits you in the feels.\n\nOne nitpick before I end: In the owl temple, there are these clouds that you squeeze water out of to solve puzzles. When you stop squeezing them though, the water that was already falling to the ground just disappears. This is a relatively small animation mistake but once you notice it you can't unsee it and it's really visually annoying.\n\nBut yeah to summarize: Great experience.

Gorgeously detailed pixel art with an attention to detail in the foreground and background elements, Owlboy had me exclaiming often at its beauty. The gameplay is smooth and the mechanics simple, while introducing enough new elements to keep it interesting. I found the puzzles to be quite easy, but they seemed like more of a compliment to the story than the focus of the game.\n\nFocusing on its storytelling and adventure, Owlboy knocks these aspects out of the park. Immediately you are rooting for Otus, the underdog... underowl if you will... to succeed in proving his superiors wrong. The story unfolds through various temple like stages, often reminding me of games like the Legend of Zelda with it's enemies and environments. Watch out for the gnomes. Seriously... They're voracious. Owlboy also didn't follow the story I expected it to, leading me to make conclusions of what I figured would be a classic ending; Owlboy defeats the big baddy and earns his place. However the depth and the turn in the story surprised me and left me feeling... well, quite content.\n\nThe combat is basic, but offers a fun repertoire of abilities and weapons in the companions you pick up. You have to switch between these companions to access each unique ability while traversing through the stages but more importantly during the boss fights. Where combat is not this games focus, it does a commendable job and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe platforming was a delight and where I said the puzzles are easy, it streamlines the game to progress the story and narrative. There is a lot of puzzle variety meaning you dont solve the same one often which let's be honest, that is super tiresome to do. The boss fights were quite easy, but always had fun phases and were well done. \n\nPlay or pass?\n\nPlay. Wholeheartedly. A beautiful adventure platformer focusing on it's narrative, the developers at D pad studio delivered a gorgeous game with Owlboy. I smiled more in this game than I have in any other, for a long, long time. Telling a story of Owls who grew too hungry for power, ever grasping for more and leading to their own demise.

Otus is often made fun of by the village because he's clumsy and accident prone, with his only friend being Geddy, a human guard of the village. After Sky Pirates attack the village you set out on a quest to stop them and learn about the history of the Owls.\n\nWhile the story of the game isn't incredibly deep, it's really well written. It has charm and every character is unique in their own ways. You meet interesting characters along the way to whom you really start getting attached to, not to mention the incredibly emotional story segments that cut you deep. \n\nGraphics:\n\nOwlboy's pixel art style is absolutely jaw dropping. The game looks absolutely stunning and I literally cannot praise the art style enough. Each environment you visit is bright and colorful and you visit a lot of places, each with their unique looks, it's honestly quite impressive how detailed every little thing is.\n\nEvery character is different and has their own unique set of animations. The details of this game are absolutely insane to say the least. \n\nAudio:\n\nThe audio design is also really good. The music is top notch and there's plenty of music tracks to match the tone of the area you're in. Quiet atmospheric tracks when it's set during the night, intense ambience when you're in enemy locations and so on and forth. \n\nThe sound effects are decent, albeit nothing incredibly special. They work with what they set out to do and I found a few of the audio effects incredibly satisfying especially the wooshing noises the characters make. Even the dialogue scrolling noise which is something I find most games tend to mess up, was very light on the ears and I have to give it props.\n\nGameplay:\n\nOwlboy is a side scrolling adventure where as Otus, you will platform, solve puzzles and fight enemies. Otus is not a fighter and often you will have to pick up items to throw them at enemies to defeat. However as Otus you can carry around your friends to help you solve puzzles and fight enemies. For example Geddy can be picked and he can use his gun to attack enemies. \n\nYou control the aiming yourself and it works fine for the most part, but it's never ideal. It feels quite finnicky at first and requires sometime to get used to, but I quickly picked up on it and I did end up liking the combat quite a bit. \n\nAs Otus you can fly around and reach areas and that allows you to cover a lot of land. It's quite fun to fly around and look for secrets and explore areas to interact with the village people and other items. It's a very light metroidvania, because there's multiple ways to go, but often then not there's not many places to visit which allows you to cover more land in faster time. \n\nThere is puzzles for you to solve every so often, but they are often really easy, only a handful of puzzles might make you stop in your tracks to think, but that's a rare instance, but they serve as a nice little pallet cleanser. So now let's also talk about the boss fights. They are often intense and often more difficult than anything else in the game. They are often the only places where you might die. \n\nVerdict:\n\nOften when games spend a lifetime in development, people think they will end up being bad, but Owlboy shows that is not the case in every instance. It's a brilliant game that is visually stunning, fun to play and has a really great story with plenty of funny and emotional moments to grip you. This is an absolutely amazing game worth your time.\n\nFinal Rating:\n10/10\n\nPros:\n+ Visuals are absolutely stunning\n+ Emotional story\n+ Great characters\n+ Fun Gameplay\n+ Great music \n\nCons:\nN/A\n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews", "timestamp_created": 1609530270, "timestamp_updated": 1609530376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.65907895565032959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83743706": {"recommendationid": "83743706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078071511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 110, "last_played": 1609159769}, "language": "english", "review": "No j\u00e9je, nechal jsem se nap\u00e1lit a koupil si hru na z\u00e1klad\u011b jej\u00ed prezentace.

I mean really clunky. Sometimes they don't respond quite right. With the release on the Switch, you can now use a controller but since I played most of the game on the PC with keyboard & mouse, I kept at it. Maybe a controller will make the controls feel less awkward and more responsive? It's also difficult because the art doesn't make it really clear at times what elements are just a backdrop verses what will actually cause damage (hitboxes can be rather wonky). I was also really unsatisfied with the mentor\u2014why's he such a dick? It never gets explained and it's exhausting and rather saddening that even the last line he has in the game doesn't do anything to shed light on his verbal abuse. Definitely no redemption arc there.\n\nThe good:\nThat being said, there is so much good in this game that overthrows anything bad. The art is just incredible; we've come a long way with pixels. The music is so pretty and epic at all the right times (trust, there are games that don't seem to know how to use their score but Owlboy is not one of them). The boss fights are super fun and unique; it doesn't feel rehashed like say, the boss fights in Super Mario Odyssey. There are puzzles that are somewhat challenging in this platformer that toe the line of frustrating, but not enough to the point where you really want to rage quit and throw your controller. Most importantly, even though I didn't 100% get the story or buy it, I loved the characters and their development so much that I didn't care too much about the loose ends. Really, the way the characters end up forming such a motley crew is believable and precious af.

I finished the game in about 8 hours.\n \nI kind of liked the gameplay. It wasn't great when compared to other platforming adventures and doesn't introduce a lot of new things, but it was fun enough to keep me interested. The gameplay and progression is built around three characters that you can carry around. Each character has different abilities and environmental uses (such as burning vines). The owlboy himself can fly around, punch and roll through the air. Not a lot of content, but it works well. The occasional boss fights aren't really tough but require a bit of thinking. Most bosses are less technical skill and more puzzling.\n\nIn the bottom line, I enjoyed the few hours of story gameplay, but I wouldn't pay the whole price of 23\u20ac for it.

Difficulty is Moderate to a little hard (minigame has an absurd difficulty curve and is very hard).  \n\n- The soundtrack is amazing.  One of the most inspired, active soundtracks I've heard in a long while.\n\n- The story starts out sad, almost depressing, but gets better until a whopper of an ending.  \n\n- Layout and levels are tight.  The world doesn't feel big at all and there's lots of hidden places to find and explore within it.  Each level is unique, though there isn't much variety in enemies between them. Instead of keeping the camera centered on the character, the camera moves from room to room.  This leads to enemies being out of sight one path over, then the camera swinging to show them out of nowhere when you enter the next area and you getting hit randomly (Or their projectile comes at you from off camera).  Other gamers had an issue with this, but it didn't get in the way whatsoever during my playthrough. \n\n- The bosses are all different and memorable.  Their difficulty varied.\n\n- The controls are...  Okay?  Aiming was a bit of a pain (accursed flying swarms).  My joystick was extra sensitive to some inputs like jump-gliding at the last level and I had to use the D-pad instead.  Minigame is, well, I'll get to that...  Flying around, swapping between helpers, dashing about, and shooting in general wasn't that hard to figure out, though I did continually teleport a friend into my grip instead of grab fruit from trees throughout the playthrough.\n\n- Most achievements are attainable easily on the first playthrough.  Choice others, like hitting your friend X times, seem arbitrary and a chore.  \n\n- The cannon minigame is about as fun as a nail in the boot.  You need to do it to get 100% of the coins.  Its controls are foreign from the rest of the game (I had to swap to keyboard because my controller wasn't very responsive to them), it's intolerably fast, and unlike the rest of the game the difficulty curve is insanely drastic.  Another issue is there is no quick-start option for it; if you die, which you will, repeatedly, every 10 seconds for over 30 minutes until your reflexes get in order, you have to jump back up to the cannon and hit the mouse button to re-initiate the launch sequence animation.  At some point it stopped being fun.  Which is a shame.  I did have fun playing, in a masochistic sort of way, but making it mandatory to 100% the coins seems cruel.   The only good part about the mini game is the course is short.  \n\n-*** Epilepsy warning!  Do not play this game if you have epilepsy.  Blinky blink blink blink blink flash boom white trigger lights ahoy! \n\n-*  (Lite) Motion Sickness Warning!  On top of the constant strobing light show, the screen will shake.  A lot.  Like you're playing on an excited washing machine.  Never the less, I had no issues playing right up until the end of it, where I got a miserable headache.  And a short break with water fixed that.  So if you get motion sickness from games, you'll probably be fine if you take breaks now and then. \n\n\n\n\nWould I recommend Owlboy?  Oh yeah, sure.  It's a fun, cute game with a fascinating plot and gripping music.   It's fun trying to 100% everything on the first play through.  The game is by no means perfect, and I could see the one mini game royally turning people off, but you can still beat the game without it.

The game is beautiful - easily one of the best-looking examples of pixel art in modern gaming.

It's not a whole lot of fun to have your tense boss fight interrupted by having to click through dialogue in the middle of it (with control taken away from you and, when returned without a lot of indicators that it's back, you have to scramble). There are sections of platforming-type puzzles that were a bit of a chore and a bore to get through - and it felt a little like they were put in to serve the story, which was fairly mediocre and frankly seemed to get in the way of the game. The controls in the last part, where you have some difficult platform maneuvers, felt unresponsive. \n\n I finished it, which is a high compliment in my book - I have no trouble dropping terrible, boring games if they're not finished...so it's not awful. I don't want the slick graphics to give potential buyers the idea that the game is better than it is, though, and so I'm giving this a thumbs-down.

What makes matters even worse is that the final boss is your friend with good intentions so there is no suspense or motivation story-wise (this bossfight also happens to be piss easy).\n\nTo put it simply - The game is beautiful, but way to expensive for 7 hours, of what is otherwise mediocre.", "timestamp_created": 1598023084, "timestamp_updated": 1598023279, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480158746242523193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74639761": {"recommendationid": "74639761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129936651", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 454, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 928, "last_played": 1597967751}, "language": "english", "review": "Owlboy is an incredible and amazing metroidvania game with so much to love, okay the story.\n\nOtis, a young Owlboy is taken under the wing of the protector of Vellie, Asio. Despite being born a mute Otis wants nothing more than to make his teacher proud, but sadly fails at every turn despite trying his best. \n\nOnly Geddy and a few small friends believes in him, believes he will accomplish great things, and soon Otis will get to prove himself with the help of his friends.\n\nAll right what\u2019s to like or should I say I love about this game. Well the story is really, really good with so many great moments from cute moments, too touching moments,too terrifying moments, too badass moments, too even heartbreaking  moments.\n\nThe Story also is very good about talking about some pretty heavy stuff, like depression, failure, anxiety and even abuse in some ways.\n\nThe art style in the game is incredibly beautiful so much detail and some pretty awe-inspiring moments from a pixel art game. The levels that are fun to explore with some interesting environments to be in.\n\nThe characters in the game are amazing, very colorful and unique with their own interesting personalities/depth even some of the minor characters have some depth to them. The music in the game is incredibly beautiful and fun to listen to from somber tones to happy tones to even scary tones. The game's atmosphere is incredibly good. \n\n[spoiler] Like that scene where we go into the graveyard for the first time, there is no music only sound effects, leting the atmosphere do its thing. [/spoiler]\n\nThe combat was fun and using different characters to take out enemies more quickly was a fun idea. The enemies and bosses were pretty cool looking. The games also hard but fair and even if you die you start at the beginning of the room you died in. \n\nAnd at this part of my review I would say what's to dislike about the game, but there really isn't anything to dislike it's pretty perfect. \n\nWell I would have liked a Boss Rush mode and maybe one or two more bosses or a secret boss. [spoiler] Like getting to fight Molstrom. [/spoiler] But those are really, really small gripes to an otherwise perfect game.\n\nSo With that said Owlboy is incredible and amazing metroidvania game with so much to love, from a really, really good story, to an incredibly beautiful art style and music and so much more, so if you are a fan of metroidvania games I highly, highly, highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1597967171, "timestamp_updated": 1601912130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74620601": {"recommendationid": "74620601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012215918", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1615753492}, "language": "english", "review": "Great old school SNES-like game.", "timestamp_created": 1597938589, "timestamp_updated": 1597938589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74454132": {"recommendationid": "74454132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331580828", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1596348991}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1597666967, "timestamp_updated": 1597666967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74440929": {"recommendationid": "74440929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029263628", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1541403132}, "language": "english", "review": "A very simple game", "timestamp_created": 1597643041, "timestamp_updated": 1597643041, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74413677": {"recommendationid": "74413677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081692853", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 506, "last_played": 1597528817}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1597597622, "timestamp_updated": 1597597622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74329046": {"recommendationid": "74329046", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989106538", "num_games_owned": 1054, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1470, "last_played": 1597465145}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me a while to get to this game and disappointed I didn't play it sooner cause what an amazing experience the visuals and story were great and I love Otus such a cute character.", "timestamp_created": 1597465812, "timestamp_updated": 1597465812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74326122": {"recommendationid": "74326122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112687870", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 372, "last_played": 1699055134}, "language": "english", "review": "mastapeece", "timestamp_created": 1597460801, "timestamp_updated": 1597460801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668485760688781738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74208761": {"recommendationid": "74208761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042327670", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 575, "last_played": 1530673025}, "language": "english", "review": "Lighthearted game with fantastic artwork.

Owlboy is a $25 game with about 8 hours of content, but i believe it to be fully worth the price. Every single ounce of this game is simply drenched with passion. \n\nThis game is absolutely gorgeous. The vistas are stunning, the character designs are fun and expressive, not one part of this game looks out of place. It's obvious how much thought went into every single detail. \n\nThe soundtrack is just fantastic. Easily up there with games like Undertale and Outer Wilds in just how many absolute bangers it has. The music is constantly enjoyable, and always matches perfectly with the tone of the game. \n\nThe story isn't profound, it's fairly short but it's charming the whole way through. It does a good job creating moments of suspense and tension, never at any point do you not feel a desire to progress it. For being as short as it is, there a quite a lot of very strong and impactful moments.\n\nThe characters are quirky and unique; they are all very distinct, in personality and especially visibly. There isn't a ton of characters, but none of them feel poorly written or largely unimportant. \n\nThe visuals, art, and story of a game are important, and owlboy does all of those well, but what's important about a game is the gameplay.\n\nLuckily, Owlboy succeeds at that with flying colours as well. The gimmick of this game is that you're flying around near constantly- free-flight is typically broken in most games but here, it's the core mechanic. And god is it satisfying. Just the act of moving around in this game feels nice. Combat in this game is fairly easy, but it's extremely addictive. You never really have to get any more advanced than Move + Shoot, aside from the occasional time you have to do a melee attack. That being said, mastering the combat is extremely fun. getting good at throwing things in the air, moving around, attacking, catching things before they fall, moving around as fast as you can, managing as many things as you can at once is so much fun, my biggest gripe is that there's never really an option in game to *have* to push yourself to that point. Narratively  it makes sense, Otus isn't really a fighter, But god it would be really cool if there were like some optional arena mode or whatever. But if my biggest issue with the game is that i wish there were just more of it for me to play, I think it's safe to call it a Very Good Game. \n\nOwlboy is a fantastic piece of media, and I recommend that you consume it", "timestamp_created": 1595904940, "timestamp_updated": 1595904940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645776569843292236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73377031": {"recommendationid": "73377031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157201361", "num_games_owned": 883, "num_reviews": 780, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1595885036}, "language": "english", "review": "this game was made with a lot of love\n\nthe characters were personable\nthe story was interesting\nthe animation was nice\nthe music was either good or fantastic\n\nbut it has quite a few problems with it\n- there is a major difficulty spike at the boss monkey battle and it probably took me 20-30 attempts to beat it (hint: I found generally staying low towards the middle helped a bunch)\n- pressing control esc, will whitescreen your game and trying to close the game from the desktop will freeze your computer\n- some times jumping once would trigger flight when usually jumping then pressing the jump button again would be how you would start flying. so in those times you try to fly and it does it on the first button press and you end up pressing the button again it turns it back into walking mode which was a minor annoyance.\n\noverall I say it was ok overall \n", "timestamp_created": 1595885745, "timestamp_updated": 1595885745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73269564": {"recommendationid": "73269564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235743172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1061, "last_played": 1595694995}, "language": "english", "review": "The developers clearly put a lot of attention and love into crafting this game.

It's obvious from the start that it is a product of love. The pixel art is vibrant and detailed, and the multi-layered foregrounds and backgrounds make the world feel more visually alive than most games of its style. Characters have charming, unique designs and are given expressive animations to fit them. The music is beautifully composed, performed, and timed within the game. As far as style goes, Owlboy is a masterpiece.\n\nIt isn't lacking in substance either. The story is a simple enough adventure with an interesting but fairly predictable twist yet an incredibly charming world and characters. There's also a clear understanding of what makes an adventure feel grand. Between dungeons and dramatic setpieces there are moments of respite wherein the characters simply relax, reflect, and bond. Just as well there are moments of anger and quiet sadness. Moments such as these are more important to a compelling adventure than action and heroics; Owlboy shows a clear understanding of this. What it lacks in deeper narrative it more than makes up for in execution.\n\nIf the gameplay had held up to the same standards as the above I may have considered it a masterpiece. Unfortunately this is where my complaints start.\n\nOwlboy's biggest strength may also be its biggest shortcoming. The beautifully detailed art often makes Otus hard to see. Part of the problem is Otus is brown which in of itself is not a color that stands out. Add to this that many locations are portrayed in shades of brown, with brown enemies, and brown projectiles. These problems aren't always happening at once but overall it seems in making the game so incredible to look at D-Pad Studio forgot that visual language is important for gameplay as well as atmosphere. The color of a character and its environment or enemies don't always have to be completely contrasted, of course, but this game struggles to find a balance. The issue is worsened when the companions you carry distract from Otus even more with their own distinct visuals. In the end I felt through the entire game that I never had a complete grasp on Otus' hitbox and often left combat feeling somewhat frustrated. Add to this that the reticle is very slippery and that Otus seems slow to react at times. Ultimately only a handful of combat encounters, unsurprisingly those with fairly neutral backgrounds and one distinct enemy, were fulfilling. However, the scripted action setpieces were thrilling and never overstayed their welcome.\n\nThe puzzling and platforming were at least fun, overall. Even the dreaded cannon minigame only bothered me in that you had to fly to a platform and watch a short cutscene to restart, which you will be doing many times.\n\nIf I had one more complaint it would be that if you're going to incentivize collecting everything you should perhaps have a limited fast travel system and a rough map. I never got lost myself, but it would be nice to have a frame of reference when deciding to re-examine the world at end game. By that point I couldn't be bothered to fly through the entire map once more looking for every last obscure coin.\n\nAll this isn't to say the gameplay is bad, it's just the weakest aspect of the game and I wanted to elaborate a bit more on the problems with it for those seeking a polished gameplay experience. That said, it's functional enough that I was never too frustrated to see what the characters would encounter next and in a game like this that may be all that matters. It was enough that I would still recommend this game for the experience alone; it's not a game I will soon forget. For every flaw in the mechanics, every encounter that I couldn't find clarity in, I found myself excited for the next dialogue between the characters. I wanted to hear more of the soundtrack and see it set against the stunning art direction in whatever new location that team Otus would find themselves in next. Despite everything I've criticized, I never once considered dropping the game.

It has some nice mechanics, some interesting worldbuilding and beautiful graphics, but it didn't really manage to catch me. It wasn't really difficult, but some parts were more annoying than fun to go through, and a few bugs made it annoying to play (every time I launched the game was a lottery to see if the controller was going to be detected, the game's main ranged attack has an annoying habit to \"lock on\" into things that don't exist and for some reason the game crashes if my internet connection is cut) Still, there was enough good in it that I persevered, even though I never felt the constant need to go back that I feel when a game manages to trap me.\n\nBut then, I reached it. I reached a part of the game with a puzzle so heinous, sadistic and painfully unfun that I absolutely had to ragequit for good. I don't know whose idea was to put a puzzle that\na) demands so much use of reflexes after a whole game where such thing was barely needed\nb) depends on heavy use of controls that are unresponsive\nc) needs you to use an attack that sometimes outright refuses to detect\nd) relies on the proper use of the \"lock on\" feature, which is painfully unreliable and\ne) is mandatory to progress in the game.\n\nI don't see many people complain about this, so either this game's bugs are only affecting me or other people have much more patience than I do. Perhaps they simply were really liking the game until this point instead of barely slogging through it with no interest like I was, so when they reached this part they weren't already bordering on rage. It doesn't matter. What matters is that it happened to me, so I can only speak from my experience.\n\nThere are some good things here, yes.

But soon this life is disrupted as a group of sky pirates attack the village, stealing an ancient relic that was created by the ancient owls. It is up to Otus and Geddy to head out and save the world... if they're not distracted by just how gorgeous the world is.\n\nOkay, calling the game a platformer might be a tad generous, but calling it a flight simulator isn't really accurate either. Because Otus can fly all over the place there's very little actual platforming, and the gameplay instead consists more of flying through various tunnels and avoiding obstacles. Adding to this there are some fight segments, where you basically fly circles around the enemies and pepper them with bullets... aside from a few bosses where you are instead kicked around like a feathery football, because they have attacks that are almost impossible to dodge. And then there are parts where you have to be stealthy, or else you risk getting eaten in a surprisingly graphic manner which reminded me of some of the deaths in Heart of Darkness. Adding to that there are some minor metroidvania-elements, but because the game is overall very linear I mostly mention this for completeness sake.\n\nOwlboy could easily be mistaken for a good game to have your kid play before they can start on more advanced games, but don't be fooled; this game is far from easy. It's not particularly difficult either, but there are parts that really surprised me with just how difficult they were, mostly the aforementioned bosses and the very first stealth section you encounter. I think the best way to describe the difficulty would be \"inconsistent\". There are segments where you have to activate a timed switch, then fly through the gate it opened with only a two-second margin, and as I mentioned some of the bosses have attacks that are so difficult to dodge that my best strategy was to just hope I could tank through them. Meanwhile, the very last boss of the game (who is powered up by these super-powerful relics which could very well end the world, I'll remind you) got handed an ass whooping on my very first try. This is not to say that the gameplay is bad, it's smooth, it's occasionally satisfying, and it works well enough to take you through the game, but there are certain speed-bumps on the way, if you catch my drift.\n\nThe story of Owlboy is fine. Not great, but it does what it can with a standard setup. Outcast must step up to the challenge, prove his worth, find the macguffins, and save the world, that sort of thing. What makes it work is not the story in itself (mostly because the ending is kind of disappointing, like they ran out of time when putting it together), but rather the characters. You've got Otus, of course, the mute with low self-esteem but a surprising lot of bravery, you've got Geddy, the best friend who sticks with you through thick and thin even though he's kind of a coward, and later on you recruit two other characters who, without wishing to spoil, are also surprisingly fleshed-out, considering the small amount of time we spend with them (the game isn't that long). Too bad the same can't be said for the villain, who basically spends all of his time just stomping around and acting evil for the sake of being evil. It's kind of a shame too, I was hoping there would be SOMETHING more to him than a mean attitude and a frowny face.\n\nSo the gameplay and the story are servicable, but nothing that you can't find elsewhere. However, if there is one thing that will sell you on this game, it is the graphics. Now, I normally do not care for graphics, as long as I can make out what is going on I'm good, I'm more focused on the gameplay, that sort of thing. But Owlboy is one of those rare examples where I can sicerely recommend giving it a look based on graphics alone. Seriously, this game is gorgeous! I would buy printed maps from the game and hang in my living room if I could! And I know some people will say \"well, it's a pixel-2D game, those are easier to make look good than 3D games\". But to that I say, it may indeed be easy to make a game in pixel-2D. Making a game look GOOD in pixel-2D, on the other hand, is difficult. Especially when you are shooting for the kind of vibrant colors that Owlboy uses, and smooth animations. And I will never get tired of Otus's surprised-face. That is a face which says \"I have stared into the abyss, before I realized it didn't have any underpants.\"\n\nOh, and the music is nice too.\n\nOverall, I had a fine time with Owlboy. It's not a very long game, it took me 6 hours to go from start to finish with some minor side-stuff. But if you're looking for a well done 2D game with decent gameplay, lovable characters, good music and marvelous graphics, you should give Owlboy a look.

I don\u2019t know how I missed that absolute masterpiece for such a long time.\n\nThis game isn\u2019t something that you play over and over again. It is so deep and impactful that a single playtrough [u] makes your wonder for hours after you finished it. [/u] Of course, there are a few things to do after you finish the main campaign, and they fit really well, but the story is the main thing here.\n\nAnd not only that, each character\u2019s Arch is so unique and meaningful that makes you want to understand [u] every.single.backstory. [/u] Each one has its ghosts, its fears, its angers, its funny moments. I found myself related a lot with Otus and his fears on the first minutes of the game and was thrilled to see how he managed to keep going, even with such handicap (narratively speaking). I cried in several moments of the game, got angry with some characters, and that only show how deep and well thought each one of them are. [b] (ESPECIALLY THE BOGUINS!) [/b]\n\nOn a [b] Game Design perspective, [/b] the game also shines. And a lot! When you finish learning a new mechanic, the game twists into making the very best use of that mechanic repeatedly, but here\u2019s the catch: [u] it doesn\u2019t feel repetitive, specially because there is always something new on the mix, something that makes you go \u201caha!\u201d after each puzzle. [/u] At the final stage (not a spoiler) I was still learning new mechanics, applying everything I unconsciously learned in order to beat the game.\n\n[b] Sound Design? [/b] Absolutely stunning. Although some soundtracks don\u2019t loop and you can easily notice when it ends, each and every song on the game is amazingly immersive and drives perfectly the mood of each stage. The Sound effects are awesome as well, very satisfying to hear when using every mechanic. Damage, narrative emphasis, mood setting, they fit well in any part of the game.\n\nSumming up, the game is a short story compared to other games out there (I played so far 8 hours, with some exploring one each area), but it doesn\u2019t stay behind in any other subject. Puzzles, Animations, Visuals, Narrative, Characters Background, Side quests, Mechanics, Level Design, sound design, FX, etc, everything fits so great together that I wouldn\u2019t even bother to ask for a DLC or more content (which if existed, it would be greatly appreciated).

My three main gripes are the cumbersome mechanic, map design, and how oddly infuriating the game can be at times.\n\nThe mechanic of picking up things like fruits. world objects, and characters with different abilities are extremely annoying at times.  When i dropped one of my partner and try to pick up a fruit to heal, i would consistently end up picking up the character that i dropped previously.  It is rather annoying when you are trying to quickly move around the map or evade enemies.\n\nSpeaking of maps, the map designs are terrible for the most part.  There were times were I did not know where to go to progress the game - only to find out that I just needed to move to the right.  But I didn't see the pathway to the righ, because of how it blends into the background.   So, whenever i am stuck in a particular segment of the map, i just wildly roll into walls to see if I can progress to the next area.  And speaking of areas, the transition from one segment of an area to the next is rather archaic.  Instead of a smooth transition, or the camera panning along with your characters, the camera does a quick shift to whatever area is going to be revealed next.  It's a rather cumbersome system, as sometimes when enemies are chasing you - that brief pause when transitioning areas can ruined your flow of movement.\n\nOverall, the game is very infuriating.  For instances, I died to the first few low level monsters because it seems that I cannot kill them with the first ability of my green character.  So one would think, \"Okay, if you cant kill it, run from it!\".  However, that does not work!  Because Owlboy flies extremely slow, even if your spamming the dodge button while flying or walking.  So there has been moments where I've been killed just because I can't escape the barrage of monsters attacking my character.  Whenever i encounter maps like that, I just bullrush past by the enemies, taken hits along the way and hope that i survive.  A lot of my gameplay was just running away. \n\nAnother thing is, one would think, a flying mechanic would be great for a metrovania game, but to me, it actually hurt this game.  Because of the game being more vertical-centric, the map designs aren't great at all as there are huge gaps between platforms - sometimes, all you do is spam the dodge button on empty maps just to transition to the next faster.  \n\nOverall, this game was rather lackluster.  There are plenty of other metrovania games out there that does so much better than this game.

It was that the core sensation of moving through the world was itself satisfying \u2014 whether the momentum of running down a slope, the sensation of travel (and peril) when jumping from one moving platform to the next, or the satisfying springyness of a well judged bounce off an enemy's head. In a good platform game, all of these actions deliver tangible feedback to the player, which gives them a feel for the physics of the world, and a sense of agency over their avatar.\n\nThere are many indie platformers which understand this, and successfully recapture that magic, but Owlboy doesn't.\n\nIn Owlboy, the flying mechanics amount to the following: Press Jump, press Jump again in the air. That's it. You're flying now. Suspended in the air, Owlboy waits patiently for the next movement impulse, which is to say pressing the analogue stick in 1 of 8 directions. Owlboy will then move in a straight, perfect and unfaltering line in that direction, at a constant speed. No acceleration, no momentum, no resistance. No dip or swoop as you beat your wings against the imagined wind. I'm not trying to exaggerate or be comically harsh when I say there is a stronger and more nuanced sensation of movement when we're sending Pacman around corners of a maze \u2014 there just is. In a game that is all about flight, it's a missed opportunity. \n\nThe foundation of Owlboy is therefore not original or satisfying platform game mechanics, which were then embellished with beautiful art.

The puzzle platformer part of the game wasn't really difficult but it kept you engaged enough that if you were ok with that kind of gameplay you wouldn't care but it was not really thought provoking. The metroidvania tag is a bit misleading if you are expecting a full action game. In exploration it is definitely a metroidvania but in terms of action most of the enemies are negligible once you experience them a few times and only one \"boss\" turns out to be a real challenge because his minions can just grab you and prevent you from flying so you get instantly killed by lava. \n\nThe story was ok for the beginning and middle but oh man that ending was bad. Like I was perfectly fine with the way everything was going because I was liking the gameplay and the game really does look great in each area but the climax of the story just felt awful once you got to it. The character in focus felt like it didn't make sense and that it was all pulled together for some shock value that just took away from the story. I wouldn't have cared as much had this been just a part of the story and not the peak but unfortunately it is all we get. The funny thing is that this peak could have just been a mini experience before the real expected final boss of the game and it would have been better but no we just have an unsatisfying and confusing final boss choice. [spoiler] Meanwhile the character that could have been a rather intense final boss that makes sense gets instantly vaporized because you swat a totem a few times after you beat the final boss. It really seems like such a confusing choice that they picked the character they did to be the final experience in the game when the big bad guy hyped up the entire game gets thrown to the side and then blown away when he has a chance to shine [/spoiler] Once that is done even the ending after that is very open ended and unsatisfying when it didn't really feel like it needed to be that way. This game didn't come across as cryptic so I don't know why they decided to make for such a confusing ending when it could have been laid out in a more satisfying way with a conclusion. \n\nAll of that being said I did have fun in the game and I do recommend it as I was having a pretty good time right until the ending. I would probably recommend only getting it on sale though especially since I received the game from the humble bundle so I didn't even really choose to buy the game I just happened to get it after I paid for other games I was looking for. Also some people said the cannon minigame was awful but I didn't have any problems with it aside from learning the initial controls but apparently that is a very common complaint from people trying to get all the achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1578378728, "timestamp_updated": 1578378978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61332710": {"recommendationid": "61332710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198448480990", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1578200003}, "language": "english", "review": "You're the Avatar and u must bring balance to the four nations.", "timestamp_created": 1578200504, "timestamp_updated": 1578200504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474874377250671387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61032614": {"recommendationid": "61032614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083946393", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1256, "last_played": 1579348551}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely fun game.

It has similar exploration to Metroid, with the puzzles and charm of Zelda, so if you're into either of those franchises, this is already a game you should be interested in. The music and characters were fun, and the game's got some of the better pixel art, compared to other games out there. While the story was rather simple, I still found myself invested in it, due to the appeal of the world, and the characters inhabiting it.\n\nI 100% recommend picking this game up on sale. However, unless you're really into this style of game, I'd say you should only get it on sale. The story is pretty short, and aside from it, there's little to nothing else to do; it's a pretty linear game in all honesty, and while I enjoyed the experience through and through, I can't say there was a little left to be desired. I talked about those desires to a friend who also beat the game, and they agreed with them. Supposedly, though, there was a lot of cut content, as the game was under development for ten years. If this is the truth I honestly can't blame the game for its shortcomings, but that dosen't nullify my one complaint.\n\nAnyways, like I said. Owlboy's definitely gonna be worth your money once another sale rolls around and cuts it a few dollars down.

I played it for four hours straight- the controls are tight and I have a blast flying and dashing everywhere, and the puzzles- while not hard- are fun brain teasers. Just about everything is satisfying in this game, especially when you land a good hard hit on an annoying enemy. \nMy only issue comes in with the combat, and even then it's not much. Gauntlets, which are common in this game, basically drive you into the ground without pixel perfect movements. You drop your partner, which is a necessity for beating said gauntlets, and have a fair amount of hitstun and knockback when an enemy touches you. \nIn this game, however, there's absolutely no penalty for dying. In some cases, there's even a bonus for dying- I've died several times to escape an onslaught of untouchable enemies. That for me makes up for the less than perfect combat features. And it feels good to play, honestly, I had a blast the whole time.\nPlay this game if you like puzzle platformers, or hell, are a fan of the Kirby series. A fun, cheesy, not-very-difficult adventure full of charming characters and gorgeous scenery and character design.

No. Is it a bad game? Kind of. When I saw Owlboy on steam, I noticed it was tagged as a metroidvania and I got excited. I enjoy the genre, it might be my favorite. What I don't enjoy is playing through Owlboy and finding the user tags lied to me, for this was a linear \"puzzle\" \"platformer\" without any challenge or fun a puzzle platformer may have. You essentially go through dungeons, making use of your partners' abilities in combat and puzzles. This could make a great game except the combat was lacking and the puzzles never made my single brain cell need to think. Boss fights were laughable. With gameplay seriously lacking, one would think that the story would make up for it. Make the game look and sound great, tell a neat story, and throw in enough puzzle platforming to make the game longer than 3 hours, bada bing bada boom, game is worth the 5 pennies you spent on it while it was on sale. The only problem is that the story itself is far from good. If you remove the main characters from the story, only 5% of the game matters at all. Your actions do nothing until the very end, and, at that point, I am only still playing in an attempt to convince myself that the money I spent may have been worth it. Even though I had felt the game was dragging on for longer than necessary, the ending still managed to feel abrupt. The story is all rising action and ends with the climax, no falling action whatsoever. There's a lot left unsaid even though it very well could have been said. This could be something you find out with 100% completion, but I don't care enough to 100% this game, even though it would probably take 15 more minutes to do. The characters themselves are okay, with the exception of one, whose name is escaping me because I don't care about any character in the slightest. The plot twist 75% of the way through the game is asinine and made me feel physical pain as I realized the game was not over. Finding out how much time was spent making this shit show fills my heart with sadness. So much potential was put to waste. Overall, I give the game a 4/10. If you still want to play the game even after all I've said, then go for it. It might just be something you enjoy, but this is not something for everybody. If you're looking for a metroidvania that looks beautiful, just play Hollow Knight or Ori and the Blind Forest. If you want a decent puzzle platformer, play Donkey Kong for the gameboy", "timestamp_created": 1575011226, "timestamp_updated": 1575011226, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581180870532989502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58467947": {"recommendationid": "58467947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078375000", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 489, "last_played": 1574969606}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall a really good experience.

The 2nd dark section also introduces a bug enemy that quite rapidly depletes your health if you leave very limited pools of light and cannot be killed.  Combine this was annoying normal enemy placements that you often can\u2019t see until they are in range to attack you, a stun lock system from enemy projectiles, and mazelike level design and it was pure frustration.  \n\nRegardless, I decided to press on.  Immediately afterwards I ran headfirst into a boss that gives very little indication about how you are supposed to beat it.  After becoming increasingly frustrated I looked up a video and it turns out I was doing it right, it is just a huge bullet sponge that has almost zero player feedback.

WOWOWOW I was blown away. Charming characters, moving story, and beautiful graphics. Dialogue-less characters are not usually my bag since I usually find them bland. But Otus is endearing and optimistic, with nice expressive emotes and animation. (Can I say, his O_O face is my FAV). I was immediately sucked into his story and the world surrounding him. \nExploration feels really rewarding especially with the hidden areas just off the screen of the map, as it should with any good Metroidvania. Not super in love with the coin-hunting aspect, but it did make earning the earlier rewards fun. If you're worried about it being difficult to control with just mouse and keyboard like I was (the name D-Pad Studio made me sweat a bit) don't worry, it handles well if not better with a mouse.\n\nSome things that could be improved:\n- I don't have a very good sense of direction, so I often found myself growing frustrated trying to return to certain areas for completion purposes. A map/teleportation feature would be immensely helpful during these portions\n- The latter half of the game drags a bit and is missing the more humanizing character moments that the first few hours had. The bosses (esp the jungle one) felt more like a frustration grind than anything skill related.\n- Spinning on the gears puzzles can get frustrating esp since it doesn't always seem to register and requires a bit of maneuvering to find its sweet spot sometimes.\n- Cannon minigame sucks butt\n\nAll this to say: a lovely game with a few flaws.", "timestamp_created": 1573331614, "timestamp_updated": 1573331614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56865752": {"recommendationid": "56865752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008414212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1577406362}, "language": "english", "review": "Watched a let's play on YouTube, and after a very promising start, including the ingenious scene with the big water jug, I decided I had to play this for myself. The art direction is charming and the game seemed witty and interesting.\n\nSadly, after the promising intro, Owlboy quickly devolves into a very unoriginal platformer. The pacing isn't that good, you're often unsure about where you're supposed to go, flying is limitless, puzzles for the most part very simple and easy, combat is clunky, difficulty ramps up way too quickly, the way action stops all the time to tell you obvious things is irritating (\"you hit this button! Now let me stop the game and move the camera over to show you that the only locked door in the room opened!\"), and some elements in the game are just nonsensical. You have the ability to carry support characters around, but the game doesn't do much with this mechanic other than have you lug people with guns around, making it feels like you're playing an old arcade shoot-em-up. You have a horizontal dash attack, but since you're flying and enemies come in from all directions this just becomes irritating as you have to position yourself just right to defend yourself.\n\nThe plot definitely has potential, and there is some character growth and plot twists, but it didn't succeed in engaging me, and the characters are for the most part shallow stereotypes. \n\nThe game has some great ideas, but does not really utilise them. In an early dungeon I could move and manipulate a cloud to make it rain to solve puzzles and kill fire enemies, which I thought was a great touch and thought would be a big part of the game from then on, like Ori's ability to dash off of enemies, but then from then on it was just generic puzzles again.\n\nMost annoying of all is that like with the first-person mystery game Draugen, the Norwegian localisation is very directly translated from English rather than using actual Norwegian phrases and expressions, which is pretty disappointing for a game made in Norway.\n\nIf you want a platformer with wonderful, creative systems, great graphics and music, and an engaging story, get Ori and the Blind Forest.", "timestamp_created": 1573327737, "timestamp_updated": 1573329019, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550813436508178711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56653080": {"recommendationid": "56653080", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999349492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 546, "last_played": 1573513118}, "language": "english", "review": "Owl Boy is fantastic, if you wasted your middle and high school years playing SNES like I did.", "timestamp_created": 1573073936, "timestamp_updated": 1573073936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56518406": {"recommendationid": "56518406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253413741", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 119, "last_played": 1595092077}, "language": "english", "review": "I was lucky enough to spot this on a daily deal.\n\n\nBeen playing it for 2 hours and savouring every second.

Worth playing but not likely to change your life. [/b]\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nOwlboy presents a unique gameplay style, with the ability to freely fly through the 2D world the focus is less upon platforming or even precision flying but instead allowing the challenges to be about the combat system and puzzle solving. the flying itself feels good with the ability to dodge in midair providing an elevated sense of control as well as allowing for quick traversal throughout already completed areas, combat relies heavily upon use of companions rather than the inherit abilities of the main character. However thanks to the ease with which you can switch between and control those companions it never feels like a detriment. The only real issue occurs with the fact that your first companion is made largely irrelevant by the final companion. Otherwise the mechanical gameplay is solid and leaves very to complain about\n[b] Gameplay Score 8/10 [/b]\n\n[h1] Sound Design [/h1]\nOne of the twin pillars holding up this game and explaining its high rating. The sound design is just absolutely glorious, it successfully sets the tone throughout the game and manages the not to be underestimated feat of not becoming bland over time. furthermore the little sounds that sprinkle flavor through the game are simple and elegant in a way that complements the score around it without ever distracting from it.\n[b] Sound Design Score 10/10 [/b]\n\n[h1] Art Design [/h1]\nThe other pillar of this game. The pixel art on display here is masterful. The retro style often used as a crutch to reduce the time and costs of art design is instead elevated to an unprecedented standard with multiple layers of foreground and background being merged together to create a visually dynamic world that is constantly impressive. Furthermore the animations are masterful with real emotion and weight on display even in small motions. The Intro alone reveals the amount of work that went in to making these characters move in a way that lets you feel for them, and sets a gold standard within the style. \n[b] Art Design Score 10/10 [/b]\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThis area is sadly the weakest part of the game by a wide margin. To begin the length of the game is sadly lacking. Short games are fine in general and can even provide experiences that are wasted on a longer format, but this is not on of them. With the way that the game plays and how the narrative moves forward the point where you enter the final section feels like it should be at most the halfway point. in this case specifically the atmosphere of the world cries out for much more exploration and depth. Whats more the story being told here does not do justice to the world it is being presented in. many details are revealed hastily and given no time to sink in or even be processed by the characters before the next major plot point steamrolls into place and barrels the game closer to the end. The other failing lies in that much of the dialogue feels like it needs a few more passes and to be read aloud and adjusted before being presented. In fact the lack of voice acting is in this case a good thing as much of what the characters say is stilted and awkward in ways that do not mesh with the character delivering them. It is truly disappointing as it is clear that the bones of a rich and truly epic story are here but not given the room to be fully explored. Also it should be noted that this issue is exacerbated by the notable lack of side content within the game. despite a large focus on completionist style treasure hunting on display in the achievements there is no real reason for doing most of it within the narrative of the game. \n[b] Story Score 4/10 [/b]\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]\nIn the end and despite what flaws the game has I do still recommend this game fairly highly on its merits alone. the only final issue i wish to address is a slight caveat to my recommendation. This game is one that most people should play, if they can get a good price for it. As it stands the game retails for $25 with a $10 soundtrack which if bundled together costs $31.50. As the soundtrack is lovely I would be remiss to recommend the game without it. The problem lies with the fact that in for the length of the game the price is fairly steep, if you truly loves games of this genre and want to show your full support for the devs then that that price is worth it, but if this game being for you is a question even at all i would recommend looking for a sale before acquiring it.", "timestamp_created": 1572263173, "timestamp_updated": 1572263238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596877574920654297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55831196": {"recommendationid": "55831196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071463268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 156, "last_played": 1524845671}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my all time favourite games.

Characters are almost all decently written, I ended up surprised at the amount of depth Geddy and Asio had in particular. The music is outright great, it's a fun combination of chiptune and orchestral mixes and they pretty much all sound amazing; while I do plan on getting into this game's (many) shortfalls soon, there's pretty much nothing negative to say about the soundtrack. The art is also amazing from start to finish. The style stays consistently beautiful and charming, and I really can't think of any glaring errors or moments at all where I didn't feel enthralled by the game's looks. The plot is also decently written for what it is. It's starts off whimsical enough before delving into some really dark depths with some very high stakes, although it does somewhat fizzle out by the end.\n\nThe best criticism I could give this game would be that there was room for more.\n\nSPOILERS PAST HERE\n\nThere was room for more boss fights, we get like three or maybe four and that's it. Movement and combat in this game is relatively fun and even a little tactical, and it would've been nice to have seen the limits of the system in place really pushed and tested, but they're not. You've got Geddy the weak but long-range shooter, although even with his upgrade he never really gains that much range. Alphonse has a powerful but short/med-range attack with a long reload time, and actually functions perfectly in his niche. Twig is meant to be a stunner, but in most situations his attacks take enemies out anyway, and what's more he has a full-screen range and a very fast fire time, essentially making Geddy borderline obsolete. This isn't helped by the fact that there isn't much incentive to actually kill most of the enemies you encounter. There's a few areas where you get coins for clearing them out once, but afterwords there's no reason to not just bind enemies with Twig and run.\n\nThere was room for more areas and world building. We get Vellie, Advent (but not really), The Owl Temple, The Owl Tower, The Floating Continent, and a few caves. That's pretty much it. You never actually explore Advent, and nobody in Vellie talks about any town other than Advent, which makes the world seem weirdly tiny. There's no discussion of other islands, continents, or kingdoms, the inhabited world just seems to consist of the 10 or so people who live in Vellie and Advent (and the three stragglers in other lands). The owls have it even worse off. We're told that there aren't many of them, but if the remaining owls really just consist of the 6 males we encounter, they're basically near-extinct, and no one acknowledges it. Twig comes from a race of talking stick bugs, and given his dialogue there's seemingly a race of talking man-sized spiders as well, but neither are addressed. Are Twig and his family the only talking stick bugs alive? Are there more races of sapient beings on other floating islands? We never find out. More areas are definitely needed, but more than that what was needed was even the mention of more of the world in general.\n\nThere was room for more rewards. The cloak upgrade we get is extremely fun to use, but by the time we get it it's borderline useless. What's worse is that power-wise it's sits at this point where it's blatantly an endgame item and you understand why you get it so late, and yet there could've easily been cloaks that fit in-between the starter cloak and the final one. Geddy's upgrade is, well, borderline useless. The gun is still weak, and the scope doesn't really add much range at all to compensate. He easily could've used another range upgrade of even a minor power upgrade. Alphonse, again, is pretty much the only character that's perfectly balanced. His one upgrade gives him a tremendous about of range without really shifting his role as the slow, but powerful shooter. Even better range or faster firing speed in exchanged for slightly weaker attacks could've been other upgrades along his path though. Twig has no upgrades, although given how useful he already is he more or less didn't need any. Honestly his range and stun time could've been nerfed somewhat while still keeping him incredibly useful, and allowed for some space for upgrades for him as well. Going back to the more areas suggestion, having more enemies and a greater variety of them would've allowed for more room for combat oriented upgrades in turn, and would've allowed the developers to further develop and differentiate our three companions playstyles and even our own, but unfortunately that's another area where the game simply falls short.\n\nFinally, there was room for more plot and character development. If Noctae could predict his death and Otus's eventual role, why didn't he leave more messages? The reveal in The Sanctum might've had more impact if he had spoken to us more than once, perhaps through recordings left in other temples and ruins. Solus should've had more appearances, and his connection to older Owl lore should've been expanded upon. We see him so little and he talks so little about Owl history that the fact that he was apparently the most knowledgeable about it kind of came out of left field. I guess we were maybe supposed to assume that the scrolls he was dropping everywhere were important old documents? It would've helped the plot a lot if he had actually interacted with Otus more over the course of the game. He could've easily had a permanent spot in Vellie or the surrounding areas where we could've optionally chatted to him about the Owl Temple and the Lost Continent, and he could've provided background information on both areas, showing us his knowledge and allowing the player to form a greater connection with him as well. More unique Pirates and just more development for the pirates in general would've been nice. Alphonse says he aspires to be an actor, but there's never a point where we see him act. No scene where he uses his skill to stealthily trick his way around fellow pirates, and no scene where he tries to orate for the other crew members around a campfire, it's just a throwaway line. Dirk claimed to feel a genuine sense of camraderie with Alphonse, but that never shows through their interactions. He doesn't seem any more jovial or kind with Alphonse when they're alone than he does at any other point in the game. Molstrom is a war bot obsessed with destruction, but even he should've been aware that having all of the islands fly into space would've ended all life and consequently made any further attempts to wage war impossible. He's seemingly just mindlessly evil for no real reason. On a more minor note, Geddy's potential relationship with Mandolin is sort of mentioned in her diary, but otherwise never brought up or addressed properly in the game at all. Geddy doesn't even interact with Mandolin more than once in the beginning of the game, and never mentions her at all beyond that, which is insane considering Mandolin's last diary entry mentions them discussing moving in together. You'd think that'd make for a good fireside chat, but nope.\n\nEND SPOILERS\n\nOverall, despite the long development cycle, Owlboy comes off feeling like it could've used even more time.

The developers on Owlboy have been working on this game for roughly 10 years, and the end product is absolutely stunning. Beautiful pixel art, fitting and emotional music, and lively, vivid characters.\n\nHowever, all that glitters is not gold. Owlboy, although having it's many great attributes as mentioned, contains several flaws, and it truly pains me to say that considering the amount of work and love put into this game.\n\nIt's very evident that the devs put priority in the art and music in this game. The sprites are all so beautifully animated, and detailed. So are the landscapes and backgrounds. And the music finds itself in the same area. Perfectly orchestrated, and fitting for every scenario. However, the developers put these two in such high priority, that I feel they neglected the most important part when making a game; The Gameplay.\n\nI believe Owlboy would've benefited greatly from one more year in development, but that year being dedicated to adding more fun gameplay mechanics. More upgrades, more levels, more abilities, and maybe even more party members. Although this game has been in development for as long as it has, I feel like they spent most, if not all of that time developing the art and music.\n\nIt also pains me just how short this game is. It's only roughly 6 hours long. It's truly disappointing because of just how interesting and pretty the world of Owlboy is. I would've loved to be captivated in it's world for longer, but before I knew it, the game was already coming to a close. I hope a DLC is released with more Owlboy lore, for I deeply enjoy this universe that has been created.\n\nAll of that being said, I still cannot say you should skip Owlboy. It still remains as one of the greatest Indie experiences I have played here on Steam. And for that, pick up this game when you have a chance.\n\nI give Owlboy:\n\n8.2 Grown Man Tears out of 10\n\nBy the way, play this game with a controller, it is far more enjoyable than with a mouse and keyboard.", "timestamp_created": 1567092670, "timestamp_updated": 1567094746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54854575": {"recommendationid": "54854575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128060917", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 843, "last_played": 1566994612}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Can\u2019t recommend: bosses are way to overpowered, especially when approaching the end which really ends up ruining this game.[/b]\n\n[h1]Examples[/h1]\n\n[spoiler]Monkey Boss: His \u2018monkey servants\u2019 are in my opinion too many and keep dragging Owlboy non-stop inside lava (instant death).

There are a few parts and attributes I especially liked (the glowing health fruit, the \u2018skycity\u2019 and the \u2018campfire place\u2019 area around night for example).\n[spoiler][url=https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/777355139408722027/87A6200EA93A7E2B023140BC0D998E6900B05157/][b]Campfire Place at Night - example[/b][/url][/spoiler]\n- I think lava snake boss part 2 was original\n- When Owlboy dies he will spawn with full health as if he has unlimited lives. This basically means very little progress is lost when this happens.\n\n[b]Negative[/b]\n\n- Bosses near the ending are way to overpowered up till the point that it ruins the game. I wasn\u2019t able to finish this game. Maybe consider making a difficulty option or a \u2018skip boss\u2019 or something for people who play mainly for the storyline.\n- When Owlboy is ambushed there is too little time to recover before he\u2019s hit again, doing even more damage to his life. This because it cost time to reload the gunner on Owlboy while mobs are already re-attacking.\n- On several spots (not everywhere, the jungle part did this just fine) there is too little or even no health points/areas available at all, like on the pirate ship. Dying isn\u2019t that much of a big deal in this game BUT Owlboy WILL die multiple times because of this. I think a hero should at least attempt not to die in an rpg game. This game offers, in my opinion, too little ways to make that happen.\n\n[b]Final Note[/b]\n\nIf there is one thing I absolute hate it\u2019s playing a game close to the end and not being able to finish it due bugs or overpowered mobs.", "timestamp_created": 1566998203, "timestamp_updated": 1566998867, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426755070686340332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54831379": {"recommendationid": "54831379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048085655", "num_games_owned": 478, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 447, "last_played": 1566870915}, "language": "english", "review": "Starts off really well, but gets much worse by the end.

When the game stays equally difficult but you've already learnt to master the controls and the challenges it has taught you to handle, it get more-of-the-samey. Boring and uninteresting.\nThe story exposition really reminds you this game is shallow. As I said for the challenge in the game, the gameplay, the setting in the beginning is interesting (good) and otherwise Ocarina of Time with the village you grow up in as a mute (intentional reference?) with the non-chatty people wearing green (reference?) and the fighting forest creatures to learn the control/combat basics. - Are these things intentional references? I don't mind. It's called lampshading and plenty of people do it.\n\nAnyway, I thought it was amusing, the setting and story from Ocarina of Time in this game. I don't judge them for it at all and liked that someone else liked that game with which I grew up on my N64. Zelda-games in themselves are the proof you can re-use their elements a lot and not mind.\n\nAs an other reviewer mentioned, the story becomes that you must get 3 special relics from the ancients like in Ocarina of Time and the pirate who just destroyed the capital like in Ocarina of Time has one of them already. But you don't find out over the course of a game what that means like in Ocarina of Time; you find out every freaking cutscene.\n> The cutscenes are like powerpoint presentations. They're so boring and all-encompassing, so full of repetition it feels unnatural and breaks the suspension of disbelief. I can't invest myself in this story because it's method of revealing itself is torturous. (not the same as tortuous ;) )\nThe gameplay gets boring. I said that. But cutscenes are what really remind you, \"why am I playing this game?\" and prompt me to not play the game. really, as I said, reminding you that this game is shallow.\n\nWhen the gameplay goes down the drain and the story exposition unnervingly punishes, it pulls both plugs at the same time. Only the gorgeous art remains and that alone would not be enough.\n\nIf you get it for free, do install it and play the first part of the game. The flying is an interesting mechanic. The best of the game I have seen is before the giant frog chase. The attack on Advent was still fun but after that you can uninstall it and not play further if you want to put it down and let it be what it was.", "timestamp_created": 1560953959, "timestamp_updated": 1560953995, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512679159641265869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51304455": {"recommendationid": "51304455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309740538", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1036, "last_played": 1560878880}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game in many ways.

It feels like in the end they just wanted to play it super safe and appealed to the lowest common denominator.\n\n[b]It's an indie platformer that feels like a bad AAA \"movie game\" where the already mediocre gameplay is interrupted by endless cutscenes with trite dialog every 30 seconds.[/b]\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nIt's not even a true platformer, much less a metroidvania. The gameplay style is all over the place. You can fly and move in any direction, so sometimes it's a twin stick shooter, sometimes almost a shmup (shoot 'em up). The other times it tries to be a puzzle game where you complete super obvious puzzles by putting things into slots. Then sometimes it also wants to be a stealth game. There's a lot of stealth sections and they're as boring as can be. You just hide in the bushes, wait for the guard to look the other way, move to the next bush, rinse and repeat. Practically any one of these playstyles is nothing but tedium because there's no difficulty. You can beat the final boss on your first try because you can just i-frame dodge non-stop.\n\nWhile the game does have a continuous world, there's little exploration to be done because all progress is gated by story events. You can revisit earlier areas to collect more coins that unlock marginal upgrades (+health, some cosmetics (that disappear after 1 hit!), some minor damage boosts) and that's the extent of the game's metroidvania elements.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nAesthetics and themes wise, Owlboy tries to be Zelda, Disney and Ghibli all at once. But story wise what we're left with is an extremely tired and cliche \"collect 3 macguffins before the big bad does\" plot. And this objective will be talked about in every other cutscene, in case you forget about it.  And oh boy, there's tons of those, every time you walk through a door the game does a slow panning shot and the characters start blabbering about how scared they are that the big bad might find the macguffin before them.\n\nTo be fair, there's an interesting subplot about an ancient civilization playing god, but it's never expanded upon. In fact, the game just ends abruptly without ever explaining anything properly. They don't even tell you if the main character [spoiler]lives or dies[/spoiler].\n\n[h1]In Short:[/h1]\nOwlboy is a mediocre puzzle platformer that feels more like a bad interactive movie. It's only about 8 hours long and there's no replayability. The pixel art and orchestral soundtrack are definitely the highlights.

Think Undertale-levels of music fitting the story. Yeah, I know what I wrote. The art is amazing as well, and keeps getting better as the game progresses, which was a delightful surprise. Given all the above, I very much recommend Owlboy.\nThis is not to say that it isn't without faults, however. For one thing, the writing can feel child-like and simplistic at times, with characters sometimes speaking in ways I feel is subtly \"off\" (I can't pin down what exactly, but it's there). The combat sections, while mildly fun, aren't anything impressive either, and a few of the boss fights introduced confusing gimmicks I had to look up to solve. For the most part the puzzles were fun and satisfying, bordering on easy.\nSo Owlboy does have flaws. Some things could have been done better, but honestly, at the end of the day, I hardly care.

If you are heart-set on buying it, at least do yourself a favor and buy the bundle with the soundtrack, because the music is honestly better than the game itself. \n\nThe core gameplay mechanic of flight + grabbing stuff IS interesting. The problem is that the level design incorporates it in the most elementary ways possible. You'd have to be brain-dead to find any real challenge in the puzzles this game presents. I almost wish they would've just scrapped the mechanic altogether, and made it more of a traditional platformer with limited flight capabilities. This would even make sense within the context of the story, since we're made to believe Otus is not a gifted flyer. \n\nIts story is bland and unoriginal and only serves to frustrate the player into continuing the game. You experience failure, after failure, after failure, only to realize each time that your efforts were either completely in vain, or counterproductive to the ultimate goal. Even in the very last minutes of the game, you're made to realize that you've actually sabotaged the \"bad guys\" plan to save the world from complete destruction. The only objective that the main character Otus has, is to prove to his idiot mentor that he isn't useless and incompetent; yet, in the final moments of the game, that is exactly how I feel: useless and incompetent. Otus is then treasured as the hero of the story, even though all he ever did was get in the way at exactly the right moment. \n\nThe art and sound design is superb. I don't have much else to add there. If you appreciate those aspects of a game, then this might be a worthwhile purchase for you. \n\nOverall, I think at maybe a $10-$15 dollar price point, this game would get a thumbs up from me, but at $25 dollars there's just too much mediocrity to justify recommending it.

The story and the way it\u2019s told more than makes up for it.\nHere\u2019s my rating:\n\nStory: 10/10\nGame Play: 4.5/10\nUI: 7/10\nLevel Design: 6/10\nArt Design: 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1556336912, "timestamp_updated": 1556336912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50311872": {"recommendationid": "50311872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080623028", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 431, "last_played": 1556172779}, "language": "english", "review": "I get to throw my friends into walls. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1556173361, "timestamp_updated": 1556173361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50296284": {"recommendationid": "50296284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181744762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1542855762}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing game with a lot of love put into it.

It is a tale about finding and holding on to courage, comfort, camaderie and resolution amidst chaos, amidst problems that are seemingly beyond one's own control.[/i][/b]\n\nYes, it is a [i]story-focused[/i] game. Whilst there is a fair amount of (fun!) platforming/puzzle-solving, Owlboy wants you to get familiar with Otus, Geddy, the quaint village of Vellie, how the Floating Continents came to be. Rest assured, there's no excessive dialogue or 'lore-dumping' here! I won't deny there's a bit of world-building to keep up with -- but with good pacing, clear visuals and expressive character interactions, the game makes it really easy to understand what's going on. D-Pad Studio gradually conveys the world of Owlboy and its inhabitants in a 'Show, not Tell' manner, a form of storytelling even someone like me (...and I'm not much of a reader!) can appreciate.\n\nHere's an example: one of the concepts that Owlboy explores is the discrimination of the disabled -- right when you start the game, you are introduced to the protagonist Otus, a mute young owl struggling in a backdrop of his own nightmares. You are forced to literally walk him through a litany of demoralizing and snide comments. In character interactions, Otus often expresses angry and happy faces to answer Yes/No prompts. Otus outwardly shows feelings of sadness, of determination, and you'll notice at times (as the player) he deliberately slows to a walk, reflecting the gravity of the situation. D-Pad Studios made great use of character interactions, environmental interactions, and interactions [i]with the players themselves[/i] to help us understand Otus'perspective.\n\nWe see this attention to visual detail with other characters, and the environments as well. Owlboy is a game [i]rich in aesthetics[/i] -- every scene is like a tapestry of pixel art, brought to life through smooth animations, a gripping soundtrack (by Jonathan Geer, the same person who created awesome tunes for the Cook, Serve, Delicious! games), and punchy sound effects.\n\nAs detailed as it may be, D-Pad Studio still manages to clearly separate decor from UI elements, and a majority of the in-game interactable objects. Minor complaint, I did (only [i]very occasionally[/i]) get confused in fast-moving sequences, being unable to make a split-second judgement on whether an object was interactable, or was part of the parallax scrolling background. On the whole, the game was visually easy to decipher.\n\nMore often it was the puzzles themeselves that eluded me, but in a good way. There's a healthy smattering of carrying-objects-to-places, stealth, mazes, etc., and they often prompt you to use Otus' flying abilities and your companions' abilities in clever and precise ways. As you might presume, there isn't much actual 'jumping between platforms' to be had, the challenge was moreso quickly and deliberately navigating through narrow passages, and it was a refreshing change from your typical 2D platforming experience. There are collectables in the form of Coins, but you're only able to trade them in for cosmetics and small upgrades to your existing stats, just a small consolation for those who would like to 100% the game, but otherwise not a focal point of Owlboy.\n\nDid I mention carrying objects? Your companions are 'objects' too, you literally carry them around and have them fire projectiles like a weapon! I found this rather hilarious at first, then intruiging. The idea of carrying your companions around forms the core mechanic surrounding puzzles and combat, it's a crucial component for defeating bosses. Each boss in fact, more of a puzzle (requiring quick thinking, pattern recognition and using a smidge of reflexes), similar to bosses you encounter in games such as The Legend of Zelda series. I admit, I did die more than a few times during some boss fights, but they never seemed insurmountable, just challenging enough to be a delight when I finally pulled through.\n\nSo there you have it, Owlboy is a short and sweet game -- even playing really slowly, stopping to admire the scenery, and to see what each side character had to say, I took only 14 hours to finish it. I'd wager the less inquisitive, more goal-oriented can probably finish it in a few to several hours.\n\n\n[b]TL;DR? [/b] Please do read it anyways, but if you insist:\n[list]\n  [*] Narrative focused: a succinct, relatable, well-written plotline\n  [*] Great 'Show, Not Tell', audiovisual storytelling\n  [*] Absolutely [i]outstanding[/i] pixel art & sound design\n  [*] Familiar, yet refreshing puzzle solving / platforming / combat\n[/list]\n\n\nOh yes one more thing -- as a [b]Linux[/b] user, I must mention that this game runs flawlessly! 60FPS (on 1280x720, pixel perfect resolution), no crashes, all in-game options function as intended, controller support is present (I've tested this with a Sixaxis PS3 controller). Thank you D-Pad Studios and Ethan Lee for porting this game to Linux. <3\n\n[i](*Minor disclaimers: I've had this game gifted to me by a friend.

It's wholesome and interesting, while not pulling punches. There are parts where the story got surprisingly dark, which is a refreshing change of pace for it's genre. All the characters are unique and well designed, especially the main character.\n     With all that being said, the game drops the ball pretty damn hard near the end. Character motivations stop making sense, a very easy final boss, and an ending that makes little to no sense and feels undeserved and anti-climactic.

But did I enjoy it or like it?  Well...\n\nPros\n- Solid story and great humor.\n- Great art, graphics, and music.\n- Good autosave system.\n- Aim assist is a good thing.  Most of the time...\n\nCons\n- Aim assist can get in its own way at times.  You shoot food on the ground instead of enemies, I think just b/c the food is closer?\n- The Grab mechanic also gets in its own way when dropping your friends to the ground and trying to grab food or puzzle-related objects.\n- Both previous points can sometimes get in the way of and disrupt the flow of flight and combat. \n- The hit recovery can be ridiculous at times.  Get thrown against a wall, slide down a significant distance, etc.  It really throws you off the flow of combat and movement, especially since it resets your weapon (friend) selection.\n- No map.\n- There is a light-less portion of the game that is a pain in the butt.  Like, nothing is fun or even fair about it.  I'm not sure if I had to re-navigate it after a certain puzzle, but I did.  W/ even less light sources than before.  And got lost.  Decided to just stop playing after that.\n\nNeutral\n- The main character's mentor is an a-hole, to the levels of not even being believable.\n- It's a twin stick shooter.  So just an FYI if you were expecting something else for a 2D platformer.\n- The game does not tell you how to defeat certain enemies or do certain puzzles that may require some outside-the-box thinking.  In general, I like this, but given how particular the controls and combat can be (see above), this isn't always something I feel is necessary.  \n- It's NOT a metroidvania.  The game is basically sectioned off in a linear fashion.  The only backtracking is when a puzzle is solved.  But there are no required upgrades to go back to get, no large map, etc.  Maybe getting a new friend that unlocks a new area counts, but it's still linear and sectioned off.

Upon purchase i didn't think i could ever fall so deep in love with an indie game like this. From what i heard it took about 9 years of development and heck i say it was well worth it.\n  The games art style is simply  beautiful. You can clearly tell in the years that they were developing this really gave them time to make absolute quality. The animation details of not only the characters, but also the environment (combined with the games soundtrack) do a great job in making the world you're playing in feel alive not only in home settlements but also outside of'em. Without a doubt the hard work in that department was well spent. (tbh i got like a mixture of hollow knight and shovel knight art combination when i saw owlboys art style and I'm def not complaining)\n  Kudos to the devs for lunging at something that i don't see often (or done right) and that's the ability of flying. Now this sorta thing can pretty much remove any challenge in a game...but this game does it solidly enough, mind you it doesn't always hit the mark but the level of challenge and the movement a good enough job imo. The puzzles and combat are pretty simplistic (grab your teammate or something in the environment to blast away enemies and or just flappin' your way to new areas) but enjoyable still. Every area has it's own gimmick and way of clearing (as is normal for a metroidvania) and although bosses can be tedious, they're nothing too ridiculous to handle.\nNow whether you enjoy the story that's up to you, It's a completely subjective matter. The plot's melancholic whilst avoiding alot of it's common tropes, while caring for others. The characters are likable and have more depth to them than you might think. While you may think \"oh, It's another one of those bland or whatever Silent Protag games\" well you're wrong since Otus does well to emote to others and there's some pretty touching moments later on.\n  With the game so capably drawn and the aesthetic pairing well with the floating islands in the sky and it's history scattered all around them. It's definitely better than you'd think after looking at the screenshots.\n\n   Owlboy's a great adventure that simply amazed me. If you can get it on a sale, a playthought might take ya about maybe 7 or 8 hours (thats just cuz took me a while with one challenge to even 100%. *cries internaly* The Buckanery Cannon) and It will certainly provide ya with an enjoyable experience. The gameplay could be better, the flaws are nothing major to detract you from the pretty and unique game world.\n   Recommend on a sale or with a bundle.", "timestamp_created": 1553939846, "timestamp_updated": 1553939846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550758421421051025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49831824": {"recommendationid": "49831824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180130274", "num_games_owned": 637, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 648, "last_played": 1553881612}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game with beautiful artwork and exceptional music, the story was alright I really just wanted to play more after I finished it.", "timestamp_created": 1553882218, "timestamp_updated": 1553882218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50641024112701416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49822070": {"recommendationid": "49822070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259336780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1419, "last_played": 1622978112}, "language": "english", "review": "Movement felt really good and the story was a nice strong willpower yet originally weak hero type, the only disappointment i had was when it was over", "timestamp_created": 1553849047, "timestamp_updated": 1553849047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49811722": {"recommendationid": "49811722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196279219", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 692, "last_played": 1553798172}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a good game. \n\nYeah, best review ever", "timestamp_created": 1553801200, "timestamp_updated": 1553801200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49804930": {"recommendationid": "49804930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026969770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1553774648}, "language": "english", "review": "I personally recommend the game, but not for full prize and wanted to give a bad review so people can expect some shit going on instead of a master piece that this game should have been.\n\nBut let\u00b4s start with the basics.\n\nThis game starts quite fun, with the exploration, the story, the characters and the art. Music is also quite melodic and as ambient music does his job, controls could be better, but the flying mechanic is appreciated.\n\nThe story continues being interesting even if it does not make sense from time to time (the broken machine was 2 screens away from main city and nobody knew about it? BS), some plot twists and situations are quite interesting for the duration of the game but there are some things that annoyed me a lot.\n\nIf my memory serves right, there is one character that does not have to die in one mission, but what happened? you choose right instead of left with no indication on the map or the story to think \"oh, I am missing that character\". The problem with this is that the game has some flow issues from time to time and this is the best example of that.\n\nAnother thing I didn't appreciate were the achievements, it feels as if the developers weren\u00b4t able to make more or make other achievements work, because there is no achievement for finishing the game, but there are 4 achievements at the very start of the game and 2-3 achievements related to a buggy minigame... there is also no achievement for finding the ultra secret message (that puzzle was more complex than expected), there is probably a lack of more than one ending, even if your actions affect the game (super secret message again).\n\nArt wise, the game is quite good, pixel game though (I know some people are anti-pixel/2D games) some scenes were just beautiful.\n\nExploration-wise, the game is quite challenging (didn't find some coins in some areas, but I still got the achievement... do not understand why), I am only annoyed there was no way to quick travel to previous areas to check them, and you have to travel the old-fashioned way which made the game a bit artificially longer.\n\nAnother BIG FLAW is the cannon minigame, mostly due to the camera being obnoxious what made, together with the controls, a 16 SECONDS run take me 90 MINUTES to be able to finish once (and won't ever repeat it in my lifetime)... If it was only a side quest with nothing game or achievement related, cool; BUT 3 of the 12 achievements are dependant on this stupid minigame (coins, treasure and seashell).\n\nPersonally, I would recommend it, because story, character, art, exploration and maps were quite good, but DO NOT buy it full prize... this game is 10 hours long only if you go for achievements, you can probably finish in 5 hours without them...", "timestamp_created": 1553775383, "timestamp_updated": 1553775623, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503816783428192139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49747747": {"recommendationid": "49747747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312006361", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 762, "last_played": 1552053333}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed Owlboy.

If you're expecting the exceptional, prepare to be disappointed. If you approach the game as a relatively straightforward indie platformer, it's a solid example of the genre that rises above in several aspects, and is well worth playing.\n\nOf course, if you love detailed pixel art and value a strong visual style, then Owlboy is virtually worth the price of admission for the visual feast alone. I personally prefer a 'clean' style over retro aesthetics - think Hollow Knight vs Shovel Knight, as well-crafted as the latter is. Despite that, I was gobsmacked by the level of quality on display in Owlboy, and while pretty pictures alone don't make a game, it sure does help in this case. The animations are detailed and consistent, the world is sumptuously rich and lush, and when combined with an orchestral soundtrack and the lore of the game, it all seems very grand and epic when outside of the homely settlements. The pixel art generated most of the hype for this game, and on that front Owlboy delivers in spades.\n\nThe devs also deserve praise for tackling a rare bird - the ability to fly anywhere. This can completely remove challenge if done poorly, and while Owlboy doesn't always nail it, the movement and level of challenge is this game is mostly solid. It feels good to fly about, and while the control scheme can lead to few hectic moments when enemies are bombarding you later on, it generally all comes together well. The combat and puzzles generally involve you grabbing either teammates or environmental objects, and using them to blow away foes or flap your way into new areas. Both are relatively simplistic, but enjoyable nonetheless. The level design is pretty solid, with hubs leading to dungeons with their own unique environmental hazards and gimmicks, fairly standard stuff on the whole. Essentially, the game plays well and while boss fights can be taxing on the first attempt, there's nothing ridiculous.\n\nTrying to measure the worth of a story is obviously subjective, but I thought that the worldbuilding and storyline were both well above average for an indie title. The plot is melancholic and avoids many common tropes, while embracing others - and the characters have more depth than you might expect. Otus emotes well for a silent protagonist, and there are some genuinely touching moments later in the game. The world of Owlboy is capably drawn, and the above aesthetic pairs well with the floating settlements in the sky, ancient history being scattered liberally throughout. It's significantly better than you'd expect just from looking at the screenshots.\n\nOwlboy is a good adventure that rarely amazes, but the whole package far more than just the art direction. If you can pick it up on sale, a playthrough will stand you 7-10 hours and provide an enjoyable experience. The gameplay could be better, but the flaws aren't egregious enough to detract from some bold stylistic choices and a pretty unique game world to explore.

Owlboy is a platform-adventure game that follows Otus, a humanoid owl, who's city has been attacked by pirates. Otus must stop the pirates and recover some ancient relics. If all 3 relics are captured by the pirates then the pirates will become unstoppable. It's your job to avenge your city and stop the pirates. I have previously stated that Undertale had the best video game music, and while this statement still stands true, Owlboy's soundtrack comes really close to Undertale's soundtrack and may even be equal to it. Amazing symphonies accompany you while you are traversing through Owlboy's world. The game's characters are also one of the things the game does best. The impactful moments of the game actually make me feel emoticon. The game's world is astonishing and everytime I discover a new chunk of this world I am filled with a sense of excitement. The combat is great and the different characters that you use to attack have different mechanics and are actual likeable characters. But, not everything can be amazing, as some small sections of the game can be daunting tasks to overcome and just feel like chores to complete because some small parts have weird difficulty spikes like most of the boss fights. Other than this, Owlboy provides an amazing experience that I feel should be enjoyed by all, even with the pretty high $25 price tag.\n\nScore: Decent 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1551063311, "timestamp_updated": 1593660223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511682271957397461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49216443": {"recommendationid": "49216443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090287532", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1550927941}, "language": "english", "review": "Yet ANOTHER game that's been hyped up like crazy and yet the game is above average at best. God dammit.\n\nLet's start with the gameplay since that's what's actually above average. So in this game, you control a character (Otus) that can fly around anywhere on the screen. He can do this without ever needing to come down into the ground. Obviously, this game therefore does not have any great platforming. While in the last level the game takes away your flying powers and therefore forces you to jump around \"normally\", even then the platforming was just \"entertaining\". Nothing mind-blowing.\n\nInstead of platforming, the game is focused around puzzles, combat, and some stealth thrown in for good measure. That's one thing about this game: it has a lot of variety. I was never \"bored\" playing this game since every 20-30 minutes or so, the game mixes up how you're tackling scenarios. This is partly done through the 3 companions you'll get along your quest. Otus can fly around sure, but he needs his companions to attack enemies and other stuff\n\t\u2022 The first companion can shoot enemies to deal damage to them. Fairly straightforward.\n\t\u2022 The second companion can shotgun enemies (i.e. close range but powerful). He's also heavy and can activate \"big\" switches (i.e. switches that need a lot of weight on them) and his gun can be used as a lighter to burn plants or see stuff in the dark. All of this comes into play at various stages in the game\n\t\u2022 The third companion can web up enemies (not damage) and can \"grapple\" things. While grappling, Otus is completely immune to damage so it serves as a \"dodge\" of sorts. Again, all of this comes into play at various stages in the game.\n\nSo yea with Otus flying around everywhere and his 3 companions, the game manages to achieve a decent amount of variety. Unfortunately, while there is a lot of variety, there's not much quality to the game. That's because nothing is all that fun to do. \n\t\u2022 This game has puzzles, but other games have far better puzzles. \n\t\u2022 This game has combat, but other games have far better combat.\n\t\u2022 This game has stealth, but other games have far better stealth.\n\nGet the idea? All of these separate elements are entertaining, but no individual element is AMAZING or anything. You never get any satisfaction from beating any of the segments in the game, since nothing is challenging. You can tank hits from most fights and even if you die, you can just restart from the same spot with no consequences. It would've been interesting if this game COMBINED separate aspects of its gameplay together. E.g. if for a boss you needed to use stealth or puzzles or whatever. But no. You can always tell when the game wants you to tackle a puzzle, combat, or stealth section and none of these elements are ever really combined in any meaningful way.\n\nAlso, while there is a decent amount of variety in the core gameplay, the same cannot be said about the progression system. You don't get any loot or exp from defeating enemies. In order to increase your health and weapons, you need to collect coins scattered throughout the game. Collect enough, and you'll automatically be given an upgrade by a shopkeeper (i.e. you cannot pick and choose. You always get the same upgrade at 250 coins, 500 coins, 750 coins, etc\u2026). The thing is, there's not many things to get. There's 3 health upgrades and 3 weapon upgrades. The weapon upgrades themselves are very marginal. So you never feel any strong desire to collect the coins.\n\nWhile the gameplay is above average, the story\u2026.. Not so much. Whoever wrote the story doesn't understand the following: Continuity, motivations, consistency, and making sense.\n\n\t\u2022 Continuity: So when the game starts, Asio (Otus's instructor) berates him for continually messing up and tells him to go to the village so that everyone can tell him how much he sucks. There's even this big dramatic scene where as you talk to people, the background shows sinister eyes growing bigger and bigger and Otus becoming sadder and sadder. Ok so based on what you're showing me, people don't like Otus. Gotcha. After that, you go to the village and turns out all the villagers (just 4) are acting friendly to Otus\u2026\u2026. What the fuck? You showed me this dramatic sequence where Otus is hated by the village, but not really? Just the teacher hates him???? Ok\u2026..\n\t\u2022 Motivations: Ok so just the teacher hates him. Whatever, the game just started, I can deal with that\u2026\u2026. Why does he hate him? Because he fucked up a bunch of times? That's why the teacher is such an asshole to Otus and constantly puts him down? Ok\u2026\u2026 so I guess this teacher is just a giant prick. Not a very interesting character but fine\u2026\u2026 BUT WAIT. Near the end of the game, the teacher apologizes to Otus for everything he's done, hugs him, and asks for forgiveness\u2026\u2026.. That is a GIANT change in character. What the hell caused this????? Is he a giant asshole or is he just \"misunderstood\". I don't know because the writer does a horrendous job in explaining the character's motivations and what he's thinking and why he's doing anything.\n\t\u2022 Consistency: Ok so the teacher is a lame character. Fine. What about the other characters? Welp, unfortunately, the characters you'll be spending time with (Otus and his 3 companions) never feel like real characters with real feelings. To be fair, there are MOMENTS where you see glimmers of greatness, but this is never CONSISTENT enough for you to get attached to any of the characters. The best example I can think of is near the middle. So a major city is destroyed by the villains. People DIE. The game emphasizes this with a dramatic cutscene and a graveyard that you're forced to walk through. The 1st companion was shown crying at the graveyard. Ok, I get that. You feel like you let everyone down. I really get that. The thing is, soon after, you're introduced to your 3rd companion and the game throws in a lot of jokes about how his parents are scared of your 2nd companion (in a funny way with characters freaking out with funny expressions) and your 3rd companion likes doing role play\u2026\u2026. Really? You went from a city being blown up and people DYING to this? REALLY???!!!! Ugh.\n\t\u2022 Making sense: So there are 2 plots to this game. The 1st and main plot is you needing to stop the villains from getting 3 relics (hence all the dungeon exploring) so that the main villain cannot become all powerful and destroy the world. The 2nd plot is that an ancient civilization of \"owls\" existed that were very advanced but then their civilization fell into ruin. So there's this giant mystery about what happened. This 2nd plot simply does not make sense. The reason the ancient civilization was brought into ruin was because the Owls discovered \"The Loop\" and society went into chaos. In order to break \"The Loop\", the owls created a machine. Unfortunately, it didn't work and caused the land mass to start floating into space slowly\u2026\u2026. What the fuck? What the hell is \"The Loop\" (never explained). It's IMPLIED that it's time repeating itself. Ok\u2026\u2026 So why the fuck would a machine designed to affect TIME have an effect that makes the land mass slowly float into space??????\n\nAnd yea that's the game.

I believe Indie games are a good source for unique, exciting experiences that we can't get from certain larger, more famous, big-budget titles that shall remain unspecified.\n\nHowever, I really despise when a developer tries to be \"symbolic\" and tries to \"speak to its audience.\" At best, it makes you come across as a pretentious, artsy, attention seeker whose doctor hasn't prescribed the right dosage of Zoloft.\n\nI mean, the presentation is fantastic - If it was a picture, I'd frame it and hang it on a wall. The characters and their motivations are clear, and the controls are... well, they're alright. Not too clunky, but not as precise as I would've liked for a platformer. But hey, I can fly!\n\nBut... I swear to God, this game hits too close to home, with possibly the only tutorial that managed to depress me more than Disorder. The prompt comes on the screen to press a certain button, I do, but then something breaks, and the game starts telling me I did it wrong. \"ME?\" I wanted to lash out, \"I did exactly what you told me to!\" (It's like living at your mom's house.)  Yes, I know it's part of the narrative, and it's a bit clever how they have the feeling of \"the village black sheep\" happen directly to the player through gameplay. A nice way to relate to the main character... but the way it was presented, I'm feeling more sorry for me than for our titular \"OwlBoy.\" \"I followed to instructions to a capital T, what more do you want!?\" Ever have that teacher in school that tells you that you won't ever amount to anything, in spite of your effort and loyalty... mostly because of your face? \n\nOh, yeah, by the way, he's mute, so he has no means to express himself - something for which the bigger, more able-bodied birds continually mock him, among other things. Instead of letting him develop and get a feel for things, they expect the world of him and -- wait a minute! Is the developer trying to provide commentary on modern economic society and the harsh standards placed upon developmentally challenged, preventing them from reaching their full potential? Boy, if I had a nickel for every time I've seen that. I didn't even have to read too deep into it; all I did was imagine all those birds were throwing shade at me, not the guy I'm playing as. In fact... they pretty much were!\n\nSo yeah, I play games to get better at something, and I rather strive to beat a really hard game than to (imagine if this was on physical media) beat my game really hard. This game's price tag is steep for an indie game, so I can't really recommend it for players who just want to have a good time. For those who place graphics above anything else, just download a free wallpaper and place it on your desktop.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, it's late at night, and there's an Owl outside my window. Gonna go scream at it.\n\nPS: No, I did not keep the game. I returned it for a refund with haste. I didn't pay for a game that's just going to act like they're my parents.\n\nPPS: I don't remember much about the gameplay itself. All I remember was flying around a near empty town, and then fighting a few enemies. It really didn't leave much of an impact on me.

Which is sad to say about a labor of love focused on insecurity.\n\nIt begins with the mute owl Otus being unfairly berated by his superior . he has a friend who is also not the ideal capable hero, later comes various other insecure or at the very least flawed characters. \n\n\nThe art and animation are both gorgeous. The soundtrack is also fairly nice, and the world of Owlboy is filled with neat little details that feel well crafted. It overall has the production value of a flagship Nintendo title. I really did appreciate how well it took advantage of its pixels to shape such a nice looking game.\n\nEach of these characters is carried by Otus in order to use their abilities/fight. It\u2019s a way to show how they complete Otus, how together they make him a capable hero. He couldn't fight or explore without them. It\u2019s a neat little detail, but this is where the well of praise dries up.\n\nCombat with enemies boils down to getting stunlock, rolling, shooting them with pebbles while you wait a small eternity for your decent short range weapon to reload. The introduction of the 3rd weapon/character actually feels like a great traversal tool and weapon, but you don\u2019t get it soon enough. the flying comes across more like hovering and it essentially takes a away the platformer aspect (save for the waterfall areas). \n\nThere are various sections that feel frustrating and seem to slow down the game to painful crawl (the owl door with two handles, the magma worm ride, stealth etc.) but the strange thing is these sections aren\u2019t that tough and only take a minute or two. The bottom line is that I wasn\u2019t having fun while playing this game. Every bump in the road feels like torture if you\u2019re in a car full of lemon juice and glass shards.\n\nThe gameplay is such a clunky exchange of stunlocks that I feel like each fight was like 100 knights of zodiac summons but no other aspect made up for this. I didn\u2019t want to explore, the unlocks were lame and the story isn\u2019t that special.\n\nit comes across as a generic Disney Knock off about friendship, self doubt, uniting etc. The humor , in its timing, writing and predictability, just falls short. \n\nNo part of this game is horrendous or broken, it just doesn\u2019t feel passable and the ten years and anxiety ridden narrative makes me feel pity. I was this close to just giving it a thumbs up because I was worried I might make Otus and crew cry.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1549275371, "timestamp_updated": 1549275371, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548988103866577148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48750238": {"recommendationid": "48750238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153561193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 836, "last_played": 1492037673}, "language": "english", "review": "Somewhat underwhelming.

No joke, no exaggeration, it was the art. Owlboy is absolutely a master work of pixel art that is largely unchallenged. In terms of the art style, the craftsmanship of this game is superb. Going through and taking screenshots of the game was a joy, and looking closely at how the artists did things in their limited palettes is something that will undoubtedly make me a better artist.\n\nBut for all of the good in terms of the art I sadly cannot recommend this game. There are several places where the controls are just FRUSTRATING to use. A good example of this is in the controls that you need to start flying. Pressing jump twice or pressing it once followed by up. Simple right? Well it would if I didn't try to use double-jump only for the second jump to CANCEL my flying because I rotated the control stick just a little tiny bit above the horizon so it registered it as an \"up\" press, thus making the second jump register the in-flight action of dropping.\n\nAnd while I'm complaining about the controls, I'd like to point out that button remapping is NOT AVAILABLE in this game. Honestly, this irked me no end! I wanted to remap my controller but NOPE! Every game, EVERY GAME, should have the ability to change button layouts in-game. That's an accessibility standard and has been for a long time. I feel like there's no excuse not to have this feature anymore. I don't think I'm asking a lot with this.\n\nOh... and for how great this game's visual style is the designers seem to have an issue letting you see it at times. Virtually every 'dungeon' has at least one section devoted to having you in total darkness so you can't see what you're doing. Yeah, that might be how they wanted it but for a game that seems to sell itself partially on its beautiful art is seems like a bad decision to me. But then again, as stated, I got this for the art so there's my bias right there.\n\nIn terms of narrative, this game is also a bit of a failure. It sets up a grand lore and a huge world... but then destroys it before we can get a chance to see it. Like, literally a place that gets hyped up is destroyed before you can explore it. This game is a classic case of the designers not obeying the artist's mantra: \"Show, Don't Tell\".\n\nAnd that's kind of a symptom of the game's larget tone problem. It's got cartoonish character designs, quirky and colorful characters, and funny dialogue... but the game's running story themes are abuse, emotional neglect, and the tragedy of death and loss. YIKES! Clearly not everyone was on the same page about what kind of game they were making.\n\nI want to like this game. I want to like it's light metroidvania-style looping areas. I want to like it's interesting world. I want to like its characters. I want to enjoy it's lore... but there's not enough of any of those good elements for me to really get into it. It's a short game, taking as long as it did only because of mistakes I kept making due to the odd sort-of-twin-stick-shooter controls.\n\nGet it for the amazing pixel art, and let it run for a few hours for the trading cards.

It feels like there's a purpose in the game, and the scripted parts are not spread out so much that the story feels like an afterthought. It keeps me engauged.

I like accepting new party members and finding relics that give you special abilites. It's fun. It's almost whimsical.

Having the duel joystick makes combat pretty fun, where one is your movement, the other to aim. \n\nOverall, I feel like the developers of this game didn't choose this style just to mimic the style of classics, but to pay hommage instead, and I feel that they did a great job.

Sometimes these little things made me chuckle, or feel empathy and sadness, or happy. Overall, I think the game is very polished in this respect.\n\nAlthough I loved playing the game for pretty much everything it had to offer, there were a few times where I found some of the puzzles or enemies a bit difficult to face either due to the limited controls or difficult response patterns. I am just bad at reacting quickly to new enemies though, so if this isn't a problem for you, then this game will probably provide a better experience for you.

It felt like there was a lot of potential here that was lost\n-Screen transitions cos these were ungodly awful, Enemies can attack you from offscreen when you are trying to go into a new area. Sometimes it feels like the game wasn't designed for screen transitions but then they realised that their hidden walls would be too easy to see through so they did it anyway, this is especially highlighted durign the worst minigame i have ever played in a platformer that i liked.\n-Speaking of that minigame; The cannon minigame i would say is awful in a great many ways, it's controls are very clunky and unresponsive with your turning accelerating the longer you hold down, the screen transitions(remember those?) cause you to be unable to react to the fast paced and very precise requirements in time making it feel unfairly difficult as i doubt there is any possible way to beat it first try knowing nothing about it beforehand and the game ends up simply being a test of muscle memory rather than skill which is also needed in spades. This is all i will say on this as it is optional if you don't want to 100% the game or get all the trinkets but it really highlighted how bad the screen transitions are for me.\n\n[h1]Overall opinion:[/h1]\ni actually really liked the game there were a couple of moments that i really enjoyed throughout story-wise. The characters felt lively and interesting and i am a sucker for a good platformer. it did feel like there was a lack of collectable variety for me personally and i have some real pet peeves about it but to play it through was definately an enjoyable experience though i do not plan to 100% this like i try to do with some other platformers i enjoy. There is quite a bit of lost potential here but i suppose with 10 years in development they just wanted it done. I'd buy it for 20% off or less \n", "timestamp_created": 1546482747, "timestamp_updated": 1546482747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48011746": {"recommendationid": "48011746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025069268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 349, "last_played": 1546320926}, "language": "english", "review": "GIve a hoot!

The game spends half of its length setting up a grand adventure in an interesting fantasy world filled with cute and lovable characters, but the game never gives you the journey it promises. If the first half of the game is the set-up, then the second half is the conclusion; there is no adventure or middle-section to fill the gap between them. It feels like there's an entire world out there, filled with magical landscapes and fantastical characters, that the game just never shows you. Instead, you get to meet the protagonist who is likeable and relatable but isn't given any chance to grow or change despite having more room for character growth than the cloud-filled skies around him.\n\nIt's a huge shame because what does exist of Owlboy is very good and very promising. The devs clearly put a lot of time and effort into the art and the music, putting the soul and spirit of their inspirations into it. But the quality of the presentation doesn't make up for the terrible narrative pacing and the lukewarm gameplay.\n\nThe bosses are forgettable and the ending doesn't feel one bit deserved. By the time I got 100% completion on this game (which took less than 10 hours, as you can see by my playtime) I felt like something horribly wrong must've happened during development of this game for it to ship with only the book-ends of an interesting story. This game did take 10 years to make, so maybe they felt they needed to speed up development to get it out the door in a reasonable amount of time. Maybe they finished the beginning and the ending first, got tired of working on it, and just shipped it without the middle so they could be done with it. Maybe they were just very confused about what kind of story they were trying to tell. Whatever the reason, the story suffers badly for it and it pulls the entire rest of the experience down with it.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how unsatisfied I was with Owlboy. The $24.99 pricetag on this game is, frankly, inexcusable. I wouldn't recommend buying this game for $14.99. If I was a meaner person I would call it a scam, but I do respect the devs for taking the time and effort to make this game look and feel as incredible as it does. It's not a scam, it's simply an overpriced product that looks very beautiful from the outside but is ankle-shallow on the inside. If you want to support the devs and experience the best parts of this game, I fully encourage you to buy the soundtrack (since you will actually get your money's worth that way) and then watch your favorite YouTuber play it.\n\nOwlboy has the foundation for an incredibly good RPG, one better than most independent studios would have the skills, love, and patience to craft. But sadly the foundation is all they were able to deliver. Definitely keep your eye on this studio, because they have a lot of potential, but right now your money is better spent elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1546195915, "timestamp_updated": 1546195915, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600773453712463379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47956112": {"recommendationid": "47956112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236095954", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 612, "last_played": 1546169527}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me ha gustado mucho la verdad, artisticamente es precioso, tiene uno de los pixel arts mas bonitos que he visto, la banda sonora es genial, las animaciones de los personajes y como consigue expresarte cosas solo con ellas esta muy conseguido, los dialogos y el gi\u00f3n estan muy bien, tiene momentos de humor muy chulos y sin duda los personajes son lo mejor, les coges cari\u00f1o a algunos y rabia a otros, es genial.

It isn't perfect, but it is mostly remarkable and its flaws can't diminish a true artistic triumph.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the writing and character development is dripping with brilliant pathos. The story will be most enjoyed by players with high levels of empathy or with life experience that will empower them to relate to the characters. It's been a long, long time since I've seen writing, direction, art, and music come together like this to convey emotion so powerfully in a retro/pixel/16bit-esque format. I was not expecting such depth when I got into this, nor was I expecting it to be so dark or to have such a mature emotional intelligence to it. That's not to say it's dour, though, as the creative team masterfully intermixes moments of levity in a way that let's you fall in love with it. However, some of the most cathartic moments of the game are missable/optional. I want to say that's a design error but this can also be a tool for rewarding exploration/completion and there are lots of games where missable events hold game altering revalations in an effective way (eg. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, Mass Effect 2, Final Fantasy VI). As such, while I can't fault them for this decision, it saddens me to think that some people will finish the game without [spoiler]talking to Asio at the overlook one last time before proceeding to the endgame[/spoiler] or [spoiler] will abstain from collecting the three gold disks that reveal a crucial element of the lore/backstory and will likely play into a potential sequel.[/spoiler]\n\nThe sum value of the storytelling isn't to say the execution is perfect. The game is strongest in its first half, where exploration/collection is minimal but still enough to feel really, really good alongside the AAA+++ retro-style pixel art. The flow/tempo of the game is perfect, with the story hitting all the right beats at all the right moments. At about the half-way point, especially if you're seeking to 100% the game, the flow gets broken by a few issues. First, there's no in-game map and effectively no fast travel. This means that while you're hunting for secrets, which is otherwise fun, you have to backtrack all the way in and all the way out of wherever you're exploring. Second, there starts to be a pretty significant gap between critical story elements. This isn't usually an issue in gaming but with such a short game as this, you feel it. Lastly, as you progress you encounter a few trial/error style fights/events that undercut the otherwise good gameplay. In the end, I do feel that collecting everything was worthwhile as the reward makes the endgame feel spot on. That said, I think the director could have executed their vision a bit better as far as the optional content goes.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't overly impressive but the dev has put a lot of thought and care into it to compensate. At it's core, Owlboy is an action adventure shooter with a lot of variation in how you can approach any given scenario. You have three companions, each with stengths and weaknesses. With Owlboy's abilities and the abilities of those companions, you can interact with enemies and the environment in novel ways such that the shooter element is never bland. It's ultimately a fresh and fun take on the genre that neither enhances nor detracts from the game itself or one's enjoyment of the story.\n\nThe soundtrack is a creative blend of orchestral compositions and retro-style melodies, some of which are quite memorable. The quality of some audio files themselves, however, is inconsitant. Some tracks have a few cracks/pops or a light static that seems pretty clearly unintentional. Most players probably won't notice the issue and it likely depends on one's hardware but it really took me out of the moment in one dungeon in particular where I feel like I spent half the time checking my tweeters and making sure my home audio system wasn't the culprit. One positive thing that suprised me about the audio was that there's an impressive use of base that we don't often see in retro-style games like this, especially in the sub-audible frequency range. Anyone with transducers/shakers is in for a treat.\n\nI feel confident that most people will fall in love with this game in some way or another. It's the type of game where, upon completion, the first thing I did was check out the dev's page to see what other creations they had to offer. There are some things Owlboy could do better but it hits home where it counts. \n\nP.S. This game has some awesome social media gifs, if you type Owlboy into the gif search bar.

On the surface, it has the makings of an amazing game, but I found the core to be quite average. Maybe some will love it, maybe some will hate it. Take this recommendation as neutral. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Great art and great music. The trailer should give you a good indication of the quality.\n[*]Characters are delightful and very expressive. I especially like the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1476771398]Gentleman fish[/url], the penguins and Otus\u2019 surprised face. It\u2019s also really nice that the party is essentially a group of outcasts. \n[*]Uncommon game mechanic, where you are essentially defenseless on your own, but carry objects/allies to overcome your weaknesses. It was interesting to try something new, and I found it worked well.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Some hidden areas are very difficult to find, sometimes with little to no indication that you can go through a wall.\n[*]Cannon mini game was frustratingly difficult. Due to the falling speed, acceleration, and sensitive steering, you have very little time to react to upcoming sections and basically have to rely on muscle memory to get through. To collect all the coins in the game, you are required to collect all the rings in the mini game, which was very annoying to me. However, I can\u2019t complain too much because collecting all the coins is optional. This allows you to buy the optional, overpowered final item.\n[*]The amount of damage Otus can take in one hit can be shocking and the recovery time feels quite long. The large knockback can also be frustrating as it increases the likelihood of being slammed against a wall, which leads to more damage and staggering.\n[*]Story was decent. It was not bad but also did not have much of an impact on me. Based on the trailer, I expected Owlboy to have a story befitting its charm, which is why I bought it in the first place. Unfortunately, I was let down since it didn\u2019t live up to my expectation. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It\u2019s a shame that a map wasn\u2019t included. Even a basic map would have been very useful, especially if you haven\u2019t played the game in a while. It would also make finding all the collectibles a little easier. \n[*]Based on how the game is designed, backtracking can be very long and boring. Since I am somewhat of an achievement hunter, it was very tedious to re-explore the areas after completing the game.\n[*]Screen transitions can be very annoying and can feel unfair if you get hit by an enemy on the other side. I especially detested the screen transitions during the cannon mini game. Due to the high speeds, you simply don\u2019t have enough time to react to the screen transition unless you already know what is coming up. \n[*]The following point has spoilers about the ending:[spoiler]Asio is very mean to Otus throughout the story, often proclaiming how disappointed he is in Otus. However, during the final cut-scene, Asio suddenly turns into a very kind mentor. This sudden change was very strange to me and ruined the ending.[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Just OK[/h1]\nCharming and quite pleasant to play but not mind-blowing by any means. Owlboy was no more than \u201cjust OK\u201d in my experience. The high scores and awards probably built up my expectations more than it should have, which ultimately left me feeling disappointed. Don\u2019t let the excellent scores fool you, this is definitely a game you can skip. Perhaps pick it up when on sale if you really want it? My final remark is that I enjoyed playing Owlboy, but will probably never touch it again.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

The visuals also do a good job defining the characters and their reactions, especially with the main protagonist. Story is very interesting that it makes me want to know what happens next. The characters are likeable and the dialogue is written pretty well.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple and a bit clunky. As a flying character, you can move pretty much anywhere you want, although the control scheme is a bit wonky. You fight enemies using your partners by carrying your partners and having them shoot the enemies (you the player doing the aiming and shooting). The progression is pretty linear and the level designs are alright. Some parts of the game, especially in the pirate sections, were annoying to go through. The bosses were well designed IMO.

The combat in this game is very unique in that your primary character, Otus, can't do much but fly and your party members hold the various different ways of attacking or moving around. The controls are very easy to pick up on after a couple minutes of gameplay. The difficulty of this game is not extremely hard as some would tell you, in fact I found the difficulty of this game to be above average, but that is all due to the bossing aspect of the game. Each boss has a set pattern and theres about 2 to 3 stages in a boss fight, during each stage the bosses paterns changes so that results in me dying at least 3 times each boss fight which isn't really a bad thing, a little variation in fights is always fun. The game is EXTREMELY visiually appealing as the pixel art is beautiful and the music in the game is very atmospheric and fits every scenario it is in perfectly. \n\nOverall I would highly recommend this game and I could easily see myself put in a lot of extra hours just to 100% complete it.", "timestamp_created": 1543091831, "timestamp_updated": 1543091831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535714268684387207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46772547": {"recommendationid": "46772547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059934601", "num_games_owned": 1132, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 779, "last_played": 1537567825}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun gameplay, good storytelling and pretty good worldbuilding/lore (for a game that's not a massive length rpg).", "timestamp_created": 1543066486, "timestamp_updated": 1543066486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46756374": {"recommendationid": "46756374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024332749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1658583989}, "language": "english", "review": "Great characters, beautiful art, so far the storyline is quite light-hearted but this doesn't detract from the experience, just makes it a different one.

But a friend of mine absolutely loved it and practically begged me to play it to experience it myself. And now I am like her, practically begging everyone to please play this game cause this was one of the best experiences of my life.\n\nIt's kinda hard to explain why it's so good. Sure, it has absolutely stunning visuals, the sprite art is just amazing. The music is really beautiful too and the challenge of the game was just right for me, not too easy but also not too hard to rage quit it (though I sure was close near the end heh).\n\nBut the thing that got me most of this game was the story. The way it's told together with the whole atmosphere of the game was so incredibly gripping, I will never forget it. It's about failure, it's about friendship, it's about trying the best you can. And while that all probably sounds cheesy as hell, I can assure you that I've never played another game that deals with these themes so well. It doesn't just tell you about them, it makes you FEEL them.\n\nThis game made my laugh a lot, it made me cry a lot, and it also made me curse a lot cause damn those boss battles can be hard haha. But it sure feels rewarding when you finally beat them. This is one of those games where during the credits I was filled with so many emotions, but mostly happiness that I had experienced this all.\n\nSo please, do play this game.

The game looks absolutely beautiful and the artstyle strikes the perfect balance between being cute, but also serious enough to really appreciate. The story is okay and has very simple dialogue, but it has a nice amount of dramatic events and action. The story is pretty long, with it taking at least 7 hours even if you speedrun.\n\nAs for the negatives, I'll start off with the controls. They are not very smooth, but you will get used to them after an hour or two. The real problem comes in when you get hit by an enemy. You see, in the game, you can fight enemies, but it's your partners that do most of the fighting. To use their abilities, you pick them up while flying around and aim their attacks at the enemies. When you get hit by an enemy, you will immediately drop whichever character you were lifting up. As a result, if there are multiple enemies on screen charging you at the same time, you could wind up taking extra damage with no way to avoid it. However, the most major issue I have is with the puzzles. As long as you have a functioning brain, they will never take you longer than 20 minutes to figure out, but usually, it's more like 5 minutes or less. The final issue I have with the game is the anticlimactic ending. It really wasn't satisfying in the slightest.  I expected more hidden treasures and passageways to find after the ending, but if you have already gone everywhere before you reached the ending, there's nothing else to do. \n\nTo conclude, the only people that I would reccomend this game for are two groups: The casual platformer players that can deal with an okay story that gets boring at some parts and young children. If you are looking for a challenging game, Owlboy is definitely not for you. I'm a below average gamer when it comes to skill level, and even after turning off the meter that shows your health, disabling autoaim, etc. I still don't think I died enough times, lol.

It's that the developers [i]cared[/i] about this game. Yet this game is shrouded in unbelievable amounts of bad design decisions that I can't wrap my head around it. Want to see what I mean for yourself? As an experiment buy this game, progress enough and get to the cannon minigame: it is so bad that it deserves to be studied by itself. Yet it's not an isolated incident but rather an encapsulation of everything this game fails to deliver.\n\nSo this is a game that was 10 years in the making, with [b]gorgeous[/b] visuals, no doubt about it. Apart from visuals, what does it bring to the table? It can be likened to run-and-gun levels of Cuphead (as opposed to boss sections of it) which tries and fails to tell a captivating story. Where and how does it fail? Because it's a story of heroics-gone-wrong, with little player agency. It's like storyteller is shouting at us, knowing in full that we can't resort back: \"Why? What did we wrong? Tell me, help me improve!\" But no, you will succeed in failing: that's the only thing game allows you to do. Don't get me wrong, I'm not particularly against failure or good-deed-gone-wrong, but here it's at a complete odd with the scenery. It's pastel, colorful, cheerful, playful. Even the \"big bad\"s are beaked robots calling themselves pirates. Completely impossible to instill a sense of seriousness, apart from all the loss we're dealt. For player growth through failure there needs to be a more somber tone than this game provides.\n\nAlso gameplay is incredibly frustrating. How did developers agreed to implement them I'll never know but I can guess: spending 10 years on [i]any[/i] is a surefire way to get tunnel visioned: your bad ideas don't appear bad anymore, after all those are the only ideas around. And you learn to walk around problems they present because you've been dealing with them from day 1. So all in all this might have been the only game they knew, so there was no problem in shipping it like this because they couldn't imagine any other Owlboy anymore.\n\nWhat do I mean by frustrating? I told player agency being limited from a narrative standpoint: This holds true from gameplay side too. You don't shoot, you carry teammates that shoot for you (you do the aiming, so it's not automatic) which shouldn't be too different from otherwise but it is: Whenever you take damage you drop your gun, so you need to reequip it while trying to dodge tons of enemies swarming you. Enemies swarm you and most have the same colour palette as you do, therefore making it almost impossible to distinguish who is who in the midst of chaos. Further, levels are large and displayed in limited portions with transitions being abrupt and discontinuous. When you get exit the screen from left you enter the next one from right though since level is loaded there will be active enemies that will damage you making you unable to fight back and make you not distinguish who's who. I can't begin to express how frustrating that was. (Solution: keep your character fixed and let environment roll around you a la Cave Story. Was is impossible in this game's context? Not my problem!)\nAnother thing: this game can't decide if it wants to be action packed or tactical. Movement is slow, there are cooldowns, enemies are not very energetic, but on occasion you'll need to mash buttons or move quickly. Why? What do you want me to do, game?!\n\nI may finish the game, I may not, but either way don't buy into the hype that was gorgeous visuals.

Combined with infuriating bosses, this game promises great gameplay only to crap all over you when you are fighting some of the crucial fights.\n\nThere is a lot going on on the screen, which doesn't mix well with the whole concept of you lugging your gunners. You get hit, you lose them, you end up flying across the room, losing control of your character. Sometimes you recover in mid air, sometimes you end up on the wall and have to wait what feels like ages before you're back on your feet - all this while the baddie is relentlessly attacking you. Then you eventually recover, spawn your gunner, cycle back and forth till you get the right one, while trying to avoid all the chaos headed your way. You press jump to fly, but sometimes you press up first, so jump just cancels out the flying (???), meaning you drop to the floor, only to be hit by something and oh boy here we go again. To top it all off, you can't just shoot bosses. You have to figure out their hocus-pocus voulnerability, which wouldn't be a problem, if it were either explained or hinted at properly. Get ready to restart some checkpoints while you figure out what the hell you are supposed to do.\n\nThese are just a few gripes off top of my head. Not even Cuphead got me this mad. This game is like a bastard child of the original Castlevania and any (all) of the NES Megaman games - you know, the games that, due to hardware limitations, were short, so developers would inflate difficulty levels to artificially extend their length.\n\nDisappointment is not the word. I can see how much effort was put into development of this game and I genuinely love the world, and the atmosphere, the sense of humour, the characters and the right amount of dialogue, how clever the story is, the meticulous, top-notch pixel graphics, the music etc. I even like the puzzles - something that most games tend to get wrong. So I get the urge to grab my controller and delve back into the world of Owlboy... but then I remember how annoying the controls can be (the bit with the pendulum in the caves...), and how easy it is to lose your footing during boss enqounters (the boss that hurls scimitars at you on the ship), how touchy the collision detection can be and so on.\n\nIt's a real shame - especially that we've all been starved of immersive, well made games nowadays.

Not the best I've played (that goes to Ori and the Blind Forest or Hollow Knight), but it's a solid title that I'll remember.

The pixelated worlds and the Legend-of-Zelda esque soundtrack can keep you immersed in this beautiful, majestic world in the sky. Movement tends to be pretty solid as well, thanks to solid use of rolling in the air. It's just a shame that in terms of gameplay, the game can often get held back by seemingly \"unfair\" damage due to what I mentioned above with screen transitions. \n\nI'd recommend Owlboy after getting through the practically perfect/very good Metroidvanias (Ori, Hollow Knight, Guacamelee 2, Steamworld Dig 2, and La Mulana), though I would not buy Owlboy at full price, since Owlboy's overall content can seem like it just isn't quite enough for $25.

But I do recall the ost having primarily orchestrals and chiptones, playing a lot towards that SNES nostalgia (which the whole game does well already) while still feeling like something new and modern.\n\nThe story is simplistic(at least on the surface), but that is kinda part of the charm. Even though you don't really spend that much time with any of characters for very long, you still get an idea of who they are and their motivations. The only two gripes I got is that the game sometimes feels a little too mean to Otus, which is an ongoing theme a good chunk of the game. The second is how abrupt the ending felt, which was already soured a bit by a character cliche/trope that I can't stand. There is also a sidequest that goes much deeper into the lore, plus a few other hidden cutscenes unlocked by doing specific things.\n\nControls took a bit of time getting used to. Your mileage will likely vary since I don't play these sorts of games normally (and I still kind of wonder if being left-handed also played some part in it), I'm pretty sure anyone who's played a lot of games of this style would pick it up well. The good news, it always kept feeling like I was improving by the time bosses/segments got harder, usually being able to get through the worst of it within a few tries and patience. However, it's very easy to loose your momentum in just one hit. Since not only do you let go whatever character you're carrying at the time, but touching any wall while being knocked back means more time wasted just to recover. \n\nAlso if you ever want to get 100%, you have to to get good at the cannon minigame. Pretty much half of the game's achievements are locked behind it. From own experience and by reading other community feedback it is definitely the hardest part.\n\nOverall, I still thought Owlboy was a nice game. Couple flaws aside, it was very obvious that a lot of care and detail was put into it (before I was even aware of its development history), so it is worth checking out. Although it is fairly short, something that I would probably recommend waiting for a good sale.", "timestamp_created": 1536400834, "timestamp_updated": 1536401451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44611456": {"recommendationid": "44611456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073380111", "num_games_owned": 1518, "num_reviews": 141, "playtime_forever": 778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 778, "last_played": 1536310152}, "language": "english", "review": "Game looks good.

Otis, the Owlboy, is not the shooter, but rather whoever he carries with him is. Interesting mechanic, inwhich you must decide which character is best suited for the situation! \n\nUpon starting the game, it is very plain the pixel art done has a lot of love put into it. The spritework is refreshing to watch and the environments you will be exploring meticulously designed down to the pixel. The story, I feel, progresses at a reasonable pace. It did a good job of keeping me engaged, keeping me wondering what will happen, what dangers are ahead? It kept me more engrossed because this character is not very capable of combat, but rather relies on a character he will carry to do the fighting. Very similar to how Ori relies on Sein's power to blast monsters with fireballs, Otis relies on friends for cover-fire.\n\nI also very much liked how it was not very difficult to learn how to control Otis' flying later on. There's plenty of space in the beginning levels to practice learning how Otis moves and controls, so you will be ready for later sections that demand more precise platforming. I had little to no difficulty proceeding through the game's later levels either. \n\nAnd similar to Ori and the Blind Forest, you are rewarded for exploring areas that are out of the way of your main objective. There are things to find, knickknacks to unlock, good treasure hunting for the completionists and adventurous players! \n\nThe characters are likeable and each have their own easiy identifiable mannerisms and persona. Some change views as the game progresses as well! And those that do teach some very deep lessons I feel are very important to carry with oneself. \n\nOwlboy is a wondrous game to play from start to finish, and would play it again had I the time to do so.

It's technically a metoridvania but I wouldn't group it under what you'd generally expect from something of that genre. As a result I can see why if someone came in with certain expectations and standards then they might be let down.\n\nOn a side note, I played on keyboard and mouse, and I almost never do for traditional platformers, so I'd highly recommend that peripheral. You need to aim a lot of the time so that should be self explanatory. The controls in this sense were very responsive and smooth and felt pretty natural to me.\n\nWhile it does share aspects of metroidvanias in the inherent progression and ability to move around going back and forth, the game gives a more open-world feeling, even if it is a bit of an illusionary one. What I mean by this is there's a main world area, but in the end you mostly only go through certain paths anyways and in that area there's not really much to do anyways.\n\nWhat the game really excels at is the charm of it's world and the sense of adventure you get from it. The gameplay supplements it and really gives you a lot of freedom to tackle many situations, from the puzzles to the boss fights. It doesn't really hold your hand but at the same time the conclusion you need to reach is often pretty intuitive. \n\nWhile I personally enjoyed the game a lot while I was playing it, finishing it left me a little lost. This is due to the story, which is kind of just a \"oh yeah we have to do this now so lets do it\" and looping that, until the end where something being revealed changes a lot of the meaning of what the whole adventure was about. The whole backstory is very interesting but I do not feel as if everything ties up very nicely. There is something you can unlock only after finishing the game and it lets you think even more on the whole world and how everything goes together, but it still left me wanting more of some kind of closure, despite there being some.\n\nIn the end, I feel like the game was a very charming little story that just barely didn't reach what I would consider something of a masterpiece. It's really unfortunate but I'd still recommend it to others who like the unique gameplay and appreciate that relatively pleasant experience.\n\nOh and of course the visuals and audio were amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1534065427, "timestamp_updated": 1534065448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60905081033706665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44080320": {"recommendationid": "44080320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033780286", "num_games_owned": 955, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1534028558}, "language": "english", "review": "Devs are lying.

It also drives the character building and story. It's well written for what it wants to achieve.

You play as a boy called Otus, who is part of some owl-humanoid race called Owls. He lives in some sky land, basically there was some disaster on Earth and some lands flew to the sky, and now there are random lands floating in the sky, and separated lands in the ocean, but way more ocean. \n\nGameplay is pretty good and unique like I said. Otus is capable of flying, and during the game you will accompany 3 allies each with different weapon and techniques, and you can switch btw these allies and basically without them you can't attack, I mean you just have basic slap without them. It's pretty fun honestly. Platforming is fun too, but it's mostly you flying and dodging stuff. \n\nArea design is not very complicated or fun, but it does the job, however variety of enemies is poor, there are like 2 types of enemies for each area. Not many different type of enemies during the game. Art is okay, not bad, nothing great tho. Game is a bit repetitive in my opinion, but still not insanely repetitive, or I would drop it, since I hate repetitive games.\n \nAs for story, well story is about Otus who lives in sky lands and his village gets attacked by pirates who are basically some machines, and he sets on journey to save his village and finds truth about Owls. He is pretty bad in everything, so nobody believes in him. Story is okay, nothing special, but Otus is kinda likeable. \n\n[i]Note: Special thanks to my friend Voluntas for gifting me this game.[/i]\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1] Gameplay is pretty good and unique, area design is meh, pretty weak enemies variety, with some okay story(not good, not bad either). If you are an achievement hunter, you're gonna have bad time, there is only 12 achievements, and I think I got 0 after beating the game. I casually played game though, and few times I went back to collect stuff. All in all, I would say that the game is good, but I would recommend it at 70%+ discount. It can get a bit repetitive. \n\n[i]Note: This explains how I rate games in my reviews. https://imgur.com/gallery/z9ZjA47[/i]\n\n[h1]Personal rating: 6.5/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1533159023, "timestamp_updated": 1609873446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574559450149536133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43865981": {"recommendationid": "43865981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133513501", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 816, "last_played": 1533532778}, "language": "english", "review": "Best single player game I've played in a long time.

From that standpoint, it would be a 9/10. It has that Ghibli vibe, it really makes the game a sight for sore eyes. The developpers put they heart and soul in Owlboy, which is the reason i think, the characters animations are so human-like in spite of beeing a 16-bit game.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is atrocious. It's far too imprecise, in a game that requires you to be precise. There are also ridiculous difficulty spikes and very annoying sequences that could have been and should have been corrected.\nThey've spent 8 years on this game. how could they not realise how absolutly awful the  cannon minigame was. It actually was the epitome of the problem with Owlboy. It requires accuracy, but the developpers failed to provide the tools to be accurate. I still managed to squeeze my way through it however it really annoyed me, how stupid the controls were.\nThere were many, many great ideas (the short game phase on the worm for instance) but they squandered it with awful handling. It was either too short, or poorly executed. Also no map, wth? It's not mandatory, but it wouldnt have hurt to have add one in my opinion.\n\nAs for the story, it was forgettable and, let's be honest, actually quite poorly written. The characters are at best cute, most of the time plain boring. I do not really get why some characters are shown to us, if they dont get any role into the game (the bully pair for instance). Furthermore, the ending is disapointing. Nothing really explained, [spoiler] a boring boss fight, why cant I face the dreadful Pirate Boss....\t[/spoiler], yet the visuals once again.... i really ended up simply gazing at how gorgeous the game was, and the last screens/areas are some of the best pieces of artwork i've ever seen.\n\nI do not recommend Owlboy. In my opinion, there are far better games around. Hollow Knight for instance.

It does not have to fully commit to either to stick out as a cute little pixel gem \u2013 one, however, that is not free of flaws.\n\nVisually, the game is adorable, with colorful environments, quirky characters and excellent sprite work. The soundtrack also matches the overall style and the tracks range from fine to quite stunning. The game's presentation is without a doubt what draws many players in and the game definitely fulfills its artistic promises. Based on these aspects alone some might be surprised to discover a story that is at times remarkably dark and betrays a rather grand ambition with a lore that could under different circumstances parallel the depth of even \u201cHollow Knight.\u201d\n\nHowever, the scope of this underlying story turns out to be much larger than a game this short can handle. After all, even completionists will hardly spend more than 15 hours on their first playthrough. As a consequence, many interesting aspects of the game\u2019s universe feel unexplored and character development sometimes rushed, with barely enough time for players to fully process everything that seems to be going on in the background before the game is already over.\n\nWith regard to gameplay, \u201cOwlboy\u201d works best when the focus lies on exploring and puzzle-solving while it struggles with combat. The relatively cumbersome controls can make the game unnecessarily frustrating at times, particularly when quick thinking is required during boss fights - of which there probably should have been fewer. For the most part, however, the game is relatively forgiving and closer to the easier end of the spectrum when compared to many other indie platformers and Metroidvanias of recent years. Thus, the occasional moments of rage do not overshadow the strengths of this good-natured title.\n\nIn the end, \u201cOwlboy\u201d is far from perfect, but still a recommended experience for those who wish to go on an emotional journey through another charming pixel world; even if players who truly enjoy what it has to offer will probably wish that there were more.", "timestamp_created": 1532859401, "timestamp_updated": 1532862559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521276593208312988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43805398": {"recommendationid": "43805398", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975217137", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1532817936}, "language": "english", "review": "Owlboy was a labor of love by D-Pad Studios, and it shows in the intricate audio and visual detail in every screen.

The overly convoluted control scheme doesn't really help things -- I keep fumbling with the controls after several hours in, which is indicative of bad controls frankly.\n\nOverall, if you think you can handle the bumpy difficulty curve and the frustration that comes with a convoluted control scheme, there's a lot to like here, really. But I just couldn't get over it. And I generally love meteroidvanias.\n\nAs a side note, the story is... rather meh. Won't spoil anything here, but character motivation is... often questionable, often it seems all the motivation boils down to \"because plot\". I mean, there are hints of depth there, but in fact, most characters are about as deep as a kiddy pool, at least as far as I can tell from my limited experience.

There are some moments that feel awesome, and some that feel very unfair and frustrating. I will attempt to elaborate upon it's strengths and weaknesses, in order from best to worst.\n\nThe best part of Owlboy is, in my opinion, the characterization. It's obvious that a lot of love was put into making every moment relatable or funny, and I loved almost every interaction and dialogue. That leads me to...\n\nThe art is, of course, also very impressive. It's 16 bit aesthetic is almost forgotten entirely when put into context of how much love and effort was put into it's animations and design. The game looks absolutely beautiful, especially during key story moments. This nicely transitions to...\n\nThe story is... passable. It's not bad, but it's not really amazing either. Strong characterization makes for highlights inbetween honestly uninteresting segments. Some story elements are fantastic (such as the enigmatic \"Loop\"), while others are unexplored, unanswered, and unfinished. Not in a \"Man, I really want to know more about X!\" way, but a \"Wait, what was X about? Well, I guess we're never talking about it again. Whatever.\". But all this niceness could be forgotten thanks to...\n\nThe gameplay. Hoo boy. The gameplay for Owlboy is bland at best, and infuriating at worst.\n\nExploration is probably the most acceptable mechanic, and something they clearly put some thought into, but the lack of map makes it easy to get lost in the similar halls and corridors within each zone, and it can ultimately feel impossible to get that last Buccanary coin since you have no idea where to look besides the rough area.\n\nCombat, however, is what really cements my overall negative opinion of the game. It overshadows the fantastic characters, beautiful art, decent story, and acceptable exploration with how awful it feels. Rather than attacking things directly, your only true method of damaging enemies is by carrying people with guns who shoot for you. Getting hit, however, not only knocks you back, but makes you drop whom/whatever you're carrying. If you fall to the ground, you additionally have to get back into the air, as you can't carry people while you're walking. The screenshake during some fights is intense, contributing to the visual clutter you can often find yourself trapped in as you take hit after hit, unable to recover. The game is thankfully merciful with most of it's respawn points, which is the only saving grace of some of the more infuriating bosses. Overall, your character feels so unnecessarily weak that some parts are genuinely un-fun, and frankly, the other aspects of the game couldn't make up for the segments in which I died over a dozen times thanks to honestly unfair mechanics.\n\nMy overall purchasing conclusion is thusly: If you're willing to put up with the frustrating combat mechanics and drag yourself through some of the less-compelling moments in the story, you will find moments to cherish in Owlboy. Pick it up on sale IF you're interested, but don't come in expecting it to engage you if you aren't already. At full price, it probably isn't worth it either way.\n\nSome may look at Owlboy and wonder why it wasn't wildly popular like Undertale and Minecraft, other indie games that certainly put in as much effort as the developers at D-Pad. This leads me to my conclusion that Owlboy is somewhat of the essence of an Indie Game. Not in a \"The perfect example\", but \"The perfect summary\". The love put into Owlboy is more than apparent at every turn, but it is still a very flawed creation. Undertale explodes with character and story, and Minecraft evolved to become deeper and more engaging over it's long, open development, and still recieves updates! But those games are rare, nearly-flawless masterpieces, and those aspiring to achieve their success are almost assuredly going to be disappointed.\n\nNot every indie game can be Undertale or Minecraft. Sometimes, they must settle for being Owlboy.\n\nEdit: The music was so forgettable I literally forgot about it in my review.", "timestamp_created": 1531095384, "timestamp_updated": 1534532644, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716924011707305908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43386850": {"recommendationid": "43386850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017841792", "num_games_owned": 462, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 676, "last_played": 1518395835}, "language": "english", "review": "https://youtu.be/_7aD_2Eu77s\nBetter than Mario.

But this game has left such a sour taste in my mouth even a week after finishing it. \n\nRepetitive, uninteresting, and poor design choices, and a hefty price tag for such a short and clunky game. It's far from a 10/10.\n\nIt's a game that reels you in at first, with interesting gameplay, story, characters, etc. The first two hours are fantastic. And it just plummets after you finish the first dungeon. Characters become cliched and boring. Combat is the same and there's literally no variance other than people leaving your party for story-reasons. Really gorgeous graphics but the gameplay is so clunky and the level design is terrible later on. You can really tell that they spent most of the ~9 years in development drawing the designs. You never want a frustrate a player with your level design choices and the devs do just this. Too much focus on making a dungeon unique has made them unfun and frustrating, such as a dungeon featuring a darkness mechanic... with an FOV of literally the player in a dungeon featuring spiked walls and enemies jumping out of walls you can't see. Sure they're unique -- in how bad the features they feature are. Midgame to endgame is full of frustrating level design and boring and lazily designed bosses. To make the boss fights worse, they all have so much HP that it takes ~2 minutes of repetitive shooting to complete one of any stages of a boss. A stage, i.e., a cycle of moves that the boss repeatedly goes through until they reach an HP threshold. \n\nBy god at least make the game playable to casual gamers. I'm an avid platformer player and some levels took longer than it should've because of the irksome \"gotcha!\" gimmicks that just come out of nowhere. The player is punished for not knowing the level enough and not because of a lack of skill. It's a platformer but it feels like more of a shoot-em-up RPG minus the progression in an RPG. I don't know how you can screw that up, the combat system is almost identical throughout the game and gets real boring after a while.\n\nGraphics are integral to a great game but gameplay > graphics any day for me. Gameplay makes up the majority of the experience, and graphics, music, story, etc. are there to complement it. The story starts off really interesting but, again, in the midgame to endgame, turns a little unsatisfying and cliche. \n\nTo call this game a 10/10 is an insult to other games with the same score like Undertale and a slap in the face to games like Pokemon AS, which received lower scores. It implies the game has little to no faults and that you had a near flawless experience. Don't ever listen to game review sites like IGN: the reviews are rushed and everyone just bases their review off another's in effort to have a popular opinion. LIterally a hive mind.\n\nI spent ~20 bucks buying a game that I thought would rock my balls. I've literally never been let down like this since No Man's Sky. This game is like a 6/10 and it's not even close to a 10/10. \n\nEven if it's on sale, save your money, or if you're looking for a satisfying platformer, get Celeste or Shovel Knight.

Spoilers will be hidden but just in case: Warning! Spoilers!\n\nAlright, I personally loved this game! It was an interesting adventure from the beginning to the end, and concidering the ending [spoiler]we will hopefully get a second one and I couldn't be more excited.[/spoiler] \nOtus was such a lovable main character and even with [spoiler]him being mute[/spoiler] the game still expressed his character well and made me fall in love with him. Same goes to the other characters, even if they had just a bit of screen time they still left an impression in my mind.\nEverything about the game was so beautiful! You could see the passion that was put into the artwork and character design, absolutely fantastic! There were many times when I had to stop and just admire the scenery for a while.\n\nThe plot was simple yet interesting, there weren't any moments where I felt bored or like I had heard the story before. [spoiler]The ending took me by a total surprise, I was expecting a generic boss battle with the main villain before the usual happy ending. I'm not a huge fan of open endings personally, so I was left hoping to at least some answers, but I'm hopeful that we will get a second game that continues the story in some way.[/spoiler] \nGameplay was also very refreshing, each boss battle was different and required multiple tries before you were able to beat them. I found myself excited to see what the next boss will do because each of them ws so unique and different, I never felt like the battles were repeating itself.\nAnd when dying in a battle instead of feeling defeated and frustrated you were left with new knowledge what to do next time and how to beat the boss, it was very motivating and nice.\n\nThe only battle that felt unfair was [spoiler]the weird rock snake moster battle.[/spoiler] I had impossible time figuring out where my character was because it blended together with the background so well. I knew what I had to do in order to win that battle but I kept getting lost in the many same colored things happening, and then taking damage for a stupid reason.\nThis takes me to the part of unforgiving. Yes, this game is challenging but I still found it extremely enjoyable as a casual gamer, but there were moments I wished the game was a bit more forgiving. A good example of that was [spoiler]close to the end when you are making your way into the temple, jumping on the floating rocks and platforms.[/spoiler]\nOnce you fall you die, there is no recovering yourself because at that point [spoiler]Otus can't fly.[/spoiler] This part took me annoyingly long because it was just trial and error until I knew exactly what to do.\n\nBut in conclusion Owlboy was a refreshing journey I was happy to be part on, I hope we will get a second game in the future to continue the legacy of the owls. \nNow if you'll excuse me, I have some Owlboy merch to buy.", "timestamp_created": 1530562417, "timestamp_updated": 1530563035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43250783": {"recommendationid": "43250783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353055016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1530554831}, "language": "english", "review": "hi am peter girften and i like this game haha", "timestamp_created": 1530555938, "timestamp_updated": 1530555938, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.234886243939399719", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43244818": {"recommendationid": "43244818", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960386328", "num_games_owned": 1383, "num_reviews": 288, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 702, "last_played": 1530712250}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Plataformeo al estilo de la vieja escuela.\nAmbientaci\u00f3n y banda sonora excelentes.\nUna historia que por ahora me est\u00e1 pareciendo muy buena pero todav\u00eda no he terminado el juego.\n\nHe de admitir que antes de que saliera lo llevaba siguiendo y ten\u00eda prejuicios con como ser\u00eda realmente el juego, incluso llegu\u00e9 a ponerlo como \"No me interesa\" porque pensaba que iba a ser otro estilo de juego, pero tras la salida y ver algunos minutos de gameplay vi que estaba equivocado y es muy bueno en todos los aspectos.", "timestamp_created": 1530540347, "timestamp_updated": 1530540347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58146291971206665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43241356": {"recommendationid": "43241356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076984824", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1590155200}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Aventura 2D de corte cl\u00e1sico, que nos recuerda la \u00e9poca dorada de los 16 bits.

Buy this amazing game, but ONLY if it's on sale. \n\nBiggest pros and cons are at the top of each list.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Incredible story with a cast of colorful charcters in creative and unique settings. There isn't a dull moment in the plot, a line of dialouge you won't want to read, or and inch of the map you won't want to explore. Look at my hours put into this game. Not a single second of it felt wasted. I was throughly entertained from start to finish. This is a big deal! It's fresh, charming, and kept me smiling throughout the whole game. There are action moments, MAJOR plot twists, wonderus mysteies left to solve, and scenes that will hae you feeling for days. This isn't only because of the story, but because of the characters that drive the story foward. Each wonderful character in Owlboy has certain poses and faces they make when trying to express something. Some are hilarious, some are heartbreaking, and other have you worried for their well-being. The characters in this game boast so much more life than other charaters in other games and they even display quite a bit of character development which isn't seen to often. Usually, you're given a bland, stagnant character. This isn't the case.\n\n-Fantastic pixel art. The atmosphere is immesley detailed and beautiful to look at.\n\n-Unique mechanics! I like how Otus, the main character, can do nothing but fly around. His adventure soley relies on who or what he picks up and what ability they have to offer. I keeps the gameplay fresh througout.\n\n-The puzzles are fun to solve. I certaintly wouldn't call this the ULTIMATE puzzle game, but there are quite a few. It may not appeal to somebody who is a puzzle master as they are quite simple, but I wouldn't call them brainless. If anything, they don't feel like a chore to complete. They're entertaining. \n\n-I'm not sure why people are saying it's too short. It isn't. There's plenty of game time along with a few side quests and easter eggs to discover.\n\n-It's just cute and somthing new.\n\nCONS:\n\n-First and foremost, the game isn't worth the full price. I bought the game on sale at $14.99 and it felt 100% worth it. At $24.99, I don't think I could say the same. If I had bought it at that cost, I wouldn't say I felt SCAMMED or disappointed. Just not totally worth.\n\n-Clunky controls. Although they work for the most part, they're going to be times where you drop things you don't want to drop, fly when you don't want to fly, and end up dying because you have to be almost RIGHT ON TOP of something you have to pick up.\n\n-This is just a personal opinion, but... boss fights. With the exception of the last one, I didn't enjoy a single one. All boss fights play out the same. You're locked in a tiny confined box and are thrown random stuff at you with very little being telegraphed at you. Oh, and if you get hit? Prepare to rage. Owlboy has this stupid mechanic of your player flying into a wall and getting stunned everytime you get hit my something. If you remain sliding down that wall for the remainder of your invincibilty frames, you're probably going to get hit again and watch the loop [spoiler]pun intended[/spoiler] continue until you die in that tiny cramped area that you can't to anything about.\n\n-When moving through the map, the entire screen scolls to reveal the next section of your area. This is fine. Lots of games do this. However, in Owlboy, chances are you are going to be greated with a rock to the face that will make you fly 100ft backwards. There is no warning and this makes the game difficult in an unfun way. There's a difference between fair difficulty (like Cuphead) and unfair BS you can do nothing about.\n\n-Bugs. Notice how this is on the bottom of my list because they rarely occur. But there have been a total of 7 times I had to restart from the last checkpoint because a boss wouldn't show up, an essential item wouldn't work, or Otus gets stuck in a wall.\n\nOVERALL: I have to say you should buy it! Videogamedunky was right. It's new, creative, and somthing you should play because chances are it's somthing you haven't already seen a 1,000 times... just... wait for it to go on sale..\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1530210871, "timestamp_updated": 1530210871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43099583": {"recommendationid": "43099583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054143018", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 392, "last_played": 1530106904}, "language": "english", "review": "Owl boy a unique platformer that lets you fly and go on an adventure as you unravel the story of a single mute owl boy as he meets new friends.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Summary[/h1]\nSo one thing that is unique about this game is that they allow you to fly in a platformer game. You are controlling Otus a new apprentice owl that has only failed in his life. You can fly around places, carry friends that have their own unique abilties to solve puzzles and overcome hurdles. You will be going through a whole story about the journey of Otus as you gain new friends along the way too that lets you  go to places you couldn't before.\n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\n[b]Story[/b]\nOne thing that really kept me going was actually the story of the game as it is quite engaging to follow the journey of Otus and see how he grows as a character. He slowly progresses from a owl that only knew failure and disappointment to someone that is courageous as gains new friends along the way. \n\n[b] Art and Soundtrack [/b]\nThis is a huge plus to the overall experience of the game! The high pixel art is really appealing and really fit the game as it is brings a light hearted feel to the game. The soundtrack is really phenomenal as it really brings out the feeling of each enviroment or level you're in and it also enhances the emotions of certain cut scenes. One of the best soundtracks is really early on as you reach Tropus the main hub or area that connects you to the other levels/dungeons of the game. This soundtrack was made really well and it was a great effort for it because of how frequent you will pass through here, it will never get stale.\n\n[b] Simple gameplay [/b]\nI would say this is one of the good parts of this game. Eventhough some may classify this as a sort of metroidvania game I'll say it is one of the simpler ones where you only have a few mechanics for Otus which is flying, Grabbing, dodging and spinning. But it is how many interactions these few mechanics give that really enhances the overall gameplay as it doesn't require you to acquire any new abilities to make it feel more interesting and engaging. For example: Grabbing can be used to grab objects, pull mechanics, grab friends to have new abilities, and also throw stuff. Spinning can be used to spin stuff that you are standing on, break certain objects and stun enemies.\n\n[b]  Level design [/b]\nEach level/dungeon of the game has it's own unique puzzles that is introduced and has it's on flow and backtracks that really makes it feel fun to go through. The levels are never too long nor too short as it keeps you engaged when you go through each and every one of them.\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n[b] The game length [/b]\nI will consider this as the  only bad of  the game as it is only about 6 hours long? The length is perfect for it's very simple gameplay mechanics but for it's story there are times I feel it is abit rush and too compact. It made me feeling like the game ended abit too quick as there is little no resolution to the amount of stuff that happens at the end. There alot of lore and additions to the game that are mentioned at the end but never explained.\n\nPros\n[list]\n    [*]Simple gameplay\n    [*]Engaging story\n    [*]Great art and soundtrack\n    [*]Fun characters\n    [*]Good level design\n[/list]\n\nCons\n[list]\n    [*]Short game length\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion [/h1]\nOverall this is a really solid adventure platformer that keeps you engaged throughout the game. There are certainly moments that made me emtional as I have grown attached to Otus throughout the 6 hours of my game. The game is certainly pricey for it's game length but certainly worth it. If this game is on discount I would 100% recommend you to get it 10/10 times if you want a great adventure and want a more unique platformer that lets you fly.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1530106792, "timestamp_updated": 1530106792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43097251": {"recommendationid": "43097251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066227302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1530099641}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to start off by saying that this game is gorgeous, the soundtrack is lovely, and the story has its moments. \n\nThat said, this game offers nothing new.

For all its beauty, the control mechanics are sloppy, the level designs uninspired, and the gameplay frustrating. The story was the most interesting thing about this game, but the flawed gameplay ruined it for me. \n\nThe controls would be all right if the bosses and quick escape sequences didn't rely on precision controls. And if a game is going to send your character flying halfway across the screen when he's hit, it'd be a good idea to make the blinky invincibility time last until the player at least has control over the character again. \n\nThe levels are beautiful, like practically all of the art in the game, but very linear. There is little reason to tread back over old ground, since you cannot find item upgrades, just find more coins to buy the limited upgrades. The exploration mostly amounts to clearing rooms of enemies, and then carrying stuff to places. There's little else to find, and that erases some of the charm. \n\nThe combat gameplay is immensely frustrating. One character shoots what amounts to a BB Gun with crap range, and the other a fire-shotgun blast with even worse range and a bigger hitbox. Combining this with the flying damage animations that the enemies combo up on you means that one hit means you're going to lose half of your life.\n\nIf you have more patience with poorly made games, then you might like this better than I did, but I would not recommend buying this game on anything but the heaviest sales. 75-80% off. Don't be a sucker like me buying it at 50%.

As\u00ed, con la ayuda de una serie de compa\u00f1eros que iremos conociendo poco a poco y que tendr\u00e1n su influencia en el \"gameplay\", no s\u00f3lo emprenderemos un largo viaje con aquel prop\u00f3sito, sino que adem\u00e1s asistiremos al proceso de la evoluci\u00f3n de nuestro protagonista desde la m\u00e1xima inseguridad hasta su aceptaci\u00f3n como parte esencial de la comunidad y al redescubrimiento de antiguas verdades ocultas sobre sus antepasados. No s\u00e9 si premeditadamente o no, pero la trama de \u201cOwlboy\u201d me ha recordado y me ha parecido que posee una gran influencia de la saga \u201cThe Legend of Zelda\u201d de Nintendo, lo cual no es sino una buena noticia porque es en las primeras, originales y mejores entregas en las que parece haberse apoyado.\n\nDe esta forma, pese a que la historia tiene momentos \u00e1lgidos de gran inter\u00e9s, intensidad y emotividad, no cabe duda que lo que genera verdadero inter\u00e9s por \u201cOwlboy\u201d es su llamativo aspecto gr\u00e1fico. Es cierto que apenas innova en t\u00e9cnicas que ya se usaban hace a\u00f1os en la \u00e9poca de los 16 o incluso 32-bits, pero hac\u00eda tiempo que no se rescataba esta forma de hacer de una forma tan detallada y perfeccionista, ofreciendo un apartado visual que, sin duda, entrar\u00e1 directamente por los ojos de aquellos que aprecien el pixel art como forma expresiva en los videojuegos. Es adem\u00e1s con esta t\u00e9cnica no s\u00f3lo como se han materializado los sprites de los personajes o los escenarios, ambos con sus respectivas fant\u00e1sticas animaciones, sino que el dilatado tiempo de desarrollo tambi\u00e9n ha servido para enfatizar los momentos importantes de la trama con cinem\u00e1ticas que hacen uso de ella y que son absolutamente espectaculares y eficaces en trasladarnos la intensidad y grandiosidad de cada momento que describen. Un diez en este apartado. \n\nPor fortuna, el buen hacer del estudio de desarrollo no se ha limitado a estos apartados y, en lo que a la m\u00fasica y sonidos respecta, el resultado es dif\u00edcilmente mejorable. Tanto la banda sonora compuesta con instrumentos reales como los contundentes efectos sonoros nos acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1n a la perfecci\u00f3n durante nuestro viaje y nos har\u00e1n sentir con m\u00e1s intensidad a trav\u00e9s de nuestros o\u00eddos lo que a trav\u00e9s de nuestros ojos ya pose\u00eda fuerza suficiente para suscitar nuestro inter\u00e9s. As\u00ed, las variadas composiciones nos har\u00e1n pasar por el proceso que va desde la tranquilidad de nuestro hogar inicial a la \u00e9pica de las batallas a las que haremos frente y al casi misticismo de las vivencias interiores de Otus y de su relaci\u00f3n con la civilizaci\u00f3n olvidada que lo precedi\u00f3.\n\nFinalmente, como no pod\u00eda ser menos, \u201cOwlboy\u201d se afianza en los pilares s\u00f3lidos de un g\u00e9nero tan popular hoy d\u00eda como es el de los \"metroidvania\". Si bien no se trata de un videojuego dentro de los m\u00e1s puristas del g\u00e9nero, s\u00ed que nos dar\u00e1 la sensaci\u00f3n de estar jugando a un t\u00edtulo de este tipo pero, al igual que ocurre con la trama, con ciertos toques de algo parecido a la saga \u201cZelda\u201d con sus pinceladas de aventura de acci\u00f3n y salpicaduras de rol. Sea como sea, deberemos controlar a Otus, el cual, generalmente y sobre todo al inicio, ser\u00e1 casi totalmente dependiente de sus compa\u00f1eros para hacer frente a los enemigos que nos encontremos. De esta forma el juego tambi\u00e9n adquiere tintes de una especie de \"dual-stick shooter\" simplificado en el que, por un lado, controlaremos el vuelo de Otus y, por otro, la direcci\u00f3n del ataque del personaje correspondiente que estemos llevando. Esto que al principio parece un tanto extra\u00f1o puesto que nuestro personaje parece totalmente vulnerable cuando est\u00e1 s\u00f3lo (podemos elegir esto en cualquier momento), pronto se har\u00e1 costumbre y se nos har\u00e1 sencillo alternar entre personajes, o bien para vencer enemigos con una debilidad determinada, o bien para abrir nuevos caminos que previamente no pod\u00edamos alcanzar como en todo buen \"metroidvania\" ocurre. Son estos caminos los que conforman un mapa bastante extenso y muy variado en cuanto a localizaciones y situaciones pero que, siendo del g\u00e9nero que es, posee un fallo impensable: la inexistencia de un mapa. Esto que, como digo, ya forma parte esencial del g\u00e9nero dado que siempre se fomenta la exploraci\u00f3n, no est\u00e1 presente en \u201cOwlboy\u201d y, sea por olvido o por decisi\u00f3n de dise\u00f1o para hacer nuestra tarea m\u00e1s dificultosa, resulta bastante inc\u00f3modo a la hora de buscar secretos y ahondar m\u00e1s en su trama. A pesar de todo, esto no puede empa\u00f1ar un esquema de jugabilidad que nos mantiene en todo momento entretenidos e, incluso a veces, en exceso con momentos sin un minuto de descanso pero que hacen ver el encomiable trabajo del estudio por ofrecer un producto que var\u00eda en todo momento y que casi no deja lugar para la repetitividad.    \n\nEn definitiva, \u201cOwlboy\u201d, sin ser de los m\u00e1s purista dentro del g\u00e9nero, es uno de los \"metroidvania\" m\u00e1s originales de los \u00faltimos tiempos, y su val\u00eda se aprecia a\u00fan m\u00e1s sabiendo el dilatado tiempo de desarrollo que se le ha dedicado y el ingente trabajo que hay detr\u00e1s de \u00e9l en pos de producir un videojuego que no deje tiempo para el aburrimiento mientras nos deja estampas y momentos que dif\u00edcilmente olvidaremos.", "timestamp_created": 1529442696, "timestamp_updated": 1529443743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579288065433502197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42838030": {"recommendationid": "42838030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075454494", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1529404265}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is amazing i loved the music and the story is so much fun over all anyone can injoy the game", "timestamp_created": 1529404532, "timestamp_updated": 1529404532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42819501": {"recommendationid": "42819501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258398304", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1529353092}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall a great game.  \n\nAs to its mechanics and overall difficulty, I have to say I didn't find the game specially challenging. Otus' flying/jumping and its companions' abilities are easy to handle when you've played much more demanding games such as Ori. If there's something that is rather lackluster about the game that's its puzzle levels, as none of them are too difficult to figure out.\n\nRegarding its music and graphics, although I feel like they could have taken advantage of its catchy leitmotif more often (which reminded me of Kid Icarus'), the music in the game has been fully orchestrated and it includes wonderful pieces like [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6YrXXA3UDs] this one[/url]. As a bit-art lover, I feel that its graphics appealed to my taste from the very beginning.\n\nThe plot is one of the features that I enjoyed the most about the game, as most platformers are very weak when it comes to developing a deep story. I found specially remarkable the fact that the main character is introduced as a loser, as I'm quite used to clich\u00e9d, brave and unique protagonists in single-player videogames. There's something about the plot that I found very frustrating, though (spoiler alert): [spoiler] in my opinion, there should have been two different endings based on a final choice during the last chapter of the game: Solus should have told you the story of the Loop and the Hex in the room where the altar with the relics is. At that point, you should have been able to choose whether to believe him or not. Not believing what he says should have a triggered a final boss fight against him which, after the defeat, would have ended up in the world being utterly destroyed (bad ending); believing what he says should have triggered Molstrom showing up and stealing the relics, turning him into the final boss which, after defeating him, would have meant Otus and Solus would have been able to activate the Hex (good ending) [/spoiler]\n\nI have to say, though, that the game is a bit too pricey taking into account its short duration. I would advise potential players to wait for the summer sale to get it.", "timestamp_created": 1529356843, "timestamp_updated": 1529357520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585382521152496338", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42817074": {"recommendationid": "42817074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073959451", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 163, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 711, "last_played": 1523331776}, "language": "english", "review": "https://youtu.be/JIrkNxwauVo\n\nOwlboy was released recently for XBox and PS4, which made me go search in my game library to see if I already own it. I found it and spent 10 hours delighted with the game. Simply gorgeous.\n\nI think the introduction says it all, but I suspect you're expecting to listen a few more lines. Owlboy has been in development for almost 10 years and went almost unnoticed when it was released on PC. It is a puzzle platformer in which we solve some relatively easy puzzles to advance. Otus, our main character, sees his land attacked by pirates and creates a group of friends, consisting of characters once devalued by their peers, to try to save their world. It has to be said that it is a very well written story, with well characterized characters, each one with its own history, more or less detailed to the point that we sincerely care about all of them. Even some of the side characters or villains are extremely well represented. It's a linear story, with a small twist at the end, but very well set and explained. My only problem with the story, and not wanting to spoil it, is the final battle. In addition some of the dialogues become rather extense, although I believe that little or nothing could be excluded from the final product.\nGraphically the game was a surprise. I expected a Shovel Knight-like artstyle but the way they used the pixelart in this game, combining it with high-resolution graphics, immense details on the movements and expressions. The construction of worlds and scenarios goes far beyond the games that try emulate retro games. For example Otus does not speak but the facial and body expressions details are more than enough to perceive all their emotions and we can even imagine a whole dialogue just with them. Recently I spoke about the attention given to detail in Sea of Thieves and Owlboy is another great example of how to build a world and how to use art to do something well made.\nThe game soundtrack does not disappoint and remarkably follows the tone of each. When we are quietly exploring the world the music is calm and relaxing, and when we are in a fighting section or when we need to do fast movements the music becomes more intense and dynamic. I liked the sound effects for each one of the movements and actions of the characters and even the sounds for the dialog boxes, and although nothing is extraordinary, undoubtedly a competent job was made.\n\nHow do you play this? I tried to play it as a twin stick shooter, but at one point I got tired of it because it's so much easier to simply use keyboard and mouse. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the configuration of the controller, but when the game reached a difficulty spike, I did not have enough skill to overcome a boss or a more demanding section, so I choose for the easier solution... change the controller.\n\nIn this game we control Otus which as a standalone character does very little. He flies, twirls, and spins. The secret and charm of the game is that he can pick up any of his three friends and take advantage of their different abilities to progress through levels or areas that we would not have access to without them.\n\nAlthough the amount of enemies is not great, combat rarely seems repetitive because the way they appear, leads us to use different techniques to overcome them in each of those moments.\nThe puzzles are relatively simple and often obvious, which means that you have the feeling that boss battles have a remarkable difficulty spike and required me numerous attempts to outcome most of them. The fact that the controls were somewhat confusing, which made me do multiple mistakes also did not help. In sections where we have time to think there was no big problem other than the frequent annoyance of picking up the friend rather than picking up an item or picking the wrong character, but during quick sequences a mistake ruins everything and in those times it becomes frequent.\nThere are lots of collectibles and hidden areas that reward both exploration and the repetition of some of the areas when we gain access to new characters. Defeating enemies in a certain way also gives you access to new items.\n\nIn a nutshell the game is this. A lovely world with characters with whom we can easily create a relationship. Graphically it managed to impress me by the way they included so many detail in the pixel art. A very engaging story. A game and also an experience that I highly recommend.

For a concise review, there is a pros-and-cons list at the bottom of this review.\n\nOwlboy is a 2D platform adventure game, with much more emphasis on adventure than platforming. The gameplay is unique in that you control Otus, an owl boy (hah) capable of flight. However, his only attack is a spin that merely stuns enemies. For combat, he picks up his companions who can shoot the enemies for him in a somewhat similar vain to how a twin-stick shooter would play out. Different companions have different attacks, and all of them are to be utilized throughout the game's progress. The game auto-saves rather frequently, so you can save and quit at any time and pick up right where you left off. \n\nThere's no levelling up or weapon upgrades, only different characters to use when the story calls for them. This keeps the enemies rather balanced throughout the game; it never feels like the enemies are damage sponges (something many adventure games seem to suffer from in my experiences). Instead, there are coins scattered around the land, and picking up the coins and taking them to a shop nets you upgrades that either increase your max HP or weapon range, or give you a cosmetic to wear. The upgrades are unlocked in a systematic order, so you don't have to worry about unlocking the \"wrong thing first\". However, it's impossible to grind for these coins; there are a finite number of coins in the land, and picking them up permanently registers that coin in your inventory. There is a section in the pause menu that allows you to see how many coins you've picked up in an area, as well as the total number of coins in that area. Exploring any area, even a little bit, often yields coins, so it's suggested - but not required - to investigate everything as you're progressing through the game.\n\nEach dungeon and segment of the game consists of many puzzles and some boss fights; none of the puzzles felt tedious, boring or overly difficult, and the bosses all felt unique, most of them have at least some creative gimmick required to defeat them. Some bosses in the later segments of the game felt pretty difficult, but not impossibly difficult. Fortunately, if you die anywhere or in a boss fight, you respawn with full health at the beginning of the room you died in, or outside the boss area. This makes dying less frustrating but still something you want to avoid. Regarding the dungeons themselves, they're mostly linear but don't [i]feel[/i] linear, with backtrack routes and shortcuts that are very difficult to miss. You can get through them without a map, which is good because there is no map system in this game. This is only bad if you're a completionist going for the achievements, but main-storywise it's not an issue.\n\nOverall, Owlboy is a fantastic 2D action-adventure game with a story that leaves an extremely strong first impression and continues to impress as you progress. You can really feel the effort the developers put into the game, its environment and its conveyance, and I was surprised at how short the credits list was at the end. \n[list]\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[*] Unique yet intuitive gameplay\n[*] Compelling and developing story.\n[*] Unique and consistent characters, both main and minor.\n[*] Enemy and level design that's not frustratingly difficult but also not boringly easy.\n[*] Amazing soundtrack that compliments the tone of each section of the game.\n[*] Any exploration is rewarded, and is completely optional.\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[*] Relatively short main story, approximately 6 hours long.\n[*] No map feature, although one isn't really needed unless you're going for 100% completion.\n[*] Overall linearity yields almost no replay value, unless you're going for 100% completion.\n[/list]\nIn conclusion, Owlboy is a wonderful game that I think is definitely worth experiencing, but $25 USD is a rather steep price for 6 hours of quality story. Definitely pick it up if you can easily afford to spend $25 on a great but short game, or if it goes on any kind of sale.", "timestamp_created": 1528003595, "timestamp_updated": 1528003595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697842776775360107", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42459148": {"recommendationid": "42459148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139890974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 225, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1596248055}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Cuando llevas m\u00e1s de 10 horas jugando y ves que la cosa va para largo no abusan con nada, la historia de momento muy muy bien y la jugabilidad tambien, hacia a\u00f1os que no jugaba un plataforma tan bueno, pixel art.", "timestamp_created": 1527988023, "timestamp_updated": 1527988023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42458483": {"recommendationid": "42458483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191170355", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1593655790}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't like really like 2D platformers.

You could definitely do worse things than play Owlboy, but the story likely won't stick with you in years to come.\n\n*Positives*\nMusic, art, boss design\n*Neutral*\nPlot, characters, difficulty\n*Negatives*\nSome of the puzzles, getting lost in some levels", "timestamp_created": 1527642015, "timestamp_updated": 1527642015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42355354": {"recommendationid": "42355354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087610673", "num_games_owned": 2889, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1105, "last_played": 1570852096}, "language": "english", "review": "Owlboy is a great single player adventure game with amazing pixel art, It takes you on a great adventure with some interesting characters. It is a must have for any lover of pixels or cute 2d games.\n\nWhen I say Amazing Pixel Art, I mean Amazing Pixel Art There are many parralax layers, Every pixel was put on the screen on purpose. It surely is some of the best pixel art I have ever seen. Only for the aestethics this game is worth every penny, Then the game has a great story, abilities that let you explore further and some interesting characters.\n\nThe Story is about Otus, He is a mute owl/human/thing, He lives in Vellie, It is a bunch of floating islands inhabited by all sorts of people, Nobody really likes Otus because he is kind of a doofus and people don't see him fit as a leader, Owls are supposed to be wise. After Vellie was being attacked by Pirates Otus leaves with his best friend Geddy to save Vellie and the rest of the world.\n\nThe game looks a lot like a platformer, But since you can fly it does not really work like one. You can carry Geddy and when you do you can shoot with his gun, So you have free movement and you can shoot in every direction, You could call it a twin stick shooter, But I would not classify it as that.\n\nThere is a shop where you can buy upgrades, There are not a lot, You can upgrade health a few times, You can upgrade the weapon of Geddy and another weapon, You can buy some hats and that's about it. The game should not take you more than 15 hours to 100%. It is short and there is not much to do endgame, Still I would recommend this game for the full 100%\n\nThe game has been in development for 9 years, And you can surely see the results. It looks like the dev had some sort of OCD where every pixel needed to be perfect. The soundtrack is amazing, The controls are amazing, The story is amazing. It has so much charm it is hard to not like this game.\n\nIf I have to name some downsides, I wish there was more to do. When the game is 100% you can fly around, But that's about it. I wish it had more gamemodes, Maybe a survival, or some of the ingame minigames with more tracks. New game + and more difficulity levels would have been nice too. The final upgrade also makes you extremely overpowered.\n\nOverall the game is a must see and must play, It has some very interesting game mechanics that combine 2 very different genres. The game is just stunning and it has a very cute story. I have to give the game a 9. It truly is amazing.\n\nFollow my Curator Page: \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/35216846/\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Steam Cloud Save[/td]\n\t[td]Working fine[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Controller Support[/td]\n\t[td]Yes, Xbox One Bluetooth Working[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Achievements[/td]\n\t[td]Pretty easy[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]FPS on Ultra[/td]\n\t[td]Locked to 60[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Launch Command[/td]\n\t[td]gamemoderun %command%[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Issues[/td]\n\t[td]None[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]OS[/td]\n\t[td]Arch Linux[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Kernel[/td]\n\t[td]5.3.5[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]DE[/td]\n\t[td]Gnome 3.34.1[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]CPU[/td]\n\t[td]Intel I7-6800K @ 4.20Ghz[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]GPU[/td]\n\t[td]Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 (Nvidia 435.21 Drivers)[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1527577747, "timestamp_updated": 1570854784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527188301086425781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42326612": {"recommendationid": "42326612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041082289", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1516938811}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little platformer.

But from what he lacks in his learnings he makes up for in the friends he makes along the journey. the story seems to be telling more the groups adventure as opposed to just Otus. since he is mute all the narration is done through second parties. while you may be the one controlling Otus it is his friends that are telling the story.\n\n    and what a story that is!\n\n\nhighlights:\n\n-great story: as told through the second parties. while Otus does not talk or make any major improvements I still felt accomplished and (somewhat) satisfied with the ending.\n\n-great soundtrack: the music and ambiance are both smooth and fitting for each environment, it never feels like the music is overpowering the mood.\n\n-great art style, its pixel art, what's not to love?  in my opinion you don\u2019t need realistic or fancy graphics you just need a good art style\n\n-amazing characters: a lot of single player games nowadays I talk to a person only once unless I absolutely must, however the characters and their stories had me checking in on them whenever I was able to just to learn more about the world I was in which leads me to...\n\n- the lore: arguably one of the hardest parts of telling a story is finding a setting and building a world around the story. it\u2019s easy to go from start to finish, but only truly great works take time to care about the before, the after, and the stops you make along the way. this game takes its time between the bosses to shed some light about the world and why you are undergoing the quest that you are on.\n\nthe only issue I had with the game was the ending. not in a sense that it was bad but that it kept things very vague, I can understand completely from a story telling standpoint why the developer did this, but I was left with many questions that were left unanswered chief among which was, what happened sir fish after the story ended?\n\n9/10- I hate giving perfect scores\nin all honesty though at $25 this game is worth every penny, if you ever see it on sale I would highly recommend getting this.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1526363389, "timestamp_updated": 1526363389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447808265686035156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42039293": {"recommendationid": "42039293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031725194", "num_games_owned": 1256, "num_reviews": 301, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 700, "last_played": 1526320707}, "language": "english", "review": "Owlboy is an okay game. It has a lot of really impressive aspects, but the game itself ends up doing little, in my opinion.\n\nThe pixelart is really amazing, and obviously the main draw of the game. There is a lot to look at and it looks really good. The only complaint I have it that it doesn't differentiate between foreground and background well at all, in some places... Still, if you're interested in pixel art, definitely take a look at Owlboy. It also has one of the best nightskies! Not a lot of attention is typically played to the sky, but they've done a great job.\n\nThe music is also surprisingly good! But it's almost \"film music\". It sounds very good, and it complements the scenes very well, but in a very disney movie-like manner. The story also fits into this, I think.\n\nOne surprising aspect that I really enjoyed was the writing. Not the background story or the main plot, but the side characters. The way they behave, especially. It's impressive how much they've done using sound effects, animations, screen shake and caps lock at the most appropriate moments! \nThe main plot I didn't care much about, really. The background story was also a bit vague, so take it or leave. But the character interactions were really good.\n\nThe worst aspect is really the game itself. It gets especially bad by the end, if you try to find all the coins.\n\nFor one, the movement is rather bland for flying. Really, it feels exactly like a walking character, only you can walk up and down. There was one moment where the flying went over the top (in a good way), but that particular section was an infuriating mini-game with a few very important problems that it removes any of the joy in the flying. So yeah, the feeling of flying is not here at all.\n\nThen, there's the main mechanic, where you can carry one character that shoots differently. This isn't used very creatively either, they're almost like \"keys\". Sometimes you have to destroy a piece of armor with one character and then switching to kill the moster, stuff like that. The mechanic is a bit awkward, but they've implemented some handy shortcuts that make the experience mostly painless. Still doesn't make it very good, only prevents it from being very bad.\n\nThe shooting controls were especially bad. Trying to change characters (shoulder buttons) while flying (left analog) and aiming (right analog) and dodging (X) and repeatedly shooting (right trigger) makes it very clumsy. Add to that the imprecise aiming of the analog stick with an weird auto-aim that sometimes focuses on exactly the wrong thing. Heh.\n\nAt the end, collecting the coins is a mess, since you're only given X/Y coins you have/need for each area. During the normal playthrough, the game often closes doors behind you too, which is infuriating. I wanted to explore two paths, but accidentally chose the main path, being locked out from the alternative one. Once I got back (after finishing the section and moving on with the story, etc. etc.), I didn't really remember where anything was. \nThe game also relies on lots of fake walls for this. Overall, it was just not fun at all. The game also lacks a way of teleporting between areas, making the whole process more painful. Wouldn't recommend going for the extra coins, the reward isn't worth all the hassle.\n\nHonestly, the gameplay wasn't very good. But I'd say the writing, artstyle and music make up for it. At least to make it an enjoyable experience. Given how good the art and music are, I was expecting an equally good game, but that seems to have been somewhat neglected. \n\nNot a game I was terribly excited playing, but there are certainly noteworthy aspects!", "timestamp_created": 1526323007, "timestamp_updated": 1526323007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489732801914215088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42038739": {"recommendationid": "42038739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014445799", "num_games_owned": 979, "num_reviews": 316, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 525, "last_played": 1526320146}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Owlboy es una bonita y epica aventura.

You will fly through cities, skies and ancient temples while on your way to solve the mystery behind Pirates attack. Every location is really well designed and there are no tough arcade (not related to fighting) elements here, like in Hollow Knight for example. You will enjoy some nice views, sometimes solve mini puzzles, but that's all.\n\n[b]Owlboy can be finished in less than 10 hours.[/b] If you want to get all the achievements, you'll spend 2 or 3 more hours, since it's only about revisiting previous locations and collecting missed coins. Unfortunately, there is no replay value in this game. \n\n[b]Owls can hurt![/b]\n\nIn case of fighting this game is quite unique, because we are mostly fighting\u2026 by our companions. There are 3 of them and each is slightly different. One has fast, but quite weak gun, second one has very powerful, but slow gun, and third one can stun enemies. We unlock all of them with time, but what is the most interesting, we can switch between our companions all the time so there are many possibilities to deal with our enemies in almost every situation.\n\nThere are many mini bosses and closed room survival combats in Owlboy, but it's nothing very hard to be honest. Checkpoints are also very often, so after dying you will very likely start over in the same location or room. There is no difficulty level to choose and whole game is quite easy. \n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n\nIf you are looking for a challenge, Owlboy is not for you. [b]But if you are looking for a pleasant experience and you are into old-style adventure games, then you must try this one.[/b] Take a look at some screenshots and if you think you'll like it, don't think twice.

The art of the world and of the characters, I found very charming. The music was very nice. The story... eh, it did the job. But everything is buried under some of the worst gameplay design I have ever seen. I'm pretty impressed with myself that I stuck it out until the end, but now that I'm done, it's a huge relief. The story was enough to motivate me to continue and see what would happen next, but many sections of the game totally overshadowed any enjoyment I was getting.\n\nThe mechanics of combat are quite simple, and most fights were laughably easy. Then, suddenly, I'd be confronted with a boss that felt completely broken. Or a section with swarming enemies that you had no realistic way of fighting without getting hit. Getting hit is supposed to be something you avoid in games, granted, but in this game, it knocks you out of the air, stuns you, and makes you drop your companion. It's really easy to get stun locked in certain fights, and it is completely maddening. There were times that I felt totally unable to avoid damage, then I'd have to jump, press up to hover, hit LB until the right companion came up, all while avoiding insanely fast attacks. Like, I enjoy challenging games, but many of these fights were just stupid. There are many QOL fixes I would recommend to avoid this incredibly frustrating combat style. It doesn't add challenge, it's just poor design. It feels janky and unintuitive.\n\nNear the end of the game, the gameplay devolves into non-flight platforming. Sure, I was happy to not have to fight anymore. But then I get to this part where you leap onto disappearing little boulders, which should have been simple, but I had to retry this part like 25 times, because you have to be near-perfect with the timing, and the controls conspire to dump you into the abyss. Why would you include this in your game? There's also a section where you're stuck in almost total darkness, which removes the visual appeal which would actually keep the game interesting. Just... so many weird choices from a game design standpoint.\n\nI really wanted to like it, but I honestly don't see how this mess of a game gets the praise it does. Just avoid it. If the art interests you, watch it on youtube, because the gameplay will make you want to toss your controller across the room. Like I said, it's not \"challenge\", it's poor design and bad controls that ruined this completely for me. Oh, and as an extra kick in the teeth, I had gotten to the ending area after the final boss, paused the game to answer a text, and when I went to resume, the game had locked up on me. After restaring it sent me all the way back to before the final fight. That was the last damn straw. I almost gave this a recommend with caveats, since it did still compel me (somehow) to play all the way through, but you know what?

And the coins,give you a awesome cape that gives you enhanced abilities,aside from the ongoing story of the merchant who \"gives\" you the cape.\n\nOverall ,its one of these rare games where its well written,made with affection and has basically no flaws.

There are some serious faults that arise once you enter the second half of the game. The main issues at hand are as follows:\n\n-The Floating Continent's Jungle Boss has a swinging arm attack that does not telegraph its range well.\n-The Molten Floating Continent's enemy gauntlet takes place above a lava pit (instant death) with solid platforms. There's an unfair mechanic I've only witnessed here where if an enemy latches onto Otus, you will drop through the platform. This doesn't happen anywhere else and makes the presence of the platforms redundant. It would make more sense if the platforms deteriorate after Otus is slammed against them once.\n-Mesos' boss is trial-and-error when it comes to figuring out its trajectory. The sequence that follows after its defeat needlessly messes with your controls.\n-The upgrade trinkets are uninteresting and do not really provide any substantial benefit. Three of them boost health (useful, but boring), three of them are COSMETIC HATS THAT ARE LOST UPON HIT (and you can't even recover them if they fall off!), Geddy's range upgrade is lackluster, Alphonse would be better off with a cooldown for his attack, and Twig gets...nothing.\n-The final upgrade that provides a worthwhile use requires playing quite possibly the WORST minigame ever: the Boguin Cannon. What you deal with there involves unexpected, incredibly frustrating physics-based controls not seen elsewhere, lack of quick restarts, and the inability to progress despite making failures. While I do get that the last upgrade provides a major boost, it should not be so aggravating to the point that one should resort to CHEATING (by way of keyboard macros) to get it.

(This can ruin the atmosphere for a lot of scenes if you're impatient)\n-Poorly placed respawn areas forcing you to rewatch dialogues (some are skippable, some aren't). This is especially bad at this one fight where there are dialogues mid-fight.\n-Way too many repetitive stealth sections taking up the total playtime, which is explainable since there is only a total of 3 or 4 enemies you can actually kill with your gunners.\n-The rest of the game\n\nI felt like there are more cons, but it might be because all of these terrible design choices stacked up and really made it an overall unpleasant experience. Immersion is impossible because you have to constantly dodgeroll to get anywhere, which leads to the story feeling very mediocre and the characters hard to be attached to. \n\n3/10 ( -1 for charging $24.99)", "timestamp_created": 1523670409, "timestamp_updated": 1523670625, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466576755046844482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41469778": {"recommendationid": "41469778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111525856", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1523658602}, "language": "english", "review": "Owl boy is fun, until it isn't fun at all.

The art is well crafted with wonderful detail.  Each place and scene feels real and unique, and displays the tone of the environments well.  \n\nThis game combines beautiful art and music with well crafted gameplay and level design to create a wonderful story.  The characters have wonderful depth, and the world is believable, easily sucking you in.\n\nThe gameplay itself is well paced, never wearing itself thin, while also lingering around enough to give you a satisfactory taste of what it has to offer.  The level design does a fantastic job at teaching and guiding without feeling pushy or blunt.\n\nWhat I really love about the levels were the dynamic range of styles.  Most areas are a good balance between simple puzzles and tougher enemy encounters, but some were more stealth based, or more action packed.  All areas felt unique, but none ever felt out of place.  This is especially true with the pirate infiltration.  It's a true stealth sequence which seems strange for such a game, but it feels true to what the game is as a whole.\n\nThe story is crafted in a beautiful way, being both simplistic yet deep.  Otis is a lovable character who has so much charm and personality.  In spite of him never stating a word of dialogue, you know who he is, and what he stands for.  Otis' friends also show wonderful personality, each one unique to the others, and yet completing each other in a beautiful way.\n\nThe music also needs a special round of applause, being near the top of my list of the best soundtracks to date.  The mix of orchestral and electronic bridge the gap of pixel and modern art, and the tone of each piece captures the essence of each moment perfectly.\n\nOver all, this is a game worth picking up.  If you enjoy story driven games with solid gameplay at its back, this is a good game for you.  For the 8-10 hours this game offers, you'll be invested through them all.

Si, con varios peros.\n\nEmpecemos por sus puntos fuertes, el primero de todos su apartado gr\u00e1fico, un 2D de sprites que recuerdan al estilo de Metal Slug, que no es poca comparaci\u00f3n. En general, muy logrados, de lejos lo mejor del juego.\nSegundo vendr\u00eda la historia, con un gran pero al final, y es que para tratarse del motor principal de avance del juego, ya que para ser un metroidvania se nos deja muy poca libertad mientras la trama se desarrolla, el final  resulta insatisfactorio, lo que es una pena. Hace falta acceder a unos hologramas que nos narran partes importantes, y sin ellos el resultado final es decepcionante, como m\u00ednimo.\nEso si, cuando la historia funciona lo hace estupendamente, con un variado elenco de personajes (aunque hecho de menos m\u00e1s figuras femeninas) y una sorprendente emotividad en en tono general de lo que se nos cuenta. Al menos yo me sent\u00ed conectado emocionalmente a ellos, lo que por desgracia hace la resuluci\u00f3n a\u00fan m\u00e1s dolorosa.\n\nLo malo es que como la jugabilidad en mi humilde opini\u00f3n va un poco justa, no me interesa finalizarlo 100% ni buscar esa piezas de historia que faltan. Una verdadera l\u00e1stima.\nComo digo los controles y mec\u00e1nicas funcionan bien un 75% de las veces, pero el 25% que no resulta molesto. No necesariamente frustrante porque el juego no es dif\u00edcil, pero incordia m\u00e1s de lo que debiera.\nOtra cosa menos evidente, debido a que el juego nos lleva de la mano durante varias horas por su fuerte foco narrativo es que no dispone de mapa de ning\u00fan tipo, ni global ni mini, lo que para un Metroidvania es no solo una rareza sino un error garrafal. Hasta que descubres que su omisi\u00f3n obedece a un intento de esconder la corta duraci\u00f3n del t\u00edtulo y lo peque\u00f1as que son en realidad las zonas explorables. Sin mapa, todo parece mucho m\u00e1s ca\u00f3tico y amplio de lo que es en realidad, por lo que volver a pasar por zonas finalizadas es artificialmente tedioso.\n\nLa m\u00fasica cumple sin alardes.\n\nAs\u00ed pues, Owlboy es un juego que comienza muy fuerte y que se deshincha en su tramo final, convirtiendo su mayor punto fuerte, la historia, en su punto m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil. \nDe todas formas, si os gustan los plataformas con un poco de exploraci\u00f3n, los gr\u00e1ficos 2D retro y el estilo art\u00edstico os llama la atenci\u00f3n dadle una oportunidad.", "timestamp_created": 1523300412, "timestamp_updated": 1523300544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41372024": {"recommendationid": "41372024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011251122", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 844, "last_played": 1523228766}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've played in a while.

The pixel art is all high quality, and there's a lot of depth added to the scenery with all of the movements in both the foreground and background. I, for one, am 100% here for hi-bit games becoming more popular - especially when they look like this. The soundtrack is also criminally underrated. I'd say it compares to a ghibli soundtrack, but with less instruments. The smaller amount of instruments does not take away from its ability to elicit strong emotions, either, which is a mark of great composing. Jonathan Geer deserves more attention for this soundtrack.\n\nThe only thing that can be a little iffy at times is gameplay. There's a bug floating around where if you enter the menu for control settings while using a controller, the button mapping will get a little wonky. Right trigger will spin you as well as have whoever you're carrying shoot, which results in you dropping your companion. This can be a bit annoying sometimes, however, it's not annoying enough for me to not enjoy this game to the fullest. Especially since this issue is remedied on my machine by simply unplugging the controller and plugging it back in. Otherwise, this game is a good difficulty level. Its a bit higher than I'm used to, but that's simply because I don't play many platformers that are actually challenging. For this game, the challenge is more than welcome. Level design is interesting, and I like the designs of both the characters and the enemies.\n\nOverall, I love this game.

I wanted to wait for a sale to buy it, but luckily I didn't have to.\n\nHoooo boy, this is difficult ...\n\nIs Owlboy a good game? Yes, kinda. What's bothering me? The same things that always make me dislike a game even when I beat it: The controls.\n\nI don't know who on earth thought it'd be a great idea to put jumping, starting flying, and flying upwards on A SINGLE KEYBIND. But I am fairly sure that person has never used a keyboard for anything other than writing. And with my XBox Controller out of comission (served me for several years, survived Dark Souls I & III, rest in piece!), Keyboard n Mouse was what I had left for this game.\n\nIt's not a pretty control scheme. And the \"Dodgeroll\" really isn't all that great for dodging. Oh, and it's also the key you hold down for flying faster when flying in a straight line.\n\nYes, this game has some serious issues with keybindings.\n\nMy serious gripe with that side, though?\n\nThe story has a nice pace, albeit maybe a bit too quick in certain parts. There's nothing that really outstays its welcome, which is great. The ending is kinda ... well, it's the same as with every game ... if the NPCs had just bothered EXPLAINING their plan, but whatever. It's an okay ending, it's a bit on the sad side, it's also kinda heroic. The story is well done, and the english text as well as the german local is very nicely done. Overall, the story is good.\n\nAs for the meat of the game ... there is plenty of hidden stuff, some collectibles explain background story (special, large mdeals that you set into monuments to learn more about the past, some collectibles get you cosmetics and power-ups from the Buccanery's Store (You gather Buccanery coins, and the more you have the more upgrades and cosmetics she gives you). There's not that much extra content outside of the story, but if you like going hunting for secrets and treasures, there's probably another two hours of content in this.\n\nOverall, this game is probably around 10 hrs long, maybe slightly longer, but a single playthrough shouldn't take you more than 15 hrs.\n\nIf it is worth the money, that is up to you. I definetly think the Studio deserves their money. I'm not the biggestest fan of \"pixel art\", but I can see the appeal, and it has a certain charm.\n\nI'm more interested what else they'd think of, story-wise, if they got enough money.\n\nI think if you can get it on sale for 10-15 bucks, this is definetly worth picking up.

Are there giant robots? Yes there are.\n\nCliche, however, is not the problem. Heart is. \n\nWhoever made this has a lot of heart. They wanted to make a game that has a lot of heart. They want us to cheer for and weep for our characters. They want it bad.  \n\nIn short: This game is extensively melodramatic. \n\nOwlboy is probably going to run you less than ten hours, but in that time the developer tries to establish truly strong relationships. It would take a mighty feat of storytelling to do this. And, in some places, D-Pad studios succeeds.\n\nBut, mostly not. I felt yanked around narratively.\n\nThere are other caveats that should be mentioned. \n\nThe controls are stifling. Never before has flying been so frustrating. As soon as I discovered dodging I felt the need to spam it constantly. Because, unlike flying, dodging is responsive. I tried not to. I hate actions that make an experience more... gamey, but I rolled my way through most of this thing. Kinda like Dark Souls.\n\nYou know what else is like Dark Souls? Dying and being launched back to the beginning of a puzzle or fight (Some of which can be long). Being forced to watch parts (you can skip most) of cutscenes again. There were times where I needed to put the controller down. \n\nDifficult sections never succeeded at platforming, and the controls (and poor floppy Owlboy) made me want to scream.\n\nSo, why the recommendation? \n\nBecause this is a work of art. Not a great piece of gameplay. \n\nNo amount of tactile or literary failings could change the soul of this game.\n\nFrom the gorgeous art stylings to the soppy storyline, this is special. Whoever made this clearly had a dream. Every bit of this thing oozes personal-touch. And though I am predisposed to not liking it, I walked away from the ending with a smile.\n\nYes, issues. \n\nYes, worth it. \n\nThere is some true beauty here.\n\n*Edit* 4/1/18\n\nThere is something worth noting in the music.

It feels like a game right out of my childhood, something I would've played on my GameBoy Advance as a kid. The fact that this game also had me nearly in tears on multiple occassions, a talent not many games are able to do, speaks volumes for its story and characters.\n\nI fully enjoyed my time playing Owlboy. The bosses were a little intense at times, especially toward the end, but the rest of the experience was absolutely delightful and heartbreaking all in one neat little package. This is a story where the villan will change, and the ending will twist and surprise you. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll hopefully enjoy this game just as much as I did.\n\nYou play as Otus, a mute owl outcast shunned by his own mentor and neighbors, on a quest with his friends to save their floating island home from pirates. Along the way there are upgrades to buy, coins to find, puzzles to solve, a minigame to beat, and an open world to explore for secrets. Everything about this story is unlikely, from the characters you meet to the relationships they form with each other, and I [i]loved[/i] it. \n\nThe storyline was heartwrenching. There are happy moments, [spoiler]but not many happy resolutions to the main conflicts[/spoiler], and that's something most games like this won't do. You know a game is good when you start to tear up after [spoiler]one of the villain's henchmen realizes too late he wants to change his ways, and dies[/spoiler]. There are many moments that bring a tear to your eye, even ones you wouldn't expect. This was a beautiful and amazing experience I wish I could forget just so I could play it again.\n\nThe music is beautiful, the graphics - though pixelated - are still engaging and wonderful to look at. There were times I forgot it was even a pixelated game, because the world is just so vibrant and gorgeous to look at. The mechanics are strange at first but once you get used to them everything runs very smoothly. I play on an Xbox controller and mainly had issues with the lock-on aiming system and flying when I meant to jump. The puzzles and boss fights were never so hard I couldn't figure them out, at least with a bit of trial and error.\n\nIf you love games in this art style, if you want the best nostalgia trip you'll ever find, or if you love owls like I do, absolutely play this game.

Directional Influence meanwhile, (up on your joystick) only enables the same ability - and far less consistently.

From its gripping and fast-paced story, to interesting characters, to unique and engaging gameplay, to beuatiful artwork and locations, there's a lot to love in Owlboy.\n\nThe absolute best thing about Owlboy is its story. I don't want to spoil it for anybody that hasn't yet experienced it, but I will say that Otus (the main character) is a flawed character that tries his hardest to do what he can to help, but in the end it's questionable if he's actually the hero. Owlbody explores a story that very few storytellers try to tell, and it works perfectly here.\n\nAside from the story's artisitc merits, the game is well-paced with an engaging story. Cutscenes are neither too short or too long and are spaced the perfect amount between gameplay sections. What this leads to is a constant feeling of progression and engagement in the game. Cutscenes are also enjoyable due to the great cast of quirky characters. The only downside is that this is not a long RPG, so there is no time for any real character development outside of the main character, but even without that, I still felt an attachment to most of the characters and the lesser characters are funny and charming.\n\nA good story can't stand on its own without good gameplay though, and Owlboy delivers that. The gameplay feels fresh and unique, borrowing elements from platformers and twin-stick shooters. Exploration is fun with some light puzzles and combat, although the game is quite linear with the only thing off the beaten path are some coins that are used for upgrades, but you'll get all of the upgrades without spending forever searching for fake walls. I think where the gameplay really shines is in the boss fights, which feel quite numerous and none are alike. They're also where any of the challenge in the game lies, as the exploration sections are quite relaxed. Boss fights feel intense, but aren't overly challenging. I think I died to most of them, but once you get them down, none of the fights last that long honestly.\n\nAll-in-all, Owlboy is a very solid package. With its unique and engaging story to its gameplay that feels like its own combined with beautiful visuals as you can see in screenshots above, the complaints I have of the game aren't enough to take away from Owlboy's solid core elements. The game feels a little short with it taking me 6.5 hours to finish, but they were a solid 6.5 hours and I never felt disengaged or bored. The secret areas for 100% coin completion don't lead to any meaningful reward and require you to either use a guide or to go to every previously visited area and literally bump your head against every wall to see which one you can pass through. It could have really used more visual clues for hidden paths. The final cutscene leaves you with questions that you are supposed to answer by reloading your save after the credits, which is strange, but it actually ties into the story of the game.\n\nThe biggest hurdle for anybody interested in this game will be the $25 price tag. I can't answer for you if that's too high a price to pay for a 6.5 hour game, but not every experience should be evaluated by its price per hour.

At first the game looks like a platformer, but here's the thing, you can fly right from the start. So there's almost no platforming except for the last level, which I liked much better then the rest of the game. The game comes down to this, fly around, shoot stuff, pickup object/push button, go to the next room. There are also some action sequences where you have to run from something and avoid the obstacles in your path and some stealth missions. Those two things add some variety to gameplay, but it's not enough, 'cause as soon as this is over you're back at the core gameplay. \n\nThe story doesn't feel fresh either. You're playing as an owl boy named Otus, his village gets attacked by pirates and your goal is to gather your friends, find ancient relics, stop pirates and save the world. I think it's an okay story for a videogame. What I didn't like about this story is that it explains too much for the player, as a result you get constant gameplay interruptions. Play for more than 10 minutes and you get a long cutscene with characters talking about things that would seem obvious to anyone who ever played a videogame/watched a movie/read a book. \n\nLike I said before this game is all about the artstyle.

I was blown away at the visuals and storytelling this game had even in the beginning with the tutorial. Although the game looks nice I can't say the same for how it plays. Don't get me wrong it doesn't play terrible, it's just a little bit... Inefficient. Moving around feels alright for the most part especially with rolling. The only downside to the movement is the screen. Instead of it moving with your character it treats each section like a different level making it feel less fluent and causing a lot of issues along the way. The other gameplay mechanic that bothered me was using your partners. The lock on mechanic I feel is necessary. However, sometimes it would lock onto a lamp when swarms of enemies are closing in on both sides making the level more difficult than it should be. Swapping between partners was a great concept but I feel it was executed a little poorly. Transitioning from one partner to the other was ok until it required you to swap between them rapidly to solve a puzzle or to fight a boss. Overall it was a wonderful experience.

Okay story. Fun characters. That's about it for the pros of this game.\n\nThe cons...\n\nDang it ! This game is so frustrating ! \n\nGrabing your friends for them to attack is a good idea, but the execution is a total mess. When you are already holding onto your friend, you cannot grab other items. That makes sense, yes, but in a game, this makes everything slow. When you have to do this every so often to solve many puzzles, this gets boring very fast. \n\nWhenever you get a slap on your cheek ( literally ), you drop your friend, and you fly away like you've been hit like a huge truck on the highway. You have to teleport-grab your friend again before being able to attack again ! And if you are close to a wall, you get stunned on the wall and you slowly drop downward, until you push the jump-button again.\n\nWhen you are walking on the floor and want to call your friend to attack... You can not ! Because your friend only wants to get grabbed when you are flying ! Not when you are walking ! \n\nThat makes sense, but in a video game, I don't want to jump, fly, grab my friend and then attack.\nIt should be like that : \"Call friend, poof, you're flying and attacking in one push of a button !\" Not all this mess like you're trying to enter a cheat code in a Konami Game.\n\nIt makes everything so slow and sluggish ! And because of that, I can not recommend this game. \nGraphics are stunning, music is memorable, the story is fine ( though, the last part with the main villain is a joke ), but if the gameplay mechanics are bad, it doesn't matter how beautiful Owlboy is, it's still a frustrating experience and I consider it a bad game.\n\nTo be honest, I don't understand why so many people call that a masterpiece. Like, did you play other platformers, metroidvania or whatever 2D games that came out this past year ? Or even in your life ? Like a Super Mario or a 2D Castlevania from the 90s ?

El pixelart y los dise\u00f1os molan mucho. El unico problema en este apartado es que una vez estas dentro de una zona, las diferencias entre cueva1 y cueva2 es si una es cuadrada o rectangular. No hay diferencias entre las diferentes partes de un nivel. \nEso, al menos para mi, hace que me perdiese mucho y no supiera dond tenia que ir. Por ejemplo en el barco pirata no me di cuenta que habia vuelto al principio hasta que vi la posicion de varios enemigos. Es mas bien un punto a mejorar.\n\nJUGABILIDAD\n\nEn la jugabilidad solo me voy a quejar de una cosa: cuando llamas a un aliado cuando estas en el suelo lo spawneas justo al lado. ESo hace que en bosses, cuando te golpean y te tiran al suelo, acabas vulnerable ya que te tienes que levantar y despues coger al aliado. Si al llamar a un aliado estando en el suelo Otus volase cogiendo al enemigo automaticamente seria mejor. \nOtro inconveniente es que el mechero de Alphonse no se activa si tienes la explosion activa. Intentar quemar una liana y tiras la explosion. Es como si al usar a Twig cuando fueses a tirar una telara\u00f1a hiceras el dash.\n\nNARRATIVA\n\nEsto sera extenso. Lo primero, si hubo una civilizacion enorme de buhos porque ahora solo hay un pueblo y una ciudad? Cuando destruyen Advento (ciudad), Vellie (pueblo) es el unico lugar con habitantes. Ademas, se esta destruyendo todo el planeta y ni los hombres palo ni las otras razas (QUE YO SUPONGO QUE VELLIE Y ADVENTO NO SON LAS UNICAS POBLACIONES DEL MUNDO) les importa. Nadie hace acto de presencia. \n\nAdvento aun, pero Vellie es que no es ni pueblo. Yo lo llamaria union de 4 casas. Si hubiesen mas casas y gente random, cuando iban a destruir Vellie me hubiese dado mas pena. Pero claro, recuerdo que Vellie son dos casas y media y me la suda.\n\nEl personaje de Asio esta HORRIBLEMENTE llevado. Al principio es un professor exigente. Despues te envia a una mision (que podria haber ido el y Otus y Geddy ir a avisar a Advento), la fallas y te odia. Pasas gran parte del juego donde Asio dice que no te quiere ni ver y MAGICAMENTE le das pena y te da un abrazo. \n\nOtro personaje mal llevado es Solus. La cosa es que Solus decide hacer el Antiritual sin decirle NADA a Otus. Es mas, prefiere pelear contra Otus antes de contarle que es el Antiritual. Porque tendria que decirle algo a Otus? Al final del juego SOLUS le dice a Otus que el siempre fue su unico amigo. SU UNICO AMIGO Y EN VEZ DE CONTARLE QUE ES EL ANTIRITUAL PREFIERE PELEAR.\n\nEntiendo que el Bucle sea algo secreto (a lo mejor contenidos extra como las 3 monedas coleccionables lo explican) pero yo he acabado el juego y sigo sin saber que es. Una cosa es dar la idea de misterio sobre la antigua civilizacion de buhos y otra cosa es acabar el juego sin saber que esta pasando. De repente Solus te habla de el BUCLE y en la siguiente escena acaba el juego. \n\nPor ultimo en el barco pirata vemos a Alphone hablando con Dirk y yo ahi pense, Alphonse les traiciona. PERO NADA. No se vuelve a mencionar. Hubiese sido un buen plotwist.\n\nPor ultimo Malstorm, Mira que el dise\u00f1o mola un huevo y tiene una fuerza increible, pero que no pelees contra el... Antes de pelear contra Solus hubiese preferido una batalla contra Malstorm.\n\n\nRESUMEN:\nEl juego me parece increible. El unico punto negativo es la historia. Todo lo otro, jugabilidad y dise\u00f1o, me parece brutales.", "timestamp_created": 1519383973, "timestamp_updated": 1519383973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40317031": {"recommendationid": "40317031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038733116", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1519351413}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy crap was this a ride. \n\nThis game has endless amounts of charme and it's showing in every nook and cranny: The characters, music, artstyle, dialogue, story and atmosphere. The story was a lot more complex than it wants you to think it is and it did a phenomenal job in suprising me and pulling at my heartstrings. No spoilers here. The world is really damn interesting and mysterious and damn do i love it, not just because I'm a sucker for owls. The dialogue was really silly at times making me grin from ear to ear especially since it was so well supported by the animation, (comedic) timing of soundeffects and other effects like shaking of the screen (this counts for all of the other dialogue as well). The music is top-notch and gives the perfect feel for every phase of the game the player finds himself in, sometimes snuffing itself out when the atmosphere would be better off supported by complete silence except for maybe the footsteps of the protagnoist, echoing through the massive halls of an ancient civilization.

Veamos:\n\n[h1]Lo bueno[/h1]\n\n[list]\n      [*]La m\u00fasica\n      [*]El arte y la animaci\u00f3n\n      [*]La historia y su narraci\u00f3n\n      [*]Las mec\u00e1nicas de juego: son f\u00e1ciles de entender y no demasiadas, en ning\u00fan momento vas a no saber qu\u00e9 hacer.\n      [*]Los controles: est\u00e1n perfectamente ejecutados y a los minutos de estar jugando te har\u00e1s a ellos y los usar\u00e1s de forma inconsciente (como deber\u00eda ser)\n      [*]Los personajes\n      [*]La duraci\u00f3n\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Lo malo[/h1]\n\n[list]\n      [*]La dificultad: el juego no est\u00e1 del todo bien balanceado. Hay partes que son muy dif\u00edciles, y eso est\u00e1 bien, es un juego relativamente exigente, y no llega a lo injusto en ning\u00fan momento. Mi problema son las batallas finales. Los bosses al final se resumen en morir tres veces, encontrar el exploit y aprovecharlo. Ejemplo: quedarse en una esquina mientras ataca, y cuando deje de hacerlo disparar. Repetir. \n\n          Ahora bien, el juego sabe esto, y por eso a\u00f1ade una segunda fase del monstruo que evita de todas las formas que puede que te pongas en la esquina. \u00bfSi los desarrolladores saben que pr\u00e1cticamente todos los ataques de la fase uno se evitan de la misma forma, por qu\u00e9 no lo evitan? \u00bfC\u00f3mo es que las partes normales llegan a ser tanto m\u00e1s dificiles que los jefes finales?\n\n          Hay una de las batallas, en cambio, que me parece maravillosa. (Sin spoilers). Si descubres c\u00f3mo explotar la mec\u00e1nica pertinente, la batalla se convertir\u00e1 en un espect\u00e1culo a todos los niveles. Sin perder toda su dificultad, consigues encontrar la manera de evitar la muerte usando cierto arma, y entonces la lucha se convierte en un baile perfecto, en una coreograf\u00eda violenta y coordinada, r\u00e1pida y certera. Es incre\u00edble. S\u00f3lo por eso merecer\u00eda la pena el juego.\n\n          Entonces llegamos al segundo punto:\n\n      [*][b]El final:[/b] Mucho plot-twist, s\u00ed. Pero, \u00bfqu\u00e9 hay del destino?\n\n          Este es el momento en el que si no has jugado el juego a\u00fan y sigues leyendo, tal vez quieras dejar de hacerlo ahora. No son grandes spoilers, pero s\u00ed pistas.\n\n          La parte final de Owlboy me decepcion\u00f3 en gran medida. No me arrepiento en absoluto de haberlo jugado, me encant\u00f3, y adem\u00e1s lo importante es el viaje, no el final. El juego te cuenta una historia entera maravillosa, la hila a la perfecci\u00f3n y luego: \u00a1Zas! La corta por la mitad y te dice \"\u00a1Ah\u00e1! \u00a1Esa no te la esperabas! \u00bfEh?\". Y en efecto, probablemente no lo hicieras. La batalla final es algo totalmente inpredecible, y a\u00fan no siendo una mala, no tiene grandes mec\u00e1nicas aparte de obligarte a usar todo lo que tienes. Se queda muy atr\u00e1s en comparaci\u00f3n con las otras, y eso ya es decir. Y m\u00e1s en comparaci\u00f3n a la anteriormente destacada, a mi parecer. \n\n         Lo que m\u00e1s me molesta de este cap\u00edtlo final es la falta de destino. Desde el principio sabes que la batalla final va a pasar, te intentas imaginar c\u00f3mo ser\u00e1, imaginas que ser\u00e1 horriblemente dificil debido a la potencia de tu adversario, incluso te da miedo. Y entonces, Owlboy te lanza el gui\u00f3n a la cara y su \"\u00a1Sorpresa!\", despu\u00e9s de todo, acaba convertido en un \"\u00a1Pues te fastidias!\".\n\n          El pr\u00f3logo deja muchos cabos sueltos, quiz\u00e1 para dejar el final abierto a una secuela, pero no insin\u00faa que vaya a haberla. La historia es autoconclusiva pero a la vez... No. Te deja con preguntas, pero no necesariamente con ganas de m\u00e1s.\n\n[/list]\n\n[h1]En conlusi\u00f3n[/h1]\n\n         Si est\u00e1s dudando: ju\u00e9galo. En serio. Hazlo. Es una obra maestra. Vas a disfrutar cada detalle. Va a llenarte. Ju\u00e9galo, y hazlo hasta el final. Merece much\u00edsimo la pena, a pesar de todo.\n\n         Owlboy es definitivamente uno de mis juegos favoritos por todo lo que ofrece. Lo volver\u00eda a jugar tres veces m\u00e1s y ser\u00eda un placer, y probablemente lo volver\u00eda a disfrutar como la primera vez. \n\n         Mi m\u00e1s sincera enhorabuena a los integrantes de D-Pad Studios, que les cost\u00f3 tant\u00edsimo tiempo terminar esta obra de arte. \n\n        Ah, por cierto, s\u00ed, se juega muy bien con mando. Y ahora lo ten\u00e9is tambi\u00e9n en la switch, as\u00ed que no s\u00e9 a que esper\u00e1is para darle ca\u00f1a.", "timestamp_created": 1518962104, "timestamp_updated": 1518962169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40188935": {"recommendationid": "40188935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406345812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1540, "last_played": 1620057862}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 \u0ca0v\u0ca0", "timestamp_created": 1518954241, "timestamp_updated": 1569931197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40175366": {"recommendationid": "40175366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119815591", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1518915022}, "language": "english", "review": "This game absolutely blew me away with its phenomenal gameplay and its heart warming and dare I say tear jerking story", "timestamp_created": 1518915224, "timestamp_updated": 1519057774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40169687": {"recommendationid": "40169687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038260614", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1518718827}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][u]TO SUM UP:[/u] Owlboy[/b] isn't perfect. It is however beautiful, emotional, heartfelt, moving, wonderfully made and \u2013 overall \u2013 a fantastic experience. If you somehow missed this one, I strongly suggest that you go ahead and give it a try.\n\n[b][u]FULL REVIEW:[/u] Owlboy[/b] is, above all, two things: it's the first hi-bit game I ever played and, more importantly, it's the game which made me fall in love with hi-bit games in general. Its world is absolutely astonishing, crafted with visible care and composed entirely out of pixels. Its characters are lovingly childish, yet well written and relatable; especially the game's silent protagonist, Otus, who \u2013 even though he is unable to say a single word (or rather to display a single word on screen) \u2013 is able to express his emotions better than many I know. Owlboy's music and sound design also play an incredibly important part since (following in the footsteps of old-school games which the hi-bit genre stems from) none of the characters are voiced. Fortunately, the game's musical themes are equally brilliant as the rest of it, providing emotional background where it's needed and creating an ambience that sometimes makes you feel like a small kid going on an adventure with your friends. Speaking of friends, I've never played a game able to depict friendship in the way Owlboy does. I often felt like the creators had succesfully tapped into some mysterious source of pure emotion and had simply decided to spill it all over this game. Simply put: Owlboy is a wonder. Although not all of it is sunshine and rainbows and some parts are incredibly frustrating and excrutiatingly painful as far as level design is concerned, I believe it to be a game able to charm anyone, provided they give it a chance and enough time.", "timestamp_created": 1518900114, "timestamp_updated": 1536878610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40168734": {"recommendationid": "40168734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126529586", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1518426308}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunatly the game is unplayable for me.

But it is a big one, as it prevented me from being able to enjoy what would otherwise be a good game. The game has a story interesting enough to draw me in, it may be geared toward children, but it was still good. That being said, most of the gameplay is not devoted to the story but the puzzles/combat. The puzzles were also simple, geared toward children, but no less enjoyable. The combat is my qualm with the game. I had to just put the game down and come back the next day because I got too frustrated with a particular fight I could not beat. I usually was only able to play for thirty minutes to an hour at a time before getting stuck as such. I got about seven total hours into Owlboy before I just simply had to quit all together, which is sad because I want to finish the story. The game has the difficulty of classic arcade games, which I was never good at. I enjoyed those games, but that is because being defeated by a difficult fight didn't stop progress in any way that mattered; other than bragging rights. In Owlboy, the difficulty prevents progress in the story. I felt the difficulty of the combat in this game ruined what would have otherwise been one of my favorite games of all time.\nThe game definitely deserves all the accolades it has received. The scenery is beautiful. The story is good. The music is pretty. For most people the combat is probably a welcome but not too great challenge.

Sadly, I am disappointed. There is a lot to appreciate in Owlboy, but all of it is superficial. Music is nice, the art is detailed and impressive. That much you can tell by looking at the screeshots. A lot of effort was put into the project, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t deliver and engaging experience. Art is nice, but isn\u2019t tied to anything engaging or fun.\n\nGameplay is the biggest weakness of Owlboy. How do you make a platformer interesting when you character can fly without limitations? Owlboy didn\u2019t find an answer for this question. You can move in any direction you want, for the most part without any restrictions. Flying isn\u2019t fun \u2013 there is no mechanic there, and movement is very slow and sluggish. Levels are dull, usually either completely open spaces, or tight corridors. Your movement doesn\u2019t get expanded at all throughout the gameplay. \n\nCombat is just as weak. Owlboy can\u2019t really fight to well, but he has buddies he can summon and carry, while they shoot. They differ from each other, but don\u2019t provide interesting gameplay and all are unsatisfying to \u201cuse\u201d. Gameplay wise you carry three boring guns, which you drop whenever you get hit. Early on there is some experimentation with enemies which can be hit only by certain characters, but the idea gets ditched very quickly. Overall, Owlboy loves to start introducing some gameplay ideas before ditching them completely after introduction.\nStory isn\u2019t engaging either. It tries to be more depressing than your usual colourful platformers, but it works just as well as a Mario game dealing with a cancer \u2013 its not fun, its not sad, just kinda weird and misplaced.\n\nOverall a weak, boring title.

It\u2019s enjoyable, but not much more. It\u2019s worth playing, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\n\nowlboy [/h1]\n\nOwlboy is definitely a well made game. Look at those graphics and that 10 year dev cycle. Those didn\u2019t go towards nothing, because there is a lot of polish in this game, especially in the graphics. It\u2019s got possibly the best pixel-art I\u2019ve ever seen. That works well for the sense of whimsical adventure it seems to be going for, and it succeeds! For like, an hour or so. Unfortunately, it slowly falls apart as you realize\u2026\n\n[h1] the gameplay\u2019s kinda boring [/h1]\n\nThis is really what kills the game, honestly. The flying mechanic is err...it\u2019s basically just being able to float in mid-air and move wherever you want. Just float. No sense of momentum, just one fixed speed, hovering in mid-air. That\u2019s kinda underwhelming, but clearly not what the game was about. It\u2019s about the sense of adventure from exploring the world, fighting baddies and enemies along the way! And...those are kinda boring, too. \n\nPuzzles are fun, but slow and easy, making progressing in the long term something of a bore. The mechanics are great when you\u2019re introduced to them, but slowly become frustrating over time. Combat is just a chore. The characters/weapons you have are particularly weak against the enemies. Owlboy isn\u2019t a particularly hard game, but it\u2019s definitely a frustrating one because the enemies are ludicrously spongy. You\u2019re just going to be floating around and clicking constantly on enemies, occasionally moving about to dodge attacks. Or using [i]that[/i] character near the end of the game.\n\n[h1] and the level design isn\u2019t particularly good [/h1]\n\nEven if we\u2019re ignoring the rather linear world, the level design still isn\u2019t that good. There\u2019s something I can\u2019t quite pinpoint about why I think the level design isn\u2019t good, but I\u2019ll give it a shot. It\u2019s like...err, A Link to The Past, but if it somehow ended up in a side scroller. It doesn\u2019t get particularly far with both types of levels.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a pretty bad analogy, but look at a dungeon of Owlboy. Look at how there isn\u2019t a very large sense of verticality. There\u2019s almost always a set roof about one or two screens upwards. Walls close in on the player, restricting their movement. The flying ability means that Owlboy plays out like ALTTP, but if it also had gravity and platforming. The compromises Owlboy has to take to allow for the top-down gameplay in a side-scroller level don\u2019t allow for either styles to shine through. Even when it does stick to a single style, most of the time that\u2019s offset by the fact that it\u2019s a side-scroller, and one that gravity basically doesn\u2019t affect you in.\n\nEven then, most of the time the game just becomes super duper long linear lines of rooms with a random puzzle here and there or is spent in the \u201copen\u201d world.\n\n[h1] so basically [/h1]\n\nI kinda feel bad because I want to love this game, and I do see the spirit and polish in it. Hell, despite my negativity, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad or even mediocre game; it\u2019s good, but that alone isn\u2019t enough for me to say [i]\"hey, you should go play owlboy.\"[/i] I\u2019ve been itching for the same sense of adventure and wonder the N64 Zelda games had. I guess that\u2019s a super high bar to set. The thing is, I think that Owlboy actually manages to beat that bar. It then immediately trips over that bar.\n", "timestamp_created": 1518058466, "timestamp_updated": 1518058466, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496740847826004028", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39920902": {"recommendationid": "39920902", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992234603", "num_games_owned": 1796, "num_reviews": 367, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1686519347}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was annoyingly fun until the point it just became plain annoying.\n\nOwlboy is a psuedo platformer. Psuedo as in you mostly fly, but some parts you're forced to run and jump. I heard it called a Metroidvania, but I wouldn't really classify it as such. Just becuase you make a game that requires players to backtrack over old levels just to get a few more unlocks. That's not really what a Metroidvania is. IMHO I feel that a Metroidvania is more about exploration, open style worlds, letting players find things for themselves, and building a story loosely based off the path each player takes. Sure, there are parts of progression held back, but it's up to the player to find and conquer each area.\n\nOwlboy would be better described as an NES Metal Gear/Strider style game. There's tonnes of dialogue. So much so that you'll spend about half your time reading text boxes. There's no real exploration. Aside from the occational hidden area, the game is linear. It's true certain parts of levels are gated off until you get a new ability and yes, you do get abilities. But these aren't found, they're part of the narrative. Also there's much more flying around than straight platforming.\n\nSo all that to say I actually think the game does better than a standard Metroidvania. It steps out from the formula and tries something new. The graphics remind me of NeoGeo style art. Every pixel has a purpose. You can tell the art team enjoyed their jobs. There's a real cohesion to the art as a whole. Every new level feels new and unquie.\n\nThe part I do have a problem with is the controls. To fly you have to hit jump them up on the analoge stick. Or hit jump twice. But you can't be holding up and jump to fly. You have to not hold up, hit jump, then hit up. If you're holding up first you won't take off. That means you either let go of up and hit up again or press jump again. OR if you're like me, you hold up, hit jump, see you're not flying, hit up again, start flying, hit jump again as a reflex, and stop flying. Doesn't happen a lot, execpt when you're in a tight spot, like a boss fight or a difficult area.... so annoying! I wish you could just hold up and hit jump.\n\nThen health is gained through eating fruit. Health can be in abundance or MIA for large portions of a level. You really never know. You can over heal yourself by about a bar and a half more health. Not sure why this is a feature other than the devs knew the health system was a little wack; so they put that in instead of trying to balance where you get health. Seriously, I finished a boss battle with a sliver of health left and had to play the game for 30 minutes until I died with no health ever showing up... so annoying! I wish they'd either have spent more design time or health placement OR just allow you to hold 1 piece of fruit for emergencies.\n\nOh! You get nothing for killing enemies btw. No health, no coins, no xp, no boosts, etc. So it's best to try and avoid all combat as it is meaningless to your progression. They just add to the annoyance.\n\nNow let's talk about the dialogue. I mentioned above that there's tonnes... Yup, so much talking! Expect the first 30 minutes of the game to just be text boxes. There's so much needless dialogue. I feel the writers thought it would be kind of cute and funny to drag out interactions. But at the end of the day I don't need 40 text boxes to introduce a character that I never actually needed to interact with in the first place (talking about you, cowardly soldier)! Also expect to play for 10 minutes then read for 5. That's about how it all breaks down. At the end of the day, some dialogue is nice, but this is just annoying! I wish they had either shortened the dialogue OR presented each interaction as one big paragraph; so I could skip it all if I wanted.\n\nSo what was the final straw for me? The blackout level. There's a level where you have basically no light. As an Owl, you carry people who help you. In this level you need to carry a big cyborg who has a lighter at the end of his gun. You need to do this just to see, but unfortunately you can't see where you are, just a small circle of light around a gun that's slightly lower and slightly ahead of your position. Okay cool, that doesn't sound super terrible.... Until they make you go through coridors that have spikes above and below you, that are just big enough for you and the cyborg to fit, that wind around in all different directions, oh yeah and they're enemies thrown in just to f' with you. \n\nI kept hitting spikes, not able to see where I was or even where the spikes were. Then I came out of that into some hornets nest. These guys follow you around and attack nonstop. I kept dying! I had half health coming out of the blackout area. So I bolted. I went past hornet nest after hornet nest, just dodging them all. I mean, it makes no difference if you kill enemies anyway. I took a turn and BAM! I was back in another pitch black area. More spikes all around, more of not seeing where you are, and now a horde of hornets hitting me from all angles unseen. \n\nYou know what?!

Certainly not, as titles like Inside or The Cat Lady will tell you. But melancholy must be managed carefully, lest it drag down a game in ways not intended. Owlboy is a game that would appear at first glance to be entirely outside such considerations, what with its bright graphics and lush environments. But the story woven through this story-driven adventure is one chock full of sadness and disappointment, and it\u2019s just as jarring as you\u2019re thinking. It might be forgivable, too, if the gameplay was half as compelling as the art.\n\nOtus is a young owl, living in the floating village of Vellie under the tutelage of the local master Asio. He\u2019s conveniently mute, which makes it all the easier for his perfectionist mentor to blame him for anything that goes wrong. And things go very wrong when pirates show up in their peaceful burg to nick an artifact of great power. Otus knows something is afoot and flaps off to stop the pirates, along with some pals he can carry along to help him out. The journey takes him to a massive aerial city, a forgotten stronghold of the ancient owl civilization, and further as he struggles to redeem himself and uncover the secrets of the pirate assault.\n\nAll of that should sound like the makings of a fine adventure, except that bit about being blamed for things. I wish I could downplay this aspect of the game but it\u2019s actually a cornerstone of the story, and something that soured me on the game right from the start. The opening tutorial is posed as Asio teaching Otus how to handle basic skills as an owl and help out around the village. But it\u2019s designed so that you\u2019ll fail everything you\u2019re instructed to do, and earn some withering disapproval from your mentor. That\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg though, as Otus ends up bullied by the other village residents, blamed for events he has no control over, discouraged from assisting during a crisis, and ignored when sharing information. Worst of all he gets guilt-tripped for a catastrophe where he was the only individual anywhere close to stopping it, and which proved to be absolutely inevitable.\n\nDoes that sound like a good time? Of course not. Talented storytellers know not to beat down their protagonists without some kind of hope or relief, but here there is neither. Just as I thought Otus was getting out from under all the pressure and assumptions about his competence, one of his friends turns on him. You spend an hour on the trail of a key item and keep it out of the hands of your foes, only for them to steal it away off-screen. For every step of your journey, someone is going to doubt you or discourage you or straight-up blame you for something out of your control. It starts out tiresome and only becomes moreso, and distracts mightily from what could otherwise be a pretty interesting story.\n\nThe gameplay at least provides a little levity from the ball and chain of the story, but only temporarily. As the titular owl-boy, Otus can fly freely across the airy realms and carry items to huck at enemies or drop on switches. He can also carry allies, and you\u2019ll meet up with three who provide useful attacks and powers for overcoming challenges along the way. Most of the game is spent puzzling your way to destinations, using switches or strange creatures to clear the way. There are enemies to fight, however, and while they start out simple enough they soon become greater annoyances than your mentor. Late-game enemies will swarm you, juggle you to death, and block attacks from the easiest angles. Their gimmicks are poorly telegraphed too, which can lead to some frustrating deaths just from trying to learn what they do. I lost entirely too much time to a group of monkeys in a lava cave because they moved swiftly and getting hit at all meant being bounced into magma and dying instantly.\n\nPut simply, nothing in Owlboy is designed even half as well as the art. Enemies move and attack too fast and can easily knock you into other hazards or deathtraps. Gimmicks like stealth sections or having to stay in the light have ill-defined rules and consequences. One of your key attacks is on an absurdly long cooldown and must be used to solve some common puzzles. The camera follows you until you reach the edge of an area and then waits for you to push past the transition, but enemies can hide off the edge and hit you before you see them. The list goes on and on, and after maybe four hours or so I was getting aggravated enough to quit for good.\n\nEven the exploration suffers from short-sighted design. As lush and detailed as the game world is, it proves to be very, very small. There\u2019s one village, a central hub area of wide-open vertical spaces, and pretty much just three large dungeons off of that. Backtracking in inevitable and sometimes the game will send you on detours just to kill time, like one teleporter that takes you back to the hub just to make you turn it back on so you can return to where you were. The themes of the game make it feel like it should be a grand journey across a sprawling world, but I never felt like I was going any significant distance, and the lack of a map made it hard to get a good picture of the world in my mind. There\u2019s not even much point to exploring either, because all you\u2019ll find are chests of coins and maybe one of three special tokens. You\u2019re not going to find any upgrades or powers or collectibles even, rendering this one a pale imitation of a metroidvania.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly distressing how much potential is lost here, especially in light of the game\u2019s magnificent aesthetic. The hand-drawn pixel art is incredibly detailed and lovingly animated, which gives the entire world so much depth and character. There\u2019s clearly a lot of thought put into the strange creatures and mysterious ruins you\u2019ll come across, which makes it all the more frustrating that the story and gameplay can\u2019t keep up. Owlboy feels like a trap, a game made to look warm and inviting that then slaps you around and ridicules you once you buy in. That awful intro set the stage for the further frustrations suffered throughout the game, and no amount of pretty art can make up for such offenses.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

It looks grainy and out of focus, but not in a good way.\n\nNot in a \"grainy sepia retro photography\" way or \"drawn excellently, then had selective portions rendered slightly blurry for effect\" way.\n\nJust in a \"I did the artwork in the most painful, slow, outdated method I could find that didn't involve grinding up rocks and mixing them with water\" way.\n\nBut the artwork is almost never what wins or loses my enthusiasm for a game. There's content and gameplay and controls that are far more important usually.\n\nThe controls are clunky and absolute crap. Want to aim that way? Alright, wait ten seconds while the dillhole you're carrying slowly re-aims to the opposite side of the screen, never mind the fact that you're being killed in three hits while you wait.\n\nSome of the time, when hitting the button for \"pick that idiot up\" (left trigger, on a control) he just won't be picked up. I wind up having to hit X to spin-attack him, then try again. This happens so that at least half the times I try to pick him up end this way.\n\nThe first boss fight you do has some interesting mechanics that make you think a little and use the things you've learned thus far, so that was good. But again, the controls are so clunky and lethargic. If you are running dual monitors, or have it in windowed mode, the cursor does NOT stay in the window, either. So that was another source of continuing irritation, having to alt-tab back into the game so whatever I was trying to dodge can hit me.\n\nAt one point, after having countless issues with the dual monitor setup, I decided to unplug the second monitor to hopefully eliminate the cursor leaving the full-screen window which launched on the monitor display (not the secondary monitor) and I left it there the entire time.\n\nRemoving the second screen that was causing the problem caused the game to crash entirely because it doesn't understand how to handle unrelated peripherals coming and going. (this was demonstrated regularly through the game, as it would toggle itself between keyboard/mouse and gamepad randomly withOUT anything being touched on the keyboard or unplugged).\n\nIncidentally, the game-crash from monitor removal was so severe, it wouldn't let me interact with the error, it wouldn't let me close it, close the game or alt-tab to another window. I had to attempt to log windows out so THAT would force-stop the game and it's error, and then cancel the log-out because I had unsaved stuff that prompted for actions.\n\nI've played worse games, I've played more infuriating games and I've played games with worse concepts. This game had a lot of potential but within an hour's gameplay, I couldn't imagine what would motivate me to WANT to play further. I don't even know if I'll bother launching it to get the rest of the cards while it idles in the background, I'm that turned off of this game. I really wanted to enjoy it, it looked interesting and turned into a poor execution so fast.

It started off so perfect. Controls were tight, story was liberating and provided depth most games fail to even come close to, but all this was short lived.\n\nI started to notice small things very quickly that I was trying to ignore, but couldn\u2019t. Things like boss fights being too easy or too stupid hard. Stupid hard meaning it\u2019s not a challenge, but more frustrating due to poor game play mechanics which causes one to die and die again only to respawn and try to figure out exactly what your suppose to do to beat the boss.\n\nSPOILER ALERT:\nI think the biggest issue I have with this game is its end board, boss, and ending. I don\u2019t agree with most people who say they love the ending. I think it makes no sense, fastly done, and a huge disappointment because it tries to do a complete 180 on the owl boys mentor. He\u2019s a complete jerk throughout the whole entire game and then all of a sudden is nice and caring for owlboy? Yeah right? If my mentor was like that I would seriously go tell him to pound sand.\n\nThe end board is a complete frustrating mess. The whole game your use to flying and use to the controls to overcome puzzles and platforming challenges. Then they take all away and provide poor platforming puzzles that cause you to get frustrated on figuring out how they work. I\u2019m sorry the spinning platforms your supposed to spin attack to move up and down don\u2019t work. I tried various things for consistency but ended up having to jump first and then spin attack them, and then only then did it work some of the time. I shouldn\u2019t have to spin attack in various points on the platform just to get the thing to move up? Is that some type of fun challenge in the game? I think not.\n\nAlso if your going to make the platforming hard, make it fun as well. Poor timing blocks that disappear quickly and leave you to guess where the next one will appear only to guess wrong and then have to start the whole thing over is dumb in my opinion. Other platforming games get this sort of thing right and help you learn from mistakes. This game just makes it really frustrating and punishes you along the way.\n\nLastly, the end boss twist is fine I guess, but so many times I got pumped to take on the Leader of the Pirates only to end up being let down for some cutscene happens and you ultimately never get to take on the captain of the pirates. Lame! Which reminds me. So many times a cut scene would happen and then all of a sudden I would take damage. Like the cut scenes blend into the game so well that sometimes your not sure when your suppose to start playing again and so you get punished with getting hit. That sucked too.\n\nSo that is my rant. Enjoy the first part of the game if you decide to play it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1517842600, "timestamp_updated": 1517842600, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39864716": {"recommendationid": "39864716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032512468", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 549, "last_played": 1517793311}, "language": "english", "review": "Great pixel art, cute story and charismatic characters.

It's linear, it's short (<10 hours to complete) but most of all it's just beautiful. From the aesthetics to the story, the world is well illustrated. I will note now that I did not 100% for the game as in finding all the coins, trinkets or such, but I have beaten the final boss.\n\nGameplay is straight forward, the difficulty isn't too high and I only got frustrated by two bosses. You don't need to be a grisled veteran of games like Megaman to win, but you do need to recognise some simple patterns and learn from your mistakes. The controls are not perfect, I was playing on my 360 wireless controller and there were a few occassions when the game let me down, especially with the aim locking and maneauvering with my third friend. There's nothing that's likely to make you want to snap the controller in half though.\n\nThe world design is a bit different. Everything is connected and it makes sense for a game with flight. Sometimes you will look a little bit for the objective as there is no arrow or other obvious sign pointing towards the next point, but the world is small enough you should remember where locations are. There's coins and secret walls to be found if you want to look for them, but this game is more about telling a story than exploring a world. The coins are used to unlock some items from a \"shop\" in the game, but apart from additional health they didn't make a noticeable difference (though I didn't unlock everything either).\n\nThe story is fairly straight forward to follow. I see some other reviews saying that some things aren't well explained, though most of it revolves around a previous society creating the technology so it's not necessarily meant to explain it all clearly. Enough to keep you interested and invested in the world, but not super deep that will make you analyse the story for hours on end. \n\nThe game is very well balanced between the aspects of gameplay, story and aesthetics. You won't find it to be revolutionary, the next big name and it may not even go down in the history of greatest games ever made, but it sets a goal and it delivers on that exceptionally well. There's a lot who may find the praise is overblown, but we are in an age of hyperbole and when something is really good it is amazing.

Owlboy is easily in my top three games of all time. I played through the entire game in about 6 hours and loved every minute of it, but I'm not done because I still haven't 100%'d the game. All that being said there are a number of things that I like and the pros heavily outweigh the cons. \n\n\nGoing into this game I purposely avoided any videos of playthroughs because I wanted to experience it myself and I'm so glad I did. The story is like something straight out of a Studio Ghibli film and I mean that in the best way possible. The imagination and detail put into this story is like something out of a child's mind; a child that graduated with a degree in creative writing. The characters are fantastic, there is a huge dynamic to everyone in the game that can change the way you feel about them in an instant. The orchestra contains no brass section meaning the game's music seems very light. The more tense music in the game is done with synthesizer or violin which might appeal to some but it's not my favorite choice; by no means am I saying I didn't enjoy the music in Owlboy though, the opposite is true with my favorite tracks being the Tropos day and Mesos themes. Tropos' theme inspires exploration and my only gripe is that leaving the area even for a moment gets rid of the music. Mesos, on the other hand, is this vast snowscape which also serves as a low point in the game for the characters, this is reflected in the piano giving you a colder tone but also the determination to fight on. The gameplay is fantastic (as most things in this game are). I played Owlboy on a keyboard/mouse setup and it's probably the only 2d \"platformer\" that feels natural on keyboard. The mouse allows for precision aiming which is important (especially with the 3rd character) and Owlboy himself flows quite smoothly. I like the idea that your character isn't a physical fighter himself, at least not to the point of wounding adversaries any harder than what is required to stun them. A couple of other small things like how Otus (the protagonist) is canonically mute makes my heart smile as it gives a justification for him being a silent protagonist. \n\n\nThere are a couple of things I openly disliked about the game, 2 specifically. The first thing is the bossfights; I liked the intensity of a couple of fights, but overall I thought they were lacking something. A great example of this is the last boss in the game whom you're supposed to defeat using each of your 3 supporting characters which is a great idea on paper; in practice this part is less impactful than expected, there's no noticable difference from swapping between the 3 characters in regards to how they affect the boss except that one of them does his part with one blast. I would've preferred for this fight to utilize the different mechanics of the three supporting characters and maybe allow Otus himself to deal the damaging blow as this to me would've been a more impactful and satisfying bossfight. \n\nThe second thing I didn't like was the fact that despite the world being \"decently sized\" it didn't feel as big as I think I would've wanted it to be. The biggest issue I had with this was near the earlier part of the game where the game gives you access to the capital city of the world you live in but most of the exploring for that part is done inside of a pirate ship. The city itself is destroyed before you can do anything about it but with you seeing almost none of this area it feels like a lot of wasted potential. I felt that this could've been remedied by maybe making it so that  the characters had to come back to the city after the carnage and could explore its ruins. I know Tropos functions as a central hub but I found myself wanting more out of it and not getting enough out of the stuff that was there. The things that were there just seemed thrown about in no particular order, sprinkle a couple of enemies over here, leave a few healing foods down here, etc. Functionally though, it gets the job done.\n\n\nIt is important to understand that even though I criticized these couple of points in great detail, I did so because these were legitamately the only 2 aspects of the game I could think of that I didn't wholeheartedly enjoy. I said at the beginning of the review that Owlboy is easily in my top 3 games of all time and I stand by that. It is one of the only games that has made me feel so much empathy for the characters that there was actually a point that I cried. Maybe that's because I'm a big baby but I like to think that it's due to fantastic storytelling and relatable characters. Owlboy is more than a game, it's a work of art; a beautiful work of art. A masterpiece. I've never played anything like it. I love this game.\n\n\nI give Owlboy a 9.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1517806443, "timestamp_updated": 1517808664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39858220": {"recommendationid": "39858220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061837984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 878, "last_played": 1529171593}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10\n\nThis game is a must play.

I love the artwork, I love the quirky characters, I love the story. Playing as Otus was a 10/10 experience for me, I couldn't reccomend this game enough.\nI feel this game is more for the visual and story than the actual combat, but the combat system worked very well for not being based entirely on that. \n\nNow, I have read a couple negative reviews on this game. And I can see what they mean, but I found no issue looking right past those aspects they mentioned. One bad review said something along the lines of \"After putting 8 hours into this game, I don't feel inclined to ever pick it back up again.\" And I understand that, in fact that's how I am about this game. I experienced the story my own way the first time, and i enjoyed it so much I would rather not accidentally speedrun a second playthrough.\n\nA second bad review said \"the combat system is too punishing for when you get hit. you get hit, you drop your friend and fall.\" And that's exactly right. But, you have to take into account that (minor spoiler) Otus isn't a full blown Owl yet. He's still learning and growing, not to mention he flies with a cloak instead of actual wings like other Owls. I guess that Otus is about in his teens. So, if a 16 year old boy could pick up someone at least his own weight and fly, I would agree that the combat system is too punishing. But it's actually fair. It's not easy for a 160 lb boy to pick up a 160 lb boy. (Another minor spoiler) Otus even picks up Alphonse who is easily triple Otus's weight, at least. And let's say you do get hit and drop your buddy, you can press 1 button or scroll your scroll wheel to teleport them to you. With that in mind, I easily look past the \"punishing combat system.\"\n\nIgnore the negative reviews, this game is definitely worth the price.

Sometimes you can recover with a dash or spin sometimes you can't, really couldn't figure out the rules. Not to mention how healing takes a great long chain of inputs.\nAnd this **would've been A-Okay** if there were more options for the player to avoid damage. But flight is slow, the dash is more of a travel tool than combat move, the melee spin is wildly inconsistent in which enemies it effects, and most of the time you're outnumbered and surrounded. But then, near the end of the game, the tables turn as you get this completely absurd hookshot move that grants invulnerability for its full duration plus about a **full second after it ends**, so you can chain hookshots together and stay untouchable. Obviously this is a problem so you get to face off against nothing but puzzles featuring hard-hitting bombs, global poison, and near-invicible pirates for a whole area.\n\n(Oh and you can get stunlocked by monkeys, but only during the monkey arena boss fight where getting stunlocked means getting dragged into lava and insta-killed. Nowhere else do monkeys stunlock you.)\n\nPuzzles get less fun and feel slower as the game goes on. The explosive-and-barrier puzzles all felt like graphical rehashes of each other with minor quirks. Pulling up a plug that opens a door for a limited time takes about half a minute of holding the same input, and you may have to retry multiples times to figure out the path. \n\nWhoever thought adding a plentiful amount of blackout mazes where you can't see a thing was a good idea needs to reconsider some life choices. Bonus points for the few where you had a time constraint in the format of global DoT and the ones where a slight wrong step meant you would fall into spikes or a bomb.\n\nThe worm-ride uses **relative** up-down controls (half the challenge was adjusting for the spinning), but the cannon minigame uses **absolute** left-right controls.\n\nSoundtrack uses a live orchestra and sounds nice and all but sadly the composition is utterly forgettable.

But underneath that, it fails on almost every level, unfortunately. For starters, the story is trite and the characters are bland. It seems like they wanted to go with a Final Fantasy-type sweeping epic tone, but the depth to support that just isn't there. There are also many cutscenes and dialogue intrusions into the gameplay. Some are skippable, some are not...it really makes the gameplay feel halted.\n\nAnd the gameplay itself... there was a lot of potential here, but a) the controls are awful. I had numerous controller issues, and eventually had to switch to KBM. Which I knew would be a bit clunkier, but at least it worked. But b) the underlying mechanics of combat and navigation just don't feel well-conceived. The game is clearly meant to be somewhat easy. And it is... but I still found myself driven to frustration because I was just fighting to controls to proceed.\n\nThere's also some dressings of metroidvania-style play...but this is never fleshed out. The upgrades are shallow. The coin collecting is shallow. The backtracking is shallow. It's kind of this game in a nutshell...lots of potential on the surface, but once you dig into, the game is unsatisfying.\n\nEDIT: One last thing I forgot to mention in the gameplay section. Here's what happens when you take damage: you lose all control of your character, get flung across the screen and immediately drop the \"weapon\" you are carrying. This is so incredibly obnoxious, and usually leads to getting hit multiple times in a row as you are frantically trying to re-equip your \"weapon.\" For most of the game, it's not a big deal, because the platforming is so easy.

There's detail everywhere, the character designs are brimming with personality, and the environment is beautiful. The music is also excellent.\n\nThe gameplay... is not on the same level. The controls are just a bit clunky, the main character maybe a touch too slow. I played with a controller, and found that trying to aim, fire, and roll to avoid attacks at the same time was incredibly awkward -- it requires you to use the right stick, a button, and the trigger all on the same side of the controller. Alternating between the two is, again, clunky, and slows the pace down further. \n\nWhen you're first given control of Otus (the Owlboy), you're in a wide open area of floating islands and the movement speed/handling isn't. Then you start getting into narrow corridors, and it becomes a drag. In the larger outdoor areas, I see a lot of what I wanted -- exploration, great scenery, collectables to hunt down and some enemies.\n\nSome of the boss fights are really fun!  In others, it can be difficult to tell if you're doing the right thing to move the fight forward. In particular, one boss needs you to shoot off his 'hat' twice. The hat looks like a dozen other things you've had to pick up so far. Do you pick this up? No, and you'll get hit by the boss for trying.\n\nThere were a lot of instances of this kind of problem, mostly small, where I couldn't tell what the game wanted me to do. Sometimes the detail of the graphics itself was the issue. Enemies that aren't obvious against a detailed background, for instance, or lava pits in a mini boss arena that I didn't realize were unconvered until I fell straight in. If you read the game's cues correctly on the first try, everything feels simple, but if it's not clicking it can be hard to tell if you're having an issue with execution or understanding.\n\nThe 'set pieces' were what really got to me, though. Corridor chases, stealth sequences, and the thing that made me quit: ride a lava worm through a spinning corridor, avoiding rocks. The controls are confusing, the handling is poor, and I was getting both dizzy and frustrated with repeated attempts. \n\nIf the controls don't bother you, and you're okay with the weird grab bag mixture of puzzle/set piece/run and gun/boss/exploration/collectable hunt... I guess give it a try! If what I've described sounds unfocused and unenjoyable, then definitely take a pass on it.\n\nI've put down and picked up the game several times now, and I'm just not having fun with it.

This little platformer RPG has heart. The game it's self isn't necessarily novel, but I find it quite enjoyable. I play this when I need good feels for a while. It really does feel good to play, and I'm sure I'll be playing it for quite some time. The style is a platformer/puzzle like most others, only you can basically equip companions that act as your extra weapon slots. It's refreshing, coming from panic driven games like Killing Floor 2 where you have to keep a level head in order to survive a chaotic onslaught. It's a nice little platformer. 24.99 seems a bit steep to me... Still, I would recommend getting it on sale some time because it's a hearwarming game and a great addition to the genre.\n\nPS: The soundtrack is wonderful. It sets the mood perfectly for each area.\n\n\nEdit:\nJust finished the main story. It was beautiful. Hit me right in the feels, man. This game really struck a chord with me. I feel good about a hero that always has their heart in the right place, even if they make mistakes, even if they get overwhelmed or let people down. Even when they do the wrong thing because they were mistaken about what the outcome would be. This game will stick with me for a long time. Everyone wants to be the best version of themselves they can be. And everyone can be if they have the courage to keep trying and never give up.

I dont want to put this game under the bus, but I dont really wanna give it a thumbs up....\nSo it's beautiful, but unfiinished in all other regulars\n\n\nThere's no map or mini map....\nIt's mentioned that Owl make their own maps. If you wanna dump the map it'd be nice to have something for use to make our own with. But even if you dont have any of that, I just never had a sense of direction. While it is ok for an area to have the feeling of being lost, you should still have an overall sense of direction. ie Town A is north, if i go east north west, I will be in A. I could never really make a mental map, and I was really just winging it... \n\n\nStuff, aka chores....\nSome coins are dependant on unlocked abilities, so you are better off rushing to pre-end zone, and then backtracking everywhere. The forums say there are hidden coins, and all sorts of bullshit you need to find. again, chore.\n\nCoins get you upgrades, which are p.much health upgrades. Your teammates dont mechanical change much, and visual changes are lost on hit, which you are going to get hit a lot.\n\n\nCombat....\nMeh? Your teammates are alright, but each is better. By the ending you won't touch Geddie unless you have too. When fighting enemies, I would get caught up on them due to forgetting your character could do things. But you forget your character can do things is easy because your spin if more of \"knock things off of enemies\" and your dashes doesnt have i-frames. This coupled with slightly slippery moverment and recovery times, and you can just get murdered.\n\n\nDamage...\nIt's inconsistent, a bosses attack sometimes just pings damage, while a mob might chunk half your HP. Also there are no items. You can pick up stuff and eat it, but no inventory. So if you are in a boss, or in a place without healing items, you just die....\n\nDEATH...\nSeems to have zero meaning... maybe the last checkpoint, but there are no lives. Also beating a challenge or boss is more about figuring out what the devs wanted you to use. Then you pretty much blow through whatever it is you were doing.\n\nMovement....\nI lot of problems stem from not knowing your internal state, but that can be placed on me. ie when you get knockback i was never sure what the recovery button was, so if there was a clear sound queue for say, when you started flying, this could have been avoid. \nYou slide a little when you stop moving. Enemies have perdictive attacks, so sometimes you end up sliding just enough to eat a hit. \nYou dont have a platform jump (for a fraction of time after you become airborne you can still make your first jump), so.... idk.... that sucked for the last area, but otherwise didn't really matter.\n\n\nSPOILER TIME\nThe story....\nMaybe it's a story of student and mentor, not enough time is spent on that....\nBut than maybe it's a story about your character, but not enough time is spent on that....\nBut then maybe it's a story about some dudes on an adventure, but not enough time is spent on that....\nBut thin maybe it's the story of a people and how they cope in this changing world, but not enough time is spent on that....\nBut thon maybe it's a story of a world, but not enough time is spent on that....\nBut thun maybe it's leaning on troupes and everyone is just doing a dance so you can feel good...\n\nBut all those pieces arent really there\n\nSolus ends up being the final boss because he wouldn't explain and you just fought him, and Malestorm is just magiced to death by accident.\nEveryone survives and the world is fixed. \nExcept for that Advent issue where a ton of people were killed. \nAnd your home village was running low on food, so I hope they can find food before starving to death. \nOr the fact that the Owls are assholes who built the grandest of civilization and ruined everything but that was lost to time in like a fucking weekend.\n\nAlso if you didn't interrupted Solus his plan would of worked and he would have finished the whatever and saved the world before malestorm got there....\n\nso....\nSPOILER END\n\n\ntl;dr\na beautiful unfinished game\nif your charaters did nothing, the world would have gotten proper fixed\n\ndevs? if you are out there learn from this and make something else, because this shouldnt be your \"end of the road\".

It feels more of a \"last breath\" than \"youthful fresh air\". I keep thinking about the span of development time that the reviewers would not let us forget: A decade. I then turn to the times during my ~8 hour playthrough where I found something not quite as polished as I expect even for (I assume) a small team over a long time. No fast travel (even though there is little reason to backtrack), no map (even though areas/sections are linear), some bosses are frustrating until you learn how to \"cheese\" them, etc.\n\nThe pixels are indeed beautiful. The orchestral soundtrack - while sounding very out-of-place at times - still shines in enough cases to make me believe it was the right choice. The story was traditional at the core while offering a couple twists that keep it from being entirely rote.\n\nPlaying this for the first time over a year later after all the hype has gone and \"Best of\" lists written... I feel conflicted. My sense - and I have no facts to back this up - is that 10 years is a very long time for a game (surely a labor of love) to gestate. During that time tastes change, people come and go, events in the world color your perceptions as a person, you grow older and possibly wiser. Perhaps, you find chances to alter parts of yourself. That correction fixes the initial flaw, but subtly adds another. Owlboy feels like that.\n\nI still must recommend this, if only as something to experience and learn from.

If you are expecting a difficult game, or an exploration game that offers many different paths to make your way through, then Owlboy is probably not for you.\n\nWhile Owlboy does have a large amount of areas, and quite a lot of open space to fly around and see interesting environments, the majority of the path to progress in the story is pretty linear. There are a handful of side areas to discover, some of which are through fake walls or obtaining collectibles, but the adventure is still pretty linear in where you navigate. For instance, early in the game you will encounter an area that is extremely wide open with a handful of exits noticeable; but you will quickly realize that pretty much only one exit is available, and you return to the area numerous times later on. That is the way most of the bigger areas work for the game, though there are occasional optional paths for collectibles.\n\nSimilarly, the game is, for the most part, pretty easy to complete. The game does not utilize save points, but instead tracks your progress at certain time intervals or when you switch between certain rooms. Because of that, even though there are some sections that might be difficult for platforming or destroying enemies, you will usually respawn in the same room or in the previous room.\n\nAlso, a couple of things that stood out to me for Owlboy were that the game does not have a world map, nor does it utilize fast travel. Thus, I would recommend playing the game in a short period of time instead of returning to it over and over. While it is generally easy to learn where things are, you might forget if you put the game down for a bit. It can be annoying if you go down a far pathway only to realize that you returned to the wrong area. Without fast travel, you have to go back down the wrong pathway again and try somewhere else. Further, it only takes about 10 hours to finish the game, more or less dependent upon how fast you go through the story and whether you collect coins and tokens.\n\nWith those points out of the way, I will say that Owlboy is a pretty interesting game and I enjoyed it more than I expected. I would say that storyline and the art style are clearly the biggest positives for the game, while the gameplay is definitely interesting in the mechanics, though it is not perfect. You can easily judge the visuals from the screenshots and trailers, obviously. There was a lot of work put into the pixel art here, and it made for some very nice scenery to explore. As for the story, it is quite confusing for a while, and technically, there are a lot of open ends by the completion of the game. Many details are still ambiguous even if you unlock the [spoiler]Eternal Sanctuary[/spoiler]. Nevertheless, slowly learning about this world of owls was interesting to me.\n\nLastly, although maybe a negative note to end on, is that I do not think the game to be as much of a \"masterpiece\" as many people claim. While I enjoyed the adventure, I'm not sure I would even put the game in my Top 50 list, really. That is not to say that the game is bad, but I am surprised by people saying that it is one of the best games ever.", "timestamp_created": 1516834475, "timestamp_updated": 1516835064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786893606185913086", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39590144": {"recommendationid": "39590144", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970761123", "num_games_owned": 2918, "num_reviews": 866, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 488, "last_played": 1510127856}, "language": "english", "review": "I heard a lot about this game, the amount of press this game got from indie fans was amazing, and I was just curious about the game.  This was a 10 year quest with hand drawn graphics and it sounded like an indie darling. \n\nSo I was excited when I finally got a chance to play it, and see how it stacked up. \n\nAfter 8 hours I ended up putting down the game and moving on to something else, and it wasn't because I was done.  It was because I didn't really want to see more.   I kept hearing about the art, and.... yes the art is good, but I don't think this is one of the best looking games as people say.  The hand animation and all just didn't resonate with me like I heard it resonate with reviewers.  The pixel art aesthetic has been done in many games, seeing it here is nice, but it's not a novel. \n\nThe art is good but \"I spent a long time with a hard process\" makes me kind of shrug.  I can see the brilliance of a game like Cuphead but that's because of the hand drawn animation and making it look and feel like 1930s rotoscope technology.   In Owlboy I see a beautiful game, but it feels like it got only a little benefit from the hand drawing everything. \n\nThe story in this game varies, but overall it lacks much of a punch or desire to follow.  You're an Owlboy, there's a evil country that you have to go fight, you need to explore... yada yada.  The story is just going to be your means of conveyance from point A to point B. \n\nThe part though that made me give up this game is the gameplay.  As I played the game, I found my mind thinking about what I wanted the character to do.  Soar through the clouds, fly around, experience real fluid momentum.  Owlboy doesn't want to do that.  In fact I kept trying to remember a game similar to this and it finally struck me.  I wanted to be able to use the abilities the bird Swoop did in Little Big Planet so I felt like I was flying.  Instead Owlboy just feels like a rather ordinary platformer where a character has the Kirby ability to fly (moving the thumbstick around) and dash.    I never felt like an \"owl boy\" and the game felt very slow and tedious.  \n\nThe fact is much of the game play never grabbed me, and just when you think the game is going to do something unique and novel, they give you people who hang on to you and shoot guns.  So while the main character never fires a weapon, everyone else does... joy.   For such a unique and wonderful game, with great art, it feels like the game play got little to no love.  You fly through rings at a very slow speed, you pull up objects out of the ground, and you shoot enemies.  \n\nOwlboy wants to be more, every reviewer seems to have bought into this story of a small indie who spent 10 years hand crafting the art of this game to be perfect, and while that's impressive, I noticed a lot of reviewers having personally spent time with the team.  Maybe they're amazingly wonderful people and charm everyone, maybe they are just burnt out on modern graphics, and either way.  That's all good.  \n\nYet I'm not the type of person who puts down games, and Owlboy is one of the few good games that I decided I was done playing, not through difficulty, or skill, but through the fact I was just bored with it. \n\nI ended up being unable to recommend this game.  I know a lot of people really do enjoy it, but to me once I look at the game I played, and the fact they wanted 25 dollars for that experience I shake my head.  That makes it a hard no on recommendation.  However I get that I'm in the minority in this opinion as well.\n\nIf you enjoy this review and want to see my opinion on other games you can find my curator page at this link. http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1516827930, "timestamp_updated": 1516827930, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 245, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736209392547607422", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39563494": {"recommendationid": "39563494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053305223", "num_games_owned": 990, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1498234075}, "language": "english", "review": "I had high hopes.\nA lot of flash, but very little substance.\n\nThe sprites are beautiful, but the themeing is textbook and unutilized.\nThe characters look good, but have no depth.\nThere's tons of dialogue, but the story is awful.\nThe last boss is fun, but the ending is bland and inconclusive.\nA weird one.\nI expected Cave Story with Birds and got a Tech Demo with art quality it didn't use on anything worth their insane effort.", "timestamp_created": 1516732771, "timestamp_updated": 1516732771, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553800761699676514", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39550266": {"recommendationid": "39550266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025159964", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 162, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 407, "last_played": 1516686128}, "language": "english", "review": "A charming little indie title with gorgeous music and sprite art.

On a 100% play through the story is emphasized and it pulls on some heart-strings.\n\nI fully recommend playing this game", "timestamp_created": 1516602277, "timestamp_updated": 1516602277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39506801": {"recommendationid": "39506801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048613500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 180, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1516539981}, "language": "english", "review": "Poetry through pixels.\nAn amazing adventure in a fantastic world filled with interesting and funny characters.\n\nThe feels are strong in this game...\n\n11/10 would cry again.", "timestamp_created": 1516530787, "timestamp_updated": 1516530787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39489838": {"recommendationid": "39489838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335124368", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1526335231}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING game (:", "timestamp_created": 1516472052, "timestamp_updated": 1516472052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39476896": {"recommendationid": "39476896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212113140", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 735, "last_played": 1516434155}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't normally rate or review games, but Owlboy is something truly special.

Backgrounds, characters and animations look wonderful, which makes exploring and meeting characters a ton of fun. The little animations and attention to detail definitely proves how much love D-Pad Studio has put into this game. Another thing that's wonderful is the music. Epic tunes, dark themes and atmopheric pieces make the game came alive.\n\n- Gameplay -\nThe game feels a lot like Metroidvania mixed with shoot 'em up-like gameplay, which gives Owlboy an unique style. Moving around feels fun, dungeons are well designed, and it can be quite challenging at times, but never too challenging. However, one of the negatives is that it's a bit hard to find your way around without a map. You sort of learn the world as you go, but a map would've helped in some situations. Some of the puzzles get repetitive, too, but nothing is too annoying. Oh, and collectables aren't the easiest to find, so if you want to get everything, prepare to spend a lot of time. Overall, though, the gameplay is solid fun.\n\n- Story -\nFor such a simple-looking game, Owlboy has quite the story. I won't spoil anything, but you really feel for the protagonist, Otus, and the game can get pretty dark at times. You get to meet interesting good characters, but the bad characters are just as interesting. All in all, the story was much better than what I expected from a game like this.\n\n- Overall -\nI really recommend getting Owlboy. It has plenty of charm in its artstyle, the music is incredible, it's full of fun characters, and the story is also quite good.\n\nScore: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1516317510, "timestamp_updated": 1516317510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39427836": {"recommendationid": "39427836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086339316", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1516245336}, "language": "english", "review": "Great plataformer, the soundtrack and art style....Simply Amazing", "timestamp_created": 1516245525, "timestamp_updated": 1516245525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39415415": {"recommendationid": "39415415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165915226", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1495765999}, "language": "english", "review": "Owlboy is a gold standard by which you'll come to judge pixel art by.

It has very few innovations and it doesn't borrow enough from contemporaries and predecessors to keep from going stale very quickly. It's not particularly hard, level theming is a little safe, and the gameplay isn't extremely thrilling.\n\nIt is, however, perfectly serviceable. It's not broken or buggy, and for all it's blandness, it's fine for baby's first metroidvania.\n\nIf you like this genre of game, Owlboy is worth picking up just to see pixel art pushed to a limit you won't see very often.

Para mi, muy, pero muy pocos juegos me han enamorado, me han hecho sentir tan vivo o incluso me han hecho sentir tan humano como \u00e9ste. A mi opini\u00f3n, te enamoras de los personajes y de sus actitudes, claro, hay algunos que odias y en este juego, por alguna extra\u00f1a raz\u00f3n no odie a nadie. Como sea. \nEn s\u00ed, puedes acabar el juego en poco tiempo, pero, creo yo que realmente puedes disfrutarlo plenamente. Puede que tenga controles sencillos, puede que ciertos niveles los acabes muriendo e intentando pero \u00bfeso qu\u00e9? Para mi, no necesit\u00f3 nada m\u00e1s; los gr\u00e1ficos, el dise\u00f1o de personajes, fueron SIMPLEMENTE FANT\u00c1STICOS. La m\u00fasica, \u00bfqu\u00e9 decir? No todos los temas fueron de mi agrado, pero podr\u00eda decir que mucha de la banda sonora iba mas que PERFECTO en varios mundos del juego. \u00bfQu\u00e9 puedo decir?

On the surface, this seems like it would have been right at home within the 16 and 32-bit era of console gaming, but exists in a more-refined and polished form. The characters are fun, made up of large sprites with good animations. The attention to detail, such as within their expressions and movements, often made me smile throughout the game.\n\nThis care is extended to many other graphical elements as well. For example, the environments elevate parallax scrolling to a high-art. The many layers between foreground and background give a nice sense of depth even though the game stays essentially 2-D. This is further enhanced by lighting effects like shine and fog.\n\n[*]GAMEPLAY / CONTROLS / DIFFICULTY\n\nOverall, I would categorize this game as \"action-adventure\" in genre, but it is hard to classify it as rigidly following any one style of play. There is platforming, some shoot-em-up like sequences, a few puzzles, etc. However, all of these are integrated together seamlessly and naturally, rather than being merely a pastiche of interesting parts.\n\nThe level design is great. They have a good balance in size that invites exploration without causing a sense of overwhelm. The maps of some games are so large that it sometimes becomes tedious to traverse them, especially when they send you on repeated fetch quests. Fortunately, this game does not suffer from either of those defects. Most items are useful to your adventure and are not overly difficult to obtain, so it does not degrade into grinding or mindless collecting.\n\nThe controls are fluid and responsive. The only minor quibble I have is that a couple of the characters have two different actions assigned to one button (i.e.: where you press to perform one action and hold to perform another). This sometimes makes it difficult to execute a specific action, but I am not sure how one would alter the control scheme to fix it as all of the controller buttons are already assigned common actions!\n\nIf you are a slightly more casual gamer, the difficultly can become a little challenging in some parts, yet is also very forgiving. The life meter is not excessively small, checkpoints are frequent enough, and continues are infinite. It won't feel so impossible that it makes you rage quit, but it won't hold your hand all the way through either.\n\n[*]MUSIC / SFX\n\nThe soundtrack is orchestral and quite beautiful. It imparts a cinematic quality to the gaming experience as a whole. I don't know if I would jam to the entire OST separately, as you can tell it is a score to something, but it complements the story perfectly.\n\nThe sound effects provide a pleasant nuance to actions. They don't become repetitive or detract from the music.\n\n[*]STORYLINE\n\nThe story is well-written. It flows and is easy enough to follow without lacking in realism. The world and its characters are interesting. As I got further into the game, I began to care about them and became concerned about their predicaments. I was even moved emotionally a couple of times.\n\n[spoiler]Your opinion of the ending may change depending upon your interpretation of the last cutscene and how much of the game you have completed, particularly if you have unlocked The Eternal Sanctuary and listened to Noctae. I have my own interpretation of the story, but I will let you draw your own conclusions.[/spoiler]\n\n[u]Summary[/u]\n\nI don't play as many games as I used to, but I really love this one and am glad that I did. I just wish it was longer, as there isn't a lot of replay value. Once you complete it, that's it! In this sense, it is like watching a good movie. You may revisit it sometime in the future, but you probably won't be watching it every other week.\n\nI would recommend it to everyone, with the exception of perhaps the youngest children (under 7), as they may not be able to follow the subtleties of the story or might become overstimulated by its contents. There is some talk of death, cartoon violence, and perilous situations, but no profanity, gore, nudity, or anything like that.", "timestamp_created": 1515293927, "timestamp_updated": 1515300130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498755455017089844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39125807": {"recommendationid": "39125807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101889084", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 321, "last_played": 1514001999}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen ost.", "timestamp_created": 1515261165, "timestamp_updated": 1515261165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39125679": {"recommendationid": "39125679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030458911", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 711, "last_played": 1515361762}, "language": "english", "review": "An easy way to describe Owlboy is to say it's pleasant, even wholesome. Someone less kind might invert those statements and call it saccharine or vapid. The cross-section of those four adjectives is the best quick way I can think of to review the game, but there's just one problem: that's not giving it enough credit.\n\nThere's a good chance that the first thing you noticed when you came to this game's store page is how good-looking it is. To my knowledge, Owlboy has the most impressive pixel-based graphics of any video game ever made. The graphics are highly detailed and very 'clean,', a fact which probably explains the majority of the game's nine-year development period. It's certainly not the scope or content that took so long: it's easy to cover everything the game has to offer in under twelve hours. As a matter of fact, the game underwent a lot of the difficulties you would expect from such a long development cycle. Quite a substantial amount of planned content was never made, and entire areas, fully-animated characters, and even complete boss fights were cut.\n\nSo far the game might sound like a case of style over substance. That's not quite fair either, because the story is actually very good. It really nails the balance between portraying human weakness and creating characters you want to root for. The heroic characters have major insecurities and they make mistakes that really impact the narrative. Even so, I never found them grating or unsympathetic, partially because they have such unerring strength of spirit. It's easy to have characters mope for too long before they rebound and try again, but Owlboy avoids that pit-trap.\n\nIn the case of the main character, Otus, that trait is tied to the themes of the story: redemption and trust. The central idea of the game is that no matter how many and severe your mistakes, you can make up for them if you try. That's probably a bit naive, and there are definitely moments where the characters are too quick to forgive, which makes the story feel sweet to the point where it's hard to suspend disbelief. But that's not too surprising: it's a game about a magical owl child after all, and it's essentially for kids. There's no reason why you couldn't let your five-year-old play this.\n\nYeah, hateful masochists like myself might leave feeling a bit unsatisfied. Besides the light, simple nature of the story, the game is really easy. For one thing, there's almost no penalty for death. The game drops checkpoints so often that running out of health will often see you transported back to the start of the same room in which you died, with your life-bar filled as a courtesy. Not that you're likely to die often: the enemy attack patterns are simple and you have a lot of health to absorb hits with. The hardest parts of the game are when you have to quickly transfer between carrying an ally and fighting empty-handed, simply because that's kind of awkward to do.\n\nIt's understandable to complain about the controls. It wouldn't be a problem to have to carry allies if you didn't regularly have to carry objects too. Shuffling them around can be a little bit of a pain, and the way the character handles takes some getting used to. The shooting works in the dual-stick method, and I recommend using the mouse and keyboard to keep down the annoyance of that aspect.\n\nYou also have infinite flight. To be fair, the game is designed so that this isn't such a broken power, but that leads to a lot of the levels being tight and claustrophobic, which defeats the purpose of the flight to some extent. In the more wide-open levels, the game loses a sense of proper constraints, and the areas feel too large to explore comprehensively. Some places in particular are large and wide-open but contain no secrets or coins, and the only way for the player to determine this is to search them manually, which turns out to be a total waste of time. The game rarely finds the happy medium between these two extremes.\n\nExploring to find all the Bucannary coins is kind of an underdeveloped element of the game. Most of the hidden coins are simply found by flying through false walls, and there is never an instance where the player needs to revisit an older area with newly acquired powers - it doesn't deserve the 'Metroidvania' tag Steam users have given it. The final power-up and a Steam Achievement supposedly require you to gather every coin in the game, except the game sometimes gives you 'extra' chests for killing enemies, another element which just makes the game too easy.\n\nBut all that bashing aside, it's still fundamentally competent. The bosses are structured well and running through the levels is fun. It technically has a good difficulty curve in that it goes from easy to less easy as the game moves on.\n\nAt this point, you may rightly think my review is just as toothless and middle-of-the-road as the game itself. I would like to return to my earlier statement, that such a claim doesn't give Owlboy enough credit. The final moments of the story are what elevate it. There's an important twist near the end that I have to admit I didn't see coming, although that might say more about me than the game. In the conclusion, the game successfully leaves certain story concepts unexplained while giving the player enough information to come to the 'canonical' interpretation himself (although it does this by not being very subtle with its hints.) Those concepts tell a short side-story that raises questions about the purpose of life and the value of science and technology, and it does so in a way that gives the player some things to think about and expand upon, even if other stories and writers have already explored the same ideas and done it better. It still eventually gets away from being the simple but functional adventure story it seems to be at first.\n\nAnd that leaves us with just a little housekeeping. The soundtrack is beautiful. It does a great job building atmosphere and enhancing the mood of the story. Finally, I should mention the price. For the length and replayability of the game, it's slightly on the expensive side. You could certainly buy a longer, more challenging, edgier game for less money (Salt and Sanctuary is one example,) but there's a trade that comes with that decision: whatever game it was, it wouldn't look as good as Owlboy.", "timestamp_created": 1515260929, "timestamp_updated": 1516174430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39119679": {"recommendationid": "39119679", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997548595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1533989945}, "language": "english", "review": "Fighting a kind of turtle with an iron mask that protects it.

That is, an extremely pretty disappointment.\n\nIt feels like two people made this game. One of them wanted a 2d metroidvania, and the other one wanted a bullet hell rail shooter. As a result, we got the worst of both worlds.\n\nI have to ask, do people really not understand what exploration means? This game drags you by the nose along a completely linear storyline, where the only \"exploration\" involves sometimes finding a few extra coins hidden behind a wall. Even the dungeons are entirely linear. This game has as much exploration as an interstate highway. So that rules out quality metroidvania.\n\nThat said, I would still recommend Owlboy if it's controls were better. In regular gameplay, they're merely irritating, in boss fights, they're downright infuriating. If you get hit, you lose your gunner. Could be tolerable, except that many of the bosses attack extremely fast. Now, I don't necessarily mean that they attack frequently, which some of them do, but their projectiles also rocket across the screen at ridiculous speeds. In addition, the invulnerability frames are very short, and when you do get hit, it's very easy to lose track of your character because the screen flashes and your sprite vanishes, which creates the following boss fight scenario.\n\nGet hit\nFind yourself on screen\nStart flying again (key press)\nRecover your gunner (key press)\n[optional] Realize you called the wrong gunner and switch to the correct one (key press)\nFind your reticule on screen so that you can aim\nAttempt to dodge the attack which is probably already incoming (note: you lack an invulnerable dodge, so this stage basically means wiggle and pray in the hopes that you were in a good enough position to not get hit)\nGet hit\nRepeat\n\nWhich rules out quality bullet swarm rail shooters, because at least in those you can keep shooting after taking damage, and the projectiles tend to move slowly and predictably while filling the screen which gives you the chance to dodge.\n\nI quit playing on the boss whose attacks are so fast that even on my 10th or so attempt I was still getting hit on every wave.\n\nSwipe left.", "timestamp_created": 1515231235, "timestamp_updated": 1515231235, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518507480621338", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39110799": {"recommendationid": "39110799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379500649", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1430, "last_played": 1498273578}, "language": "spanish", "review": "De los mejores juego que he jugado.

Playing with a mouse and keyboard was a little bit awkward for movement and switching through characters, and for whatever reason, I couldn't get controller support to work (DS4 on a Mac). \n-The game had some really sudden difficulty spikes, with a handfull of bosses being key factors, as well as that stupid cannon minigame. \n-Collecting all the coins was tedious (you'll certainly miss one pot or two and have to spend a while scanning a whole level to get everything) and it felt like there wasn't much reward for progression. \n-For whatever reason, it couldn't go fullscreen for me, which caused issues a couple times. \n-Price tag is a bit high for the length of the game.\n\nI'm disappointed that I didn't enjoy this game as much as I thought I would since I really enjoyed watching the game develop over the course of so many years, but at some point it just stopped being fun and I was only finishing it to say I did.

The art direction, music, world, and often the gameplay combine to create something that will remain in my memory for a long time. The fact that the world of Owlboy--a world filled with history, humor, and memorable environments and characters--has an internal logic where everything has an explanation and a place is very satisfying; I found myself immersed in this world and truly \"swept along\". The art design and story are studio Ghibli inspired (fine by me): colorful, aesthetically brilliant design mixed with themes such as the ever popular \"finding yourself\", non black-and-white motivations, and humans v nature. Little touches--the way you open chests and heal yourself not just by pressing a button; Otus's different facial expressions--end up meaning a lot. The score (by Jonathan Geer) is a masterpiece of videogame sound design which, for this gamer at least, truly evoked feelings and sensations that I simply couldn't believe I was feeling at the age of 28 (and playing this on a toaster MacBook pro while on vacation). It has a wealth of different textures, orchestration, moods, and colors. How much the score strengthens the game cannot be overstated. As an aside, it has been inspiring to hear so many incredible, sophisticated scores in indie games recently, such as those in Hollow Knight, Ori, Banner Saga, and Abzu (both by the incredible Austin Wintory) to name some of my favorites. \n\n\nThe gameplay is technically competent, sometimes outstanding, and rarely annoying and unintuitive. For instance, a platforming section near the end of the game and several boss battles seemed to me infuriatingly arbitrary (hard as it is to get mad at such a lovable game). Likewise, a section without adequate lighting was a chore--especially given that I think the same mood and effect could have been acheieved with a little more clarity of design. On the other hand, the early hours of flying, exploration, and dungeon crawling are elegantly designed and provide alternating sections of tension and relaxation (not as tense and motoric as, say, Mega Man..not as exploration heavy as Zelda). The combat allows for several tricks which give it a degree of depth. The final portion of the game I can see as being divisive, as some of the freedom and sense of non-linearity to the level design goes out the window; there is however a lore justification for this, so perhaps it is a matter of opinion. The fact that it threatened the gameplay in a small way makes me ambivalent, if not outright disappointed. \n\n\n\nDespite these nitpicks, this was one of the most memorable games I've played in the last..well, ever. Buy it because a) you'll have fun with it, and a2) it is a TRUE work of art, and in my opinion we should all support these kind of developers. I would be as hyped for Owlboy 2 as for the Witcher 4!\n\n\n\nP.S: There are several collectibles and secrets in the game. While I didn't scour for all of them, I'd like to go back for a second round. Partly because the game is replayable on the basis of its amazing story and charm, partly because the secrets are not just ceremonial trinkets but tied to the games lore. So there is some meat here to dig into after the main quest.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515102161, "timestamp_updated": 1515102161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628230929374694824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39062588": {"recommendationid": "39062588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332653925", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 611, "last_played": 1515201114}, "language": "english", "review": "The Good: \n\nThe soundtrack is by far my favorite thing about this game. Some songs are absolutely beautiful, especially when coupled with the magnificent pixel art. Both of these aspects are second to none, and are the highlight of this game.\n\nThe Bad: The sad thing about Owlboy is that it fails to be any more than mediocre in every other aspect. \n\nThe controls are clunky. This is one of the most important parts of any game, and with Owlboy, I found myself stumbling through the entire game when it came to the controls. I felt like I never really got used to them.\n\nThe puzzles are too easy. There wasn't a single time that the puzzles were challenging. I love the \"Aha!\" moments of games with puzzles, and sadly this game didn't contain a single one. This was the least challenging part of the game.\n\nThe mechanics of the game were often very awkward. There is no one thing that bothered me when it came to the mechanics, but instead a lot of little things. For one,  I would often find myself dying solely because the camera would pan over, and lock to a certain part of the dungeon at inappropriate times. Also, there is no in game map, which most of the time this isn't a problem, but a few times I would completely forget where a certain building is, and spend a good amount of time fflying around searching for it. Another annoyance is that when you are injured, our hero flashes and blinks, often causing me to lose track of where he is within the sometimes chaotic fighting. Finally, one other mechanic that was bothersome after a while was the lack of control during talking scenes, and they were a frequent interruption of gameplay. The flow of the game suffered for it. \n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the storyline. This is a big one. The storyline started off interesting because of the main characters dynamic with his mentor, who  thinks our hero is completely useless, and constantly reminds him so. This really pushes you to try to prove him wrong. Sadly, as the game progresses, you have fewer and fewer reasons to care about what is happening. While the characters had distinct personalities, I never felt particularly attached to any of them. They each had a short background story, and that was that. The storyline itself was a typical \"save the world\" plot. As the game went on, I never found myself really being driven by the story, and while some people really appreciated the ending of this game, I found it very unsatisfying and was mostly happy the game had ended.\n\n2/5", "timestamp_created": 1515099839, "timestamp_updated": 1515228251, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513173341751098633", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39062219": {"recommendationid": "39062219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357471935", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 623, "last_played": 1544384476}, "language": "english", "review": "(Potential spoilers)\nI enjoyed this game a huge amount.\nOwlboy easily makes one of my top 5 games for the following reasons, the story is wholesome and can leave the player with mixed emotions towards the end.
