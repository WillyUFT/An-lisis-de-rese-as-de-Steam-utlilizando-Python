effects, and with a story that is well written, to the point, and manages to be quite cheesy at times, and sad at others.\n\nOnly issue for me, as it was on the other games of the series, is that it

This difference is interesting and for the most part well done, although it does feel a little overwritten at times, especially in the third act. Without going into spoilers, Impostor Factor's story sticks out to me as the most emotional, and probably best written of the series so far. There's some moments in this game that really had me tearing up. The writing here is absolutely superb in the second act and this is where the game shines. The third act is a bit all over the place since it tries do a lot, and at times it can feel a bit of a mess but it manages to still pull off a satisfying and heartfelt ending. The pixel graphics are beautifully done as are all of the games by Freebird, but it really stood out to me this game. They really fit the tone of this game much better then previous ones I think due to the horror feeling that parts of this game fall under. If you enjoyed the previous games in this series then you'll love Impostor Factory as it is very much more of the same. If you haven't played the previous games I highly recommend playing them before this one as a big part of this story relies on previous knowledge to be effective.

I feel like, unlike the other characters like Johnny/River, and Colin/Faye/and his wife, Quincy/Lynri, while a beautiful start (i loved the act two story). their story kinda got less emotional in the third act. The idea of Lynri losing the baby and completely removing Quincy from her life was heartbreaking, and a huge part of me thought that we were experiencing one of the first scientist who created Sigmund Corp rewriting their own memories (Lynri rewriting her leaving Colin after the baby died, and essentially writing the ending of the story as her new memory). \n\nI do like that we finally got some insight on Neil, and why he uses the machine, and what could possibly be wrong with his, but i do wish act two held more weight bc that was very interesting, but act two was pretty much shut down by the finale, which made it kinda obsolete imo.\n\nI am reccomended this game because i do not think it is a bad game, and those who love Freenird games would still enjoy it, however, this is a game you DEFINITELY have to play after To the Moon and Finding Paradise, especially if you're invested in the story of Neil.", "timestamp_created": 1694641441, "timestamp_updated": 1694642253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501869022846221924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146217756": {"recommendationid": "146217756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250013440", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1694604557}, "language": "english", "review": "Not what I expected.\nBut, it's still a good story from the series.\nLooking forward to the beach episode.\n", "timestamp_created": 1694604622, "timestamp_updated": 1694604622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146154460": {"recommendationid": "146154460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128231432", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1694498342}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice conclusion (for now) to the Freebird games franchise.

The price tag is well justified and I would encourage anyone who likes a great story to jump on this one - and the others (To The Moon, Finding Paradise, A Bird Story) IMMEDIATELY. This is a series you NEED in your library.\n\nThe thing that makes these titles so special is the fact that they're very thoughtful and have complicated storylines, and they run the gamut of content - from light and funny, to dark and serious, to hopeful, heart-broken, upset, happy, and everything in between. This series is one of those that when you start one of the games, you just won't be able to stop until it's finished, and each one has a lot of content/story. Once you start playing, you'll be gripped by it and just HAVE to know how things turn out.. and you'll probably sit there playing until it's done. AMAZING, AMAZING stories.\n\nBasic concept (which, I don't think this will be a spoiler, but I'll hide it anyway): [spoiler] Ever had something you know you're going to regret on your deathbed? Maybe you wish you had done this thing, or made that choice. Now your life is over, and you're regretting how things turned out. What if there was a way to truly believe you HAD done that thing or made that choice? The company Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene work at does just that - on your deathbed, they burrow into your memories, find out what makes you tick, and implant a series of new memories into your head - overwriting the old memories - so that as you pass away, you do so happy with the way things turn out.[/spoiler]\n\nThe great thing about each story is diving into it, figuring out what makes each character tick, finding out all about them... and it's told in such an amazing way. I can't tell you enough how fantastic this developer is at telling stories.\n\nMy recommendation is to play them in order. While each episode is a \"self-contained\" episode, it really benefits the player to play them in order. Kinda like how if you watch different episodes of your favorite TV show... sure, each show might be a self-contained story, but you don't get the full context unless you watch them in order.\n\nTo The Moon\nFinding Paradise\nA Bird Story\nImposter Factory\n\nSome folks might disagree and say A Bird Story should come before Finding Paradise, since it sorta comes chronologically before FP... But one of the things that makes each story great is \"getting to know\" the people involved... and I feel like \"A Bird Story\" is better viewed as the \"deleted scenes\" of a movie, rather than as a prequel. If you watch the deleted scenes on a DVD first, maybe it won't \"spoil\" the movie, but it just doesn't feel right. Play FP first, and then dive a little deeper with ABS.\n\nGet all 4 of these immediately. This is one of the few storyline games that got me a little choked up. I absolutely LOVE the characters and every bit of these stories was phenomenal. I couldn't possibly recommend them any more. They are well worth the full price. I had... SO much fun, and I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting the next chapters from this developer. STUNNING story. Easy gameplay.

The third (fourth if you count Bird Story) installment in the To The Moon series by Freebird Games, and games that have come to emotionally dominate me.

The [spoiler]real world versions of them only show up after the credits have rolled. Even then Eva only really says a couple lines in this game.[/spoiler] We focus instead of Quincy Reynard, who's invited to a mansion for a social gathering but gets way more than he's bargaining for - and meets a mysterious girl named Lynri. \n\nThe game didn't make me cry like To The Moon and Finding Paradise, which I was sort of disappointed about as it was the reason I was holding off on it for so long, but it was still plenty heartbreaking. [spoiler]In our reality, Lynri chose to save Neil (who's implied to have a condition of his own) at the cost of her living a long healthy life. In the reality the game shows us through the memory walk, Lynri lives long but Neil (Tobi) passes away and she leaves Quincy and lives out the rest of her life at the Foundation who invented the technology we're familiar with.[/spoiler] Lots of complicated character moments, but in the end I love how Freebird Games always tells really compelling love stories. \n\nHere's to the Beach Episode!", "timestamp_created": 1691382187, "timestamp_updated": 1691382187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143548215": {"recommendationid": "143548215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281349587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1691355306}, "language": "english", "review": "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm very good", "timestamp_created": 1691355182, "timestamp_updated": 1691355182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143507553": {"recommendationid": "143507553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060706139", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1691310475}, "language": "english", "review": "wow", "timestamp_created": 1691310513, "timestamp_updated": 1691310513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143492242": {"recommendationid": "143492242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313186495", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1700665670}, "language": "english", "review": "just perfect", "timestamp_created": 1691286665, "timestamp_updated": 1691286665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143448698": {"recommendationid": "143448698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073319250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1691234283}, "language": "english", "review": "Your games bitterly and wholeheartedly remind me that life is too short.

And there will be references to the first games (also, i think the two prequels are Story-Emotion masterpieces and you miss out if you skip them).\n\nThe Ending is a bit vague, so there might be a Sequel in the future. If you don't mind an somewhat open ending, think something like, idk. Inception, then this hopefully won't bother you to much. The Story itself got closed, it's just that the universe it's set in lives on. So you will get a nice conclusive story, with somewhat of a marvelesc after Credits scene to setup a possible Sequel.\n\n4 hours of suspence and heart touching moments. Just get it (and the prequels)\n", "timestamp_created": 1689152896, "timestamp_updated": 1689152896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550408720970153809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141836785": {"recommendationid": "141836785", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997027017", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1689085712}, "language": "english", "review": "Genuine dissapointment and easily the worst story out of the \"series\". (Marked spoilers below.)\n\nImpostor Factory has a giant flaw. Ironically, it's a hollow \"impostor\" of previous stories. Tries to go for the same story beats, yet is predicatable, going nowhere and worst of all, completly pointless. There is no point in investing yourself in the characters, because [spoiler]beside the epilogue, none of them are real[/spoiler], no point in following the story, because [spoiler]multiple realities, everything is a simulation, etc.[/spoiler], no point in pretending that anything actually matters. The \"emotional moments\" are like something out of a bad soap opera and, again, they don't matter in any way because see above. \nWhat offended me the most, tho, was the part in the epilogue, where one of the characters tries to slightly \"lampshade\" the fact, that what we saw was kinda of a nothing. Yep, you just spent 5 hours, to see a guy [spoiler]make himself a bit happier after seeing his mother's memories? Or maybe sort out those memories of his parents? Or rather imagine his parents and himself being happy for once? Who knows? Maybe he had a little too much spare time?[/spoiler] It doesn't work like in the previous titles, because that character is FULLY AWARE of what is happening?? So everything that happend during the game is just kinda brushed aside at the very end??? Okay. You can call it out as pointless, but it doesn't change the fact that the story WAS pointless.\nAnother random tidbit, that iritated me, which might be controversial, but reviews, like opinions are highly personal: [spoiler]Did the story imply, that putting the unborn baby's health over your own is the \"correct\" choice?[/spoiler] Seeing as everything that happens before it is supposed to be kinda awful, but after the change everything is more or less fine and dandy (and more \"canon\"). That's something that I definitely cannot get behind.\n\nAfter excellent To the Moon, and slightly worse, but still great Finding Paradise we get this.

You show up to a party where there's a bunch of investors for a project of some sort and then a murder happens, and there's a mysterious woman, and you go back in time, and a bunch of crazy things happen. The first act of this story is PHENOMENAL. I laughed several times, I gasped in surprise, I openly remarked to my wife in the other room \"This game is so pugging great!\" It's amazing. And honestly, I recommend exiting the game right there and basking in how good the first act was.\n\nBut if you didn't do that, that's too bad, because now you have to go through the second act. The above mystery woman, who you had a handful of conversations and have barely gotten to know suddenly thinks you find her interesting enough to set you on a journey witnessing her ENTIRE PUGGING LIFE STORY, and folks, it is a trope-laden, cliched, dismally boring slog. She was born with an illness of some sort (never fully explained) which sets her as The Doomed Girl. She meets a fellow student who is a Free Spirit but apparently not free-spirited or interesting enough to have any sort of life outside of being a good boyfriend. You will run through every major moment in their lives together along with way too many minor ones, with a progress bar telling you how much longer you'll need to keep going through this mind-numbing journey of two cardboard cutouts in a story so bland that whatever AI program was involved in writing it probably requested a pseudonym. I quit after almost three hours of gameplay because I stopped caring and wanted to do anything other than spend time with these characters for one second more.\n\nThis game rates as Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam and to you Yes voters, I am Overwhelmingly Positive you all are lying.

There are some light spoilers.\n\n\"I often wondered about whether games could really, truly change someone's life - make someone reflect on their life decisions, or help them clarify some of their thoughts about themselves or the world around them. I've played many games, some with great emotional impact or that were really fun experiences that brought me joy. But this one, Impostor Factory, this was one of the only ones that really changed me. That changed my life.\n\nWhen I played Finding Paradise, I cried at the end - Colin's obssession with the imaginary was something I found quite relatable. I thought that was the peak of what games could do for me, as at the time I was somewhat of a colder person. I enjoyed the game, called it a masterpiece, and moved on.\n\nThen four years later, Impostor Factory came along. I was now a different person, at a different mood and with different emotions. I was grappling with my own insecurities and fears of what the future would look like for me. I was clinging to the idea that I would live my life focusing on one single objective, and kind of ignore everything else, including relationships, to pursue that goal.\n\nSo when that conversation between Quincy and Lynri, about their different viewpoints on how life should be lived, occurred... something clicked with me. I began thinking more and more about this concept - Lavenders and Stars - and really question whether I really wanted to beeline myself into one single goal.\n\nMy time here is limited, and I didn't want to leave without leaving a mark, as a 'mediocre' person. But at the same time, I realized... I don't want to be alone. I realized I was masking my fear of coming out to my parents with the idea that I didn't want relationships, and as such would never have to discuss such things with them. I felt trapped and alone, but I didn't want to admit it. I had built up this totem of \"Relationships are dumb and I'm above them\" for so long that I couldn't question it anymore. It became almost a dogma.\n\nAfter all of that (and some conversations with some of my friends), I decided to come out to my mom. For eight years I knew I liked boys, but I never could muster the courage to tell it to her until now. At the end of the conversation, she hugged me and said that I should've said it much earlier, and that she would always support me. If I hadn't played this game and hadn't had those conversations, perhaps I would've just decided to go on with my life without telling her anything. Would I be a happy person? Perhaps, perhaps not. But without a doubt, this freed me from my cage.\n\nSo, yeah. Sorry for the wall of the text, and thanks again. I feel so much lighter than before, and your game really helped me with that.

Kan Gao and his team fully understand the medium game and the engine/artstyle they're using, and they have mastered that to the fullest. There is a reason why these games are so popular and that is that there are probably no other games like it, that have managed to tell a story with such excelence in worldbuilding, character drama and location design.\n\nA special shoutout once again to the incredible soundtrack.

Having completed the game myself now, I can understand why, although I disagree with any implication that the first two games are subsequently superior in story quality to this game.\n\nThis story feels like a mix of Cthulhu, Inception, and To The Moon. The mystery/horror elements are especially prevalent in the first act so I can see how this might startle fans that are expecting the same safe sad-but-feel-good story across all acts like in To The Moon and Finding Paradise, with maybe a touch of creepiness which Watts' sense of humor usually downplays. It certainly did not start off in the way I was expecting. Creatively I feel like it was trying to take a different approach to what was starting to turn into a formula developed for an episodic series and I found it refreshing. \n\nIt can be convoluted at points (I am including Inception on the story trope reference list for a reason), but the explanations hold and I enjoyed the experience throughout. The writing is still just as emotional and hopeful as the other entries. The qualities which made the other game stories so appealing are still there, including it's humor and dialogue beats. [spoiler]Ricebot is everything. Please give me rice. I want to taste the world's best rice.[/spoiler]\n\nKan Gao's composition makes a triumphant return for this game as well. Overall I hope that the developers will continue working on the series to provide a conclusive ending within a main game, since Eva and Neil's story is still ongoing and they only had minor appearances this time around.\n\nEDIT: I noticed at the time of writing this review that I beat the game in less than 4 hours.

Unlike the previous two titles, this one follows the story of new characters and the creation of the memory machine that Sigmund Corp. uses. While the story doesn't follow our beloved characters of Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene they still have a role to play, just as a minor role this time around. \n\nThe story this time around follows Quincy. Quincy arrives at a high-class party but doesn't quite understand why he's there. Unfortunately for Quincy the evening takes a quick turn when the hosts end up dead. Understandably Quincy freaks out a bit and ends up in the bathroom. Washing his hands however, seems to reset the entire evening. This is the beginning of an odd case of clue, in which the same people die and no one knows who's killing them. After a few resets, Quincy believes that he may have come across a lead when he sees one attendant has a duplicate self. Pursuing this lead begins the start of a long heartfelt slope into history. \n\nUnlike the previous titles in the series, this game doesn't use puzzles, and instead is primarily a walking simulator that provides answers to questions from previous titles, and leaves some open. It is not required to play the previous games to play this one, but I would highly recommend you do. The game does still utilize memory orbs like the previous games, these orbs are earned through interacting with environments or by witnessing events. This is the extent of any puzzles in the game. \n\nWhile the game did tend to be a shorter title, the information delivered was both intriguing and heartbreaking upon realizing what it meant. Just as you think you finally know exactly where the story is going, something happens to counteract that. Eventually, this no longer works but despite knowing what's to come what happens and is inevitable still holds impact. Not every story requires multiple twists and turns, nor does it require that its secrets remain hidden until the very end. Often, the best stories will give you the answer early on, and maybe not in the correct sequential order. These stories are the ones that still provide impact, draw the player into their world, and leave a mark on those willing to see it through to the end.

Otherwise, I'm not sure that the simple story, short playtime, and lack of meaningful game mechanics would grip you enough.", "timestamp_created": 1675528057, "timestamp_updated": 1675528057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132161504": {"recommendationid": "132161504", "author": {"steamid": "76561199132925299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1678417551}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 game", "timestamp_created": 1675479024, "timestamp_updated": 1675479024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132039051": {"recommendationid": "132039051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869884842", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1675450196}, "language": "english", "review": "it's Kan Gao's game, and all of his game's stories are masterpieces, burst me into tears everytime", "timestamp_created": 1675306762, "timestamp_updated": 1675306762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132029991": {"recommendationid": "132029991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373756834", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 176, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1675292406}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1675292492, "timestamp_updated": 1675292492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132023455": {"recommendationid": "132023455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031327741", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1675283601}, "language": "english", "review": "Flawless as expected.", "timestamp_created": 1675283742, "timestamp_updated": 1675283742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131897522": {"recommendationid": "131897522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002016480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1675118016}, "language": "english", "review": "THE SECRET INGREDIENT IS RICE", "timestamp_created": 1675119062, "timestamp_updated": 1675119062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131785029": {"recommendationid": "131785029", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087465635", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1674991618}, "language": "english", "review": "long cat, he protecc  =\uff3e\u25cf \u22cf \u25cf\uff3e=", "timestamp_created": 1674979267, "timestamp_updated": 1674979267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131769309": {"recommendationid": "131769309", "author": {"steamid": "76561199188375723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 349, "last_played": 1674958397}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved this game, got angry, cried, frustrated, overall the graphics were amazing, the storyline with the twist ,phenomenal!

Weird & insidious things happening in the mansion and time-travelling thing appears to be resetting and the protagonist male doesn't know what's going on and goes on to discover something deeper.\n\nI liked the introduction, but when digging deeper into the lore, I find myself getting more dissatisfied with how the lore leads.

I know the whole purpose of the game is giving the protagonist and the lady a chance to properly live together with a child but I don't really feel that emotional connection with it.\n\nThe art style is stunning. It's not typical RPG-Maker game and the character animations are very smooth and clear so you can see how the characters portray themselves, making it feel \"real\".\n\nThe story itself is story-rich indeed but did it hit super emotional level?

So when I started Impostor Factory, I was confused as to how the game started and its premise. Upon reaching the end, it became clear why this story was told in the way it was. For those looking for a rich narrative, and wonderful character development, this is the game for you. *YOU MUST PLAY TO THE MOON & FINDING PARADISE BEFORE PLAYING IMPOSTOR FACTORY* My review ends here but below I go in further depth as to why this game received a perfect score from me (Spoiler Free); \n\nSTORY\nThe narrative within this series is the primary focus to why these games are so good, and Impostor Factory is no stranger to this statement. Impostor Factory tells the story of innocent, upbeat, lovable Quincy as he receives an invitation to a dinner party. Entering, he is equally perplexed as he is astonished upon the establishment he has entered. As the evening progresses, a shocking turn of events unfold and as the player you are IMMEDIATELY immersed. Joining forces with another guest, it is your job to figure out what exactly is going on here, but is everything really as it seems...?\n\nGG's (Gameplay and Graphics)\nThis game has been developed by RPG Maker, so in terms of game-play mechanics, its as basic as it comes. You can move around and interact with npc's and the environment, however the main appeal here is the narrative and the music, both masterfully executed. The graphics are presented in the same common RPG Maker pallet, however the fantastic use of colours, saturation, and lighting utilised my Freebird Games encapsulate the themes, settings, and establishes the narrative your heart will fall for. Graphics are very accessible here as you can make the image to your liking via the options menu. \n\nMUSIC\nLast but certainly not least, the score in the series carry the emotions of the narrative. Every plot point, every sequence, the music perfectly encapsulates the themes presented and truly makes you feel for the characters and their emotions. Music is a very powerful tool for expression, and the composer here does such a fantastic job. Can definitely admit I've cried many times during each session and as the story progressed.", "timestamp_created": 1673396824, "timestamp_updated": 1673396824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130544364": {"recommendationid": "130544364", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980779856", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1658863099}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Gameplay 1/10 (y lo llaman videojuego, ja!), unos graficos penosos y todo pixelados, una historia super lineal sin toma de decisiones ni nada, no se que de un gato asesino y un lavabo-maquina del tiempo, y lavanada, mucha lavanda.

They did it. They FINALLY made a good game in this series! I wasn't expecting to like it, but they managed to make an engaging narrative driven game that kept me interested from beginning to end! It's still a tour through set pieces, but it wasn't boring or repetitive like the other games. It broke the mold and did something NEW, something INTERESTING, something I actually WANTED to keep playing! Even if it doesn't have a lot of replay value, it's still such a good game that you have to play it at least one time and experience the journey. I seriously recommend buying this and playing it for yourself. You don't even need to play the other games to enjoy this one. It's a great experience all on its own!\n\nBut, to go into further detail...\n\nSPOILERS, THIS IS A SUMMARY OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE GAME; \nYOU SHOULD PLAY IT FIRST AND THEN READ THE REST.\n\nThis game serves as an origin story for the Sigmund Corp. and for Dr. Neil Watts. \n\nHis mother, Lynri, was diagnosed with a hereditary disease with unpredictable patterns as a little girl. When she went to college, she met a man named Quincy. They debated over whether they enjoyed their lives or stuck with their careers. After graduating, they got married and made a compromise: Lynri would work for a group of scientists who created a prototype of the memory simulating machine, while Quince would be a stay-at-home husband. However, the machine ended up killing one of her colleagues during an experiment, causing her to leave her job and travel the world with Quince. When they came home, they found out she was pregnant with Neil.\n\nBut the pregnancy was difficult. Lynri found that her disease was in the early stages of altering her physical well-being and shortening her life expectancy. The treatment for the disease would've given Neil birth defects, so they chose to deliver him healthy and THEN undergo the treatment. The problem was they started too late, and the disease had its effects on her.\n\nLynri went back to Sigmund Corp., the company who licensed and improved the technology after the accident, to have her memories archived for Neil.\n\nNeil grew up as a healthy boy, but Lynri soon died. After being diagnosed as an adult with the same disease, he decided to take her place and pursue the same career. At Sigmund Corp., the technology was perfected, leading to the events of the previous games in the series.\n\nHis secret project was building a memory simulating machine that would let him access his mother's memories. He also uploaded a digital copy of Faye, Collin's imaginary friend from the last game, to help him with the process. The game is essentially simulations of Quincy and Lynri going through altered versions of her memories to stabilize the archived memories so Neil could see and keep them for himself.\n\nThe only problem is that the machine is running so many different copies of Quincy, Lynri, and her memories that the digital world they inhabit will soon collapse. Faye takes them out of the digital world and destroys it, but she's also able to give them an award. Since the latest copy of the simulation is the closest to Lynri's archived memories, Faye can send them through a portal so they can live the \"perfect timeline\", one where the family didn't have any issues with hereditary diseases, treatments, or Lynri's death, and they get their happy ending. \n\nOne minor problem I have is that it's not ENTIRELY believable (Neil loving Eva was pushing it too far), but it was still nice to see Neil give his parents a good life and better memories before shutting down the machine and keeping the archived memories.\n\nThis is easily the most interesting story in the series. It kept me guessing what would happen next, and I found the cast of characters to be more likable and interesting than ANYONE in the Sigmund Corp. It also made Neil a sympathetic character, one that I came to like for who he is internally, and what he was trying to achieve the whole time.\n\nIt also helps that the gameplay actually changes things up and doesn't get repetitive or boring. It's still a tour through set pieces, and they occasionally have you gathering memory links and bringing them to a memento; but it's made a lot shorter and easier to find everything and move on to the next segment; and, more importantly, I legitimately enjoyed THIS tour through THESE set pieces. \n\nThis journey through Lynri's simulated memories was far more emotional, interesting, and left a greater impact than either of the patients from the other games. I actually cared about what was happening to Neil's family, and I wanted to see how it would end.\n\nFreebird Games finally won me over with \"Impossible Factory\", and I'm legitimately excited to see where the series goes next!", "timestamp_created": 1672897066, "timestamp_updated": 1672897066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130138493": {"recommendationid": "130138493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074211097", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1672866904}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1672867051, "timestamp_updated": 1672867051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130135960": {"recommendationid": "130135960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107612622", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1672863458}, "language": "english", "review": "I thought it would take so long to finish the game but actually it was not that long and quite enjoyable run!

I will say that this really felt like a game for us- the players of the series. Though it's like that not so much in the sense that it picks up perfectly where the last game left off (Apparently this takes place right after the previous game), but more so that the story really resonates with you should you have the experience of the previous games under your belt.\n\nOther than that though, this is still an excellent entry in the Free Bird portfolio. As expected of them the pixel art is fantastic (So many new sprites!), the overall art direction was on point, the writing was wonderfully engaging, and the music was gorgeous. My only complaint in these areas was that there were very few times that the playable character had anything to say when interacting with the environment, and those are usually some of my favorite interactions.

No podemos interactuar con casi nada, apenas hay interacciones divertidas porque la mayor parte del tiempo est\u00e1s solo y no hay nada de juego. Te dedicas literalmente a ver pasillos sin ning\u00fan tipo de interacci\u00f3n, un espectador en el sentido m\u00e1s literal de la palabra, como si te hubiesen tirado la historia triste a la cara y nada, a ver cosas y recorrer pasillos.\n\nSin entrar en spoilers no hace falta m\u00e1s que ver los detalles del producto que ni ellos mismos saben lo que est\u00e1n haciendo con el juego. Te lo dejan caer como que es un thriller de asesinatos, te dejan caer que puede estar relacionado con los dos juegos anteriores de alguna manera, pero no me acaba de convencer. \n\nLa primera mitad del juego es sopor\u00edfera por el problema de que no sabes muy bien lo que pasa y tu personaje apenas dice nada al respecto. Los otros dos juegos funcionan tan bien porque en la mayor parte del tiempo sabes lo que est\u00e1 pasando, y los dos protagonistas tienen muy buena qu\u00edmica lo que hace que los momentos tensos o tristes transicionen mejor y no sea una retah\u00edla de historias tristes que no sabes ni a d\u00f3nde lleva. \n\nLa segunda mitad del juego no voy a decir mucho por razones de spoilers pero se pone un poco mejor, pero no culpo a nadie que haya abandonado el juego antes de llegar a ese punto.\n\nNo lo s\u00e9, no me veo rejugando a este juego de nuevo al contrario que los otros dos, la verdad. Protagonista soso, poca interacci\u00f3n... Esta saga estaba haciendo un worldbuilding interesante en los dos primeros juegos y aunque aqu\u00ed hay algo de ello, es lo mismo de siempre. Te dejan el caramelo en la boca con un posible plot twist que nunca resuelven y ya han pasado m\u00e1s de diez a\u00f1os y oportunidades no les han faltado, creo que ya va siendo hora de cerrar los misterios que llevan en el aire desde el principio.

[/b] Great, buy Impostor Factory. You may not love it as much as the previous games, but you will enjoy it. However, I strongly suggest you replay Finding Paradise before you pick this one up. Trust me, it will help you later!\n\n[b] Have you never touched To the Moon or Finding Paradise? [/b] Okay, then go play those games. Please start with To the Moon. After that, play Finding Paradise. If you end up liking those games, then pick up Impostor Factory. Despite what the Steam description says, you should [b] NOT [/b] play this game without having experienced the other two games. The significance of Impostor Factory\u2019s final act will be lost on you without the context of the previous games.\n\nThat\u2019s it the for the quick review. A more detailed review and some minor structural spoilers lies ahead. Nothing major in terms of moment-to-moment plot points will be discussed, but turn around now if you want to go in completely blind.\n\nTo put it bluntly, I feel as if Impostor Factory has something of an identity crisis.\n\nThe first section of the game presents itself as a murder mystery. The tone in these opening moments is striking when compared against To the Moon or Finding Paradise. You\u2019re not a doctor trudging through the memories of a dying patient anymore. There is a very real and immediate sense of danger seeping through the mansion, and it is [i] lovely [/i] to play through. Quincy does not have the previous weird-world experience mastered by Neil or Eva. He is very much afraid and unequipped to handle the strange situations that he finds himself in, and it is an absolute joy to help him unravel the secrets of the mansion. You never quite feel safe, and you\u2019ll be dying to know what happens next.\n\nHowever, for better or worse, the game begins to shift at the midway point. Without slipping too deep into spoiler territory, the story eventually drifts into something that is much more reminiscent of the previous games. The tension is deflated, cast away as if it had never been there at all. Likewise, the then-current items of conflict are unceremoniously put on hold in favor of the usual melodrama that Freebird is known for.\n\nAnd while that melodrama may be interesting, it isn't consistent either. Towards the end of the game, the story\u2019s focus shifts once more. What comes next is, for lack of a better word, surreal. The game\u2019s tries to hit you with a curveball, but the pitch just doesn\u2019t find its mark. Your millage may vary, but I can\u2019t help but feel as if Freebird just did not know how to close the story.\n\nWith this being the case, Impostor Factory left me disappointed. The story raises many questions, but it dares to leave half of them unanswered or floundering with half-baked resolutions. The more I sit with story, the more I feel as if Freebird just did not know what type of game they wanted to make. A murder mystery? A heart-felt, down to earth drama? The rambling dreams of a surrealist? There are so many interesting ideas on display, but they just don't have the focus needed to properly develop. \n\nImpostor Factory is my least favorite entry in the series, but the game isn't awful. Wasted potential, maybe, but by no means is it a waste of your time. Even if the story isn\u2019t perfect, many of its big moments are still very, very good. The series appears to be building towards something bigger, and I am definitely interested in seeing where Freebird takes the story next. My one hope is that they'll settle on a consistent plotline next time.\n\nEither way, set aside about four hours for yourself to play the game. If you are able to do so, I suggest playing through the game in one shot / session; I feel like that's the best way to experience Impostor Factory. While the story may not tug on the same heartstrings that To the Moon did, you will most definitely walk away with a memorable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1668810494, "timestamp_updated": 1668837673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125566053": {"recommendationid": "125566053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198813140617", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1668594944}, "language": "english", "review": "Sussy", "timestamp_created": 1668596146, "timestamp_updated": 1668596146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640196859836578369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125558699": {"recommendationid": "125558699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271434420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1668578910}, "language": "spanish", "review": "(Despues de To The Moon y Finding Paradisie) Una historia m\u00e1s que deja con ganas de m\u00e1s.\nResulta el m\u00e1s lineal y menos interactivo (pero tambi\u00e9n fluido) de los tres.

You'll walk in a straight line for 3 hours, with minimal choices as you do, and little commentary. Sadly, you gain nothing from being the one playing the game, you could get by watching a no-commentary playthrough and have the same experience as everyone else in the reviews. (i.e. following Act 1, you'll just be pressing the W key and reading.)\n\nHaving played all the of the predecessors of this series, I can confidentially that this instalment is odd. The game starts off on a very different note then it ends, and the contrast in themes/gameplay gave me mild whiplash. The first act was excellent, and the mystery element was really, really engaging, but the later acts became a lot more dense. The art has improved greatly, but I found myself asking, \"Okay, so when does the prologue end/when does the game start?\" multiple times. (Maybe I'm heartless, but I didn't really feel moved by a lot of what I was reading--it wanted to be relatable but felt more fantastical. I think To The Moon was far easier to resonate with.)\n\nWhat got me is that there's no game. No choices, minimal object interaction, little exploration. Don't let the first act fool you, 90% of the later acts is holding down W while your character walks down a path. It's just a long flashback that could have been summarized into a 2-minute segment of any other game.

Impostor Factory on the whole is a pretty good game with an engaging storyline, but isn't as direct or relatable as the previous two games. This story gets its value in the writing twists as opposed to emotional breakthrough moments, but the writing is still very good.\n\nThe graphics and writing excel in this game compared to the previous games. The scenery and characters are excellent and there are a lot of very nice little details: In one scene at an airport, there's a person at the bottom of the screen with their phone charging in the wall. The music is fitting and enjoyable, but I didn't enjoy it as much as To the Moon or Finding Paradise.\n\nI would say the promise of Impostor Factory being \"bonkers\" and \"categorically out of its mind\" are about right. The details of the story are abstract and confusing at times, which might make the game worth playing a second time. But as the story relies on twists and shock moments, replay value is much more limited compared to the previous two games - I've replayed To the Moon a few times and still love it. I don't know if I could play Impostor Factory more than twice without it losing the charm. On the first playthrough though many of the moments in the story are memorable, if not just a different tone than that of the previous games.\n\nA pretty good game, but different.",

Absolutely loved the experience by the end of it.  \n\nIt has some issues that I think are worth talking about.  As much as I loved it by the end, some of the story's choices make it lag in places.  SPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nAct 1 introduces a fun, almost sci-fi themed murder mystery with a mysterious woman, time travel, and lots and lots of dead bodies.  But, Act 2 all of the sudden thrusts us into an entirely different story about a young woman battling a hereditary condition that gets married and tries to find purpose.  So, essentially, the game promises a murder mystery and then forgoes that for a drama.  While Act 2 does provide us a somber, yet hopeful viewing into someone's life that can be very beautiful - it feels disappointing next to the interesting sci-fi murder mystery.\n\nNow, Act 3 does bring it ALL together.  And I personally really enjoyed Act 3.  Ricebot is the best.  Long cat will never be forgotten.  There are some things that are revealed that really make your head spin (in the best way in my opinion).\n\nBy the end, I loved it.  But, the journey to getting to that can laboring.  I think for some people, Act 2 can be beautiful. \nIt discusses life, death, purpose, etc. and can really hit home for some.  I'm sure the experience for this game is going to be different across the board.  For me personally, I wish Act 2 could have been condensed or could have had more going on.  For example, I would have liked to see long cat throughout the game as our main character's companion so he can have someone to talk to about everything he's seeing.  Having fun interactions between their characters would have helped the story a lot.  Because he only says a few words for 2 hour span of Act 2 and I wanted to hear him talk.\n\nOverall, loved the game a lot.  I came out of crying my eyes and feeling intensely philosophical.  It may have some issues, but I enjoyed the experience overall and would recommend it for anyone who's a fan of the \"To the Moon\" storyline.\n", "timestamp_created": 1657678762, "timestamp_updated": 1657678762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118721903": {"recommendationid": "118721903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156984500", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1657671809}, "language": "english", "review": "Stellar work once again from the man who's relentlessly making me cry like a b*tch for the 3rd game in a row.

When I first watched the trailer, I was really concerned. This did not look at all like To the Moon or Finding Paradise. After completing the game, I can confirm that if you want another game like the first two, you're in luck. A wonderful emotional story awaits you. I can also confirm that the trailer is pretty much accurate. How those two are both true is a bit of a mystery, but it works. If you enjoyed the other games in this series, you'll enjoy this I have no doubt.\n\nThe music is wonderful as always. The game-play is definitely refined. To be fair, the worst aspect of To the Moon was the tedious searching for enough colourful balls to move to the next scene, then solving a picture puzzle. Finding Paradise made things a little better, but Impostor Factory takes the cake. This game does away with the puzzle, and the colourful balls come to you as you experience the story, so it plays much more fluidly, and you won't be stuck in one scene for far longer than was intended.\n\nAs stated in the game's description, you can play this game independently of the others. I will say (without spoiling anything) that there are a couple of moments that would have no real impact if you hadn't played the previous games, whereas the impact they had on me was significant. So my recommendation would definitely be to play the other games first.\n\nSo yeah, highly recommended. If you're at a loss after watching the trailer and reading the description, good!

I never played the other two games in the series, so maybe that had something to do with the bad experience I had with the game. This game has no gameplay. There is like 1 puzzle you have to solve at the beginning, but after that it is just walking and cutscenes. This game can be easily split into three parts. The first part was probably the most fun I had with the game, as it was more or less true to the promises that the steam description gave it. It was a time loop murder mystery game, and frankly that was somewhat enjoyable. About an hour or so into the game, you go through a random door, and are transported to what I can only call the worst excuse for a section of a video game I've ever had the displeasure of playing. It is a more or less 2 hour hallway that you traverse down and interact with balls that play cutscenes that reveal the life of one of the (at this point) random NPCs that are in the mansion. This section goes on for way too long, and frankly if there was any gameplay in it, maybe I would have found it enjoyable, but it was just a movie that I had to babysit. After this long slog, that really only kinda matters, you get to act 3. Act 3 is really \"cool\" because it basically invalidates Act 1, and just kinda throws whatever at the wall and hopes that it will stick. Turns out the mansion is a simulation, you're not a real person, and there's something messing up the timeline. This sounds cool, because oh it's a murder mystery again, but no, turns out the villain is just a character that was never introduced before, alludes to vague simulation stack overflow essentially, and you get more or less the same cutscenes from act 2, but you are on the roof of the mansion.

Since then, superb story writing is something synonymous with this company. This time, they took a slightly different approach to the story\u2019s theme. While it\u2019s not as emotionally compelling as the previous entry, I find Impostor Factory to be one of the most enjoyable story-driven games I\u2019ve played recently. \n\n[h2][b]Now, about the game[/b] [/h2]\n[b] In a nutshell, the reasons I\u2019m particularly fond of Impostor Factory were that: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*] Superb story writing \u2013 as expected of Freebird games, they always deliver\n    [*] Can be played independently without clearing the previous entries\n    [*] Simple yet rewarding gameplay\n    [*] Brilliant soundtrack that complements each scene\n    [*] Sentient rice cooker that cooks godly rice and long cat that protecc\n[/list]\n[h3]Classic RPG opener[/h3]\nI mentioned before that Impostor Factory is the third entry of the series. Now, you might think that you have to play the previous entries to understand the story, but fret not! While it\u2019s somewhat a sequel, Impostor Factory is a standalone experience that rewards both new and long-time followers of the series with its weighty emotional story and sci-fi plot that relate to the other entries.\n\nThe story kicks off with Quincy, our main character, arriving at a fancy party in the middle of nowhere. Being told that he was the first one to arrive and feeling out of place, he decided to take a look around the mansion where he met a fellow guest, Lynri, on the second floor of the mansion; this confused him as he was told that he was the first one to arrive. The party progressed and everything was fine until Quincy discovered that the host was brutally murdered. But that\u2019s not all, things started to get even weirder as the corpse suddenly vanished, leaving no trace whatsoever. That event left Quincy in a panic state to the point that he suspects even the household cat as a potential killer, which makes me laugh at how ridiculous it was. Strange things are happening and everything is not how it seems to be. What happens next is horror-comedy slapstick with Quincy at its center.\n\nI have to mention that despite Impostor Factory being a 16-bit game, everything is beautifully illustrated, from the huge mansion in the middle of nowhere to the lush lavender field. In addition, the characters had a detailed design and smooth animation. You can see the amount of love and effort poured into this, big props to Freebird Games.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2813216850 \n[h3]Simple and straightforward gameplay[/h3]\nGameplay-wise, I think there aren\u2019t that many changes from the previous entries. Impostor Factory uses the classic RPG exploration mechanic: you explore the area to find hidden orbs that would allow progression to the next area. Now, I know that gathering hidden objects tended to be tedious in older RPGs, but not in this one. As you look for these orbs, you\u2019ll find glimpses of memories that show you the tale of Quincy, which made the gathering feel a lot less tedious and more rewarding since you get to know his backstory in the process.\n\nI tend to explore every room before moving on to the next area, especially on classic RPGs like this, and Impostor Factory is what I call a short game. Including the exploration part, it took me close to six hours to completely clear it.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2813219259 \n[h3]Beautiful soundtrack[/h3]\nFreebird Game once again proved themselves as a genius not only in writing up brilliant stories but also in composing beautiful soundtracks. They did it so exceptionally well that you can feel how the character felt at that given moment. It lightens the vibe during a comedy scene, hypes you up during a thriller scene, and best of all, it brings the emotional scene to the next level. All in all, the soundtrack did a perfect job in delivering a wonderful experience and is definitely on my playlist now.\n\n[h2][b]Overall[/b][/h2]\nEver since I finished To The Moon a few years ago, I got completely hooked on the series. So far, none of the entries have disappointed me, including this one. Even with its simple gameplay, Freebird Game manages to create yet another gem. The best thing about Impostor Factory was the quality of the story writing; they successfully made it hilarious and profound at the same time. While It\u2019s slightly lacking compared to the previous entries, Impostor Factory is still a great read and I truly enjoyed playing through it. For those who are looking for a good narrative, I highly recommend you give Impostor Factory a shot. Even when it\u2019s not on sale, it\u2019s absolutely worth every penny, especially if you\u2019re planning to get into the To The Moon series.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2813216861\n[quote]Follow our Curator page, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41449676/] Summit Reviews[/url], to see more high-quality reviews regularly.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1653630287, "timestamp_updated": 1658390187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736014664173126221", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116059022": {"recommendationid": "116059022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017348763", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1653601628}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful game.\nTo the moon and Finding Paradise took me a while to finish.. even though they are amazing games.. but I need to be in the mood to play games like that.\nImposter Factory didn't take me nearly that long to complete.\n\nWhat a story, what an experience!", "timestamp_created": 1653601810, "timestamp_updated": 1653601810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116009987": {"recommendationid": "116009987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025564347", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1653515154}, "language": "english", "review": "It wasn't really as enjoyable as the other games from Kan Gao, mostly because you did not really \"play\" anything.

games but here we are. Let's get a few things out of the way first: the OST? Amazing as usual. The graphics? It's the usual pixel art but even better. The characters? Complex and with an interesting story to tell... but yeah, the two main characters' story is what really disappointed me. If you're into the whole Sigmund Corp. drama that's been going on since To the Moon then yes, play this game. But if you're like me and play these games for the \"two main characters plot\" that starts and ends all in the same game then no... it's kind of a huge disappointment here.\n\n(SPOILERS)\nI really enjoyed act one and almost cried a few times during act two. But then the game basically tells you that nothing is real and everything is just a simulation. Yep, those weren't the real Quincy and Lynri, just an alternative version of them. As soon as the game said this I lost most of the connection I had with them and simply stopped caring.

I kinda miss those mini games that engages players other than going through the gameplay itself but story driven packed with drama and humour, took over the missing element.\n\nBUT overall, I really had fun playing this story telling video game and looking forward to Freebird Games' next game!!!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/a01IpwBzgwM", "timestamp_created": 1649458849, "timestamp_updated": 1649458849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113520320": {"recommendationid": "113520320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078522815", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1638541581}, "language": "english", "review": "ricebot", "timestamp_created": 1649419013, "timestamp_updated": 1649419013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113508931": {"recommendationid": "113508931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991900357", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1645525658}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a cool little story but I just hate how none of the choices I made had an impact, it's like I am watching a movie and I am not really doing anything.

Incredibly well-written story, characters, great music and gorgeous artwork keep you glued to the screen for about 4-5 hours. The type of story is definitely something new compared to the previous entries in the To The Moon-saga, but as it progresses it's revealed as a logical next chapter. The pacing is much better than the previous two, because there's fewer forced gameplay elements in there and it makes for a beter flowing story. I have to say that I was sobbing uncontrollably with To The Moon and Finding Paradise at the end of each game, Impostor Factory did not hit me as had in the end. That is hardly criticism, though, as several emotional scenes brought tears to my eyes all throughout the story this time around.

The writing is superb and the music is very phenomenal. There were some issues with the older game, but it was just very minor compared to overall experience in playing this game. These three games are the good games that make you reflecting your life and asking yourself questions about life. \n\nThe storytelling in this game is exceptional, you can feel the sadness, laugh awkwardly at the dry humor, feel proud for the character's achievement, and even roll your eyes at some jokes. The story is one of the strongest point of these three games, I highly recommend you to play this game without any walkthrough or read spoiler to enjoy the game to maximum level. \n\nThe music in this game is truly phenomenal it deserved a special paragraph in this review. I regrets that I only played [b] Impostor Factory [/b] using my headset. If you have a proper headset or headphone, try playing these games using your headset/headphone to appreciate the music.

I'm not saying its bad, but compared to the others I felt like it wasn't connected as well. The story itself is still strong, having strong characters and an interesting hook throughout the game. The ending is a little confusing, but still satisfying. The only negatives I can think of is that it's somewhat the weakest story of the three games but it's like saying it's an 8/10 while the other two are 9/10. Also these are story-based games so there's little gameplay. However the stories are strong enough to keep me going back to them. I'm planning on playing all three games all at once and see how this connects to the other two. \n\nI love this developer studio for creating such heartwarming and emotional stories.

Quien realiza un juego tiene un objetivo en mente. FromSoftware realiza un juego con miras en ofrecer un sistema de combate pulido hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle. Por otro lado, cualquier juego de Telltale Games tiene la intenci\u00f3n de ponerte en la piel de un personaje, y tomar decisiones que dirigir\u00e1n el rumbo de tu historia. Criticar a Telltale Games por tener un combate aburrido, o a FromSoftware por no emocionarte con su historia, serian cr\u00edticas, en mi opini\u00f3n, injustas. \nPor eso mismo creo que esta saga de tres videojuegos hechos por Freebird Games es perfecta. Desarrollaron sus juegos con la intenci\u00f3n de contar una historia. No se propusieron que cada jugador viva su propia historia, y por eso no tiene sentido que haya decisiones. Detener el guion seria cortar la fluidez de la narrativa, y por eso no tiene sentido que haya combate. Los recuerdos son preciadas posesiones para las personas, por eso tiene sentido que hayan decidido \u201cEncriptarlos\u201d y darle al jugador la tarea de desencriptarlos mediante mini juegos en forma de puzles. \nEn mi opini\u00f3n, lo que hace a un juego bueno, es que se proponga un objetivo (O m\u00e1s de uno) y lo cumpla.

It's also not a great game, unfortunately. It pains me to say that, because I've waited for it ever since it was announced and literally counted hours until the official launch to play it immediately once it was out. I even gave myself weeks, which then turned into months, to digest the game and mull it over before forming any final thoughts, because i hoped i'd change my mind. A lot of people are very positive about this game and i felt my experience was an outlier of some sort. This review is partly for people who also had a similar experience and partly for me to accept that this game didnt live up to my expectations.\n\nFirst of all, i have to say, i felt and still kinda feel lied to by this game's marketing. It is being sold as a murder mystery but it is not one. It [i]appears[/i] to be one at the start, i'll give it that. However, the mystery gets basically explained to the player with their minimal input.\n\nSpeaking of that, the simple puzzle segments and interactions with the environment are gone. I do have to say, it felt as if the world was much more empty because of it, but perhaps that was the point. That doesn't change the fact that their absence was very much felt. I've seen many people complain about how this is basically a walking sim now but the To The Moon series was always kinda in the walking sim genre, besides the genre itself is not a bad thing. I always thought that these games were more about the story than the gameplay, honestly.\n\nThe thing is, the story is not very good in my opition. Going forward i'll be discussing some story elements in detail so [b]Heavy Spoiler Warning[/b]. Also this is obviously just my personal opinion and i'm a biased being.\n\nI feel that, contrary to most negative reviews i've seen, i'm one of the few people who didn't like the game but ended up liking Lynri as a character. Even before I got to play, i was already immensely excited about finally getting what i presumed to be a female patient for Neil and Eva (oh how naive i was back then!). The thing is - i like Lynri as a character. I don't really like the story she's in though. While playing through her flashbacks i was excited to see that she was her own character and seemed to be all about leaving a legacy behind, which seemed to be majorly motivated by her unspecified disease. I liked that as her drive! She seemed ambitious and i was curious to see what she would face.\n\nThen we meet the flashback Quincy. I feel like i'm gonna be in the very small minority here when i say that i Really [i]Really[/i] dislike him as a character. Don't get me wrong, i loved seeing his friendship with Lynri develop, i was actually very excited about the possibility of them staying strictly platonic friends. And then my hopes were squandered. I know that the TTM series kinda has a formula of being focused around characters who have families and love lives and romance is always a part of the story, but with how much Impostor Factory was changing up things i hoped that the story wouldn't be so... tried. Not only that, but Quincy gets rejected and still [i]Insists[/i] on getting together with Lynri even when she says no the first time.\n\nQuincy introduces the conflict of domestic bliss vs successful career which i very much dislike. There were several scenes showing the player that Lynri was focusing more on her work than on the relationship and it was portrayed negatively, while i was sitting there going ????? because ???? of course this would happen???? She specifically stated that she won't be able to balance her personal life and work when rejecting Quincy and [i]he[/i] was the one who insisted on going out even if that was the case, i honestly don't know what he expected. \n\nAnother thing that irks me is that after the travelling montage it seems that Lynri never gets to try to find a new fullfilling job ever again. She is immediately pregnant and then later on has to make a choice between her own life or the baby's. I'm gonna be honest, this story beat made it too \"pro-life\" to comfort for me. Especially since the choice to choose her life ends up being framed as the bad and selfish one. I could write entire paragraphs on how women in the TTM series are mostly only mothers or love interests and how disappointed i was to find out that even in a game about her we mostly experience everything from the perspective of her lover and she's not allowed to exist on her own but instead ends up being Neil's mother as a twist. I really dislike the fact that in the timeline where she chooses herself she ends up being completely miserable.\n\nThe whole simulation thing just made it look really unnecessarily complicated and honestly felt like this whole ordeal was kinda meaningless in the end. I didn't really feel anything during the ending, which i think is just... kinda sad, considering the other games in the series.

In different type of game it would be a bad thing, but in this case it makes sense, because in this type of game the story is the main focus, gameplay is just a bonus, at least that's how I feel about it.

Just finished this game and I'm disappointed. Before I start, I went into this having never played any other games by this studio, I think playing their other games first is a good idea before playing this.\n\nThat out of the way, this game was two glaring issues, both related to each other. The first is that the gameplay changes completely. It starts as a point and click adventure then totally changes in act 2 to a walking simulator visual novel. The second is the pacing, as Act 2 utterly destroys all the buildup and intrigue from act 1. You go from a murder mystery to an extremely long flashback of a side character's entire life. I have never seen a game squander a good first act so poorly. Imagine if you were playing a Resident Evil game where after you beat the first boss, the entire rest of the game is just unskippable cutscenes of Barry's trials and tribulations going through adolescence, getting bullied, losing his grandpa, being inspired by to win a spelling bee, and losing his virginity.\n\nNow, that being said, I think that as a visual novel, act 2 is a good story with good writing. The issue really is just that it is such a jarring shift that left me feeling totally unsatisfied, as I kept asking myself \"Why the hell am I watching the life story of this person who had barely any screen time in act 1? Why would I want to watch this after act 1?\"\n\nI also was pretty confused and unsatisfied by the ending, because [spoiler] I came into this under the impression this was a standalone game, and questioned why the game was expecting me to care about Neil or his wife/gf who I knew absolutely nothing about since I hadn't played any other game in the series. It felt so weird that I picked up on it being fanservice. It fell totally flat for me and really ruined the ending. If your whole ending is gonna be devoted to being fanservice for previous games in the series, be more open about it having a definitive place in this whole series in the game's description. Not having played the prior games severely hampered my enjoyment of the ending. [/spoiler]\n\nUltimately, I just want people reading this to be aware that most of this game is just watching cutscenes and reading dialogue and not solving a murder mystery in a time loop, which was not my expectation from the promotional materials.", "timestamp_created": 1641375618, "timestamp_updated": 1641377235, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650127708911895752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107357645": {"recommendationid": "107357645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146726330", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 422, "last_played": 1639642628}, "language": "english", "review": "[spoiler] everyone and everything is sus [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1641366308, "timestamp_updated": 1641366308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542966067790985107", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107346386": {"recommendationid": "107346386", "author": {"steamid": "76561199077760071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1652663093}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Loved it.

It maintains the art & comedic style of the previous titles, but is completely disconnected from the main story until the very end.  Regardless, it still feels resonate to the rest of the series, focusing on regrets, memories, & the idea of adjusting past mistakes in one's own fantasy.  A rather sudden & wonderfully confusing 1st act kicks in that leaves the the main character, Quincy, to begin questioning everything around him.  It, along with the music, draws the player in for another ride of a story, leading to an eventual heartwarming/heartbreaking climax, depending on the player's point of view.\n\n[b][u]CONS[/u]:[/b] Once again, all of the same problems, but with a neat little twist.  The 1st act is a mystery that feels like it ends a bit too quickly, & the 2nd act plods along.  The 3rd act is about what one would come to expect from this series.  A noticeable take away is definitely the lack of a Laura Shigihara song at the end.  That's about all one can give, considering how similar the Sigmund Corp Series games tend to be.\n\n[b][u]ACHIEVEMENT[/u]:[/b] Another one for completing the story.  Another simple, several hour trail to completion.\n\n[b][u]FINAL[/u]:[/b] Impostor Factory feels more interested in pulling in new players compared to the previous title, but it's still very similar.  These games are good, emotionally resonant, but are simply stories.  If you enjoyed the previous titles in this series, then you will enjoy this.  If you were curious or cautious about the series, & for some reason haven't tried To The Moon, then this may be a decent starting point before going back to the rest.

If you're looking for a game of the mystery thriller genre, not too sure if this is the game for you. It's sorta part of the premise but I can't go into too much detail without spoiling the plot. Trust me when I say it's mostly heart-warming like the previous games and if you haven't played To the Moon and Finding Paradise (grab A Bird Story while you're at it if you can), then you'll be missing out on a lot of the plot elements so I definitely don't recommend you playing this game before at least finishing To the Moon. \n\nBesides that, the dialogue between the characters made it really personable especially with the struggles I'm facing as a working adult and growing older. They felt very real to me in that regard and that's what made me love the characters a whole lot. \n\nThe removal of the memento puzzle segments made the experience more immersive as well (less hindrances to the story) however, I think there's a missed opportunity to have more \"point-and-click\" puzzle sections which would've made it more interactive though I guess it depends on the developer's ability to implement such puzzles in a thought-provoking manner with the setting of the To the Moon games. From what I remember of Kan's previous game titled \"The Mirror Lied\", there's definitely potential to develop this area.\n\nOverall, though it didn't make me bawl like a baby,I think Impostor Factory might be my favourite episode of the 3 games that have been released!

It builds upon the previous two games in the series in some ways, but in other ways it struggles. Overall, it's still an enjoyable experience if you liked the previous games. If you didn't like To the Moon or FInding Paradise, however, this may not be your cup of tea.\n\nFor starters, Ken Gao and the rest of the devs at Freebird did a great job with the graphics. Considering the fact that they're using RPG Maker and are such a small studio, it's really impressive what they pulled off. It is abundantly clear that they have learned over the years, which is made apparent by looking at the progressive improvements in the graphics from To the Moon, to Finding Paradise, and finally Imposter Factory.\n\nThe music in this game is alright. It's certainly not bad, but I'd say its predecessors had more memorable OSTs. Unlike the previous games, I don't remember the tunes or names of any of the tracks in this game. By no means is the soundtrack bad, it's just not as memorable as To the Moon's or Finding Paradise's in my opinion.\n\nAs for gameplay, it hasn't changed much. They completely removed the puzzles in between levels, which I believe they did in Finding Paradise but it still bears mentioning. The devs also removed the little scavenger hunts for the items to unlock the memories. In my opinion, this was a good change because they didn't do much other than pad out the game time for no real reason. However, due to this, there isn't much gameplay other than walking and interacting with characters/objects. If you find that type of gameplay boring, you may not enjoy this very much.\n\nFinally, the story was alright. If you're worried about spoilers, I'd skip this paragraph. It wasn't as captivating, climactic, or emotional as the other two games to me personally. Similar to my point about the music, it certainly isn't bad. Far from it, in fact. They introduce a lot of interesting concepts/lore in this game that seem to build up to future games. In fact, that would probably be the main reason it isn't as feel-heavy as the previous installments, it's simply not as focused on doing that like the other two games were. That isn't to say it's a boring or soulless experience, either. There are moments akin to those in To the Moon and Finding Paradise, but they're less impactful and less frequent. Instead, focus is shifted to worldbuilding and lore information.\n\nSo, with that all said, do I recommend the game? Yes, given you have played To the Moon and Finding Paradise. Whilst it may not be as strong of an entry in the series as the other two, it is still very much an enjoyable experience. The graphics are impressive, the story is good, and the gameplay is streamlined. If you enjoyed the predecessors, than I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy Imposter Factory as well.\n\nAlso, the name's sussy, so that's funny", "timestamp_created": 1640468380, "timestamp_updated": 1641313601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711458504199981689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106523320": {"recommendationid": "106523320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045235510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1640467262}, "language": "english", "review": "What can be said at this point?

Usually there is relationship focus and this one is no different. It does have a pretty nice start that I can\u2019t say anything about to spoil. Imposter Factory does further expand and build the universe upon it\u2019s previous 2 games. \n\n [h1]Previous Games Encouraged[/h1]\nThe devs say you don\u2019t need to play the game to enjoy this and that is true for the main character and his story, but there moments usually towards the end that will either feel weird or have no impact and not feel as epic if you don\u2019t play the other 2 in the series, so it\u2019s not required, just strongly encouraged. Just get all 3, they don\u2019t last longer than 5 hours each. \n\n[h1] It\u2019s All About Character[/h1]\nI will mention that if you saw the trailer and expected this wild crazy scif-fi horror/mystery game, it\u2019s a jebait as to not spoil the real story for fans. It focuses more on two characters and their life choices, its ups and downs and carries heavy themes about family, job struggles, working through a relationship and more that will eventually as always make you feel for these characters and maybe even hate them and eventually will at one point break you down. Fans know to expect it and they still throw those emotional punches that hit.\n\n[h1] Less Gameplay =  Better?[/h1]\nThe gameplay is just a walking simulator and potentially cutscene simulator. Here the complaints from the last game are gone; you can now sprint so it\u2019s a running simulator. Then they made the best discussion to cut the stupid artificial \u201cgameplay\u201d tetris thing that is was used to halt the story. Here you just go to an object tied to the character and collect an orb to unlock the next scene. Usually these orbs are just given after scenes to make sure you see everything and not rush past an important moment or dialogue and no longer halt the pacing and why we play the game the story and characters, mostly written by one guy. It\u2019s almost a style or genre at this point and glad to be supporting this hidden gem and hope you give it a shot and feel the same.\n\n[b]PAID:  $10[/b]\n[b]COMPLETED IN: 4 hours[/b]\nhttps://youtu.be/Y32GV1-ClRA\n[h1] Games Similar I recommend:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*] [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/calibrojosh/recommended/337340]Finding Paradise[/url]\n    [*] [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/calibrojosh/recommended/501300]What Remains of Edith Finch[/url]\n    [*] [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/calibrojosh/recommended/714120]Little Miss Fortune [/url]    \n   [*] [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/calibrojosh/recommended/1203710]Unmetal [/url]\n     [/list]\t\n[h1]Games looking to try next:[/h1]\n    [*]Night in the Woods\n    [*]Behind the Frame: The Finest Scenery\n    [*]Twelve Minutes\n    [*]Before Your Eyes", "timestamp_created": 1640251700, "timestamp_updated": 1644119279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106289336": {"recommendationid": "106289336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151226957", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1640179388}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel", "timestamp_created": 1640179620, "timestamp_updated": 1640179620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106273111": {"recommendationid": "106273111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847422065", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1640149516}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Another incredible game, I cried like a child, Freebird games did it again, Altough I would have wished to hear a song like \"Everything's alright by Laura Shigihara\" but all the music was great, my score: 100/10, Amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1640150867, "timestamp_updated": 1640150867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106271705": {"recommendationid": "106271705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035857269", "num_games_owned": 572, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1640148351}, "language": "english", "review": "The sequel to the hit games To the Moon and Finding Paradise, does it hold up?

The real problem I have with this game is it loses its mystery element to quickly and goes onto something else, I wish it had stayed on card and kept with the theme.

And though it didn't have me weeping like the last two titles it still kept me engaged with the story and characters.  It's not afraid to shy away from its themes of existence and what makes a person.  Unlike media like Blade Runner that gives a sort of open idea of what it could be this gives a definitive answer and lets you decide whether its right or wrong in a sort of bitter sweat way.\n\n6/10 - not as good as its predecessors but still a worthwhile play.", "timestamp_created": 1640148281, "timestamp_updated": 1641603557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106265180": {"recommendationid": "106265180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198932287689", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1659325757}, "language": "english", "review": "Heartwarming story", "timestamp_created": 1640137033, "timestamp_updated": 1640137033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106261626": {"recommendationid": "106261626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353458919", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1640131084}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0410\u043a\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u044f\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b Press Space to Win \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, \u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0437\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0431\u0438 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0441. \u0426\u044f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u0433\u0430 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e Sigmund Corp., \u043a\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u043d\u044f\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435 \u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0430. \u041f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0442 To the Moon \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u044a\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0432\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435.\n\u0410\u043a\u043e \u0434\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u044f\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e \u043d\u0438\u0432\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0432\u044a\u0432 \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u044a\u0440\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1640131332, "timestamp_updated": 1640131332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106261302": {"recommendationid": "106261302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198796275688", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 340, "last_played": 1678052819}, "language": "english", "review": "Mr. Kan Gao and everybody at Freebird Games, please, never stop creating.

El nuevo trabajo de Kan Gao vuelve a ser una aut\u00e9ntica maravilla argumentativa que te masajear\u00e1 la patata a base de bien mientras, tal vez, sueltas alguna que otra lagrimilla. Sin embargo, hay que hacer algunas apreciaciones importantes.\n\nEn esta ocasi\u00f3n, no controlaremos al doctor Watts y a la doctora Rosalene mientras buceamos por las memorias perdidas de un paciente ag\u00f3nico que desea un pasado mejor. Esto al principio puede sonar algo rollo, y lo cierto es que durante la aventura se nota much\u00edsimo la falta del doctor Watts y su humor tan friki.\n\nSin embargo, el personaje que controlaremos tampoco es manco en frikadas y golpes de humor, aunque en mi opini\u00f3n no llega al nivel del querido doctor Watts. Pero al menos, tendr\u00e1 ayuda extra de otros personajes que le ayudar\u00e1n a hacernos re\u00edr bastante. Pero eso mejor que lo descubras personalmente llegado el momento.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, Kan Gao ha decidido presentar la historia de una manera muy diferente a lo que pudimos ver en To the Moon o Finding Paradise. Ahora todo ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s sorprendente, mucho m\u00e1s oscuro en un primer momento, haciendo que nos encontremos tan perdidos como el propio protagonista de la historia.\n\nEsto dota al t\u00edtulo de un aire renovado que le sienta realmente bien, ya que evita caer en la reiteraci\u00f3n de planteamientos, aunque tampoco est\u00e1 libre de eso, ya que posteriormente viviremos una aventura conversacional que tira por los mismos derroteros que las otras dos aventuras, present\u00e1ndonos una historia realmente bonita y que da bastante que pensar sobre la vida y sus vicisitudes.\n\nEs m\u00e1s, Kan Gao se ha venido un poco arriba con esta aventura y ya no solo se limita a tocar temas emocionales, de errores y aciertos, de alegr\u00edas y penas, sino que da un paso adelante y se atreve incluso a plantear diferentes teor\u00edas de f\u00edsica cu\u00e1ntica bastante actuales. \n\nPero no temas, si no conoces el tema del que habla Kan Gao bajo bambalinas tampoco pasa nada porque te quedar\u00e1s con una historia realmente emocional y de gran calidad, pero si da la casualidad que s\u00ed las conoces entonces podr\u00e1s llegar a comprender la profundidad del tema que trata en esta historia, que es bastante, por cierto.\n\nDe todos modos, y para evitar spoilers, solo me voy a referir a la historia principal vagamente. Simplemente para compararla con las anteriores. Despu\u00e9s de haber acabado el juego en una sentada, literalmente, la pregunta que me vino a la cabeza fue: \u00bfEs una historia mejor que las anteriores? La respuesta es no, particularmente me gustaron mucho m\u00e1s las historias de To the Moon y la de Finding Paradise. Adem\u00e1s, de lejos. Pero eso no quita para que la historia de este juego sea muy buena igualmente.\n\nOtra pregunta ser\u00eda: \u00bfEs el mejor juego creado por Kan Gao hasta la fecha? En mi opini\u00f3n, s\u00ed. Aunque con matices. Como historia principal me han gustado m\u00e1s los otros dos nombrados anteriormente, A Bird Story no lo tengo en cuenta para nada, pero s\u00ed es cierto que Impostor Factory es mucho m\u00e1s ambicioso en su argumentativa a nivel global. Much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s, de hecho.\n\nTal vez el problema sea que la jugabilidad como tal no ha cambiado un \u00e1pice desde Finding Paradise. En el juego solo tendremos que hacer clic en pantalla todo el tiempo mientras desplazamos a nuestro personaje por el escenario y se nos va contando la historia de alguien, una historia bonita es cierto, pero nuestra labor ser\u00e1 meramente como espectador. Un par de veces o tres podremos elegir una respuesta, pero su impacto es nulo realmente en la aventura.\n\nEn To the Moon hab\u00eda peque\u00f1os puzles, y a veces hab\u00eda que recorrer bien los escenarios para encontrar las esferas. En Finding Paradise se eliminaron esos mini-puzles, pero el doctor Watts hac\u00eda tantas frikadas que te part\u00edas de risa. En Impostor Factory las esferas se te caen en las manos, y no hace falta casi ni buscarlas, y eso provoca que la jugabilidad se vuelva terriblemente simple, m\u00e1s a\u00fan si cabe. Y la historia de la persona que se nos cuenta no es tan diferente realmente a lo visto en los anteriores juegos, a groso modo claro, pero luego s\u00ed es cierto que todo es bastante sorprendente.\n\nSin embargo, si el tema de la jugabilidad no te importa, si solo quieres disfrutar de una buena historia y punto, aqu\u00ed vas a encontrar una realmente buena. Eso seguro.\n\nEn su aspecto m\u00e1s puramente t\u00e9cnico, el juego no ha cambiado demasiado en el tema gr\u00e1fico respecto a los anteriores t\u00edtulos, aunque s\u00ed es cierto que me ha parecido todo mejor presentado, con mucha m\u00e1s variedad y muchos detalles de agradecer. Por otra parte, la m\u00fasica es realmente buena, con unos temas muy acertados y de gran calidad.\n\nEn definitiva, Impostor Factory ofrece algo memorable en su parte argumentativa, aunque su jugabilidad sea bastante limitada. Puede no llegar a los niveles de las anteriores aventuras, pero eso no es \u00f3bice para que no sea realmente magn\u00edfica y no muestre una ambici\u00f3n mucho mayor en el fondo de su mensaje.

And if you [i]haven't[/i] played those other games then stop reading this and start playing To the Moon immediately!\n\nThere's not quite as much experimentation with the mechanics as last time, which I consider an improvement, but the story, and really the narrative structure are somewhat more experimental here than before. Repetition is a very purposeful motif, used effectively.\n\nImpostor Factory asks big, bold questions. What should your priorities be? Is it ok to be a little selfish? And ultimately, how does one live a good, meaningful life?\n\nThe craziest thing here is that the game actually manages to answer those questions, and answer them well, while still leaving some wiggle room for interpretation.\n\nAnd the real strength is that there's also room for you, for injecting yourself into the characters and thinking about how you would react in their situation. Once again, just like with To the Moon, this game generated countless discussions for me in real life, because the scenarios it brought to my mind were worth talking to other people about. More than that: I [i]had[/i] to talk through those ideas.\n\nParents, be warned, you will be hit far harder here than anyone who has never had kids.\n\nI get why this game took so long now. It's not that the graphics or the engine are doing spectacularly complicated things. It's that the experience had to be finely crafted so that you arrive at the right place in the emotional arc for what was going to happen next.

Who could you have made happier? Are there times where you prioritized your own needs when others around you needed you more? I think most people probably don't spend much time contemplating these things, but this game may certainly move you to do so.\n\nTowards the end of the game, a mysterious character remarks, \"To me, time is just a place.\" It comforts me to think about time in this way. The fear of death is largely due to time's linearity, the idea that after death is oblivion, and your life no longer exists. Impostor Factory reminds us that we always exist, that our piece of time is there forever, and even if we may not be able to access it, it's still something we leave behind. It's both calming and empowering - make the best choices you can in life, people, because those choices are infinite.\n\nAnyway, the rice is perfect, cat protec, boxing gloves.

As with the previous games, I can start by saying that the people at FreeBird Games managed to craft a beautiful story one more time.\n\nThis time, however, things are slightly different. While the previous games followed the (mis)adventures of Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene as they do their jobs for Sigmund Corp, in this one you'll play as Quincy, a regular guy who one day gets invited to a party in a fancy mansion. I mean, you could get that from the game's description, but honestly I feel that's all I can say without spoiling the story. Just let me add that it still has that emotional beauty found in To the Moon and Finding Paradise, by the end, it'll make you cry.\n\nThe writing, as always, is top-notch. It's a very touching, emotional story, and they also manage to write in some sillyness to lighten up the mood, which, in my opinion, is necessary for the themes these games touch, so as not to make the story too depressing.\n\nAs for gameplay, well, it's what you'd expect from a game in this franchise; it plays like a relatively simple and straightforward RPG. After all, these games are about the story more than anything else, and the gameplay remains simple enough so as not to hinder the main part of the game. A similar thing could be said about the art style, it's a somewhat simple style reminiscent of old JRPGs, but it's still full of charm.

I do not feel a part of it. I do not feel that I can effect a change, or even move the story forward.\n\nI am simply an observer. If this'd be a film, or a book, it'd be fine. The expectations would be different. But going through an \"interactive experience\" without your actions ever really interfacing with the experience is a waste of the medium. Repeatedly rooms lacked interactivity. Everything was super linear and basic. \n\nEven the visuals became more barren/rudimentary as the game progressed, and evoked a feeling of a project that had run out of steam/funding/time two-thirds through. Details like pathways between cutscenes starting out misty and handcrafted, to becoming just straight dragged gradient brushes.\n\nThe writing was hyper-expository, everything was constantly spelled out, nothing left to be figured out.

What starts out as a murder mystery quickly morphs into something else entirely that will have you guessing what the fuck is going on from beginning to end. You laugh, you will be delighted and you will cry. \n\nThis entry hit me the hardest out of all the entries in the To The Moon series. However, I also think Imposter Factory is the weakest entry in the series by far in terms of characters, narrative and game design. The cast this time around just isn't memorable in the same way as the previous ones were. They are great in the moment, but you won't remember them like Johnny and River. Gone are all of the little quirks and nooks you could find when exploring. They have been replaced by some absolutely gorgeous pixel art and linear level design, which is pretty, but lacks the depth previous entries in the series had. Neil and Eva are largely relegated to a cameo at the end, which was super disappointing, as I loved their banter, Neil's crazy random antics, and their sub plot in the previous games. The narrative here does address their sub plot from the previous games, but it's disappointing that it does so without them. I felt their appearance also destroyed the closure the ending brought. I really hope this isn't the last entry in this series like they said it would be back when they were developing it. As there is clearly much more story to tell. You also NEED to play through the previous entries in the series before playing this one.

Less than alright I guess? \nAlthough the gameplay has been streamlined compared to the previous games, I didn't mind it that much. The mini puzzles were more tedious than fun so leaving them out and focusing more on the story is not a bad move in my opinion. \n\nMy main problem with the game is the story. It starts strongly, but drops the ball midway and closes with a confusing disappointing ending. In previous games we knew that we are playing in a simulation and despite this knowledge we cared very much about the characters because the pictured reality sucked and we rooted for the simulated reality. In this one they have decided to render the whole storyline of the game pointless towards the end. How do you expect me to care about the story if nothing matters?

While the earlier installments were also not very modern, at least that didn't really matter for the story. In this game, however, it's apparent that as soon as a woman is the character you're delving into the memories of, it's not about her. In the end it's not about her hopes, not about her struggles, not even about her ending. \n\nTLDR: this studio severely disappointed us. \n\n\nSPOILER: \n\nIt's about her having children. Even worse, the story has a big focus on being pro life in the most literal sense of the term. It doesn't matter that the child will be severely handicapped, it's alive! You want to have a good life but now the child is dead? No worries, this whole story wasn't in the real world so you made the (heavily implied) 'right' choice in real life and you died a slow painful death! You are both constructs made in a machine and multiplied until there were thousands of you? Let's put you all on the moon! The woman herself even said that a new life where, you know, she isn't severely disabled and can enjoy live WHILE STILL having the child wouldn't matter, because at least hEr BabY iS safe In tHe rEAl wORlD. And why is the make belief childhood friend of the last game there?! \n\nWe thought, as we started playing, there was a good reason for us following a guy without clear memories in the actual memories of a gal who seemed to know him. You have many hooks to knit a story from, like the guy has Alzheimer and her memories were needed as a backbone to help him or something (all the elements were there). Instead, the part of the story we actually liked (everything before her getting pregnant because as soon as that happened we knew it would all focus on that) didn't matter according to the game. At all.

Impostor Factory is easily the weakest entry in the To The Moon series, and this episode is not a stand alone: I don't believe I would have understood what was going on if I didn't know the lore. But if you do care about the lore, you must play this one.\n\nI made it through the entire game without crying and that's a bit of a disappointment for a Freebird Game. There are certainly sad things in the game, but nothing actually raised to the level of sobbing that the previous games induced.\nThe graphics and engine are better than the previous games, and that's appreciated. Gameplay wise, there's a lot of just moving right through a corridor, with no other interactivity, which is a regression: there's very little exploration of the scenes. The music is lovely as always, but there's no stand out theme. There was no \"For River\" or \"Faye's Theme\" that were immediately unforgettable.\n\nThere is no way to talk about the story and why it's interesting without total spoilers, so spoilers ahead:\n\n---\n\nIn the end, everything takes place in one of SigmundCorp's machines. Neil Watts' mother, Lynri, was involved in building some of the scanning technology used across the series and left Neil a copy of her emgrams. Neil is now apparently experimenting on his mother's brain scans on his own time, and that scan is apparently conscious. Even though Neil appears to be doing this to give his mother a posthumous equivalent of what he and Eva have given dying patients in previous games, there's questions about whether Lynri consented to any of this and thus Neil might be committing a mindcrime on a copy of his mother.\n\nThere's also the question of what happens to two conscious minds at the end of the game. If they're terminated, that should be read as Neil committing murder, as they're running on Neil's hardware instead of on a decaying human body. But if they're left alive...then the To The Moon universe has reached a civilizational victory condition: mind uploading plus out-of-body simulation.\n\nIf you still needed a meat brain to run a human mind, SigmundCorp's services in To The Moon and Finding Paradise make sense. But if you don't, taking a scan right before death is a straightforward path to digital immortality...and it questions what SigmundCorp is even doing in the first two games. Lynri's scan is done before the events of the first two games, so brain scanning in enough detail could have been done for River or for Colin. Faye shows up on Neil's terminal so maybe they did.\n\nBut if so, why isn't this mentioned in universe?

Anyhow.\n\nTo The Moon was a great game. Finding Paradise was a great game. Impostor Factory is NOT a great game. In particular:\n\nThe claim that Impostor Factory contains \"A cozy mix between adventure game elements and classic RPG aesthetics\" is FALSE. Impostor Factory does not contain adventure game elements. Previous titles at least included very small minigames to keep the player engaged; they also contained item descriptions which encouraged players to interact and engage with their environment. Impostor Factory, in contrast, is far more passive, especially in its second act. For large parts of the game, gameplay consists of walking along constrained corridors, talking to the only NPC available to interact with to obtain story dialogue, then repeating. That is not \"adventure\".\n\nThe first and third acts are what redeem the game. These sections afford a small amount of player freedom, and reward the player's efforts to talk to different NPCs. The dialogue in these sections is frequently witty and charming, and was the highlight of the game for me. Two of the sidekicks, in particular, were excellent, showing off the calibre of writing that the studio is capable of.\n\nAside from that, fans of the series may find themselves being invested in the lore contained in Impostor Factory.\n\nThose who haven't played To The Moon or Finding Paradise should 100% play those titles instead. Do not start with Impostor Factory. The relative weaknesses in Impostor Factory may deter new players from investigating the series further. Experienced fans of the series will find Impostor Factory worth it in the end, but should go in with lowered expectations. It's not a great game. It's not a bad game.

I think this marks a potential turning point in the possibilities of future installments, in ways I'd absolutely look forward to.[/spoiler]\n\nHowever, the game is a huge letdown in terms of how the story unfolds. The whole thing is linear to an alarmingly literal sense, in that often, the only direction you can move your character is forward, and the game allows for little interactions outside of the plot-specific NPCs to talk to or objects to click on. The previous installments of the franchise have vast environments for you to explore, so even when the game only progresses with certain actions you still feel totally immersed in the story. In Impostor Factory, however, it felt more like I'm side scrolling through panels of a comic book.\n\nAnd I think that's the biggest disappointment here: I'd rather have paid for a full-length graphic novel version of this chapter of \"To the Moon\" than for the game itself. Had this been something I could read instead of play, I'd have loved the beautiful story within the pages. But playing this lessened its impact because I was constantly frustrated by the lack of engagement. Visual novels as a medium are so great to me because they allow for a lot more flexibility and creativity for the creators, to huge benefits on behalf of the \"reader,\" but this was little more than moving from point A to point B as the story is told around the reader.

I've been just so numb to it a lot of time. But this game, this game reminded me of why it really hurt. It reminded me that I'll never mom grow old with dad, despite fighting for so long, despite all the sacrifices. That feeling where she'll never be able to take care of her grandkids, just as she always wanted. She was the smartest, bravest, most generous soul I have ever known in my life. I always thought that she could've been so much more than just a housewife taking care of stupid old me and my sisters. She could've been an amazing lawyer, like she once wanted. I talked to her about it, and guess what she said. She said I, and my sisters, were her pride and joy, that there's nothing more in this world that makes her happy than us.\n\nLife had not been kind to my mom. She was dealt the worst cards she could handle, even before cancer, and yet someone like her could be so amazing. That's why I wish I was better. I wish I could've paid her back. I wish I could make her happier and prouder. \n\nI might not get the technical details of what Neil did, but I definitely know why he did it. What his mom did was amazing. A self-sacrificing, unconditional act of love that only a mother could make. I KNOW he wanted to pay her back, even if we all know that's impossible.  \n\nNeil, you did good buddy. And go confess to Eva already you tsundere dumbass!\n\nAnd Kan Gao, thank you. Thank you for reminding me that we should be better.

Proverbially smashing into the indie scene 10 years ago with their detailed masterpiece, To The Moon, Freebird has since added a sequel in 2017 and brings a continuation and possible end to the Sigmund Corp franchise with Impostor Factory.  I\u2019ll forewarn, this game is weird, and somewhat hard to wrap your head around at times, but bear with me: it\u2019s worth it.\n\nOn a rainy day in front of a disheveled yet grandiose terrace, Quincy attends a party where the status quo is quite a few tax brackets higher than himself.  While the outside is damp and disarranged, the inside of the mansion is as pristine as the proclaimed germaphobe tenants can make it.  In this sprawling two story abode: scientists, investors, big wigs, and some in between find themselves attending to see a mechanical miracle that could change the world in ways never seen before.  Before Quincy and company can see what\u2019s in store for them, Quincy stumbles upon the freshly murdered bodies of the mansion\u2019s owners.  Unraveling at the seams, Quincy runs to the bathroom to avoid suspicion and explanation.  After washing the blood from his hands when checking the bodies, he returns to a similar scene not a few minutes earlier.  None of the guests were the wiser of what happened because the mansion\u2019s residents are still alive and well.  What lays ahead for Quincy is what can be best described as Clue mixed with Groundhog Day.\n\nBut hold on friends, this is only the first part of the game.  Impostor Factory builds itself into its own name as the genre of this title changes almost by the hour, going from a darkly comedic whodunit into something creator Kan Gao is more known for: heart-string tugging love stories.  Genre changes this abrupt should have to go through some bumpiness, but the love and care taken into the two character\u2019s backstory is so engulfing, engaging, and provoking that you almost forget this game was making you laugh with its ridiculousness.  Within minutes you\u2019re now in Impostor Factory\u2019s grip with how somber and captivating the history between these two are and time feels like it stops with how hard it pulls you in.\n\nAnd it builds tremendously upon its middle act.  Impostor Factory serenades the player with a wave of simple yet beautiful piano scores throughout.  Engaging enough to liven a scene yet subdued enough to appreciate the details of the flashbacks: it\u2019s these tender moments that get enunciated that shine the brightest and hit the hardest.  Dealing with the ups and downs, slips and falls, the highest highs and lowest lows, and the simplistic in-betweens that most couples cherish the most.  The amount of emotional weight of the two characters pressed on the player is astonishing given the minimal amount of time used and a true testament to the emotional genius Gao is at his craft.\n\nWhen that emotional weight carries into Impostor Factory\u2019s third act, the strands of a lifelong journey intertwined by a choice encounter start to tie together with familiar characters and the twists and turns that are revealed provide a beautifully poignant end to the absolute roller coaster of a story.  The choices and paths led after all the mysteries are laid out tear deep and all I could was just admire the quintessential direction of Quincy\u2019s story until the credits rolled and I could exhale after what felt like an eternity of holding my breath for them.\n\nEmotionally, I\u2019m exhausted.  But mentally, I\u2019m so happy I spent the time diving head first into Impostor Factory.  Kan Gao shows once again the supreme talent and direction he\u2019s used over the past decade to tell a funny, imaginative, and emotionally crushing tale of living life to the fullest no matter the obstacles thrown in front of you.  Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to put back on the OST and try not to cry.\n\n...I\u2019m gonna cry a lot.\n\n[quote][h1]Follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33247611/]A Review Is Worth 1,000 Words[/url] for more Steam Reviews.[/h1][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1636523846, "timestamp_updated": 1636523846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102520380": {"recommendationid": "102520380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059278449", "num_games_owned": 643, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1636519619}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Did you play To the moon and liked it?\nThen you own it to yourself to play the whole trilogy.\nThis game is beautiful from start to finish", "timestamp_created": 1636519044, "timestamp_updated": 1636519044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102519055": {"recommendationid": "102519055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198431244835", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1636515927}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been trained to cry to the music of these games, even though I've been more excited with the introduced concepts more than feeling sad this time. \n[spoiler]From 'To the moon' just the technology of altering memory to give a perfect life was cool enough.

This game is still good for its price and unique experience as a standalone, but compared to previous entries it's weak. I'm gonna list why below:\n\n1) All previous entries has added new, unique and quirky gameplay elements as an ice breaker or a moment of relief from the feels, be it a puzzle or a parody of old JRPGs. This game has NONE OF THAT\n\n2) All the previous entries had an unexpected twist which serves as a trigger to start crying while you get hit by the FEELS truck. While IF also has a twist, it felt predictable and weak and it Failed to break my \"Guard\" against the \"Feels\"\n\nThe Disappointment is I guess more for the fans the previously played everything since the start. They chose the safe route to wrap up everything nicely but that's what made this entry weak. There was no HOLY SHIT, or WHOAH reveal at the end. \n\nIt's been almost 10 years since the first entry, To The Moon, was released.

If you don't know the characters from the other games, the ending will be meaningless and confusing.\n\nI've played the first two games and enjoyed them very much, but it's been four years since the last installment.  My entire experience during the end was struggling to remember who everyone was and how they we're connected to everything else. If you don't know the characters from the other games, there will be almost no payoff to the story whatsoever. There isn't much payoff for the characters you come to know in this game regardless.\n\nThe opening, the screenshots, and the game description of a \"bonkers time-loop tragicomedy\" really hammer home the idea that this one's going to be something different. It's not. After a compelling Act 1 setup, Act 2 gives way for a storytelling experience much more akin to the first two games, albeit significantly blander and feeling disconnected from the first act. The final act offers lame explanations for the intrigue that was set up at the beginning and does little more than furthering of the stories outside of it's own neglected narrative.\n\nIf you're familiar with the other games, and you wash the expectations Act 1 sets up, you can probably have a good time.

It's a little under four hours (my playtime is at 4.2 hours, which includes the game sitting idle a couple of times while I was busy AFK), nothing all that different from the previous games: it's still only a little more involved gameplay-wise than Dear Esther: you just walk from one scene to another, occasionally clicking to talk to someone, or to inspect or use an object. The game's strength lies more in the feels department, though it didn't hit as strongly as the first game. Impostor Factory also featured considerably more blood than I'd expected from the series.\n\nIf you pardon me for being vague in order to reduce spoilers, I found that making the story partly about the mechanics or rules of the simulation towards the end killed both my interest in the intrigue and my emotional investment in the characters.

Finding Paradise I thought wasn't as strong as To the Moon, but it is still a solid game with a great story. When I found out they were making a sequel/another entry in the series, I was really pumped, and I anticipated for the day it would come out.\n\nThen the game came out. \n\nIt starts off really well actually. Starting off in what appears to be a generic mansion party of sorts, only to spiral into some kind of weird reality twisting nightmare. (This part I am not sure is a spoiler but I'll spoiler it anyway) [spoiler] We even see a a really sad story, on how we got into the situation and one of the characters behind the whole thing. [/spoiler] It's really nice actually and it's a high point in the game. Later on the game has a twist that I thought was kinda nice, but everything after that starts to trip over its own feet and go downhill.\n\nThis next part is a big spoiler view at your own risk. [spoiler] The entire game takes place within the memory altering machine that previous characters, Neil and Eva use throughout the series. Essentially Quincy is a memory entity and Lynri (the character responsible for the memory device and the predicament you are in) is trying to work some bugs out only for the thing the glitch out and spawn Faye from Finding Paradise. Why is Faye in this? I don't know? I always thought she was a figment of Collin's imagination but now she is vital part of the machine. She later goes on to explain that there exist many realities within the machine, and the reality where the previous characters from the last game exist in another reality raising the question if any of the previous games were even real within the To the Moon universe. Then for some reason Faye gathers all the alternate versions of Quincy and Lynri to destroy the imperfect world, and create a perfect world for Quincy and Lynri. We never find out what reality actually happened as Faye says that the previous realities where just one of the many that we could implant. That is until you see the post-credit scene, where we see a scene with Neil in the machine. But even then, I had to look up what exactly even happened, and even now that I know what reality is real, the story still doesn't make sense. I feel like there are a lot plot holes. Like how is Neil viewing his dead mother's memories when she is already dead!? Did he get them from his father or something? [/spoiler]  \n\nEssentially the game pulls off a ton of deus ex machina alternate universe BS that really toyed with me and my understanding of everything I have come to know from the series. It's a decent story but not\n\nThe gameplay (and this is gonna sound stupid but follow me on this ok) feels incredibly lackluster compared to the previous entries. I know the last two games weren't all complex with what they were but here is the thing. This game was a linear walking simulator compared to the rest of the game. I know you don't do much in the previous games either, but you still had to explore your small environment and uncover the pieces to advance to the next part of the story. But here you are literally on a one way path. You don't explore, you just walk and get a piece of the puzzle to break the barrier to advance. Idk how but this is like a downgraded version of the previous games gameplay. They're aren't even any puzzles to do before you advance. I got nothing against games that prioritize story over gameplay, but the story just isn't good.\n\nI did like a lot of the funny moments in the game, but they are not enough to salvage it. Sorry ricebot and long kitty.\n\nI guess some other merits I can list off is that the Art is really nice, the music is great, and the pixel animation is really good in this one.\n\nWhen I first beat To the Moon and Finding Paradise I felt good. Like I experienced a genuine emotional ride. And I left with a bittersweet feeling (the games made me sad ok, good would be a weird way to describe an experience of an emotional game). This game, I literally just sat at my computer as the credits rolled and was just like: \"What the heck was that?\" I didn't feel anything, just confusion and emptiness.\n\nFreebird Games are full of talented people and they make incredible games with some of the best story and music. I really hope this entire review doesn't come across as an attack on the team and their work. I love To the Moon, and I even enjoyed Finding Paradise. I didn't have any strong expectations for this game, hell I didn't even know what to expect.\n\nBut this game feels really weak compared to its predecessors. It's Story had good build up but bad pay off, and it somehow managed to make the gameplay very lackluster somehow (I know that last part sounded weird but that's how I can describe it).\n\nI am sorry, but I don't think Imposter Factory is worth it.

However it didn't resonate with me. I'll explain why--but do keep in mind how positive the other reviews are when making a decision on buying this.\n\nOn with the show. Impostor Factory is the third game of this series, proceeded by Finding Paradise and To the Moon. These games tend to tell emotionally involved stories with puzzles to figure out about how to progress.\n\nUnfortunately, I found that Impostor Factory retreads the same ideas present in To the Moon and Finding Paradise without meaningfully pushing the overarching narrative of the series forward or evolving the writing in a meaningful way. The first two games are tearjerkers, but it doesn't feel like the developers have progressed since To the Moon released in 2011, which quickly gives the game a dated feel. \n\nThe gameplay here is actually simpler than the first two, with the puzzle elements removed entirely from progression. You'll walk and talk, and that's about it. I think some people may enjoy not needing to figure out puzzles to continue the plot, but for me I felt like it was a regression from the previous two entries and an unfortunate omission.\n\nWith that said, the writing here IS good, but I was disappointed that the game throws away its most interesting ideas early on to retread the same tropes & half-opened mystery box styled writing that featured heavily in To the Moon and Finding Paradise. This made it much more difficult for me to invest in the game because while Freebird Games does tell good stories, they seem to have gotten stuck telling the same story over and over and over again. Instead of the revelations coming as a shock, I rolled my eyes as the game proceeded down the same patterns as its predecessors without growth.\n\nThose of you looking for some closure on this decade-long series might also leave frustrated. While this game really does need the first two in the series to be played and understood, I don't think this game does much to meaningfully push the narrative forward for those of us who have been following for a decade now. This is a shame because--again, the writing is good! But it feels like every game Freebird Games releases is another take at Act 1 of a greater story. They're all great Act 1s, but after a decade I'd like an Act 2.\n\nAnd that's where I'm at. This sequel disappointed me, but at least part of that is on me for wanting it to be more of a continuation than it is.

The things that I've said...)\n\n[*] An espresso execution with zero filler and no time drains (You can definitely square that one, because it's there! Well done!!)\n\n[*] long cat (Is this the first time we see a long cat in a game? Someone please verify below!)\n[/list]\n\nBut yeah. Awesome game, go try it.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1635623195, "timestamp_updated": 1635623195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101909497": {"recommendationid": "101909497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046257243", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1635620233}, "language": "english", "review": "qwq", "timestamp_created": 1635622283, "timestamp_updated": 1635622283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101903682": {"recommendationid": "101903682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271477900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1635618776}, "language": "english", "review": "Powerful story and music, as expected of Freebird and Kan Gao. \n\nWhile the game can be played independently, I feel like there's a special impact for players who played the previous games. \n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this for anyone who wants to sit down for a while and immerse themselves in a story.", "timestamp_created": 1635616749, "timestamp_updated": 1635616749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101896077": {"recommendationid": "101896077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052267709", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1259, "last_played": 1635609495}, "language": "english", "review": "got scared, laughed, and ugly cried. would recc", "timestamp_created": 1635609648, "timestamp_updated": 1635609648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101874837": {"recommendationid": "101874837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048913108", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 270, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1635532330}, "language": "english", "review": "YESSSS!

However, it is the weakest installment of the series so far.\n\nThe graphics certainly got a bit more polish and flair this time around and the visual presentation is a big success. It looks great, it's not by a mile, but if you've played To The Moon recently, it's noticeably better. From the spritework, to the map designs and some of the effects, most notably the now animated barriers, everything seems to have received an extra layer of love.\n\nThe gameplay and pacing are very different. This one is even less of a game than the other two. Granted, if you've played the other two, you know what you're getting into, but now there's just less of it as a result. This means a little less padding by having you search every nook and cranny but it does feel more straight to the point and they did pack in a lot of info back there. I wish our playable character kept commenting a bit more, during the second act, as he tends to fall silent for pretty long stretches of time where it seems like he could've been a little more fleshed out. We're pretty far from the previous games' pair of protagonists sharing theories and opinions at the end of basically every minor scene. However the choice of having stills on the way that you don't interact with but still properly convey story beats and emotions is not only a good choice, but also well executed.\n\nThe music is a bit of a let down. It hurts to say, because it's objectively fine, but you can't escape comparison with the past titles. The main recurring theme doesn't stand tall on its own and isn't nearly as memorable as the ones from TTM and FP. The range of music is also not as great, especially compared to FP which had an excellent range of moods within its soundtrack. The absence of diegetic music is also a first, there isn't a compelling reason why the main character doesn't play an instrument to fill that role. It would've rounded the character and might've helped the soundtrack feel a little more alive. It used to be such a prominent feature of the other games that it's disappointing to get a soundtrack that very much feels like background music this time around.\n\n-Spoilers Ahead-\n\nThe story was not bad. The initial fake out of a murder mystery felt unnecessary in retrospect but I have to admit some of what they did was just unnerving enough to make me wonder what an actual horror game made by that team could look like, so as a framing device and source of conflict, that was weak, but the execution was ok. The main character's life story was fairly predictable, both the simulated one and the actual one we learn about later on were fairly standard affairs and not all that difficult to see coming from a mile away. They didn't keep me guessing like TTM or FP did, it was a very conventional narrative that doesn't really feel unexplored anymore in medias. In fact, I'm surprised that the game never addressed how much travelling the world and mending the rift in the relationship as a result was a Plan B. Nobody commented on the fact that without a deadly accident and failure of her current project, their couple might not have lasted. Quincy had literally just started to speak up about it and he basically had his needs met by pure random \"luck\", but never confronted the possibility that he would've absolutely kept being miserable or lost her entirely if the presentation worked out. \n\nThe twist meta-story left a lot to be desired. It's interesting that they went that way and the new themes explored are fun for a twist, but it does leave us with a taste that most of what we saw was more or less meaningless. In previous games, you could at least get the feeling that all of this was done for the benefit of an individual, but in this one, the only real actor here is Neil. Faye is there for the ride and because she has a job to do, but she didn't seem to be especially touched by these events. I get that Neil working to create a perfect ending is, in some way, personal growth and beneficial for his character. At least it would be, if he wasn't shown to have a cynical view toward what he ended up creating. Plus, he has to be painfully aware that making a simulation comfortable isn't the same as an actual person. Whether that actually constitute a meaningful event remains to be seen in future titles. It didn't help that if you consider the murder mystery as the red herring that it is, then this twist is more or less the only actual surprise the game has for you, and it's basically telling that none of it is real, including the participants. I was honestly hoping for more, but after seeing the prominent tentacles and end of the world narrative the trailer promised, I guess I shouldn't be too mad they didn't play that one straight. On its own, it's a pretty poor twist, but there ARE a few ways the next game could retroactively make this one more relevant. For example, if they decide that Eva ends up finding out everything and has to confront the idea that she works with someone who is sick, might have feelings for her (or feel she's part of his perfect ending) and has to reconcile with the idea she's working with someone who uses the technology on himself to create perfect ending for virtual recreations of his loved ones as a coping mechanism, personal quest or just as a hobby. The tease of the possibility of a next game is the main thing that doesn't make this story a total letdown.\n\n-End of Spoilers-\n\nIn the end, I recommend this games to fans of the series. It is absolutely not a good idea to try and enjoy this game as a standalone. It only works with the context of the previous titles and might actually work better if more titles are yet to come.

It's (except for some end-game material and a very important after-credits sequence) essentially a prequel to the other games, walking you through the personal stories around how the memory-interface technology in this world was originally developed, and why. It continues to build on the broader implications of the memory technology for human life and society, implications that the characters themselves incompletely grasp.\n\nIt also has, somehow, even fewer game-y elements than the prior main games.  Exploration is only a tool here to increase your investiture and to optimize story pacing, nothing else.  It's also a bit shorter than the other main games, though nowhere near as short as the interlude games.  Finally, this is clearly not an entry point.  Anyone playing this series should go in release order (skipping the interlude short-games if they like).\n\nI'm not going to spoil any more than that.  Playing this is a wonderful experience.

The story is engaging and interesting, and the soundtrack accompanies it all really well. This game drops some of the mini-games present in the previous entries and made it clearer what was necessary to progress, something that I think was a terrific decision, as it removed potential points of frustration or confusion, and really leaned into the story telling aspect which is where it shines the most. There are still places to explore and extra interactables to find, giving depth to the scenes.

What sets this apart from the other games is the stronger mystery element, and the furthering of the wider story in the series.

It saddens me to say this, because there are some very touching moments, and the sprite artwork and music are both absolutely on point. It's just lacking in a few important ways, and has a twist ending that renders the entire thing pointless. I have this feeling like they attempted to go deep and philosophical, but missed the mark horribly.\n\nMy main reasons not to recommend it are:\n\n1) The length. It's easily the shortest of the 3 main entries in the series. Even exploring as much as I could to find anything I could interact with, I got through it in a mere 4 hours. In fact, for most of the game I assumed I was playing through the prologue in order to have important context for the game proper. When I thought the real game was about to begin, the *twist* happened, and then roll credits.\n\n2) The endless corridors. This is the main reason I assumed I was playing through a prologue when I was actually experiencing the bulk of this game's content. I recall environments to explore to find the important memories, and various things you could interact with in a few of the environments in the earlier games. The environments in this game are tiny, there is almost nothing to interact with, and it's literally just a series of rooms and corridors - often-repeating rooms and corridors, too. You don't even have to find anything - the memory orb things are just handed to you as you walk. There wasn't a huge amount of interactivity in the earlier games, but this one lacks it altogether and is a poorer experience for it.\n\n3) The twist was bad and made it feel like this was an entirely pointless entry in the series. I won't spoil it for you, but it makes everything you experienced in the previous few hours utterly meaningless to the overall ongoing story begun in To the Moon. It. Was. So. Stupid. I already thought that the twist in Finding Paradise was contrived and just not-very-good, but not in a game-ruining sense. At least the idea of your journey revolving around a core memory was a good one. The twist in this one, however, made me almost angry. Such a slap in the face to the fans who waited eagerly for the next installment.\n\nThat's about it, really. They're charging the same amount, if I recall correctly, but you only get maybe 1/3 to 1/2 as much. And most, if not all, of it is rendered meaningless by a plot twist I never would have anticipated.

I was SO excited and keen on playing \"Impostor Factory\" (IF)! When it came out, I bought and played it directly. Unfortunately, I was fairly disappointed by this game :(\n\nI recommend strongly to play TTM and FP before playing IF. Otherwise, the end might be too confusing. To be honest, the story itself started interestingly, but got pretty strange - especially due to the involvement of previous characters. In my opinion, IF did not really wrap the trilogy up. Open questions from previous games were not really answered, but new questions arose. Though I sympathize with the underlying theme of the game, the way the story was told and the story itself did not catch me as much as TTM or FP.\n\nFor me, one of the reasons why the game did not feel so intriguing as the previous games was the music. The music of IF felt more like a remix of previously used music. To be honest, I was disappointed :-/ In my opinion, it is a shame that no song by Laura Shigihara was included. Her songs were what totally made me cry during the previous games. Straight to the heart in the strongest moment of the games. However, there was no song sung by her. Or any song sung by anyone. How can you not include a song in this game? (except for one in the credits \u00f4o) The opportunities were there and suitable music would have catched me so much more, would have dragged me into the game. \n\nTo be honest, IF felt so different overall and this feeling got stronger by the missing song. The music in general was not comparable to the music from the previous parts. \n\nTo me, IF was more like a walking simulator. At times, I did not really know what to do and had to walk into every room, talk to everyone, go to every room again - hoping to hit the trigger to push the story forward. It felt exhausting at times. I did not like that feeling. I did not enjoy the game as much as I wished I would.\n\nIf there was a neutral option, I would chose it. But since Steam only allows a positive or negative review, I have to give a negative one, unfortunately. \nIf you did not play TTM or FP then please do not play this game - I do not think you will understand much of the game.\nAnd if you played TTM and FP then think twice before playing IF, because it might disappoint you if you expect too much.\n\nPS: Please do not be confused by my \"total play time\" that Steam is showing for the game. I played most of the game when I had no internet connection and apparently, Steam does not take this time into account.

Instead of exploring and figuring out the story like in the previous games, here it feels like someone just takes us for a ride. It's a lot more linear, none of the puzzle or mini games. Changing the perspective of how the story is told makes it refreshing. It tries somehow new with a strong start of a murder mystery that fizzles out into the routinely emotional story that the series knows we expect. And while it's a good story, it's emotionally less hard hitting than the previous games. But in it's stead the meta plot of the doctors is explored more with giving some answers and leaving more questions.

It's also clearly a sequel. Yeah, I guess you can play this game without having played the others, just like you can start watching The Two Towers without having seen Fellowship, but it won't make total sense. \n\nIn my opinion, Finding Paradise is one of the greatest games ever made, so expectations were high.  \n\nThe series continue to explore the subject of the butterfly effect and how small or large decisions can have immense ripple effect in the future. The issue is the devs crammed a ton of topics (butterfly effect, parenthood, pursuit of greatness vs simple life, alternate timelines, etc) and genres (murder mystery, dramedy, sci-fi, love story, drama, slice of life...) into one narrative, and tying that together in a story that honestly makes no sense (did anyone actually understand the mess that was the 3rd act?). I really thought at the beginning of the second act that the focus of Simple Life VS Pursuit of Greatness would be the central theme, with the two leads tugging at each end. Instead, the writers canned that as soon as they could and moved on to some convoluted alternate, parallel reality plot that I am willing to bet $100 even Kan Gao does not understand. Bigger isn't always better. Freebird is known for taking common slice of life stories and diving deep into them, not sci-fi and half-azzed humor (the cat? the Pokemon reference made me chuckle but it was annoying fast. Ricebot is life though. Ricebot is love. ). \n\nAnd I had no idea Neil Watts was such a popular character to be shoehorned into this story which had nothing to do with him. I always thought Neil and Rosalene to be the game player's eyes in the prequels, not the main characters, so seeing them forced into a story about Lynri was just a poor attempt at fan service.\n\nDefinitely the weakest game, weaker than Bird Story. It may resonate with you if you're a parent maybe? Only play this is if you played the prequels and loved them.", "timestamp_created": 1633885974, "timestamp_updated": 1633916407, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524303972721099854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100852036": {"recommendationid": "100852036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134810119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1633884394}, "language": "english", "review": "Gocdammit, I cried like 4 times while playing the game.
