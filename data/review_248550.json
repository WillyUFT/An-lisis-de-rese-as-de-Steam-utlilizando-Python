Build your robot how you see fit and conquer six different worlds with three levels each with a final boss waiting for you. After finishing the game, you'll also realize that there are color schemes and different parts still about, so it's up to you to go look for them and complete your collections. Your robot's house can contain up to 20 different builds.\n\nThere is no online multiplayer *BUT* you can play this game with friends through Remote Play. Any mode you play will definitely be a blast as your friends can build their own robots and take to the battlefield or explore the levels with you.\n\nIf you're feeling gutsy and if you think the final boss was a cakewalk, give the tournament a try. You will fight 8 rounds of a pool of at least 20 formidable robots with interesting builds. Winning beyond round 5 will earn you an increasing sum of money depending on where you finished.\n\nOverall, this game is pretty good. However, I wish that the devs would update it with a few things:\n\n- A survival mode where you fight non-stop waves of enemies that hit harder and harder the longer you play\n- The ability to import or export builds to and from the Steam Community, as well as fight them in the tournament\n- More parts (I want a two-handed sword weapon! :D)\n- The ability to make yourself a crab bot (for those who want a bigger challenge)", "timestamp_created": 1591797661, "timestamp_updated": 1591797661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553954362869262695", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70076816": {"recommendationid": "70076816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094803808", "num_games_owned": 3796, "num_reviews": 4908, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1590892767}, "language": "english", "review": "6/10 fun but kinda repetitive\ni have yet to try local co-op", "timestamp_created": 1590897669, "timestamp_updated": 1590897669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.284500986337661743", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69512000": {"recommendationid": "69512000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049013016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1635, "last_played": 1659937859}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolute joy.

que te permite cambiar cada pieza del robotete por la que m\u00e1s te guste o mejor te venga, teniendo en cada parte diferentes movimientos o propiedades, tambi\u00e9n le puedes cambiar de color con diferentes pinturas que tienes que ir encontrando por los diferentes niveles, lo que le da un puntillo extra de exploraci\u00f3n.\n\nEl escenario es mayormente destruible, encontrando lugares ocultos a trav\u00e9s de los bloques que puedes ir destruyendo.\n\nModo cooperativo local, el cual solo a\u00f1ade m\u00e1s diversi\u00f3n a\u00fan.\n\nModo torneo para jugar con o contra amigos, en el que las piezas que hayas conseguido en la historia pueden ser usadas para crear vuestras propias configuraciones.\n\nLa duraci\u00f3n de la historia esta bastante equilibrada, ni se hace corto ni cansa.\n\nEl gameplay es bastante entretenido, llegando a picar bastante si juegas con un amigo, aparte de que responde muy bien a los controles.\n\n\nCONTRAS:\n\nHistoria simple, no destaca en nada, y no tiene mucha chicha.\n\nNo est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol, aunque para lo que tiene de historia y dem\u00e1s tampoco es que importe mucho.\n\nUna vez lo desbloqueas todo te quedas sin saber que hacer, es una pena que no saquen contenido para el juego, aunque fuesen nuevas piezas o pinturas que coleccionar, o nuevas arenas o modos para jugar, una pena en este apartado.\n\n\nCONCLUSI\u00d3N:\n\nEs un juego que si lo juegas para pas\u00e1rtelo y completarlo, no quieres que se te vayan demasiadas horas, y el estilo gr\u00e1fico estilo \"low-poly\" no es un problema para t\u00ed, est\u00e1 bien incluso para jugarlo solo, eso s\u00ed, si lo juegas con un amigo, la diversi\u00f3n se multiplica por mucho.\nComprarlo o no ya es decisi\u00f3n de cada uno; \u00bflo recomiendo? si, \u00bfme ha

When you and a friend would spend hours debating who REALLY won that battle and who just had better items.\n\nIf this game, who's wiki is not even written after 10 years, (hopefully) attracts the attention of new players.

You have a normal attack and a special attack button combined with directional inputs (up, down, side, neutral) for different types of attacks. You play as a robot which you can customize the parts of, which also allows you to pick what special moves you have and alter your strength, defense, speed, or add additional jumps to your character. There are no grabs (and no ledge grabs), but you do have a shield and shield breaker move (which doubles as a taunt) on every character.\n\nThe main game is an adventure mode where you go through standard levels of varying environments. At the end of each \"level\" is a boss fight on a more standard \"Smash stage\" like platform. The game does have a story about how your robot village is the home of a powerful energy source. Defeated enemies will sometimes drop parts in levels, which you can instantly equip if you want. There is also an in-game currency for defeating enemies which you use to buy more parts.\n\n[h1]What I like:[/h1]\n+ You can customize your character to alter their special moves and stats. \n+ You can find new color skins in the form of collectibles hidden in various levels.\n+ The Adventure mode can be played in 4-player local Co-op.\n+ Versus mode for up to four players as well.\n+ Tournament mode to face off against a series of CPU opponents by yourself to earn currency and more parts.\n+ You can save many of your own \"builds\" for quick changing of character setups.\n\n[h1]What I don't like:[/h1]\n- the damage based knockback mechanic seems not to work as well, from my perspective, in an enclosed space (levels) in comparison to traditional smash-like platforms where you die from being knocked off the stage. Here you die from hitting walls at an unknown point of high speed. Enemies also go flying around the closed room after hitting them so you have to chase after them to finish them off mid beating the tar out of them.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nI like a lot of ideas in this game. If you are looking for a simple smash clone with a cooperative adventure mode, this should be right up your alley. I think this is fun and has great value as a multiplayer game with custom characters.\n\n[h1]Still not sure?

All levels are full with secrets and getting certain parts helps you get to previously unreachable areas.\n\nThere is just 1 character, You can customize it by equipping parts, You have a Head, Core, Shoulder, Hip, 2 Arms and 2 Legs, some parts have abilities like extra jumps, Boosting, Drilling, Shooting, etc. and other parts improve your stats like defence or attack. There are a total of 150 parts to collect, They drop by finding chests, defeating mobs, killing bosses, buying them in the store or winning them in the Tournament.\n\nNext to parts you can also change colors, There are 30 colors available and some are very tough to find, They are scattered all around the game, You can change these colors and parts in your home, Here you can also save custom builds so you have the perfect build for each level and boss. Once you have unlocked a part or color you can always get them from your home for free.\n\nThere is a general area with a shop, your home, entrances to all the levels, even here you can collect some hidden unlockables, To find all of the parts and colors is quite a challenge, It is a great game with a lot of content that everyone will be able to enjoy\n\nYou can play the game with up to 4 players locally, there is no online multiplayer. all levels, all bosses are available in coop split screen, You can also play versus is the battle mode, Use your custom builds to battle your friends, This is a great smash bros like brawler, and being able to customize your build makes it even better.\n\nThe game does have some issues, Steam Cloud Save and Achievements don't work. But luckily this can be fixed. The issue is that there is a SteamWorksNative.dll file in the game directory if you put the proper SteamWorksNative.so in the same place and suddenly Cloud Save and Achievements start working.\n\nOverall it is an awesome game, There is no game like it, The gameplay is very unique because it is a blend of different games. Going through the Adventure to unlock some stuff and then taking it into battle is just an amazing experience. I have to give the game a 9, It really is amazing. If the Linux specific issue was fixed and it had Online Multiplayer it would be an easy 10, Maybe Megabyte Punch 2...\n\nFollow my Curator Page: \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/35216846/\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Steam Cloud Save[/td]\n\t[td]Works after fix[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Controller Support[/td]\n\t[td]Yes, Xbox One Bluetooth Working[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Achievements[/td]\n\t[td]Tough but doable[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]FPS on Ultra[/td]\n\t[td]around 500 fps[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Launch Command[/td]\n\t[td]gamemoderun %command%[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Issues[/td]\n\t[td].dll in the game directory[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]OS[/td]\n\t[td]Arch Linux[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Kernel[/td]\n\t[td]5.3.5[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]DE[/td]\n\t[td]Gnome 3.34.1[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]CPU[/td]\n\t[td]Intel I7-6800K @ 4.20Ghz[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]GPU[/td]\n\t[td]Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 (Nvidia 435.21 Drivers)[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1528762106, "timestamp_updated": 1570839286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545328021049499512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42585232": {"recommendationid": "42585232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088679718", "num_games_owned": 894, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1528487626}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice, if you like the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1528488434, "timestamp_updated": 1528488434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480352520942687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42352308": {"recommendationid": "42352308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018446175", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 563, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 552, "last_played": 1527957478}, "language": "english", "review": "Very awesome Brawler, go check it out!", "timestamp_created": 1527560933, "timestamp_updated": 1527560933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480352520942687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41984938": {"recommendationid": "41984938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246911778", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 535, "last_played": 1633824574}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego y entretenido tanto para una persona o mas muy recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1526068858, "timestamp_updated": 1526068858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41896664": {"recommendationid": "41896664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078117239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1525648942}, "language": "english", "review": "Megaman style sidescroller with attack unlockables, enemies to kick and jump around.\nIt's what it is but nothing more really.\nNot my kind of thing but I give it a yes because it's playable.", "timestamp_created": 1525649180, "timestamp_updated": 1525649180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41878477": {"recommendationid": "41878477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391273080", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1362, "last_played": 1538092022}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great, nice customization and EXCELLENT gameplay.

Battle it up like Smash Bros or co-op adventure and loot the world for drops.\n\nGreat Linux client too (Thanks Unity!).  \n\nStupidly cheap right now on Steam Winter Sale ($2 and change) and totally worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1514474295, "timestamp_updated": 1514474400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517133951187133789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38748579": {"recommendationid": "38748579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236689264", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1933, "last_played": 1678256339}, "language": "english", "review": "Mgeabyte punch is an easy game you get to do is you can finish off your opponents with a spinkick or the ones that had the super art move in youtube or whatever.

Maybe I expected to much from the 92% approval, since many got it for free.\n\nMaybe I'm being a but picky. I usually enjoy story heavy metroidvania type games, and played smash bros fairly competitively for years. So I'm used to good stories and tight controls. Because I love smash, thought I would give this a shot. I only got past the first boss before I knew the game wasn't for me.\n\nI could forgive the 'are plots REALLY necessary?' Storyline if it delivered an incredible, tight, control scheme. Unfortunately, it doesnt. Your attacks feel sluggish, and it's very difficult to predict what's going to land.

It doesn't have a huge amount of depth in it and the story isn't exactly what I'd call \"compelling\" as there are no actual characters. \n\nWhat is very good is the combat mechanics. Every piece of equipment is good for different situations. Mainly, you will find one set that will be slightly modified to fit your playstyle. There will be levels though that you have to switch up your playstyle because it doesn't work. For example, in the last level, my mobile glass-cannon style of play wasn't working, so I had to switch to full armored tank with a huge rocket launcher, and it worked fantastically. Another boss fight I had to switch to a full speed upgrade and attack speed with only one ability in order to defeat the boss.\n\nThere are a couple enemy AI exploits that could make the game boring if you bought into them, but as long as you don't actively try to exploit, you shouldn't notice AI quirks much.

It provides room for 4 players to play on one screen with Xbox 360/One controllers (or whatever controllers, if you're ok with mapping buttons).  It gives you a story, but it's not really about its story as much as it's about collecting and equipping parts.  You'll mostly just want to skip enemies at first, but later, you will find that skipping enemies makes you miss out on parts you would have found if you defeated more enemies in each level and found more loot chests.\n\nYes, there's loot, but it's not as RPG-like as you may expect.  It's more like a move set you can customize and a skin that's equally customizable though not purely for cosmetic purposes.  If you equip a certain part, it unlocks abilities, but if you want to look a certain way that another part allows, you'll have to choose one or the other.  This isn't necessarily bad, because it would be silly to do drill moves, for example, without a drill.\n\nGet this game asap.  It's worth full price.  Get it for coop or enjoy it solo.

The premise of the game is collecting pieces from your defeated enemies and using them to augment your own suit. The powerups provided can be anything from a base damage upgrade, to a new ability like a laser shot. The powerups are assigned to specific areas like core or arms and you can only have so many, like 2 arms. You can only have 4 active powerups at a time, these are assigned to your special via your standard special, side special, up special, or down special. These are very similar to the up, down, side, and standard B's of super smash bros. I really like how they allow the powers to be customized to certain spots, which help you become most comfortable with the controls. \n\nSpeaking of the controls, they are very tight, with quality bindings that can be changed and gamepad support. Gamepad support is essential for 2d platformers and I always appreciate when it is there. \n\nThis art is interesting, I really haven't seen something like this and I am not sure how to classify this. It seems to be a combination of bright colors, with sharp polygon voxel-ish objects. I really love this and this is a unique style that reminds me of what mighty number 9 wished it was. The bright colors and sharp angles really pop and stand out from a lot of games. \n\nthe music is fine, there isn't much to it, but it does its job. The soundtrack consists of basic techno music that is pretty vibrant and uses a variety of sounds to create a feeling of action. I don't have too much to say about this music, other than I like it.\n\nThe game also has boss battles that all have unique parts that you can only get from them. These parts can be something like an arm or leg that have unique abilities such as a drilling ability that act as both a combat ability and an environmental modifier. For example, you can use the drill to dig through certain materials, and that is how you get to level two.\n\nThis game is all about customization. You customize the color of your armor with color palettes you collect. You customize your aesthetics and stats with body parts. And you customize what abilities you want and what slot you want it to go in. This is the one that really stands out to me as I don't think I have seen something like this before in other games, but I feel like it should be commonplace. I can put the most comfortable setup of moves for myself into the bindings I want and it is super convenient.\n\nOverall, this game hits a lot of strong points and is definetly worth a look (unlike some other action platformers). With customization, fun, and challenges abound; megabyte punch earns a 9/10 with a label of \"unique\".\n", "timestamp_created": 1497030668, "timestamp_updated": 1497030668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32136348": {"recommendationid": "32136348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154742035", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 68, "last_played": 1491256005}, "language": "english", "review": "I could go on for days and days about how average this is or you could just play it.

Satisfying challenge, but make sure you bank enough time to complete each level because your progress in any given level is not saved.\n\nThere really are 150 different parts with which to customize your character, but the differences are mostly cosmetic.

It's not a challenge if your opponent spams the same move. Especially the first boss spamming the drill attack. Sometimes, it's almost pointless to shield because the AI are really slow sometimes unless you play tournament.\n\nThe controls are also pretty wonky. Especially if your moveset is setup wrong to feel weird.\n\nI also wish the levels had more AI. Level 3 so far for me has been probably the most enjoyable honestly in terms of gameplay and thrill. Other than that, it's pretty empty compared to Brawl's Subspace Emissary.\n\nIf anything, I want to praise are the ability to customize your specials. You design your fighter with your favorite skills and passives as well as color choices similar in the way of games like Kirby and the Amazing Mirror (Find the color palette in secret areas; check them out in a menu.)\n\nAlso, really wish this game would have online multiplayer. This would be insanely addictive with it, both co-op and competitively.\n\nI think this is honestly my first negative review. I like the game and I'll try to beat it to the end if the difficulty was lowered for beginners (This may look like Smash, but it's not Smash tbh.

Say you die during a boss battle, you don't get to start that boss battle again. You are dead, its done for and you'll have to play an entire level again till you get to the boss battle. You lose all your collectibles and pretty much everything you collected in the level. Thats what makes is more difficult. Its like the old school games like Contra, except that in Contra we could always use the help of a second player much more easily. Besides all of this, the game really really needs a online co-op mode. This could greatly reduce the difficulty and an option to use saves during a level.

The fighting system is very satisfying specially due to one core mechanics of the game: the ability to switch the body parts of your character. These parts can be obtained through various ways and collecting all the different parts, exploring the different powers, set ups and building any character you want is what makes this game differ. Sadly there is no online multiplayer to be found. The potential for one is immense but only local multiplayer is really available.\n\n\t\n\tIn terms of plot Megabyte Punch actually tells a good story. There are two factions warring for control of the village you were made to protect. The intrigue here is that these factions will help you to take down the other faction and even persuade you into thinking that they are friendly when they are in fact just waiting to backstab you. The problem here is that the story itself its not very well delivered to the player and the characters are always so lifeless. This might have been thought out to make the experience of the player feel more \"retro\" but I fear that most of the players will just skip the dialogues and miss out on the plot.\n\n\t\n\tMegabyte Punch has a good balance between Retro and Modern and the soundtrack is one perfect example of this. It sounds very modern while having a more retro feeling. The \"blocky\" graphics are somewhat resembling of a pixelated sprite and the gameworld is actually side-scrolling, both working towards that \"retro\" feeling. The world is layered through different levels each one with an unique look and feel to it. On the end of each world there is a boss fight that will reward you a special part from himself. Theese boss fights are the climax of Megabyte Punch. The overall Artificial Intelligence of the game is well done, proving to be somewhat challenging and all the bosses are unique both in design and skills wich make them real fun to beat and very rememberable.\n\n\t\u2022 Final thoughts\n\n\tIn overall Megabyte Punch is a very entertaining experience and a greatly well done game. It has everything to be an excellent game: wonderful gameplay and mechanics, an awesome soundtrack, an interesting plot and a colorful aesthetic but has little issues that prevent him to become so much greater. The lack of Online Multiplayer really hinders this game. But still this is a must play for any type of gamer and I hope that one that day we see a sequel to Megabyte Punch.", "timestamp_created": 1491322263, "timestamp_updated": 1491322263, "voted_up":

review:\n\nGood game. Unique customization system, battle physics, and nice art style to it. The game should run flawlessly on most computer setups, and look nice while doing so with little to no compromise needed.\n\nI'd give it a solid 8/10. \n\nNow for the bulk and detail.\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10\n------------------------------------------------------\nThis game delivers a hardly-done combat system that is both unique, and frustrating to get the full hang of at first. The core mechanics are not unlike Super Smash Brothers physics to fighting. You beat up an enemy, and as they have more damage to them, they fly further from your hits. If they hit a wall too hard, or fly out of bounds, they die. There's a default cap of 1000 damage before you simply drop dead, however. This is an entertaining concept, and it's done fairly well. The customization, however, leaves you feeling at times like you need specific parts on to get a certain edge in exploration and combat. An example would be the first major piece you get, a \"core\" that allows you to do super jumps into the air. Once you have this, you will most likely never be able to not use this ability anymore. Despite these sometimes almost-forced pieces, the game is more than fun enough to keep players' attentions for hours.\n\nStory: Hard to Score\n------------------------------\nThis game's story is hardly a driving force in actually playing. It's more of a guiding template for progression. You won't find yourself performing quests, no NPCs will be particularly important to you besides giving tips, and overall, mean nothing. It's a good system in place as-is to just familiarize you with how the game works, and that's about it.\n\nSounds: 8/10\n------------------------------\nNot much to say here in all honesty. The game's sounds and music match well with the atmosphere, and help bring you into the game further. It's not remarkable by any means, but it's a lovely side to the main course that is the gameplay.\n\nStyle: 7.5/10\n------------------------------\nThere's nothing groundbreaking here.

Likely better on controller. \n\n- Adventure Mode (the main story) certainly didn't have any masterful storytelling  but it was a nice little addition to add some life to the robotic world. \n\n-  The graphics are a bit sub-par but I wasn't terribly bothered by that.\n\n- The combat is, as most say, very much akin to Super Smash Bros and was quite enjoyable overall, with the loot system allowing you to pick up parts from other robots and attaching them to yourself, giving you a new power in most cases, a very fun system I'd say.\n\n- Unfortunately this game becomes quite tedious when you run out of lives as there is no option to just retry the level as soon as you died, you'll have to run all the way from your home point to whichever level you died in and in the cases of two levels, you'll have to change a piece equipment to gain access again, meaning if you swapped it out for something better you'd have to enter your house, re-equip it and then run back through/clear the way to the level again.\n\nAs someone who got this for free I'd give this something along the lines of a 6.9/10.

megaman? you like smash bros? you like power rangers? you like looting? you like customization? you like feeling powerful? you like getting better weapons/parts? you wanted a good megaman spiritual succesor then this game is for you this game is like megaman but without one crucial part your main weapon isnt shooting you can get weapons which special ability is to shoot but your main source of damage is melee this is a great platformer with great mechanics great looting and great part system you can get parts from different enemies each enemy drops a part that they use and you can get to the point of replicating an enemy it haves great controls even with keyboard and they are really tight and also this game makes me feel powerful for some reason also the weapons are awesome and each weapon makes your playstyle different since different weapons give you special abilities that you can use some just boost your stats but still.there's tons of different playstyles because of this in this game you dotn have health when you take damage the enemies do more knockback on you if you get knocked real hard and hit yourself agaisnt blocks you die there's shields which are the same as the ones in smash  the level desing is great and you can explore the levels a lot and they are huge  there's 150 weapons i think the game said i find dialogue to be funny but that's because i find things funny really easily probably there's tons of collectables for people that are completionists the reason i asked if you like power rangers its because after you get enough parts your robot will look like a power ranger robot i find the soundtrack also to be good its good if you listen to it or if you ignore and it's just background and this game also gives a pretty retro vibe and haves great platforming and great enmy and boss design (you can get cool weapons from bosses too you need them to progress through the story too) and the graphics are great not as in they are realistic but as in its own art stlye kinda way overall its a good but dont get for 15$ you should wait for it to be on sale because i dont think its worth 15$ even though its pretty good\n\ncons:you cant alt+tab",

It can take a while to get used to that. \n\nEdit: Also, 150 different parts (collect achievement) takes too long because of RNG.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1481723821, "timestamp_updated": 1481982829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510135114192962646", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28353658": {"recommendationid": "28353658", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976693456", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2333, "last_played": 1697999142}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like the floaty combat from smash bros 64, this is for you.

I'd kind of equate it similarly to old-school Sonic the Hedgehog levels, in which the ending may be in the same spot, but there are a vast array of ways to get to that end.\n\nThere are a plethora of paths and secrets, most of the secrets may just be hidden money capsules or part, but the fact that there are so many well hidden things encourages you to explore these well-designed levels even more. There's also colors you can find to change the appearance of your robot more, which is heckin stylish.\n\nThe actual fighting is as you probably know, very similar to super smash bros but simpler. Due to the fighting not being very complex this might be a turn-off for you, but I found it to be very satisfying. The moves are meaty (even though you're a robot) and have a lot of impact.\n\nFinally, the customization is pretty nice. Finding a new part to equip to your robot that may give you a sweet new move or maybe you want a loadout that allows for 4 extra jumps! I do wish there was a bit more variety in the amount of moves though, as there's \"only\" around 15 or so.\n\nOverall, I'd highly reccomend this game.

And I finally booted it up about a month later.  It's a novel idea, but it heavily suffers in that it's not a unique game outside of those ideas in my opinion. \n\nThe game is clearly influenced by both Mega Man and Super Smash Brothers.  The player runs through Mega Man style levels and uses Super Smash Brothers combat to fight.   In addition, there's a rather involved system for equipping items that will help change stats, give new abilities and get new attacks. \n\nThere are even different levels, every level has a theme, and each level looks different. \n\nSo on paper so far, that should sound good.  The problem is there's a caveat to almost everything I've said. \n\nMegaman had amazing levels, I'm sure if you can think of two different levels, you can come up with at least ten differences between them, Megaman's levels are iconic.  Megabyte Punch's levels are not.  For the most part, they are pallet swaps with very little life to them, you can look at the images above and notice, that the \"ice\" world looks the same Dirt world, and the Metal world is only slightly different.  They handle the same, they act the same they are the same.  There's no different controls or different \"theme\" it's really just a pallet swap.  What made Megaman iconic is the characters and the levels all have a single solid theme that really stand out. \n\nAs for the combat.  I have to say that is the highest point, and then I also have to say the lowest point.  The combat feels SO fresh when you beat up the first enemy, and when you beat up the same enemy for what feels like the 50th time (which actually is the 50th time) before the first boss, it's tiring. Megaman has a lot of enemies, but it threw a lot of low health enemies at you.  Instead in this game, each enemy takes 3-4 hits to kill, using Smash Brother rules (higher damage means they fly higher).  Boss battles are FANTASTIC with this system because they have special attacks and different tactics.  They even have a life system with it. \n\nRegular enemies though are repetitive as hell.  When you have to beat everyone by hitting them 4-5 times, the novelty of the combat wears off and you're just like \"I want to get through this level\".  It's sadly tedious. \n\nSmash combat works well when you're fighting hard enemies on a single level, but trying to make a full level based game with it, is tiresome, and while it was good enough for Super Smash Brothers Melee, it wasn't required to stand on its own, but just be a side diversion.  Plus you had the iconic characters Smashing it out.  \n\nAnd finally the item system.  Again, novel idea, horrible execution.  The images up top look good, and they are good, the problem that is in game, at least in the first three levels, you never really look \"good\" you don't look iconic, you look like a jumbled together wreck of a machine \n\nIt's a really great concept though, but the fact is nothing really works exactly like it should.  I actually got bored of it by the third level and went to play something else.   \n\nI got the game for free, but I had to ask myself \"How much would I have paid for this game?\"  and well the answer I ended up with is, I wouldn't have paid for it.  I just didn't like it that much, it really was a great concept, but the overall execution bored me, and I feel it missed out, because a game that plays like Megaman but with a smash gameplay could work, but it needs a lot more iconic levels, and less Smash gameplay (or at least fewer enemies you have to fight).", "timestamp_created": 1473721998, "timestamp_updated": 1520454911, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639979124069213867", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25436654": {"recommendationid": "25436654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049535698", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1473467131}, "language": "english", "review": "ITS GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1473479509, "timestamp_updated": 1473479509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509157419204711914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25435106": {"recommendationid": "25435106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097391482", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1587512232}, "language": "english", "review": "Super Smash Bros meets Custom Robo Arena.\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1473469674, "timestamp_updated": 1473469674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25340612": {"recommendationid": "25340612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052006705", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 161, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1470118664}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is addictive.

Free is good. But in this case, free is good, and the game that you get with it is even better.\n\nProbably the easiest way to describe Megabyte Punch is to draw parallels to the Super Smash Bros. series of games. You're a robot beating up on other robots, raising their damage levels with each attack and combo landed, and eventually you send them flying into the environment to explode and leave behind either Bytes (the game's currency) or parts (which can be equipped to grant stat boosts and special abilities). The controls and game play are very responsive, and you'll have no trouble traversing the colorful and non-linear levels, pummeling other robots and finding hidden Byte and part caches all around. On top of it all, the game seems to have a pretty bizarre sense of humor, which is always a plus, so I intend to spend quite a bit of time with it and see where it takes me.\n\nWith quite a bit to unlock and find (there are 150 unique parts to discover), this is a highly recommended game if you're a platformer fan or a fan of Smash Bros.-esque mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1469218477, "timestamp_updated": 1469218477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24464393": {"recommendationid": "24464393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066596658", "num_games_owned": 1012, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1487341151}, "language": "english", "review": "Got it for free, so it's cool, but I could recommend even to buy this game, this is really funny and I didn't get bored 1 minute\n\nWill kill some innocent robot creature again", "timestamp_created": 1469212607, "timestamp_updated": 1469212607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474887192249298096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24458033": {"recommendationid": "24458033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165299162", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1588437898}, "language": "english", "review": "AWESOME", "timestamp_created": 1469187456, "timestamp_updated": 1469187456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24451477": {"recommendationid": "24451477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054820924", "num_games_owned": 1009, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1472633380}, "language": "english", "review": "HeY tHaTs PrEtTy GoOd", "timestamp_created": 1469149341, "timestamp_updated": 1469149341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24449669": {"recommendationid": "24449669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142262055", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1471816066}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really fun, like an updated Vectorman with Smash Bros-esque boss fights, stylized with some Custom Robo or Virtual On. Definitely worth checking out.\n\nHowever, a few personal cons:\n-Salvaging multiples of the same part is mildly annoying since you can only break one at a time, and every time you do so (per item), it backs you out of the Break Parts submenu, forcing you to navigate back to the item again to salvage another.\n-The Break Parts mechanic should really just be a button press within the Inventory submenu. It gets really tedious going back to the Inventory to see a part's stats and features before you consider breaking it down more bits. If the reason they did this was for difficulty (Inventory menu isn't paused), then I guess I understand, but geeze does it get really tedious with all that back and forth navigation through menus just to break a half dozen common parts.\n-AI difficulty is kind of wonky. Basically, the overwhelming majority of the baddies you crush are absolute cakewalks, leaving you ill-prepared for the radically tougher boss fights (second boss absolutely annihilated me).

Imagine Smash Bros mixed with Megaman. You play as a robotic being, with a modular body. You collect body parts, that have different designs, stats and abilities. With them, you can create unique combat styles and character designs. It reminds me of \"God Hand [PS2]\", where you could collect fighting moves. The combat system is straight from Smash bros. The more damage you take, the more knockback you get from enemy attacks. When you reach a certain threshold, you get launched in the air, and you die if you hit something. However, if you somehow manage to avoid all obstacles, you can continue. It leads to some interesting situations, where you have to finish a stage with 1 last life and 150 damage. Every single hit you take might kill you. The game consists of unique leves with individual stages and bosses. The stage design is non-linear and huge. You can get lost pretty easily, because there is not much variety in stage visuals. Bosses are fought in arenas, Smash Bros style.

Gameplay is fast and smooth, like cutting butter with a warm knife, while early game can be almost a cake walk (as expected), the final levels will force you to play better if you want even a chance to win, but man, does it feel great beating that final boss.\n\nLocal multiplayer may not be everyone's cup of tea in an online focused era, but I would still recommend the game if only for the singleplayer content. Eight battles against AI opponents to win special parts, whose difficulty rivals even that of the final boss, and six levels to explore with six bosses to defeat, and more secret levels.\n\n150 parts are advertised, though there's more like 20ish abilities, this isn't bad as it offers the player a lot of choice to customise their character to have the abilities and looks they want, and 30 color schemes to choose from.

Now normally it paints all your parts, but it doesn't paint ones already in your inventory before the color was chosen, this can be used to combine many different colors and parts to make a truely unique character.\n\nStory is alright, though I don't play games for a story, that's what a book is for.

Just very, very, veryveryvery good. Don't even let the 100% completion, or the 50 hours, be what convinces you. Hell, don't even let my review be what convinces you, either! I'm not exactly an unbiased source of information here! \n(tl;dr at the bottom.)\n\nNow, before anything else, I'll mention off the bat that I got the code for my copy of the game off of a Steam friend; looking back, though, I'd say that I'd have bought this regardless, and maybe some more copies for friends as well. take with that information what you will, as maybe not having paid for it myself's painted my opinion a little.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nMegabyte Punch surprisingly has very interesting plots and subplots as you progress through the game. You and up to 3 friends play as Megacs, a living entity comprised of data, and were created by a mysterious artifact called the Heartcore. Your village, Ventu, is roped into a dangerous game of politics and power struggles, as two different factions both fight over control of the Heartcore. It has some good suspense, and even a couple plot twists, although very brittle ones. In short, I'd say it's a pretty good story overall.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\nFrom the get-go, the aesthetic of the game looks very sleek. Sharp designs of the parts and enemy models meeting against cubic map design and an impressive background setting makes for a strong showing of what the Unity engine is capable of. Every part looks incredibly distinct, and you can many times outright know an enemy's moveset just by knowing the parts they have equipped.\n\nAnd have I mentioned the soundtrack? Because the soundtrack is amazing. A good mix of mechanical and synthesized sounds, layered over one another, setting the atmosphere of their respective locations in a heartbeat. You know when a battle's taking place, because the music will kick into a high-energy track, getting you pumped and ready to beat down whatever's in your way!\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nNow, what I'm about to summarize of the gameplay may make you want to buy this immediately: Imagine Super Smash Brothers meets Medabots: fast-paced combat gameplay and the ability to beat the ever-loving crap out of anyone who looks at you funny for their parts, and then adding them to yourself. That's a lot of what the core gameplay is like in a nutshell.\n\nThe tutorial is short, snappy, and gives you the basics of how the game works: You start with a standard layout, and through defeating enemies, you can use their parts to get new abilities and alter your stats on-the-fly. Like Smash, you take damage based on flat values of attacks and different abilities, augmented by yours or the enemy's attack and defense bonuses. Taking too much damage will send you hurtling around; get hit hard enough into a wall or off the map, you lose a life. Lose all your lives, game over. Thankfully, you keep any and all parts collected even if you lose, so there isn't so much a penalty other than restarting the level again.\n\nThere are a total of 6 'levels,' which each consist of 3 stages and 1 boss fight. The stages play out as huge, sprawling maps, with many mooks to fight and collect parts from. Alongside occasional traps, such as bombs, pits, and what I can only describe as 'Repulsion' blocks. Bosses come at the end, and typically consist of a more arena-style map where you fight them (and occasionally others.) Defeating a boss will grant you with their unique part, parts you can't normally find off of regular enemies.\n\nWithin stages, you can also find secrets, including rare parts and color capsules. Color capsules are basically just new pallettes you can use to customize the appearance of your Megac; these, along with any parts you've collected, are all available at your home in Ventu Village.\n\nThere are a total of 150 parts, and few limits to how you can mix them. Did the enemy drop an arm? Head into your inventory and slap it on! Have more abilities than you have slots to equip them? You can change out your active abilities, and which keys they're slotted to, whenever you want! It allows for a lot of deep customization, which expands the more parts you collect from enemies in the world. I really like this, as it incentivizes replaying levels to hunt for parts; an active reward for exploration.\n\nAlong with finding parts, you can buy them with Bits! Bits act as both a currency and a point system in levels. Collecting 64 bits grants you with an extra life for that level, and you can even break parts down into Bits. You can use the Bits to purchase from the shop parts you may be having trouble finding, or can't find through normal means. Don't be afraid to check into it more than once while in Ventu; you never know what the shelves will be carrying!\n\nThe village itself also has its fair share of secrets to discover; some aren't present immediately, but reveal over time as the game progresses. It's worth taking a look around Ventu inbetween levels, as you may find special color capsules. [spoiler]Along with a unique part...the fabled Megabyte Fist.[/spoiler]\n\nAlongside the Campaign, you can also play Tournament! This is a 1-player endurance mode where you fight 8 rounds against specialized enemies. One may be heavily armored, making direct attacks useless. Another may be highly evasive, ducking out of range to fire shots. It's a highly-replayable mode, encouraging you to tweak your build between rounds. Placing high rewards Bits, and first place nets you a special part.\n\nAnd finally, there's Battle mode, where you and 3 people can fight against one another. It's fun to see how your friends and you play off of each other's styles, and strategically plan around them while also taking into account you may have 2 other people wanting to take you on as well.\n\n[h1]Finale[/h1]\n(Spoilers ahead!)\n\nI wanted to give special mention to the final boss of the game, as it is possibly the best curve ball the game has to throw at you. Around the end of the game, [spoiler]the Heartcore has been stolen by the Valk, leaving Ventu Village in a terminal state of duress. Without the Heartcore, Ventu and everyone in it will die off, prompting you to venture out one last time to get it back. The catch? It's in the hands of the Valk Emperor.\n\nThis guy plays for keeps. The Emperor is far harder than any enemy you'll encounter; he fights fast and dirty, prompting you to prepare in advance and to apply all your knowledge of the game thus far. His parts are unique to him, including a special ability that only his chestplate has: Summon Clone, which lets him create an identical copy of himself to fight you with. You'll have to be highly aggressive to put him down.\n\nAnd then it's STILL not over!\n\nThe Emperor's final play comes in the form of harnessing the Heartcore's power to become gigantic! Standing as the largest enemy in the game, he has a massive range of attacks. He can shoot, launch rockets, punch through your shield, punch YOU off the stage, and that's just the first half of the fight! The second half adds a missile barrage that you're forced to evade or deflect back. He's a grueling fight, but defeating him is nothing less than satisfying. Beating him unlocks the credits and his special parts for purchase in the shop.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1] (tl;dr)\n\nIn all, the game is absolutely worth the time of any fighting game fanatics. Even if you're not that all into fighting games, the deep exploration and discovering secrets is highly rewarding and a lot of fun. I had a blast completing this game, and I'll probably come back to it a lot; I'm even thinking of starting over again and bringing some friends along!

I didn't think that the art design was all that appealing, and I didn't think it would play very nicely. I bought the game along with fifteen other games in a bundle, and I was certain that this would be one of those games that I would spend 15 minutes on and never play again for the rest of my life. Several hours later, at 4:45 in the morning, I found myself still playing this game. \n\nThis game is basically the God-sent answer to fill the Super Smash Brothers hole in every PC gamer's heart. Rather than being a blatant ripoff, however, it embraces the combat that makes the series so fun but then allows you to create your own, unique character with its own fighting style. With more than a hundred parts to customize your robot with, you can make your character truly unique. There is a full, fleshed-out campaign with plot that gives explanation to everything's existence, and the opportunity to find new parts for your robot.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything, that list would be short. Here it is:\nThere is no online capability at all.\nThe tournament mode should at least reward you for trying, to have incentive to keep playing it.\nThere is no \"versus\" mode with bots.\n\nBut I'm not complaining otherwise.

You utilize these abilities to get through the story and your enemies to beat the game, which starts off basic and easy. As you beat enemies, you collect parts, which can boost your abilities or give you unique attacks. There's a large variety, and enough overlap that you can pick and choose based on aesthetic and still get the bonuses/moves you want.\n\nAs you encounter more enemy and move types in more challenging levels, the game becomes progressively more fun and engaging. The story is sparse but actually relatively decent for its type. Still, for the most part the aim of the game is to beat things up, and I'm here to report to you that it excels at this, being just as fluid and fast as Smash while adding its own innovations, and keeping a great sense of balance with the cooldowns on the various attacks, be they big and satisfying or short and sweet. There are mid-range, long-range, and close-range options, with a roughly 40/60 split between ranged and melee variants. You can stack parts providing defense, offense, jumps, ranged/melee attacks, or more for specialized or fun builds, so the gameplay promotes a lot of individual technical skill while retaining a lot of fun. Basically, I'm telling you to buy it if you for some reason haven't already!\n\n[h1][b]Graphics:[/b][/h1]\nThe graphics in Megabyte Punch are downright gorgeous. They retain a vibrant blocky style that would be at home in a NES Zelda title but they don't rely on pixels or take any shortcuts to look good. There's a very good spread of variety to the levels and environments, and plenty of skin colors to unlock and you can definitely make some great looking megacs to dish out the beatings with.\n \n[h1][b]Audio:[/b][/h1]\nThe music and sounds while perhaps not universally appealing are all very high quality. Well produced, sensible, and satisfying.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h1]\nWhile I still wholeheartedly recommend MBP as a solo experience, if you have even just one friend that you can couch party it up with, I can confidently recommend you buy Megabyte Punch at:\n\n[b]Full price.[/b]..but it does go on sale and in bundles frequently.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\nThis endorsement approved by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/trureviews]The Reviewers' Union[/url],\nproviding better standards for reviews and reviewers.\n[h1]======================================[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1460323382, "timestamp_updated": 1460333422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737790167331695557", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22320246": {"recommendationid": "22320246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067359292", "num_games_owned": 479, "num_reviews": 304, "playtime_forever": 875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 724, "last_played": 1460230676}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like this, the game is a combination of Smash brothers and Medabots.\n\nYou collect enemies robotic parts, some only add to your stats, others add special attacks, the design is cute, there is a lot of collectibles and the tournament mode is challenging.\n\nThe only  small downside for me now is that there is not that much variation with the special powers, I would have hoped to have a bit more special attacks.

A little bit about where I'm coming from: I'm a 30-something that grew up on side-scrolling platformers like the original Mega Man series for NES as well as couch coop beat-em ups like Streets of Rage.  Very few games can scratch that itch these days, and this game manages to do that with an engaging adventure mode which has you working your way through various open ended stages and an arena mode with some of the most satisfying competitive play you'll find anywhere. Both modes can be played with between 1-4 players so grab your friends, a controller, a beer and be prepared to be entertained.\n \nThe combat is very much like Smash Brothers in that you don't just die after receiving a set amount of damage. Instead, the more damage you take makes it easier for you to be flung further and faster with each hit you take. Take a hit that launches you into a wall hard enough or off the stage and you blow up spectacularly. I cannot stress enough how satisfying it is to roundhouse kick an enemy through a wall and watch him break into bits on the rock behind it. This goes doubly so for launching your friend's character into orbit when they are sitting next to you on the couch and you can observe their reaction in real time!  \n\nThe adventure mode's premise is that you are a digital being call a \"Megac\" born from something of a super computer called the Heartcore to protect your village. You quest through various large stages, each with multiple paths to the finish and a reasonable difficulty curve. Exploration is both highly encouraged and rewarded with goodies being hidden in unorthodox places that the keen observer (or just plain lucky) will find. As you destroy enemies there is a chance that they will drop one of their \"parts\" similar to how Mega Man can absorb defeated bosses powers but with a much higher degree of customization. As a Megac, you can take those parts and customize yourself on the fly creating various builds you can switch as the need arises. Your Megac is made up of a head, shoulders, core, hips, two arms and two legs. Each one of these can be customized making for characters that play wildly different from eachother. These parts can either buff a particular attribute of your Megac or provide a special ability. Bosses at the end of stages make for good challenges as well as dropping rare parts unique to them.\n\nMultiplayer is an arena affair with all of your custom Megacs squaring off in a variety of floating platforms. All of the combat mechanics are the same, although certain parts become more useful in this setting than the adventure mode. A very skilled player will have no issues using any of the parts, however.   \n\nFrom a mechanical standpoint, the first time I booted up the game the controls felt a little \"floaty.\" I realized that the reason for this is the game defaults to using an analog stick for movement which is different from my Mega Man/Smash Brothers muscle memory I have built up over the years by using the d-pad.  Having that much more throw in the control does take some getting used to and I suspect is the reason that some of these reviews say the platforming could use some work. Once you adapt to the difference or change your controls, you are fine.\n\nFor all that is great there are some criticisms I can level at the game. The elephant in the room is a lack of online multiplayer. At the time of development Team Reptile (who would later go on to make Lethal League) made the choice to forego online functionality as they weren't sure they could implement it to the standard the rest of the game was made. I'd love to see them revisit this title and add it now, as they most certainly have the expertise to do so. Also, there is the issue of unlocking parts. If you just buy this game now and sit down with your friends to play, you will have almost no parts to make your Megacs with because they are unlocked via the adventure mode. A \"free vs.\" mode would have solved this issue entirely. \n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game enough if you are okay with the caveats I have listed above. 9/10 \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1448731119, "timestamp_updated": 1448731119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19272967": {"recommendationid": "19272967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115470381", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1460932993}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, shame it has no online co op", "timestamp_created": 1448486092, "timestamp_updated": 1448486092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19151761": {"recommendationid": "19151761", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984505368", "num_games_owned": 1522, "num_reviews": 223, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1447888482}, "language": "english", "review": "Whilst this looks quite promising, I just cannot get-on with the combat at all.\n\nWhen you hit/shoot something, it might barely move or it might pinball around the level and explode spectacularly - seems random what actually happens.\n\nUpgrades seem to offer TINY benefits and are quite tiresome to sort through (and the game doesn't pause whilst you do that either!!)\n\nGames looks nice but it's SO repetitive that you quickly get lost in the world (there are arrows to give hints so the developer clearly realised this but it still means the place is VERY samey)\n\nIt's the combat tho - it gives the feeling of randomness and damage-sponge enemies and - I can't be bothered with it.", "timestamp_created": 1447888742, "timestamp_updated": 1447888742, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460940927267074585", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18999186": {"recommendationid": "18999186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065006598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1634700083}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing!, it's like a megaman settingss with minecraft, because you can fight and break blocks.", "timestamp_created": 1447193963, "timestamp_updated": 1447193963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18853634": {"recommendationid": "18853634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135143088", "num_games_owned": 630, "num_reviews": 447, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1446541991}, "language": "english", "review": "This is awesome.

Just uppercutting enemies or kicking them to far distances with one of the arms and legs respectively gives me a lot of fun and satisfaction, watching them fly to their deaths exploding and destroying the scenario, just eye-gasm, the destructible scenario is a little add-on that, while it does nothing for story progresion except for the drilling part to get to new areas, just makes the killing of enemies and overall playing of the game thousands of times more enjoyable, it doesn't get old.\n\nTo the developer, Thank you!

In fact, it was described to me as Custom Robo meets Super Smash Brothers. I have not played the former, but I can tell you that Megabyte Punch postively smacks of the latter: Damage to players is calculated as an increasing percentage, and you do not die unless you are launched out of the arena or level: however, the higher your damage percentage, the further you get knocked by attacks, and unlike Smash, you can be exploded if you slam into a solid surface fast enough. Also like Smash, the game is horribly balanced, favoring setups that use cheap, powerful weapons and players with the response time of a goddamn hummingbird. Multiplayer is likely a blast for someone who enjoys such, as I did not. However, I found the campaign a mostly enjoyable experience, thanks to MP's excellent music, colorful graphics and simplistic, but eye-grabbing art style. There is considerable depth of character customization. The wall-jump mechanic is a bit odd, however- no actual use of the jump button is involved, you need only push away from the wall if you are contact with it. I've never seen this anywhere else and I found it more awkward then not. However, the game's greatest flaw is by far its difficulty. The campaign starts out easily enough but across a mere six or so levels, quickly ramps up to a ridiculous degree, aggrivated by an archaic lives system in which they only way to acquire more is to gather 64 bits, the game's coins. I was unable to beat the final boss and had grown weary of the game well before that point. I am sure there is someone out there who can and has beaten him.

Also, you won't be able to set up interesting battles vs the AI. Aside from the story mode, you can either do tournament mode and fight the AI 1v1 8 times, or you can do battle mode and fight up to 4 players split-screen. There is no option to create a custom game with players vs AI, which is a shame since there are parts of the story mode that are actually 2v2, you and 1 AI vs 2 AI opponents, so the systems are there.\n\nDespite this, I would recommend this game to any Super Smash Bros fans, especially those who also like customization such as that found in Custom Robo or other Mech games. There has been mention of the possibility of a sequel, however there is no word whether or not it's under development or not.

But I'll do the devs a solid for a bit and just give them a binary 'yes'.\n\nMegabyte Punch has a lot going for it, as far as indies go. For one, it tries to emulate the fighting style and feel of the ever-so-popular Smash Bros. series of fighting games, and puts in a bit of Custom Robo meets... Mega Man into the mix. While this sounds like a dream come true, where it really fails at is the Smash Bros. part. Before we get to that, let's start with the good.\n\nGood:\n- The graphics are very well done. Nice, bright, but very cool colors, and pretty well done if a bit simplistic robot design.\n- Level Design does it's job well. Damage tiles, secrets, so far so good.\n- Lighthearted kid-like humor in the writing. I wouldn't be afraid to hand this to a niece or nephew.\n- Music is nice.\n\nMeh:\n- Gameplay feels very static and restrained. As far as I can tell every bot has the same default attacks, and what's changed is the secondary (specials in Smash.) moveset. What's also missing from Smash are...well, smash attacks, and rolling. In-game I always try to pull off those two moves, and it just bugs the hell outta me when I can't. \n\nBad:\n- Sound effects. No, seriously, it's annoying enough to be a problem. There is a delay when opening up some of the customization options, and it's very noticable. Same goes for some attacks, and the explosion sound repeats for each object per explosion and it sounds terrible.\n- Local-only multiplayer. It's rare to find someone willing to huddle around a monitor to play some indie game, and I haven't been very lucky.\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty nice. I can't speak for multiplayer, because of said local-only multiplayer, but it's alright to kill an afternoon with or you're just on a coffee break or somethin'. I don't think the game needs a very built computer to play on.\n\nSo, 6.5/10. Great idea, average implementation. If they fix all my gripes, This game would be an 8 or 9 easy.

The story itself was very well constructed and written, with a great plot and story arch. though I didn't finish the story I was very happy with what I did get through.\n\nWhile I was fighting the enemies I was exclaiming \"HOLY S***!!\" because the way to kill enemies is to bash them against the walls and have them explode into and through the walls. One instance where this was very apparent is when I purposefully kept hitting an enemy into a wall to increase his damage percentage to a very high percent, when I pulled my finisher move on him he demolished a huge chunk of wall. This shock factor only really happens when the walls are destructible, and for the second level all the walls were indestructible so the shock factor dissipated.\n\nThe games graphics aren't anything to fancy, they are quite dull in modeling but make up for it in color. The character recoloring was welcome in making the game very colorful, I even made my guy looking like Batman, bat wings and grey color.\n\nThe Tournament mode was a very welcome challenge. I never got past round 5 because the bots are super powerful, compared to story mode. Their damage equaled mine and had every customization that I myself could have. I found myself having as much AA damage as possible and hitting them with ariels to maximize my effectiveness in battle.\n\n~~~~RATINGS~~~~\n\nReplay Value : 7/10\n\nGame time (estimated to completion) / Cost : 25/15 10/10\n\nArtwork: 5/10\n\nStory: 8/10\n\nMechanics: 10/10\n\n~~~~~~~OVERALL RATING~~~~~~~~~~\n\n~~~~ 80/100 ~~~~", "timestamp_created": 1426479397, "timestamp_updated": 1426578218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14699841": {"recommendationid": "14699841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044890569", "num_games_owned": 469, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 463, "last_played": 1425683720}, "language": "english", "review": "This game.

If you have ever played SSB and felt that you could never find a character that fit welll, now you can make one. The game use a similar control scheme where you have the standard or \"A\" button attacks and then depending on what parts you equip you can add your special attacks/abilities or \"B\" Button moves. You can even change which direction you use for the move combo to your own liking. There are plenty of parts to choose from, once you unlocked them of course. The only issue I have is that there is a lack of size cusomiztion, being able to change your character's size would help give the game more of a SSB vibe as that ga,me has heavy to light characters which affect speed and knock out. Despite that, you will have plenty of options to choose from, such as Powerful Uppercuting Fist to legs that boost speed to cores that boost shielding ability to Shoulders that give you extra jumps and the effects can be foud on multiple part types or sometimes on the same part type but in a different look, which is makes the customizing easier both functionally or comsemticly. \n\nThe only concerns are the lack of online multi player and the tournament mode where the CPU players must be made out  of a dense alloy as they can still remain in the battle despite having 300 damage but you little robo will have a hard time staying once it has 100 damage; they also must have been modeled on that one guy who spams the same moves as they love to and will not hesitate to use the same move repeatedly. \n\nPROS: \n\n- Runs Great, no bugs or crashing\n- Lots of variety in Character Customization\n- Adventure Mode is fun with secrets to find and parts to unlock\n- Tournament Mode is a good test of skill (or of how cheap you robo's fighting style is)\n\nCONS: \n\n- Tour. Mode CPU needs to be brought back to Earth (So when I uppercut them at 200 DMG they go flying)\n- Tour.

It does not quite have the sophisticated move sets and balancing of either game, but the combination of the two creates a fairly fun game.\n\nThe adventure/campaign mode is about 6-8 hours long, depending on how much backtracking is done in each level for rare parts and color customization items, and each boss fight is essentially bare bone Super Smash Bros. stages but with some destructable terrain.  The story is simple as well, but considering the genre and style of the game and the fun factor, it can be forgiven.  Connecting a spin kick on an enemy gives a nice satisfying feedback in slow-mo sound and visuals as you watch them fly. The level visuals are nice as your character travels to different regions. It never felt like a chore to play the game. \n\nGiven the strong foundation that this game has built, I hope a sequel would be made that expanded on the combat system through part diversity. There may be many parts but there isn't a wide variety as many share the same abilities.  They may be located in different areas of the character's body, such as double jump attached to the head instead of the shoulder, or are cosmetically different and functionally the same.  Also, the majority of abilities can be found about halfway through the game which makes backtracking for rare parts in later levels to be less rewarding. Considering that many are variations from Super Smash Bros., I wouldn't mind seeing more abilities and ideas borrowed too. For example, the shield mechanism doesn't allow rolling, which I found myself repeatedly trying to do. Basic melee combat is always at a fixed range because there are no melee weapons and parts don't extend attack range. Just adding some of these can be a massive improvement on an already solid game.\n\nOverall though I found Megabyte Punch to be a fun and would definitely help scratch the itch for a bit of Megaman and Supersmash Bros. game on Steam.

Of course you do! But have you ever been playing Smash Brothers and wished you were a completely customizable robot? If so, then this is the game for you. Megabyte Punch is essentially Smash Brothers between robots with customization. It's not the most original idea but it is fantastic.\n\nFor the story, you are a simple robot fighter living in a simple village till evil comes along and forces you to take action. You fight through a bunch of levels, each one containing a boss at the end, collecting parts and making money. You get a great feeling when you finally find a new kickass weapon to place on your robot, or a new ability, or an enhancement of an ability you already have. You can change up your head, torso, hip, back, left arm, right arm, left leg, and right leg, Also there are a bunch of color designs to be unlocked throughout the game that can be applied to your robot. The customization is probably this game's strongest feature. You can also complete the story mode with a friend in couch coop or compete against them in arena style matches. \n\nSome minor complaints I would have with the game would be that the robot customization system can take some time to get used to. Also, you have to physically run to each level before starting it up. Being able to just teleport from the town to the level would save some time. These are very minor complaints and do not take away from the game to any serious degree.\n\nOverall, this is a great game at a good price with only minor problems. If you are interested in a fighting/customization/robot game with couch coop then you should definitely give this a try.\n", "timestamp_created": 1423606981, "timestamp_updated": 1423606981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14398559": {"recommendationid": "14398559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069022833", "num_games_owned": 801, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 111, "last_played": 1423533698}, "language": "english", "review": "I always liked platformers like Megaman, and this game has very good similarities, plus tons of customizations.

It showed potential when I first started playing it. I recently picked it up again, but found myself wanting for the end to come; the ingame credits or otherwise. \n\nPROS:\n -The Super Smash Bros. style combat system works fairly well, with the player being able to smash their opponents into the wall or off the stage.\n -The game is of average length.\n -The parts system is easy to understand, intuitive and interesting.\n -Part designs are interesting and varied.\n -There is a stage editor.\n\nCONS:\n -Stages can be 1/2~1 hour long.\n -There are no checkpoints in any stage except for the boss at the end, so if you lose all of your lives, you'll have to start the entire stage all over again. (which leads to artificial playtime extension)\n -I've played through the entire game yet still have no clue what the story is.\n -The final boss is frustrating, with absolutely no payoff after killing him.\n -Sometimes, you will die because the controls fail you.\n -Wall jumping is useful on a keyboard, but definitely not on a controller.\n\nOverall, the game is OK, but not worth a buy unless A) you're a fanatic of Smash Bros.-style games or B) it's super cheap.\n\n---PRE-ENDGAME REVIEW POSTED JULY 14, 2016 [Positive]---\nThink of Super Smash Bros.

It took around 10 hours to get to the end, no 100%.\n\nI heard the comparisons to Super Smash Bros. and Custom Robo and didn't believe it at first, but it got me interested in the game.  And I'm really glad I picked this up now.  \n\nSo you're a super fighting robot, and it's your mission to go beat up other robots in the Levels and beat the boss at the end of the third stage of each Level.  Controls felt pretty tight.  On a controller, left stick moves, you have a button for jump, normal attacks, special attacks, and the parts menu.  You can wall jump, sprint, double jump, and have a variety of normal attacks based on tilting the stick or if you're in the air (no smash attacks here).  But the rest of the fancy stuff comes from parts.\n\nMegabyte Punch is part exploration, part platformer, part fighter, part collectathon.  The basic premise of the game is to find the door in each stage to advance to the next section until you get to the end of the third stage and fight the boss to clear the level.  On your way, you'll fight other custom-made robots both in the field and in arenas that seal themselves off when you enter.  Like Smash, you still have to raise the unseen damage number for your enemies, and like Smash, a particularly hard hit will send them flying.  But if your foe slams into a hard surface, it explodes, leaving behind life-granting Bits or a custom part.  Or if they go into the soft blocks, they'll cut right through them and explode.  And the same applies to you.\n\nBoss battles twist the basic formula and turns it into an itemless match of Smash.  Smack the boss around and get his damage up and then send him into the black killzones around the area a few times.  And of course, try not to burn all your lives in the process, or you'll have to start the entire level over.  \n\nI liked exploring, though outside of the forced-fight arenas, you're allowed to rush to the end.  The issue then is finding the right way to go.  The damage you take is permanent until you die and respawn, so rushing may end up being the better option for some.  You can carry a small inventory of extra parts from the robots you destroy and from there you can swap out with what you currently have on, but everything not equipped goes to your inventory at home when you go through any door.  You more or less start each stage with the clothes on your back, but you can break down any spare parts for Bits--64 of which give an extra life, and you start each Level with three no matter what.  \n\nI wouldn't say the platforming was necessarily hard, but I went with more jumps and most of the challenge was maneuvering around obstacles with enemies present, or dealing with dangers like damage plates and mines in the arenas.  Each stage is pretty big though, especially if you try to drill through the soft blocks.  \n\nParts do a variety of things, like give you passive mobility boosts or extra jumps, or some give you special attacks you assign to Neutral, Up, Down, and Side B.  While there are a lot of parts, there aren't as many unique effects, but you could argue it's partly for aesthetics reasons too.  You can equip to your torso, head, shoulder, left and right arms each, left and right legs each, and hips.  And there are color palettes to collect too, though you can't customize each part's color--it's everything or nothing.  You can save quite a few parts and color loadouts too.\n\nProgression in specials felt a little stagnant, but it was less \"ever-powerful moves in later stages\" and more \"everyone is mostly on the same playing field.\"  The strongest special is the 25-damage Megabyte Punch, and I had a move that did 18 in the first level, though it was slow coming out.  Every move felt like it had a use, as opposed to 100 moves of which you'd use 10 at best.  \n\nOverall, if you enjoyed Adventure Mode/Subspace Emissary in Smash, you'd probably like this game.  It has local 2-4 coop for Adventure, there's Versus, and a Tournament Mode to get rare parts.  No online, but desyncs and lag would hamper enjoyment for a game like this.  Lots of parts, lots of things to beat up, great length for the price.  \n\nAnd I had a smile on my face from the first time I spiked one of those little robots through the ground.\n", "timestamp_created": 1414284505, "timestamp_updated": 1414284505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619146883487701416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12582452": {"recommendationid": "12582452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040982862", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1033, "last_played": 1413809025}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!\nA Megaman X Smashbros perfectly done with a Sonic-like retro design.\nThe sound track is pretty cool too.\n\nThe online part is the only missing point for this game to become a must-have.\n\nNow i'm looking for similar games :D", "timestamp_created": 1413811134, "timestamp_updated": 1413811134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580863118171691895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12561817": {"recommendationid": "12561817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065024702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3614, "last_played": 1693276044}, "language": "english", "review": "If your a fan of the SUper Smash Bro Games and have played and liked Custom Robo for the GameCube, then you will love this game.

The higher the enemies damage is, the easier it will be to either kill them or laumch them off screen and kill them. However there is no way to heal yourself other than dying. Its also got a Super Mario component to it where if you collect 64 Bits in adventure mode, you get an extra life. As for your character itself this is where the Custom Robo part come in to play. In Custom Robo, you can collect parts that can give you stat boosts or new attacks and abilities. Megabyte Punch does the exact same thing. Each part can either increase your stats or give you a new attack and you can obtain new parts by either winning tournament mode, defeating enemies in adventure mode, or buying them from the shop in adventure mode..

THIS GAME ONLY SUPPORTS LOCAL CO-OP AND VERSUS MODES. [/b]\n\nI'm really not one to write reviews because I believe other people are able to better define why or why you shouldn't buy the game, but because I've burned so many hours into this, I felt I needed to speak about it.\n\n[b] Megabyte Punch is what would happen if Super Smash Brothers met Custom Robo and created a multiplayer campaign. [/b]\n\n[h1] Overview: [/h1]\n\nWhen you load the game you're given a few options: Campaign, Tournament (the 1-player stage fighter) or Versus (the multiplayer stage fighter). You can play the campaign with up to four players, and the screen is split so you can explore on your own without trapping players in a corner (a la Gauntlet style).\n\n[h1] Campaign: [/h1]\n\nPlaying Campaign allows you to unlock new colors and parts for the game. The game boosts 30 color schemes and 150 parts (some of which are duplicates for different body parts). \n\nYou play through 6 worlds, each having 3 levels and a boss at the end. Each world can take about 15 - 30 minutes, depending on if you're trying to find the colors/parts or just racing for the finish. There are also two bonus levels, one of which is fairly difficult. \n\n[b] Overall, the Campaign is a solid 7/10. [/b] Story is okay, the levels are fun, the bosses are great, but it doesn't have any replay value unless you want to play with friends.\n\n[h1] Multiplayer: [/h1]\n\nThis is where the game shines. I recommend getting some parts and colors from the campaign, then playing Multiplayer with some friends. \n\nThe game has full X360 controller support, and you can change the controls to best suit you (that said, I've never changed them because they're perfect for this game).\n\nThe first time you play Multiplayer (Campaign or Versus) be prepared for about 5 minutes per player of setup time. The nice thing is you can save your Megac Set to the game, making for a quick load the next time you play together.\n\nOnce you get into Versus mode and everyone is ready, you'll enter the stage select screen. There are 15(?) stages to select, along with 3 custom stages you can create.\n\nThe Multiplayer is exactly like Super Smash Bros with no items: Just you and your abilities trying to knock your opponents off the stage.\n\nThe big downside to Multiplayer is the lack of match customization. You can only play 4-stock, no time limits. While I've never run into any problems with this ruleset, it would be nice to have a time mode, or items.\n\n[b] Overall, Multiplayer receives a 9/10, and is the main pull for this title. [/b] The lack of online Multiplayer prevents me from playing with a few friends, but this game is really meant to be played with people right next to you with everyone yelling at the monitor/TV.\n\n[h1] Other/General [/h1]\n\nTournament mode is quite the challenge, but allows you to unlock a few secret parts in the game that you can't get through Campaign. There is also the task of tracking down all 30 color schemes and all 150 parts, so there's plenty of exploration to be done, and the game has a lot of replay value.\n\n[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]\n\n[b] I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Super Smash Brothers, Custom Robo, or has friends who enjoy Co-Op Campaigns. [/b] While I did mention the Campaign is lacking a little, it's still an absolute blast with several people, but the main pull will still be the customization and the Versus mode.\n\nI look forward to any future updates or Megabyte Punch 2 (f there are any plans).", "timestamp_created": 1413505767, "timestamp_updated": 1413505987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912531673908233643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12504619": {"recommendationid": "12504619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020898916", "num_games_owned": 713, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 1197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1082, "last_played": 1458404354}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth every penny.

The worse thing about bad controls is it's really hard to explain so i'll give my best to but it won't be an accurate description: For starters you can only have 3 abilities which you can slot in certain directions for example up, down and left + Right. You then have to be pressing in that direction in order to use the ability so if i had teleport on UP i would press UP + Special how ever if i wanted to teleport to the right i have to pull off an extremely tricky UP + Special into the direction i want to use. If you're a second too late it doesn't work and you often find yourself doing one of the other two abilities you have slotted half of the time and the other half you'll find yourself teleporting up.

Then you would be able to do the ability in any direction you wanted but no you can't do it like that because that would make sense!\nTo do a combo attack you have to be stood still and press the attack key how ever when you're running at an enemy and pressing the attack key it does a heavy attack flinging the enemy away from you so you can't get an extra hit and end up doing minimal damage.

It takes a working formula and overhauls it with loads of customization, while cutting out unneeded mechanics. This creates a fast-paced fighting game with a fun adventure game stacked on top. Unfortunately, the lack of ability to create your own custom matchups as well as the lack of online multiplayer drags the game down to being merely \"really good\".\n\nThe meat of the game revolves around exploring levels, destroying enemies, and taking their broken parts as your own. The game uses a Super Smash Bros. style damage system, where the more damage a character has, the further an attack will send them flying. Non-boss adversaries can be destroyed by bashing them against a wall at high enough velocities, while bosses are fought in a classic Sumo-wrestling slugfest.\n\nThe game is much more fast-paced than Super Smash Bros. and actively encourages building combos; A skill you'll need to master if you want to defeat bosses or win the tournament. As an aside, smacking an enemy hard enough to send them destructively cratering through the terrain is [i]extremely[/i] satisfying.\n\nFallen enemies will drop either currency or one of their body parts, which you can install on your own character. Each part has a different ability attatched to it, ranging from increasing the number of double jumps you have to giving you a chaingun for an arm. You can have drills attatched to all of your limbs, allowing you to tear through destructable blocks with ease... or you can equip a bunch of parts that increase your damage output, turning you into a close-range terror. It's even possible to build a perfect replica of every humanoid character in the game - even the shopkeeper and the final boss!\n\nThe presentation uses chunky 3D models and colorful if not cliche environments - the overrall presentation manages to evoke some level of nostalgia without looking like a shitty NES game. More people need to figure out that this is possible.\n\nThe soundtrack is similarilly modern-nostalgic, combining the composition of chiptune music with modern synthesizers and drumkits. While I do feel that some of the level themes are a bit too cliche for their own good (looking at you, Ancient Tech Ruins) the overall soundtrack is pretty catchy, and in some cases, pretty hype too.\n\nNow, as with any good game, Megabyte Punch has some serious flaws. Firstly, finding some rare parts doesn't involve \"finding\" them so much as going through the same level over and over again until you randomly encounter a version of the enemy carrying that part. I must have played through Frostbyte Deep five times before one of the enemies decided to spawn with the Frostbyte Leg part. Additionally, while the game does tell you that certain rare parts can only be won in the tournament, it does not tell you that certain postgame parts can only be found in the shop... the shop which only carries duplicates of parts you already have 99% of the time.\n\nAnother flaw with the game is the predictability of the AI. It's unfair to expect AAA-level brilliance from a game made by two guys, but the fact that I can [i]repeatedly[/i] spam the Submachine Gun until the enemy shields, break said shield, and then KO them with a tornado kick without fail is a bit... disappointing. Additionally, the boss opponents become easilly confused when faced with more than one player character, rendering them unable to decide who to attack. And any enemy with a plasma cannon will annoyingly spam projectiles.\n\nAll of these flaws are forgiveable. The game was made by two programmers and one composer, give them a break. However, there is ONE flaw with this game that I absolutely do not understand: [b]there is no online multiplayer in Megabyte Punch.[/b] The official reason for this is that neither of the programmers had any prior knowledge of netcode and they didn't want to incorporate a flawed feature, so they left it out entirely instead. As far as co-op adventure mode or random matchmaking goes, this seems like a rational desicion. But can't I at least play peer-to-peer versus mode with a friend? I want to see what kind of character they've built, and I want to see how they fight, but I can't. For a PC exclusive fighting game, this is completely absurd.\n\nDespite the glaring flaws in the game's design, however, I still had a crapload of fun with Megabyte Punch. The game's customization and two singleplayer game modes add a ton of replay value to the game, especially if you like to experiment with building new characters. If you're a fan of Super Smash Bros. style fighting, Cave Story style exploration, and Custom Robo style character building, I seriously suggest you play this game.\n\nOh yeah, and when the wise old robot tells you to seek out Three Flowers, keep in mind that they're stacked vertically.

Every time I punched one of them, they would fly a few screens away. I don't even know if they did any damage!\n\nBugs were another problem with this game. I somehow managed to punch a character through the entire flooring of the level all the way to to the bottom. As cool as it looked, it turned out that was not actually supposed to happen. Had I not had wings to fly back to the area, I would have been forever screwed. That of course was only one of the bugs I ran across, but hopefully you see my point.\n\nIt was at that point that I decided I just couldn't stomach it any further (about 30 minutes in).

Those robots that blew up for a short amount of time because of their Gameboy games? If you don't or if you need a bit of a refresher: Medabots were robots that were acclaimed for their customizability. Within the games, you were able to change out each arm, each leg, the chest, the head, the hip, and even their power medals. Every piece you changed gave that medabot a different ability, whether it was a passive like increasing their attack power or it was an active like the ability to do a powerslide. You could piece together a tank medabot, with actives and passive that supproted the generally slower and bulkier parts. Or you could make a speedy medabot, with parts that quadrupled its speed, but made it very fragile. Another piece of the game was how you gained parts: by beating your opponent and randomly taking one of the defeated medabots' peices. But if you lost, you lost one of your pieces. It made each battle exciting and very competitive among friends. Now, take all of that, give it updated graphics and stuff it into a platformer and you have Megabyte Punch. Although the game could be a new remake of Medabots in a different genre, it is still a tremendous amount of fun, especially with friends. With that being said, MP (Megabyte Punch) has a few minor flaws that culminate to knock it down from a perfect score. The levels being to feel a bit repetative, even if they are still entertraining enough to keep you going. The bosses are pretty hard (only because they are ungodly spammy), which is weird after extremely easy build-up levels. And the final flaw is something so simply fixed that it pains me to have to bring it up: hit-boxes. While most are okay, some of the moves have really annoying and off hit-boxes, screwing up those perfect and delicious combos that the game allows for. One move that always messes up my juggle combos is the up-basic attack, as the hit-box is only on the side you are facing, making the juggle much harder than it should be.\n\nEven with the minor flaws, this game still stands tall as a monument of customization. It fights like Super Smash Bros with more combos and (unfortunately) more spam. Either way, try this game. If you can convice a few friends to join you in co-op or versus, you'll enjoy it even more.\n\n8.75/10", "timestamp_created": 1403486547, "timestamp_updated": 1403486547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "10671014": {"recommendationid": "10671014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040556302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 426, "last_played": 1550781704}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like Smash Bros. but you make your own character and its got pelvic thrusting as an actual game mechanic.", "timestamp_created": 1403454892, "timestamp_updated": 1403454892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "10651403": {"recommendationid": "10651403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052785444", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3319, "last_played": 1403420690}, "language": "english", "review": "I had much higher hopes for this game...

[i]Megabyte Punch[/i] is a platforming beat-em-up that gives players a lot of control over how their fighter handles. Both the entire Adventure mode and Versus mode can be played locally with up to 4 players, and players can test their mettle against the AI in Tournament mode.\n\nIn Adventure mode, players travel from their base of operations to 6 different areas and beat up everything in sight. Each area has 3 levels, and each level has plenty of enemies to fight and parts to collect. Once you get the hang of fighting a lot of enemies won't pose a serious threat, but as a whole Adventure mode is well paced and great for players who want to collect everything.\n\nCustomization is where the game really shines. Once you defeat an enemy and collect their scraps, combine the looted parts into a brawling robot that fits your style. Want to get up close and personal? Teleport point blank and slide kick into the enemy. Prefer ranged combat? There's a sniper rifle and a minigun for that. Need defense? Bring a shield and load up on armor. Don't care about fancy moves? Stock up on stat boosters and extra jumps. And if you want to be a real pain, there's always poison attacks and mines. If you want to be both functional and fashionable, several parts grant the same bonuses so your creation will look and feel just right.\n\nWhen you think you've perfected your mechanized marauder, take them to Versus mode and Tournament mode. Up to four players can duke it out in one of the Versus stages, or you can even make your own [url=http://forum.reptile-games.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=110] custom levels\t [/url]. If you don't have anyone around to challenge, take the fight to Tournament mode to demolish computer opponents and collect rare parts.\n\nThe game isn't perfect; there's no online multiplayer, limited versus options, and the Tournament AI can be punishing. While there are a lot of parts, many share the same abilities and can leave you wanting more by the end. The walljumping mechanic is nice, but I can't count the number of times I've accidentally bounced off a wall into a painful death. One big problem is the single save file; if you want to start a new game with your friends, [b]it'll wipe out any progress you've made[/b].

It has fluid controls and hits make you feel like you really smacked it. My only farts about it are there are so many parts, but little variety in stats. So all the customizing is more for looks than it is mixing up the abilities. And that last boss...my friend and I have both been working at it and find ourselves struggling to see it worth our time to conquer it. So everything up to that point was definitely fun. Just such a steep curve in difficulty. It's not that it's even that hard, but it takes so long, you mess up and lose, each time feeling less like you want to try again. I wonder if it's worth the win. Or is it like the dang We Love Katamari secret where you spend hours collecting exactly 1,000,000 roses...only for a frickin' stupid looking spinning rose loading icon. \n\nDespite the negative, I would still recommend this game because it looks and plays great. The soundtrack is good too. 6 levels, each with 3 parts plus bosses really felt close to flawless. I really enjoyed the time I spent playing it up till the last boss. If you see it on sale for $5-7 it's definitely worth a purchase. At $14.99 I would have been a bit disappointed.  Then again...thinking back to the old days. Super NES used to sell games up to $80. wtf. And we still bought em, disappointment and all. Man, times have changed.\n\nTo the developer...please update this game with an adjustment to the final boss' difficulty. At least so it levels with the rest of the game. And more variety in part abilities would be nice too. At least something to make certain parts more special than others.

There are also secret collectible colour capsules to change your colour scheme; and believe me, the customization is absolutely stunning. And it may just be me, but shooting the crap out of a robot and sending him flying across a room and exploding him against a wall is pretty cool. But the game can sometimes feel lacking in collectibles and stage length, but it may just be the low-poly art style that puts me off.\n\nAside from the main story, there is also a tournament that you can enter and win rare parts; and a local multiplayer versus mode, which can become amazingly fun and intense. This is definitely worth purchasing, but some people might not appreciate some simplified graphics and monotonous mechanics. All in all, the platforming, environment and gameplay feel amazingly fun and solid.\n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1393669995, "timestamp_updated": 1393669995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9286376": {"recommendationid": "9286376", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999023835", "num_games_owned": 479, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 390, "last_played": 1598481717}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Super Smash Brothers at all, you will love this game.\nThe play style is alot like smash in witch you take damage and fly further with each hit. \nNever made much sense in smash, but in this, your a robot, so stuff breaks, you fly further, you hit a wall hard enough and you blow up.\nYour entire bot is up for customazation so it has that metabots feel to it.\nAll in all so far its been quite a great game, and plenty long too. \nThe campaign is even 4 player co-op.", "timestamp_created": 1393554377, "timestamp_updated": 1393554377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9284195": {"recommendationid": "9284195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005351852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1615, "last_played": 1449608545}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is damn fun to play and so satisfying to kick other Megacs throught the wall when you made lots of damage on them, also this is the result when combining: Super Smash Brawls, Megaman, custom robot and maybe lots other games that would've been combined in this great game, graphics are simple and nice, music are just great to listen.

This game is an utter delight and truly a hidden gem in the sea of Steam.\n\nThe presentation of the game is stellar. I'm astounded by the level of finese Reptile managed to achieve with the free version of the Unity engine. This game has a bright, colorful aesthetic with really nice looking robot models and an old-school feel to level design that screams \"1990's side scroller\". The music is wonderful, and it all gels together amazingly.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing to snuff at either. The game is split into two modes of play: the side scrolling stage-based Adventure mode, and the stationary Smash Bros. style Fight mode. Adventure mode feels a lot like Mega Man, where you go between battle rooms defeating enemies and work your way to the end of the stages. There are six levels with three stages per level and a boss fight at the end of each. You defeat enemies by building up damage on them ala Smash Bros, then using a powerful attack to send them flying at killing speed towards a wall. Enemies will often carve deep into walls, giving you a real feeling of impact as their bodies slice through the terrain of the level that is truly satisfying. As you progress, often doors will lock you into a small arena where you need to defeat multiple enemies before proceeding, which also spawns a checkpoint if you die. Along your path, you will find two kinds of collectable. The first thing you get are Bits, which can be collected for an extra life, 64 netting you a 1-up, and after each level Bits can be spent in the store to obtain rare parts. Speaking of which, your other collectables are a plethora of robot parts, each one having different properties you can get by adding them to your robot in real-time. When you pick up a part, you get the option to attach it to your robot immediately as you play through the stage, letting you not only see and apply your own progression, but also giving you an immense amount of autonamy with what upgrades you want to apply. The part system lets you really choose what kind of play-style you want to go for. There are 150 parts to collect total, each giving you a variety of stat boosts and special attacks, so go nuts.\n\nAfter you're done with the Adventure mode, you can play in the Fight mode. The goal in Fight mode is to build up damage on your enemies then send them flying off the stage, like Smash Bros except with the customization of Custom Robo. There are two ways to play in the fight mode, the first being a Versus with 2 to 4 local players (no bots), or in an 8-round 1v1 tournament against a series of 8 bots. The Versus mode is rioutous fun to play with friends, and if you can hook your PC into a TV it can literally be fun for hours. After showing it to my personal friends, I've had testimony that this game is better than Smash Bros. While I don't necessarily agree, the appeal of the multiplayer is apparent. The other mode that can be played in Fight is the Tournament mode. The goal is to defeat 8 consecutive AI opponents, all randomly drawn from a pool of pre-built opponents. You can switch your build in between each round, and it plays much like Brawl's All-Star mode where you must defeat each opponent with only a limited number of lives in order to achieve victory. Placing in the top four nets you bonus Bits to spend in the shop, which is extremely useful for getting some of the rarer parts, and getting first place nets you rare parts.\n\nThis game is truly great, but it definitely has problems. First, customizing your robot can be fairly slow, as you have to page through 15 pages of parts, 10 parts per page, with no decent organization. Given, the parts are arranged into categories by a sort of soft transition, but it would have been nice to see the parts be separated into different scrolling pages based on the part category, to speed up the sorting process. The second major problem that this game has is that there's no way to play free rounds of Fight mode against a number of AI bots. If you want to play alone, all you have is Adventure and Tournament; playing in a 4-player free-for-all requires you to have 3 friends lying about, and there's no online to fill in the gaps. Third, the game's AI can be a little predictable at points. I found it easy to exploit AI behavior in certain ways, such as spamming ranged shots to build damage without having to move whatsoever, and the AI would just walk into the shots instead of trying to shield and jump away from my line of fire. Fourth, it would have been nice to see a little more part variety. I know, there's 150 parts in the game, but many of the parts are simply aesthetic changes. However, the variety is a very minor complaint as there's quite a bit of variety in there and many parts share stat boosts in order to build robots in certain ways, but it just gets under my skin. And finally, farming to get all the parts is a pain, some of the parts seem to have horribly low drop-rates. As a player who's sole goal is to make his multiplayer games completely multiplayer ready by having everything available, this irked me.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is great, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat, and I'm surprised it managed to go under the radar like it did. This game is one that will even make non-gamers entertained, and it's great for parties. If you haven't gotten it, get it now. For all it's small flaws, this game is truly great and will be an excellent addition to your library.

It was a surprisingly good overall, although it has some serious issues that deters a lot from the experience.\n\nMegabyte Punch is an arcad-y brawler with a fairly high focus on customization. The combat is very much alike Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which is nice to see on a pc. Essentially, you go around several levels, with 3 stages each, with a Boss as a final stage. Each level has its own looks and theme to it which is good for variety. \n\nEach time you lose all your lives (which you can get from collecting Bytes, the game's currency), or you finish a level, you get back to the village, the game's \"Hub\" area.  There, you can go around talking to different Megacs getting a few tips on the game, or go to a store and buy new parts, and then go into another level, which you unlock as you go further into the game.\n\nGraphics.\nAs you can see from the steam screenshots, the game is really great looking! It has a very unique artstyle, and manages to invoke some retro feel while looking very sharp and modern. That's a really nice feature of the game. There's not much else to be said about them. Everything seems to fit pretty well, it's a great 2.5D looking game!\n\nSound.\nAlso, the music is really awesome! Surprisingly so, actually. And music also changes according to the level your in, each fitting the setting as best as possible. There's a level in a desert, with pyramids on the background, and with an oriental sounding track. You get the drill. \nSoundEffects were pretty good as well, giving the combat a good impact after you've done some good damage. More on that further.\n\nCustomization.\nSo, in Megabyte Punch, you control a Megac, with several different parts you can attach to it, each giving a different Stat or Ability, and changing how the character looks. This actually reminded me of Medabots quite a lot, and it was a great throwback to my childhood. That's always a plus!\nThere are 150 parts in total, which you can get through the levels or the Tournament Mode (more on that later). Although there are many parts, some of them have the same effects. Or at least, the same description, since there aren't all that many numerical information about them. That's actually pretty bad, in my opinion. There are parts that simply \"increase damage\". But there's no actual information about its differences. If the only difference is the look of them, it's kind of pointless to have those in, isn't it?\nAh well, overall, customization wasn't bad, but there is much room for improvement, to be honest.\n\nCombat.\nSo, this is probably one of the most important components of this game. Unfortunately, it does not feel as well and it should, most of the time. The biggest issue I had with it was the knockback. If you're familiar with SSBB's combat, you know that as the opponent gets more and more damaged, the impact rises until he flies into a wall and explodes. Well, it's the same here. BUT, the first hits simply throw the opponent away enough so that it's hard for you to hit him a second time, as a follow up. That leads to Punch-step-punch-step-punch... etc. This makes the combat very sloppy, and not that fluid. It makes it harder to combo moves, and it leads to imense frustration when the opponent is hit, and then attack you right away to the ridiculous knockback. Also, (note that I was playing with a Gamepad), using different abilities is sometimes very clucky, since you have to press a direction to activate an ability, and then quickly press the direction in which you'll you use it. This leads to the player using the wrong abilities all the time, or just wrong directions. \nSo, overall, I wasn't too pleased with the combat, leading to a frustrating experience that could have easily been polished.\n\nTournament Mode.\nThis is essentially a classic SSBB mode, in which you fight other Megacs, or Bosses, individually. It's pretty cool, but it gets old a bit too quickly on your own.\nWhich leads to another big problem. Local Multiplayer Coop only. Sorry, I had to mention it. Since there's no online play, a big part of this game is simply left to dust in a pc game. It's a shame, it could've been a much better game for it.\n\n\nFinally, my biggest problem with the game. This got on my nerves way too much. \nThe checkpoint system. I don't understand why the developers thought this was good at all. Well... it's awful, sorry.\nEverytime you lose your lives, you get back to the Hub Area. But, that area is pretty big, which makes the player walk for a few minutes before getting back to a level. On top of that, if you were on stage 3 when you died, you'll have to go through the first and second stages again. What the fuck?! Why would there be several stages if there are no checkpoint systems? This leads to too much time lost everytime you die and, again, frustration. The only real Checkpoint is before a Boss. Well, at least there was that. But it's definitely NOT enough. \n\"Oh, you were just bad at the game\". Yeah... Look at Super Meat Boy. A game has to make \"dying fun\", in a sense. It's alright if one dies, as long a he can get into the game right away and try again. Without having to deal with walking to the level over and over again, and then redo a lot of previously beaten sections. You'll be bored to death before getting to the challenging part. Aaaand that leads to the final Boss.\nThat was really, really awful. First, it starts with a normal Megac fight. Fair enough. It was challenging, but nothing to hard. Once you're done with it (which takes a while), you get 2 lives and advance to a second Boss Fight. I'll not that there is NO CHECKPOINT after this, which means that you ALWAYS have to beat the first stage before moving. \nBut, the second part of the Boss has 4 stages. And the first 2 are essentially the same as the last 2. Which is really dreadful design. This leads to a very long fight, which gets far longer whenever you die, having you go through it over and over again. With the clunky combat system and the awful checkpoint system, this leads to a very bad experience, in my opinion. It's a shame, but this last impression pushed this game down a lot in my consideration.\n\nConclusion.\nIt's unfortunate, the starts starts off stellarly, but then reveals its flaws further into it. It's an overall great game, but its design flaws hurt it a lot, with long levels without checkpoints (which makes you be stuck in the game for longer than you should), and a huge wait time between deaths.\nPlus, no Online Multiplayer.\nStill, it's great going through the levels, it looks and sounds great, and it invokes a great feel from 90s games and TV shows.\nExperimentation with the different parts and combat styles is also pretty good!\nCheers.", "timestamp_created": 1390835945, "timestamp_updated": 1390835989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464895635843276978", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8807081": {"recommendationid": "8807081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044599802", "num_games_owned": 703, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 755, "last_played": 1450568637}, "language": "english", "review": "BEYOND AWESOME its like super smash bros 10.1", "timestamp_created": 1390395726, "timestamp_updated": 1390395726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8806941": {"recommendationid": "8806941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043590808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 826, "last_played": 1421592004}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like the feeling of a Super Smash Bros game, or if you have people to play with to a funky game, this is an very good choice ^^ \n\nYou can destroy levels, or not, it can be part of strategy, you can put some parts on your robot, you can channel combo that, even in SSB, you couldn't imagine.\n\nA must have !", "timestamp_created": 1390394740, "timestamp_updated": 1390394740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8803068": {"recommendationid": "8803068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017086725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 989, "last_played": 1390387766}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute recommend.

I literally heard nothing about this game untill I found the Steam page for it, watched the video, and bought the game on sale. Was it worth my money? For the most part, I found the game pretty fun. There are three different game modes to play: story mode, tournament, and versus mode. The story takes place in a computer world where the heartcore, the giver of life in your village and world, is stolen by a corrupted empire. You play as a robot fighter, fighting off the empire and saving your village from destruction. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the Super Smash Brothers series, as you have basic attacks as well as powerful attacks meant to knock back enemies, but there's a twist. Enemies in the game are made up of different robot parts that can be dropped upon defeating them. See an enemy with a cannon arm? Beat him up, and if it drops, its yours to equip. Parts range from movement buffs, to extra defense, to special attacks, and it's interesting to come up with different combinations to make your character the way you want. You can even find hidden color capsules to personalize your robot even more! Boss fights are similar to a regular match in SSB, where you rack up damage on your opponent to knock them off the stage. Defeating bosses will give you new parts you only catch a glimpse of from common enemies, which makes it all the more satisfying to use the part back on them. The gameplay, while fun, can get repetetive after a while. most of the enemies are no threat at all, being easily knocked into a bundle and shot off by your power attack or rockets, and some of the platforming can be a bit frustrating at times. The visuals are simplistic, bearing resemblence to polygons and geometric figures, but it's very colorful and charming. Combining this with the great soundtrack creates some interesting themes in the stages and areas of the game. Really, my only main complaint with the game is the multiplayer. Have you always wanted to have SSB-like battles with your friends over the internet on your PC? Well, you'll be severely dissapointed, because this game only has local multiplayer. That means your friends have to come to your house and play the game there. Also, unless you've played the main game for a decent amount of time, you won't have any parts to customize your robot with for multiplayer. Overall, If you like customizable robots and SSB adventure mode, you'll like this game. If you want a good multiplayer game for steam and don't like playing fighting games by yourself, I would skip this game.", "timestamp_created": 1390273099, "timestamp_updated": 1390273099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8776603": {"recommendationid": "8776603", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996310822", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1499051039}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine Super Smash Bros.

This game attempts to somewhat ape Super Smash Bros by having an action platforming game where your robot character can pick up parts to customize it's abilities and move sets. It's a neat idea, but for some reason, the game just feels a bit uninspired. I mean, it has some personality thanks to its art style which is midly charming, but sound assets and music lack any oomph or interest to be memorable. The controls of Super Smash Bros was perfect, especially the shield, throw, and dodge mechanic. Here, you have a shield, but any dodging is reliant on running away or skills that help you move fast. I can't tell if there is enough balance in this game. I played the Fight mode, and the first enemy nearly beat me because it kept landing attacks. The second enemy was slow, and I landed tons of attacks on him, but he placed bomb that hit me and all of a sudden I had a ton of damage compared to him, despite that I've hit him numerious times compared to the less than 10 times he hit me.\n\nI'm sure some players with a lower quality threshold won't mind this game. It isn't terrible or completely incompetent, but it is certainly not enough to entertain me and doesn't come close to the perfection of the series it tries to imitate.

It\u2019s a simple pick up and play video game that will appeal to children and adults alike. The game\u2019s mechanics are also comforting with a Megaman look and Super Smash Bros style of fighting. If there\u2019s one thing Reptile did really well with Megabyte Punch it\u2019s its combat system that keeps the player engaged even with the amount of repetitive enemies encountered in stages. There are however particular enemies that do provide a good level of challenge. Play is also best when using a gamepad as using the keyboard can become difficult. \n\nThe graphic style used by Reptile also works well with the gameplay. The environment compliments the action figure like robots that battle it out and can cause damage to their surroundings. Everything that is presented is clean and aesthetically pleasing with a good choice of color palettes used. Throw in some 8-bit style music and Reptile Games has truly created an indie gem that will appeal to players. \n\nMegabyte Punch is a game that will definitely challenge players. With six levels consisting of three stages and a boss each, on top of further time spent customizing your Megac, Megabyte Punch will give you some bang for your buck. But it doesn\u2019t end there. The developers also expanded gaming options with the Tournament mode that will give the player even more challenges and customizable parts outside of the story mode. \n\nFinal Message\n\nMegabyte punch is an entertaining video game with a simple beat em up style of play. While the game runs well early on, it can become repetitive as your progress through the game. Nonetheless, Reptile Games has delivered a title in 2013 that stands with some of the best indie games of the year. \n\nVideo Review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yasK_Uf3QE&list=TL8Fme--YE_RvVGyUp1JCVfHWjguD2uk4W\n", "timestamp_created": 1389056071, "timestamp_updated": 1389056071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489726036787033081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8597001": {"recommendationid": "8597001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069665603", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1382, "last_played": 1480298952}, "language": "english", "review": "It may look like a crappy game, for dad's and mother's/gamers out there, but hell this is pretty good.

The same move can generally be found on a few different parts in different styles and/or equippable to different body zones, which is nice if you want to put together a slightly different skill set or just keep your favorite move without looking like an idiot, which is thoughtful. Gameplay can occasionally be frustrating in much the same way singleplayer SSB can, but the AI isn't usually as insufferable. The colorful lowpoly graphics are fun.
