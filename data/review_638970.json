"language": "english", "review": "damn near 10/10\n\npros:\n-good pacing, amazing characters, very rewarding storylines, good cliffhangers at the end of each chapter, amazing character arcs, great backstories and setup for future games, and great substories.\n-ending of the game was literally perfect\n-combat is actually pretty good and really easy to understand, even if it does get a bit braindead and repetitive at times. \n-fighting styles are (mostly) amazing. brawler and thug are both pretty great all-around styles, rush is fun, beast and slugger are always a blast, and breaker is uh... breaker: fun style but rarely used it. legend styles were alright, i liked that they kept some of the passives from the other styles but they felt very one note compared to the already fully fleshed out styles the game had.\n-minigames are good for the most part: the vincent games are pretty great, the sega arcade games are okay, the gambling games at west park range from utterly confusing (all the hanafuda games) to great (all the dice games), the batting center is good, bowling is good, karaoke is great, and fishing is kinda just there but it's not bad. \n-pocket circuit is amazing.\n-real estate royale was a great business. very simple and didn't need very much interaction like cabaret club czar did. kinda got boring after a little while, though. storyline was pretty decent.\n-cabaret club czar was a great business as well, being even more interactive than real estate. liked the customization a lot and the fact that you get to make the roster to your liking. storyline was also decent.\n-so amon was a good fight.\n\ncons:\n-maharaja. i hate disco with a passion. it had not one hard substory line, not two hard substory lines, but THREE SEPERATE HARD SUBSTORY LINES.\n-catfights. rng bullshit, and not even a great way to make money since mr shakedown exists. visited probably once or twice and then never again\n-mahjong. didn't even bother with it. same with shogi.\n-telephone club. not an awful minigame by any stretch of the imagination, but the substories ruined it by making you pay attention to every little detail to figure out which girl you were matching with. some of the voices literally sounded identical and you would get a dupe of a date. good minigame, bad rng.\n-didn't even know the casino existed until i looked it up. could be good but putting it as a con since i never knew it was there.\n-real estate royale got very stale and almost felt like it didn't exist due to making so much money off of shakedown. nothing really kept me coming back after i beat the storyline.\n-cabaret club czar felt like an absolute drag when the storyline was complete, and it was especially agonizing trying to get through every training and date with the platinum hostesses. it got to the point where i just ran an all bronze cast and went afk to let the time pass to let me do another date. i also didn't win any date that wasn't disco or karaoke :(.\n-no mention of yumi like whatsoever.\n-jo amon was a bad fight.\n\noverall:\n9.7/10\namazing game, highly recommend", "timestamp_created": 1700766859, "timestamp_updated": 1700766859,

"[b]Standard price, AUD:[/b] $24.95\n\n[b]Price paid, AUD:[/b] $7.86\n\n[b]Time to finish:[/b] 113 hours. Completed the story, plus 99% of side stories but not the completionist stuff like minigames and collectibles.\n\n[b]Difficulty setting:[/b] Normal.\n\n[b]Graphics settings:[/b] Ultra at 3440x1440\n\n[b][u]PC specs[/u][/b]\n\nMotherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX Z490-E\nCPU: Intel i7 10700K @ 3.8GHz\nGPU: NVIDIA RTX 3080 10GB\nRAM: 32GB DDR4 1600MHz\nDrive: Silicone Power 500GB M.2 PCIe SSD\nOS: Windows 11\n\n[b]Performance:[/b] FPS was largely in the 60-120 FPS range with slight deviations both above and below. I never noticed any hitches or other performance related issues during gameplay.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] Graphics were acceptable. Did the job, but nothing more. The only thing that was bad was some of the supporting characters\u2019 hair that looked like glossy black play-doh.\n\n[b]Story:[/b] Without giving anything away, there\u2019s not actually much I can say, but I will say this. The people who came up with the story for this are some of the best. I didn\u2019t expect to cry multiple times during the story, but that is indeed the weight and power that this story holds. Even outside of the main quests, the side stories had some great moments, too.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] I\u2019d consider the beat \u2018em up combat the main gameplay element to this game, and it does it well. Both characters have several different fighting styles. One normal, one for speed and one for power. You can also unlock a legendary fighting style through the side stories and I think there\u2019s even another style unlocked from CP, though I didn\u2019t grind CP enough to get it. All these styles are upgraded with money, and you gain access to locked upgrades by doing the main story and some side stories. Depending on the enemy\u2019s fighting style, you choose your own accordingly. This requires you to think quickly when you\u2019re surrounded by enemies of different fighting styles. All the moves feel great to use and there are plenty of flashy, cool and ridiculous moves. The heat gauge allows you to perform additional powerful moves and you can even use an array of melee and ranged weapons. All the boss fights were great. They use a combination of styles and make for a tougher battle. \n\nThe side quests ranged from relatively normal to straight up crazy, and even ones that seemed very simple at first, quickly turned to the unexpected. I\u2019ve heard it said that the side stories in these Yakuza games are part of what makes this game great, and I\u2019m inclined to agree. \n\nThe minigames were my least favourite side content in the game. I didn\u2019t go out of my way to try these, and sometimes the game made you do them because they were tied to a quest. I had absolutely no desire to learn how to play Mahjong, for example. This stopped me from going down the completionist route. It\u2019s not that the minigames were bad. I just didn\u2019t enjoy it.\n\nEach character had their own business to run, and that generated income and gave additional side stories. This was probably the most unexpectedly enjoyable part of this game for me. I sunk at least 30 hours into the business side of things alone.\n\nThe only thing I really didn\u2019t like was the two secret boss fights that you get access to after doing all of the side stories for each character. These two fights were leagues more difficult than any other fight in the game, but most annoyingly, they were cheap, cheesy fights that were designed to infuriate. And for me, that\u2019s exactly what they did. They can take you down from full health to 0 in a very short combo. They are relentless in their assault, they can dodge mid-attack as well as when they are getting attacked themselves, and they are incredibly hard to stagger or knock down. After dying about 30 times, I\u2019d finally learned their unforgiving moves\u2026and then they change fighting styles and get a power up. At this point, I went online and started looking for strategies to beat them, only to find that the way people fought these two was with very specific equipment and done in a very specific way. Without giving the method away, you can one-shot one of them after you perform a specific move. Completely cheesed. After seeing this, I decided to give up. I don\u2019t like cheesing fights, and I don\u2019t like bashing my head against a brick wall for 5 hours. So, I moved on.\n\n[b]Bugs:[/b] None.\n\n[b]Final thoughts:[/b] This game is not my usual cup of tea, but after seeing snippets of the story here and there from streamers I follow, I really wanted to experience the story. This game is filled with crazy, whacky, weird, wholesome and heartbreaking moments, tied together with an incredible story and laced with a very enjoyable combat system. I am very excited to play the rest of the games in the Yakuza series!\n\n[b]Do I recommend this game?[/b] Yes! Even if you don\u2019t get this on sale, it\u2019s absolutely worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1700606081, "timestamp_updated": 1700606081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

The side cast was pretty good. some of the characters were fucking masterminds and there was great villians. I was never bored playing the game. The side mission was pretty good and funny at times. The game has a great and amazing story and is kinda shocking sometimes. I expected that there would be more of the funny jokes, but there were not as many as i hoped, but it might be in the sidequests or somethin, i only played some of them so i don't really know.

Starts at a slow pace, that gradually ramps/builds up, and feels like the crescendo is snowballing towards a huge peak. \n\nDefinitely recommend, especially for those who have only played Like a Dragon and are fiending for the same world and character building, as well as an awesome story and fun gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1700251553, "timestamp_updated": 1700251553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150287972": {"recommendationid": "150287972", "author": {"steamid": "76561199499551774", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 12073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12073, "playtime_at_review": 4216, "last_played": 1700786017}, "language": "english", "review": "Majima is in it", "timestamp_created": 1700238717, "timestamp_updated": 1700238717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622363924980163574", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150279119": {"recommendationid": "150279119", "author": {"steamid": "76561199400834710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1486, "playtime_at_review": 2090, "last_played": 1700707973}, "language": "english", "review": "i like it very much", "timestamp_created": 1700229078, "timestamp_updated": 1700229078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150271153": {"recommendationid": "150271153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165456442", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3936, "last_played": 1639002034}, "language": "english", "review": "Play it; you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1700217695, "timestamp_updated": 1700217695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523835957050323486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150264977": {"recommendationid": "150264977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162842105", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "playtime_at_review": 4082, "last_played": 1700315911}, "language": "english", "review": "Yikes!

This prequel to the popular Yakuza franchise is arguably one of the best games in the series. Nearly perfect in execution, Yakuza 0 provides a richly detailed recreation of Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, with era-appropriate music and fashion. Once you start playing, you'll find yourself fully immersed in the neon-lit streets of Japan, fighting your way through the criminal underworld for hours on end. \n\n[h2]Gameplay [/h2]\nYakuza 0 provides an open-world action-adventure experience with role-playing elements. As players explore Tokyo and Osaka, you encounter missions and side quests at every turn. The combat is fast-paced and brutal, involving punching, kicking, throwing, and weaponry. Defeating enemies and completing missions earn money and experience to upgrade abilities.\n\n[h3] The Combat System Is Simple Yet Deep[/h3]\nThe combat system in Yakuza 0 is deceptively simple yet provides depth for those who want to master it. On the surface, the controls are straightforward: light attack, heavy attack, grab, and dodge. However, there are many layers beneath this simplistic scheme.\n\nBy combining light and heavy attacks, as well as grabs and dodges, you can chain together devastating combos to take down groups of enemies. The four fighting stances\u2014balanced, speed, power, and grab\u2014provide different movesets for various situations. Switching between these stances opens up more possibilities in combat.\n\nHeat actions, the brutal special moves activated when your heat gauge is full, introduce a strategic element. Do you unleash a powerful heat action to defeat one enemy instantly or save your heat to heal yourself in a pinch? The enemies you face also have different fighting styles, so you must adapt your approach to overcome their defences.\n\nThe depth in Yakuza 0's combat truly shines through in the boss battles. These lengthy, multi-stage fights against dangerous opponents feel like final exams, testing everything you've learned. Defeating a boss provides an immense sense of accomplishment due to the mental dexterity required.\n\n[h3] Some Dated Gameplay Elements [/h3]\nWhile Yakuza 0 excels in many areas, some of its gameplay elements feel dated. The combat system, while still fun, is basic and repetitive. Battles boil down to mashing a few buttons to throw punches and kicks at groups of enemies. There is little strategy or nuance required. The lack of variety can make long fights feel tedious.\n\nThe mission structure is similarly repetitive. Most missions involve little more than going to a location, watching a cutscene, and then brawling with a group of thugs. Rinse and repeat. There are a few standout missions that break from the formula, but the majority follow a predictable pattern. Adding more puzzle-solving, stealth, investigative work, or other types of objectives would help mix up the mission types and pacing.\n\nThat said, the story, characters, world-building, and humour are so superb that the repetitive gameplay is easy to overlook. \n\n[h3] Difficulty Spikes Can Be Frustrating [/h3]\nWhen you first start playing, the basic combat mechanics seem simple enough to grasp. You have a light attack, heavy attack, grab, and dodge at your disposal. However, as you progress through the game, increasingly more complex enemy types are introduced that require intricate strategies and combination attacks to defeat. Some boss fights ramp up the difficulty so sharply that you may find yourself stuck, unable to progress further, no matter how many attempts you make.\n\nRather than gradually increasing the difficulty through the natural progression of the game, Yakuza 0 throws players into the deep end at times. To advance past these roadblocks, you have no choice but to spend time grinding - repeating easier missions to gain experience points, money, and resources to upgrade your character. The grinding required can feel tedious and dull in comparison to the otherwise fast-paced action of the game.\n\nWhile a challenging experience is appreciated, the difficulty spikes in Yakuza 0 are severe enough that they cross the line from engaging to annoying. The steep learning curve for mastering combat and overcoming certain bosses means that less skilled or patient players may become frustrated and give up on the game altogether. Smoothing out the difficulty progression and providing more guidance for developing combat skills would make the gameplay in Yakuza 0 nearly flawless.\n\n[h2] The Story and Characters Are Engaging [/h2]\nThe story of Yakuza 0 is set in 1988 Japan, during an economic boom. You play as Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima, two yakuza members who find themselves in the middle of a conspiracy within the criminal underworld.\n\nThe narrative is split between Kiryu in Tokyo and Majima in Osaka, creating two engaging tales that eventually intertwine. Kiryu is a level-headed enforcer trying to clear his name after being framed for murder, while Majima is an eccentric club owner aiming to rejoin the yakuza. Both protagonists are likable and complex, with interesting backstories and motivations.\n\nSupporting characters are similarly multifaceted. The villains have understandable reasons behind their actions instead of being generically evil. Allies become friends that you form genuine connections with over the course of the story. Memorable subplots and side quests also help to flesh out minor characters and build investment in the world.\n\nWith its blend of humour, drama and hard-boiled crime fiction, Yakuza 0's story is a thrill ride from start to finish. The game does an excellent job of pulling you in with its charismatic characters and high-stakes narrative. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series or completely new, this prequel entry is not to be missed.\n\n[h2]Vibrant Neon-Lit Cities [/h2]\nThe game is set in Kamurocho, Tokyo and Sotenbori, Osaka, both of which are modelled after the Kabukicho and Dotombori entertainment districts. These areas come to life with crowded streets, neon signs, pachinko parlours, and nightclubs - all hallmarks of 1980s Japan. Exploring these dense urban environments transports the player back in time and provides context for the underlying themes of economic prosperity and indulgence in the era.\n\nWalking down the cluttered alleyways and streets, you encounter many distractions, from ramen carts to disco clubs to pay phones ringing. The lively city hubs are filled with details that make the world feel lived-in and bustling. All of these elements combine to deliver an authentic depiction of the exuberant economic boom in 1980s Japan.\n\nThe game's soundtrack also deserves mention, with catchy synth-pop and electronic beats that were popular during this time period, adding another layer of '80s ambience. The music creates a sense of cultural nostalgia for those who grew up or lived in Japan during this era.\n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\nOverall, Yakuza 0 richly deserves the critical acclaim and fan devotion it has garnered. For those seeking a memorable story and virtual tourism in 1980s Japan, Yakuza 0 is a must-play game that hits nearly all the right notes. While a few minor missteps keep it from absolute perfection, Yakuza 0 is a title that will stick with players long after the credits roll. It is a game that succeeds in tugging at heartstrings while still making you laugh and in crafting a world so lush you can nearly smell the ramen and cigarettes.

It didn't, and here are my reasons:\n\n-Combat system:\nThe game has 3 combat styles for each character, with plenty of over the top moves to unlock that make the fights very satisfying. When you're fighting multiple weaker opponents there's some strategy and a lot of button mashing but overall the fights are fun and let you be creative.\nIt's when you're fighting high level enemies that things go terribly wrong and the combat system becomes boring, random and very frustrating. Strong enemies will of course counterattack much more than regular enemies, but there seems to be no logic or rule on this. Sometimes you can get long combos on them and sometimes they will dodge and counterattack after 2 punches. This becomes a problem especially when they powerup at the second stage of the fight. When you dodge a powerful attack and end up behind them you expect to have some sort of reward right? They should be open to at least a short combo, right? But no, even if you go for a simple light>light>heavy (or even just light>heavy) they sometimes do a 180 and hit you in the face with a move too fast to react. If you manage to hit them with strong attacks sometimes you get punished because they'll recover before you do. Grabs also stop working after a few succesful throws, and that's fine, except sometimes they still do but I found no logic behind that, just another thing that seems completely based on rng.\nWhat happens is that the best strategy for fighting these bosses is running around like a chicken without locking, waiting for an opening to land like 2 hits and then keep running. For me it was mostly a problem with Majima, because Kiryu has a fast style that lets you dodge mid-combo, so I did a lot of his hard fights by spamming attacks and dodging randomly and it worked pretty well.\nI thought I didn't understand the fightsystem, but when I looked up youtube videos, everyone was playing exactly like me.\nYou can stock up on healing items that you can use from the pause menu and brute force through every tough encounter in the game, but that's pretty lame.\n\n-Minigames:\nThe game is known for being filled with content, sidequests, minigames and collectibles to an insane level. Personally I find it a bit too much, the game just wants to tickle that part of your brain that wants to 100% a game even if it's not fun anymore, so you'll go around and try to eat every food, collect every card, and complete every minigame.\nBut back to the minigames: there's so many of them and some have some sort of complexity and even come with side-stories that require a lot of time and effort to be completed...I personally wouldn't play most of them even if they paied me, but since they're optional that's no problem. My problem was mainly with business activities: to level up your characters you need money and at some point the money you make from missions is not enough anymore, so the best way to make money is through business activities, which are yet another minigame.\nBusiness activities are just time-wasting, dopamine-releasing minigames. You just have to play a lot, see numbers grow up, click things to spend money to make more money, watch money go up and feel like a drug addict, you're no better than you grandmother playing facebook games when playing these. I have to say that al least the cabaret club has some gameplay and strategy to it, but it requires soo much time of repetitive gameplay to complete a working day, upgrading your hostesses and running around town to find business partners.\nThe real estate business is even worse. It just requires you to go around town, buy some property, go back to the office to start money collection, wait around, go back to the office to get the money, invest in every property and start collection again, then go around town again to buy new properties with exponentially increasing prices, rinse and repeat.\nUnfortunately you have to spend some time \"playing\" these minigames to unlock your abilites and to beat the final mission without filling your inventory with healing items.\n\nTL;DR: Combat system is random and tedious when facing strong opponents. Minigames will fuck your dopamine reward system up\n\nSo that's all, as I said I overall enjoyed the game but I don't think I'll play any more yakuza games unless there are some big changes in the

This title is the definitive gateway for those of you hopped on Baka Mitai memes and constantly distracted by intrusive thoughts of Goro Majima. At times you may find yourself itching to buy a plane ticket to Japan, or questioning why Kiryu Kazama isn\u2019t in Tekken yet (he doesn\u2019t hit women), but for those who want instant gratification and would like to avoid spending thousands of dollars travelling, this is your answer. \n\nWhat might surprise you is Yakuza 0 is even funnier than its memes. The game\u2019s humor and writing shines through its side-quests, which showcases outlandish scenarios and memorable goofball characters. To balance this, the main story features a deep criminal conspiracy involving two differing points-of-view. While the pacing is glacial at times and requires a lot of patience, the payoff is exhilarating. Accompanying this is action gameplay that is easy to learn and has surprising depth. \n\nUnfortunately, Yakuza 0 sets the bar on storytelling and gameplay so high that some of the later titles pale in comparison. Combat can be sometimes frustrating due to an uncooperative camera, and certain heat attack timings are unnecessarily strict. Zero also struggles from a rare case of having too much content, and it\u2019s clear that the quality of its minigames is imbalanced.

It is what introduced so many people to the franchise. It is where a large portion of the memes came from. Many consider it to be the best in the franchise - and perhaps for well deserved reasons.\n\n[h1]Shortly[/h1]\nYakuza 0 is a dark game set in the bubble of 1980's Japan, where a small bit of land from the Imperial Palace was worth more than the entirety of the US region of California. Money is a central concept in the game, gained from beating up mobs from generic thugs to properly fleshed out story bosses, often coming out hundreds of thousands of yen richer from each battle. The bubble shows and rears its head often. Upgrades hit the tens of millions and hundreds of millions-zone early on, and you become even more of a money machine than before.\n\nIn the midst of this neon paradise however, you will come closer acquainted to the criminal underworld of Tokyo's very own Kamurocho, and perhaps even the concrete - all the while wrapped up in a murder mystery that's clearly bigger and more intricate than it would have you believe, which will take Kiryu through highs and lows that test his personality and mold him into his own person.\n\n[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n-Neon streets.\n-Kamurocho.\n-Absolutely well made world that [i]feels[/i] like a bustling city in the 80s, where people no longer know how to spend their cash.\n-A significantly more noir-like story compared to the other games that came before, in stark contrast to what comes after Y0.\n-Variety in heat actions.\n-Satisfying combat.\n-Cool characters.\n-A story you don't want to miss.\n-Side content abundance.\n-There are so. Many. Different. Heat Actions.\n-The game is very humorous.\n-Character development.\n-Two playable characters.\n\n\n-The music.\nThe damn music.\n-Dynamic intros - the painting-like way characters pose before a battle, are so unadulteratedly good, and cool.\n-Kiryu. Is. So. Damn. Cool.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n-For someone whose first introduction to Yakuza is this game, the console-only nature of the franchise will be jarring at first. Keyboard may not be as optimal as controller, but it is still effective and not hard once you get a grasp for the game and it's mechanics.\n-For anyone in the West, it will also undoubtedly be very strange witnessing Japanese game design and writing in action.\n>The game, like other games in the series, suffers from tropes and clich\u00e9s that you will absolutely be able to see coming for yourself, reducing the impact of the gameplay and story.\n-Strange game design decisions every now and then. You will also know who is an NPC and who is a main/side character based off on looks alone. It gets old rather fast, and the characters sometimes look strange or similar with little variety - of which most is reserved primarily for the main cast.\n-Without cheesing, it becomes a bit of a chore acquiring more money to level yourself up with.\n-Some side content (which is also shoehorned in the main story missions) is... NSFW, to say the least - such as betting on women wearing almost nothing wrestling with eachother.\n-The game's 2 playable characters *may* make it a bit disjointed following the main story, and it inevitably results in less content for each character. However, it's rather well done in Yakuza 0, especially compared to further entries, so it is far less noticeable.\n-It's subtitled in English, but everything else is in Japanese. Voice acting can be dealt with, but sometimes it gets tiring only seeing Japanese letters that you can't get a read on.\n-The game's hardest difficulty - Legend - makes the game's design flaws and combat flaws become all the more apparent. Not being able to save whereever you want, having NO checkpoints, being forced to restart from the last save if you die, (or don't even die - but just simply fail a substory..) it's ridiculous. I believe not many have qualms about using cheats to finish the job when the game also actively works against you while you can also not counter that.\nWho. Asked. For. Escort. Missions.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game begins with exposition revealing who you are and general details of the main character and his story, while introducing you to the mechanics of the game. Eventually, you get to grips with the combat system - heat actions, grabs, throws, combos, and fighting styles. \nYou, quite literally, canonically eat money to become stronger. The world is full of random encounters, and each hit gives you more money.\n\nAs there is little to no multiplayer, being a mainly singleplayer game, there are no updates.\n\n[h1]Community[/h1]\nYakuza 0's - Yakuza's community may have a reputation for being [i]everywhere[/i] much like you could say JoJo fans are everywhere. The same JoJo logic also applies to Yakuza fans, spamming out memeable clips and basing personalities, names and entire online presences around Yakuza characters while constantly spitting out Yakuza references.\nIt is merely a vocal minority, but it is an imprint people will still have, regardless.\n\nBut for a franchise with someone in it who is so cool that he has a tattoo of a fucking [b]dragon[/b] on his back, is called the Dragon [DoD] much like Katana Zero (sooo coool!!) and is incredibly strong in combat and is also a tough bad boy [i]with[/i] emotions, I cannot blame them for it.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics are very good. Naturally, cutscenes are 2 times more fleshed out than anything in gameplay would be, but normal gameplay looks very good even if it screams \"this is a console game\" - worldbuilding is awesome, but what's disappointing is the normal dialogue you have with NPCs. Character models are an upgrade over Sims 3's pudding-faces, but they aren't exactly what you'd expect from a 2018 PC game.\n\nCutscenes, though? Pleasing to look at. Well made. So good. \nAnd some of them even have potential as desktop wallpapers - at times, even profile pictures.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nYakuza 0's soundtrack is certainly an experience. At first, it won't seem too notable. Singing forced karaoke and finding out this is where the funny meme song came from, you likely won't think much of it still.\nAs the fights go on and you progress in the story, you start realizing that the soundtrack isn't generic or mediocre. It's damn well above it.\nYour archrival will have a very aggressive rock-like, guitar-heavy track that you will be very familiar with by the end of the game. But by the end of the game, you notice something. It's no longer aggressive. It's not antagonistic anymore. It's even hopeful, in a sense.\nSongs are aptly named and fit their characters. Your buddy has a well-fitting 1980s-like upbeat, energetic, hopeful power beat. A foreign assassin has a menacing, hostile theme. Some bosses have a more generic boss track, but even it works for them as a strange, electronic guitar beat.\nAnd the final boss's track... is better experienced by playing the game through till its' end.\n\nTo go on about listing the minute differences that make each song great would be a feat to make even Sisyphus happy, though. It's best to simply play the game and listen to the OSTs by oneself.\n\n[h1]Conclusion, Final Words[/h1]\nYakuza 0 is a banger of a game in more than one way. Not much of it leaves the player unsatisfied or frustrated.\nIt is an experience through and through, best enjoyed without spoilers, listening to the music anywhere else other than ingame, or even checking out Yakuza-related media beforehand.\nYakuza 0's poses, fighting moves, and characters are cool, all in a primal way. They just [i]are[/i] even if tattooed shirtless men fighting other tattooed shirtless men doesn't sound as cool on paper.\n\nNot being able to understand a word of Japanese is no barrier to playing this game. Even without further intention of buying more Yakuza games or the collection, it's good to play through Y0 at least once. At 20\u20ac, it's not even a big hit on your wallet buying it. Or 5\u20ac, for who waits for a sale.\n\n[b]9/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1698434119, "timestamp_updated": 1700334418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148987841": {"recommendationid": "148987841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173203769", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1380, "playtime_at_review": 476, "last_played": 1700748146}, "language": "english", "review": "BAKA MITAI", "timestamp_created": 1698423225, "timestamp_updated": 1698423225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148970839": {"recommendationid": "148970839", "author": {"steamid": "76561199062508380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9628, "last_played": 1698473689}, "language": "english", "review": "W game", "timestamp_created": 1698406790, "timestamp_updated": 1698406790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148967900": {"recommendationid": "148967900", "author": {"steamid": "76561199210611533", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 234, "playtime_at_review": 1617, "last_played": 1700679328}, "language": "english", "review": "Too good", "timestamp_created": 1698403489, "timestamp_updated": 1698403489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148961778": {"recommendationid": "148961778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111732258", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3347, "last_played": 1584246516}, "language": "english", "review": "The amount of feelings that this games evokes is unreal. \n\nExplore the side stories as much as you like.\n\nBe careful, though, if you get too distracted, you'll lose track of what happened in the main story and it will feel like it's dragging on.", "timestamp_created": 1698393483, "timestamp_updated": 1698393483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148949241": {"recommendationid": "148949241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071558233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3152, "last_played": 1698386500}, "language": "spanish", "review": "THE BEST.", "timestamp_created": 1698370821, "timestamp_updated": 1698370821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148947733": {"recommendationid": "148947733", "author": {"steamid": "76561199508904210", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1865, "last_played": 1695759910}, "language": "english", "review": "muscular sweaty men", "timestamp_created": 1698368384, "timestamp_updated": 1698368384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148944635": {"recommendationid": "148944635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440760584", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 413, "last_played": 1699857075}, "language": "english", "review": "oh man i just got framed for something i didn't do!

I don't like playing this game, I'm not interested in it, I don't want to beat it. It's not bad, I'm not leaving a negative review and I'm not even not recommending it, I just don't get this game. I really just don't get it.\n\nI played Yakuza Like a Dragon before this, and before that I played Kiwami. I just don't understand why anyone would prefer this game to LAD. I really just don't get the appeal, this game has 4 combat styles and the only one I like using is the first one you unlock. The story is good I just don't care about getting money or upgrading my moves. I really just don't understand the appeal of the gameplay loop or the combat in this game or what about it is supposed to be fun. Like I said the only combat style I really like is the standard one, rush makes it so I can't do wacky over the top finishers with bicycles and milk crates, the grabber one makes it so I just grab shit and hit people with it and then throw it after it's broken, and I don't even remember what the 4th style was. I just don't get the appeal of this gameplay and I don't know why people say this is the best yakuza game, or the best gameplay in the series. Again the story is great but it's really the only thing keeping me going and when I don't like the core gameplay I'd rather just be watching Battles Without Honor or Humanity so I don't have to actually play the action scenes, or I could playing Like A Dragon where the action scenes are fun to me because the characters are ALWAYS doing cool over-the-top shit.\n\nPlease someone help me like this game because I really don't understand why anyone would want to play it over just watching all the cutscenes on youtube.

The character development is nothing short of exceptional; you'll find yourself emotionally invested in their struggles, triumphs, and growth.\n\nOne of the standout features of Yakuza 0 is its vibrant and meticulously recreated open world.

I beat this game already on PS4 when i had one a while back along with Kiwami, Kiwami 2, (skipped 3 but watched every cutscene to keep up with the story cuz i didn't enjoy the gameplay) beat 4, and I'm working on 5 and moving on to 6 afterwards. But 0 is an fun begging story to those both Familiar and Unfamiliar with the story of Yakuza. If you haven't played any of these games and do not know the story and are looking to get into it from beginning to end, Start with this one, it is worth the play. First off, learning the backstory of two of the most loved characters in Yakuza, Kiryu, and Majima, Each having unique styles of fighting, and two separate places to explore, Kiryu mainly taking place in Kamurocho, and Majima taking place in Sotenbori. And not to mention two huge minigames/side stories for both characters (which i am guilty of spending far to long on) however if you can get yourself through them both, you unlock their secret styles which they will be seen using in future games. There are a lot of cutscenes, and usually that takes me away from most games, but considering Yakuza is know for it's more serious story, and it's absolute bonkers side quest, i cannot help but be interested and have my eyes glued to the screen to keep my eyes on whats happening next. The gameplay and using these styles to fight enemies is pretty damn fun, the Heat Moves are extremely brutal, and it's fun finding out more you can do and what you can learn in the future. If Resident Evil didn't exist and make my childhood for gaming amazing, then this game series would be my favorite series out there today. It is so fun and actually a great time, 100% better than Grand Theft Auto ever could hope to be in my opinion. If you haven't played any Yakuza game in the series, or you have played almost all or all of them except this one, you owe it to yourself to play this one.", "timestamp_created": 1697477526,

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\n", "timestamp_created": 1697393242, "timestamp_updated": 1697393242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560439348220825195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148291302": {"recommendationid": "148291302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986149372", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 10171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10171, "last_played": 1697262840}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Yo... Kiryu-chan!\"\n\n- Goro Majima\n\n===================================================================\n\nMy first ever Yakuza game. First things first, for everyone who's going to try to 100% this game like me, I'd like to tell you that you have to prepare yourself for hours of frustration. But, it is still possible to do with patience and resilience, of course. The Game Mechanic is really good and the Graphic also looks awesome. The battle is okay but it's getting kinda annoying near the end of the game. What I really love from this game is that it feels like it's never running out of content to give. I never got bored getting from 1 place to another because you'll be faced with either enemies or Side Quests. There are many things to explore from Restaurants, Equipment, and even Mini Games.\n\nNow, talking about Mini Games, these are the things that will make you frustrated for getting 100% Achievements. The mechanics of the Mini Games are different from each other and kinda hard to master. Like there are billiard, roulette, batting center, even Arcade Games that each contain their own mechanics. Some of them are quite RnG heavy, so even if you already understand the rules or how to beat the Mini Game, chance is you probably still need to retry many more times before getting the Achievement. But, other than those things related to Achievement, and especially if you want to play just to enjoy, then this Game is so rich in Narrative and Battle. You can explore many Fighting Styles and combine them with various weapons. The Plot is intriguing to the point that I can't wait to see/learn more of it as the Chapters go. The Main Story itself can tear your heart apart, but the Side Stories are also really good.\n\n===================================================================\n\nI'm gonna give this game a \"Baka Mitai\" out of \"24-hour Cinderella\"", "timestamp_created": 1697389825, "timestamp_updated": 1697389825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148287717": {"recommendationid": "148287717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198937668740", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 50, "playtime_at_review": 3306, "last_played": 1699740924}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny Sugarcoating Game", "timestamp_created": 1697386067, "timestamp_updated": 1697386067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148285467": {"recommendationid": "148285467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354276646", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2491, "last_played": 1699396242}, "language": "english", "review": "BEST GAME EVER MADE, INSPIRING, MOTIVATIONAL, FUNNY, EDUCATIONAL, SEXY, JUST A MASTERPIECE 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1697383853, "timestamp_updated": 1697383853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148277881": {"recommendationid": "148277881", "author": {"steamid": "76561199063961945", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1479, "last_played": 1699192271}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good karaoke game that comes bundled in with a story,2 maps and minigames", "timestamp_created": 1697376453, "timestamp_updated": 1697376453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148269231": {"recommendationid": "148269231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968108434", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3096, "last_played": 1699014857}, "language": "english", "review": "The fucking real estate plot goes insane", "timestamp_created": 1697366533, "timestamp_updated": 1697366533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148265336": {"recommendationid": "148265336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835049519", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10589, "last_played": 1670843762}, "language": "english", "review": "Wish I could forget and play this game for the first time again, this game has a special place in my heart.

This one is personal because 1) it's my first time writing an actual review, 2) it's the first game I actually complete totally by myself. I'm not what you'd call a \"gamer\" and I usually enjoy inviting friends over to play together or ask 'em for hints, tips etc. But this one is mine alone. I will divide the review into sections:\n\n- Story - \nThe story is literally like a really well-made crime thriller, set in old Japan, during the days of Yakuza. Great character archetypes, action, drama, emotion, exceptionally interesting plot with well-written plot twists and amazing atmosphere (more details on that below)\n\n- Gameplay -\nSome might not find the combat system interesting, it revolves around stances that your 2 playable characters use, each with a unique set of moves/special actions. Basically what happens pre battle is that you stumble upon some hostile fellas and the fight begins, once you wipe 'em all out, the fight scene ends and you're back from where you left. Boss fights or special fights are the same, there's a scene being displayed, combat starts, finishes and scene goes on. The game is focused on martial arts and pure brawling so don't expect anything Mortal Kombat-like. The \"Abilities\" section in the menu allows you to spend money you collect on upgrading your battle stances. NOTE: You DON'T need to upgrade all the stances or all the skills of one stance to the maximum, you can finish the game by having incomplete stance skill trees but unlocking the 100% of a stance is legit broken but requires an amount of grind. Smooth movement across a Japanese background, historically accurate, well-depicted scenery and random spots around town that serve as restaurants, shops or places of interest in general. You're free to enter any shop, eat and restore HP, train into your battle stances, play old Sega arcade games and other minigames (e.g. bowling, darts and more) or buy items you can carry around in your inventory. Also includes an Item Box as an option.\n\n- Main story & substories - \nI'll start off by saying that Yakuza 0 is basically 40% gameplay and 60% watching. For some, this isn't a good thing, while others find the story captivating and don't mind at all (like me). Substories are of course an optional part, however there are so many funny, witty, well-written substories, that I'd encourage any player to complete as many as they can. By completing substories, you gain some sort of points that you can exchange at certain places in the city called \"shrines\" for buffs or perks. The best thing about the main story and the sidestories is that the game overall serves as a small history lesson. You get a peak of '80s Japan, when technology started thriving, the economy started booming and the transition between old and new took place. The way people speak, eat, respect, show honor, betray, party, it's all as realistic as it gets. There are references to history, economic subjects, pop culture, innovations of that period, Japanese pornstars (I'm not joking), the yakuza code and so much more. There's one type of collectible items, which is old telephone cards you can find at random places on the street. On these cards, there are pictures of Japanese women and their real names. With a quick Google search, you see that these women are indeed Japanese real-life actresses in adult films. \n\n- Minigames -\nHaven't tried them all myself but most of them are fun, especially the karaoke. Different gameplay for each one with secret achievements or substories following their successful completion. The main \"big\" minigames are that of Kamurocho Real Estate (1st protagonist) and the Cabaret Club (2nd protagonist). Completion for these requires too many hours (this is where I am currently), but it's optional of course. The more you play 'em though, gives you access to even more content, part of which is so witty and funny\n\n- Cons -\nSome might find it slow-burn. If the story doesn't attract you, you'll probably wanna just get done with it. The real estate and cabaret minigames might feel like a drag and combat might be considered flat since you don't have a huge variety of moves. Friends of mine have called it boring from time to time; it's not a game you can launch and hope to complete part of the story in 20 minutes time for example. Cutscenes might take enough of your time so you end up playing for 1.5 hours cause in between the cinematics you didn't have a phone booth to save your progress (yeah, your save points are phone booths scattered around the city). Thank god I don't go with none of them possible cons.\n\nAn amazing experience that will soon end. If you read the whole thing, thank you so much for reading my feelings about it.

(also the cutscenes are incredible, and it ran well on my GTX 460 with no lag) As the game shows, there is some  partial nudity, at most it suggestes sexual themes, and there is a catfighting ring that is mostly optional. blood and gore can be turned down in the settings if you feel the need too as well. great game overall! :D", "timestamp_created": 1696749225, "timestamp_updated": 1696749225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147848260": {"recommendationid": "147848260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326110422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 541, "last_played": 1696805395}, "language": "english", "review": "beat this game on ps4, played the whole game with majima as bocchi, this game sucks please buy it/10", "timestamp_created": 1696745775, "timestamp_updated": 1696745775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147843216": {"recommendationid": "147843216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074771731", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5648, "last_played": 1698355523}, "language": "english", "review": "Yakuza 0 is one of the best games i have ever played ever, this video game was made for one purpose, and one purpose only, FUN , it is clear the developers had a vision to make an intense, heartfelt tense story, and incredibly funny, entertaining and all around crazy fun side quests, and without a doubt they succeded. \n\nYakuza 0 is a masterpiece, if you are reading this wondering if it's worth the money and time, it absolutely is, I will remember this game fondly for a very long time, and so I absolutely recommend it to everyone of you. \n\nGood luck on your journey to become a real Yakuza.", "timestamp_created": 1696736616, "timestamp_updated": 1696736616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147842227": {"recommendationid": "147842227", "author": {"steamid": "76561199150910580", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "playtime_at_review": 2824, "last_played": 1699894599}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor juego con las mejores jugabilidades y modo historia,", "timestamp_created": 1696734916, "timestamp_updated": 1696734916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147839480": {"recommendationid": "147839480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969718761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1011, "last_played": 1696745558}, "language": "english", "review": "very sexc game", "timestamp_created": 1696730219, "timestamp_updated": 1696730219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147839068": {"recommendationid": "147839068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880975916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1697054066}, "language": "english", "review": "Wanted to take a break at the first boss after trying to beat it for an hour because I have no idea how the combat system works.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1696714413, "timestamp_updated": 1696714413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147819994": {"recommendationid": "147819994", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180428616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 165, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1699984574}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game", "timestamp_created": 1696703946, "timestamp_updated": 1696703946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147814879": {"recommendationid": "147814879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201825028", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5240, "last_played": 1696704299}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1696698543, "timestamp_updated": 1696698543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147809693": {"recommendationid": "147809693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967930537", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 9439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9439, "last_played": 1687362234}, "language": "english", "review": "en rahatlat\u0131c\u0131 adam d\u00f6vme oyunu", "timestamp_created": 1696693159, "timestamp_updated": 1696693159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147805133": {"recommendationid": "147805133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091132446", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_at_review": 1286, "last_played": 1699814505}, "language": "english", "review": "dame da ne guy never fails", "timestamp_created": 1696688865, "timestamp_updated": 1696688865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147802773": {"recommendationid": "147802773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080867198", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 4139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4139, "last_played": 1696000352}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo, volver\u00eda a pelearme contra DOJIMA FAMILY LIEUTENANT, TOJO CLAN DAISAKU KUZE otras 30 veces m\u00e1s.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1696686587, "timestamp_updated": 1696686587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147797125": {"recommendationid": "147797125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274052814", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4796, "last_played": 1613504489}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Yakuza Game I've ever played.

My expectations were not inflated by this, I tried it out with an open mind. After experiencing several aspects of this game, I have started regretting bying multiple Yakuza games.\n\nThere's a stark contrast between what this game could have been and what it is; Some story quests feature full voice acting and fitting sound and visual effects, while the majority of the missions and street encounters are heavily text-reliant and feature stiff characters who only grunt or utter the occasional \"Nani?!?\". The semi-open world is very limited, and often features only a few linear paths with little room for exploration. This world includes many components which attempt to bring the world to life, but it still suffers from limitations, repeated events such as street thugs on every other corner which gets old fast, and a confusing map system. My biggest gripe with the gameplay is that the game does not tell you what to do or where to go half of the time, which leads to confusion and the need to consult guides and walkthroughs online. Many aspects of the game feel like they were limited or cut due to budget reasons, and the player experience suffers as a result. The only highlights from my 10 hours of playing were the dance mini games and the combat which was somewhat decent and varied.\n\nI would recommend making your own critical assessment of this game before trying it out - It's very highly spoken of by some, but may not be for everyone. The disappointment of this first Yakuza game and the tedious gameplay has not left me wanting more of the series.", "timestamp_created": 1696406474, "timestamp_updated": 1696406699, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504761815071105957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147604402": {"recommendationid": "147604402", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992183095", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 983, "last_played": 1696344963}, "language": "english", "review": "Yakuza 0 is easily one of the best games I have ever played and it made me buy its sequels before finishing the game.

It has heart warming, incredible stories. It has some of the most entertaining music and funny events I have ever seen, and the Disco, is just great!\n\nThen why am I not recommending it? Well, although the music, the story and some mini-games are fun to play, there is a huge annoyance that remains constant throughout the game, and that is: The Combat\n\nWalking peacefully down the streets? Combat. Something happened in the story? Combat. Something happened in the sub story? Combat....  Combat, Combat, Combat and more Combat.\n\nBut normally combat is the fun part right?\nYes, it is supposed to be fun. Unfortunately, for me, it is not.\n\nLet me explain:\nAll abilities and combat skills are locked away from you in the beginning, but its not like its the extra stuff, its actually the basic stuff that is locked away.\nNormal Dodge? Locked. Normal Block? Locked. Make more than 2 attack combos? Locked. \nThen after unlocking the basic stuff you want to AIM to the enemies, well good luck with that!\nEnemies can rotate around you and make a very annoying combo then drop you to the ground, once you are hit, you cannot escape, you are stun locked and will receive the full combo, you will stand there like a sandbag and receive it all against your will. Once the enemy has finished the combo, your protagonist slowly falls to the ground and stays there until you mash a button for what seems like an eternity, after that, it will stand up only to repeat everything all over again if you don't dodge as the first action you take. And believe me, it is a pain in the royal ass to feel useless and smash a button that almost doesn't seem to do anything just so the character you are controlling finally stands up from its eternal slumber.\n\nThen the developers knew that there was a problem. Fighting 1v1 works. But add 1 more opponent to the formula and its a train wreck...for the player.\nSo what did they do? They used something called \"Heat Actions\" which automatically makes a combo for you? Why? because they noticed that their combat was very frustrating and having mini cut scenes of combat was going to fix everything, but guess what? Heat Actions are also Locked from you until you get enough in-game money to unlock them, so the solution has to be reached by the player. But to unlock them you either have more and more Combat, or do side mission with guess what, more Combat.\n\nThe ending of the game is also not satisfactory, plot armor is visible throughout the last chapters and the hand of the game designers can be seen conveniently making events happen out of the blue and trying to convince the audience that characters can behave not like themselves just to alter the outcome of an obvious event.\n\nI am new to the Yakuza franchise and can say that this is a great Japan simulator, i have traveled to Tokyo and Osaka and man this game shows the cities very nicely, I can feel I am there just by remembrance.\n\nBut if you don't care about gimmicky combat, hours and hours of grind, but absolutely love anything Japan related and can swallow the pain pill it causes, then this game may be for you.\n\nTl:dr\nI hate the Combat in this game.

Variety like different styles and different Heat Bursts (short cut scene special moves) helps\n- Wide variety of mini-games. Can't really name a \"bad\" mini-game and a few really stand out as quite good like Cabaret and Real Estate.\n- Side stories are varied and (in my opinion) hilarious, even if they're not PC!\n\nNeither here nor there:\n- For the age of the game, the graphics are decent enough though it does suffer a little here and there as a PC port.\n- Main story is fine and functional but is rather safe. So I guess it does it's job but not much more.\n- The music is actually quite good with some excellent hooks and a few stand-outs, but it often lacks variety and personality. \n\nCons:\n- Missed opportunities with 2 protagonists - too many shared qualities\n- In the main story, there's quite a few forgettable 2D people who are just archetypes really\n- Not a fan of the unvoiced sections. Even a handful of side character voices would go a long way rather than just hearing \"hai!\" or \"um!\" every now and then.\n\nOverall:\n\nA solid, safe game with a great premise (basically anime meets a mafia movie). However, I don't feel like it pushes enough new ground despite some interesting ideas like 2 protagonists. Everything from the story to the music reflects this. Still, can't argue too much with a fun game.", "timestamp_created": 1696286745, "timestamp_updated": 1696442148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147529602": {"recommendationid": "147529602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198436309207", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 329, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1700761958}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, playing only 3 hours of this, it's very engaging and the action feels amazing.

"language": "english", "review": "Chronologically, Yakuza 0 is the first game in the series. However, it was developed after Yakuza 5, which means it is one of the later Yakuza games in the franchise. Being a prequel, it rewards players who already have established knowledge of the plot lines in later games 'cause it gives a lot of new perspective on some key characters (Nishikiyama and Majima in particular), while also giving fresh newcomers a wonderful starting point in the series. And in this way Yakuza 0 is pretty clever, because veterans will want to replay the 1 and 2 remakes (Kiwami games) after finishing this story, and newcomers will most likely want to see how the story continues in the Yakuza saga.\n\nThe story is as ever the strongest point, with some flaws that have always been with Yakuza. That being the jarring dissonance between what occurs in the gameplay and what actually happens in the story. So much so that you might as well consider the gameplay non-canon, as watching Kiryu literally shank yakuza with a knife to their innards or shoot down guys in helicopters are some few examples of the narrative contradicting what it preaches later on. If you can suspend your disbelief for these moments, then the plot won't be ruined for you as the drama, characters, and suspense will all keep you going.\n\nThe gameplay is alright. I love my action games, and Yakuza 0 does enough to hold interest with its brutal, brawling gameplay. Though it is a little jank as well as bosses often have lots of superarmour, and won't really let you use HEAT actions (which are the most gratifying part of the combat). There's no shame in picking the Easy difficulty for this reason for the story is far more enticing than the combat. There are tons of mini-games and hilarious sidequests too that are a good distraction from the heavy plot if you just need a break from all the drama.\n\nOverall, Yakuza 0 is a fun ride. The story can get a little dumb at times, but it also delivers one of the best plot threads the series has to offer. If you can just revel in the fun, then honestly that's all you need. Just enjoy the craziness, the over-the-top nonsense, and the genuine moments when the story delivers on its plot points and excellent characters.\n\nI'm booting up Kiwami right as I finish typing this review.

This was my first Yakuza game and I was seriously impressed with its writing, voice acting, streamlined beat em up gameplay, sheer amount of content, musical score, and animations.  Pretty much everything about this game delivered. I would absolutely recommend it for fans of fighting games and narrative RPGs, even for newcomers to the series like me. \n\nMaybe 1/3 of my gameplay time is spent watching cutscenes. Strictly speaking about the main story, you are basically watching a movie in which you play the fight scenes and the parts where you walk around town. But that was fine by me, I thought the story was excellent, weaving a complex and interesting mafia story with twists and turns that kept you on your toes. There is a lot to unpack here, but suffice to say, I really enjoyed it, not being a typical fan of these types of things. \n\nThe game offers a massive amount of content. My 27 hour playthrough was mostly focused on the main story, with a few hours dipping into the extras and side quests. I felt like a barely scratched the surface of the game. Both two main characters have about 100 side quests between them and both of them have a fully fleshed out business side storyline that I barely made any progress on. I could see this game offering an interested player 70-100 hours of gameplay easy. \n\nThe sounds design was excellent. SFX was great, the soundtrack hit just right during the action sequences but also during the more tonally serious bits. The game is subtitled, and the voice acting is in Japanese, but none the less I could tell it was delivered with passion and quality from the voice actors. \n\nThe game doesn\u2019t offer a particularly big open world, but the two main explorable areas are jam packed with content. \n\nMy only gripe is a relatively minor one, the writing includes many interesting characters but absolutely  no well written female characters. There is only three and they are all poorly written in my opinion. I get that the yakuza is a male institution, but the game had so may throw away civilian characters maybe one of them could have been a cool fem.\n\nAll in all I really appreciated my time with this game. Its narrative was excellent, its beat em up gameplay with just complex enough to keep my interest. I would recommend this game for sure. \n", "timestamp_created": 1695913997, "timestamp_updated": 1695914494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

And that is all it really is, is a preface. It has less to do with this review itself than you'd think.\n\nI have been writing since I was sixteen years old. And every time I wrote, I wrote to bring myself wealth. 'This is going to be the one, I just know it'.\n\nBlatant lies of a fool with hopes stronger than the legs he stood on. I've never gotten past page 50, let alone page 100. I always redesign my work, 'this should go here' or 'I don't think that'll sell like that there'. It was all in the name of securing what I wanted with monetary gain.\n\n\nThen, one day I stopped writing.\n\nToo many mess ups, too many times I had thought of the 'thousand dollar winner that'd put me ahead in life'. And too many times I had lost hope. If I couldn't sell my book, what was the reason to do it?\n\nAnd then I played Yakuza 0. \n\nAs my first Yakuza game, I had already heard the praise long ahead of actually enjoying it. Kiwami's Majima Everywhere system had become a meme in my recommendations, and I had previously listened to the music on my own. So I knew I was getting into something good.\n\nAs characters came and went, they were interesting\u2014some downright amazing\u2014but nothing exactly life changing. Kiryu was a bad ass and righteous, Nishkiyama was trustworthy and loyal,  Kuze was conniving and brutish, and Majima was just generally depressing at times. But there were two characters that changed how I view my life.\n\nMajor spoilers for Chapter 8 onwards ahead.\n\nThe first actually appeared in Chapter 8, a man by the name Nishitani. He starts off as your enemy, making you go the extra mile to get a kick out of fighting you. However in the very end, Nishitani gives his life avenging his Uncle B, and makes a request of Majima; to blaze his own path, and live life how he sees fit.\n\nThen, at a later moment, there's an after-scene of the fight with Awano. Awano spent his life on dazzling lights and accelerated highs. While he was basking in the limelight, he never took a chance to really enjoy it. And in the very end, he also died, a life of wasted potential thrown away.\n\nAnd these men got me thinking; what have I been writing for? Who have I been writing for, if not for me? And I made a decision, then and there.\n\nI'm not going to write to sell my book any more. If it comes to that, then fine, my dreams can be reawakened. But until that becomes a reality, which could very well never be, I'm going to write to make a story I want to live by. A dream I want to fashion myself rather than the clouds that hang above my head. Could I never even get close? It's a well possibility. But I'm going to take that chance as long as it brings me joy; I'm going to live my way, for myself, and I won't dare squander an opportunity to prove my skill to myself.\n\nIn the end, I'm no longer trying to win the world over\u2014I'm the one I'm trying to impress.", "timestamp_created": 1695781008, "timestamp_updated": 1695781008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

The game actively encourages you to engage with all of the side content as it improves your overall standing in the world, on top of giving you more abilities for your various fighting styles. \n\nYou unlock various moves with cash money and the combat actively rewards you for varying your moves by providing more cash in each random (or linear) encounter. I am constantly engaged with everything in the world and it's so refreshing to play an open world game that rewards you for spending as much time in it as possible. For such a small map, there is so much to do and you can spend hours upon hours and still miss things. I've clocked 40 hours and I'm only about 2/3 of the way through the story, because I've been having so much fun with Cabaret Club and pursuing all the side content. \n\nIf you're a fan of beat-em-up style games, open world RPG's, engaging and creative NPC side quests, memorable characters (in the side stories as well) then this game is for you.

Hopefully if you decide to try the game, this will help save your progress unlike my own.", "timestamp_created": 1695431961, "timestamp_updated": 1695431961, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146820732": {"recommendationid": "146820732", "author": {"steamid": "76561199021796663", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1697937759}, "language": "english", "review": "baka mitai", "timestamp_created": 1695429121, "timestamp_updated": 1695429121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146819231": {"recommendationid": "146819231", "author": {"steamid": "76561199068944909", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1507, "last_played": 1680134302}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Dame dane damelo dame damelo", "timestamp_created": 1695427270, "timestamp_updated": 1695427270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146817381": {"recommendationid": "146817381", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066921627", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2445, "last_played": 1699474689}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a yakuza game what do u expect", "timestamp_created": 1695425116, "timestamp_updated": 1695425116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146815254": {"recommendationid": "146815254", "author": {"steamid": "76561199093254248", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2418, "last_played": 1695422446}, "language": "english", "review": "I believe in Goro Majima SUPREMACY", "timestamp_created": 1695422660, "timestamp_updated": 1695422660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146809520": {"recommendationid": "146809520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309316774", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1695247361}, "language": "english", "review": "Daha ba\u015flarday\u0131m in\u015f \u00e7ok pis bir plot twist yemem.

Their heat actions are devastating and satisfying and this is what makes the Yakuza games absolutely playable and fun.\n\nNot just the main storyline that has serious moments but the substories that make the game have a more and-go-lucky feeling. Plus the minigames here are absolutely entertaining. The best part of minigames is the arcades and secret arena fights.\n\nIn conclusion, Yakuza 0 is absolutely the best game recommended for new players who want to know about the Yakuza franchise from the beginning.

One thing you will find hard to do is get bored.......unless you are watching one of the 10 million year long cutscenes with so much exposition dump that made me think that Quantum Physics would be easier to summarise AND UNDERSTAND in the same time. It is quirky and FUN game nonetheless with a lot of character. Comments can be made about that \"character\" but overlooking that, worth the 100+ hours i have put into it, mostly spent watching said cutscenes.\n\nThe gameplay can be accurately encapsulated by two words|: \"FUN\" and \"CHARMING'. Have a lot of fun things to do, and everything has a lot of quirkiness, be it the over the top fight scenes or the pocket racing minigame or the Cabaret Club thing that i never really paid a lot of attention to and definitely did NOT complete. There are also AV video stores in game as i have been told, but never came across.  The lock on system for the battle mechanics seriously can be infuriating at times, but the game makes up for it by letting you PICK A DUDE UP AND THEN JUMP WHILE TRYING TO CRUSH HIS HEAD ON THE PAVEMENT and letting you break dance your way out of a messy situation. \n\nAs for story, it is decent if not better than that. It is complicated and feels a bit fragmented at times especially with new characters getting added every chapter almost. Guessing it has nostalgic value for people who know said characters from other Yakuza game but falls flat mostly for others, like me. Also, all bad characters you will beat up are BAD, until OP! NO THEY ARE NOT! They have a sad past you sadist POS so feel bad about beating the shit out of them after every boss battle.\n\nIs Very Good game. I like.

Even walking around in the convenience stores are fun; there's all sorts of things to buy and eye candy to gawk at.\n\nSo aside from losing about 20 minutes of \"progress\" (read: my crane game prizes) I have absolutely no complaints.  The story interests me, the core gameplay is fun, and all the stuff you can stop and do is awesome.  This is my first Yakuza game so I'm not sure how it compares to the others but I'm definitely going to be checking the other games out at this rate.", "timestamp_created": 1694487553, "timestamp_updated": 1694487553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146144867": {"recommendationid": "146144867", "author": {"steamid": "76561199100584586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13480, "last_played": 1649005792}, "language": "spanish", "review": "majima te rompo todo el upite 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1694479846, "timestamp_updated": 1694479846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560781717300415039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146120312": {"recommendationid": "146120312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844285167", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 4210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2818, "last_played": 1695038455}, "language": "english", "review": "baka mitai", "timestamp_created": 1694445369, "timestamp_updated": 1694445369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146113294": {"recommendationid": "146113294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198858190851", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 141, "playtime_forever": 1615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1529, "last_played": 1694483873}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A prime example of how to make a story-driven game [/h1]\n\nDefinitely one of the best games I have played so far. The story is really deep and incredibly well done with a lot of drama and complex parts regarding the development of each character. The pacing of the story is also excellent, it never stops with filler content, it's always developing new drama and introducing new villains to the plot.\nThe most amazing part is how everything interconnects as you progress. No one is just a simple NPC. All of them have really deep reasons and complex connections to literally everything that is happening, and a lot of unexpected reveals also happen, which makes everything even more engaging. \nThis game reminds me a lot of the Trails/Kiseki series where a lot of these deep character developments and interconnections happen. The difference here, at least within Yakuza 0, is that the pacing is faster.\nThe story in Yakuza 0 is amazing, and it's just the beginning of a very long saga and I can't wait to start playing the next game. I was afraid of starting playing this game before since there are 9 games to catch up, but after this game I noticed that once you start, you won't be able to stop playing.\n\nCinematography in Yakuza 0 is also excellent. Both the camera work and animations are really well done and it's clear that the series have a lot of influence from Japanese TV dramas. The graphics are really good during cutscenes, but the game definitely show it's age during gameplay since it's an old PS3 game with some limitations like having load transitions when entering stores, but still holds up really well. \nThe PC Port is excellent. I ran the game at 1440p 60fps on a RTX 2060 Super using the maximum settings and it was perfect. Really stable frame rate, and zero issues regarding bugs or crashes.\n\nThe maps are also really dense and packed with things to do and sidestories. Yakuza 0 really shows the problem with most open worlds these days. A lot of recent open world titles are just big maps, but dead with almost no stores to enter or things to interact. Yakuza 0 does the opposite, the map is small but really dense and packed with content.\nThe side content available is really high quality and fun to play, especially the cabaret managing game. I was really impressed how much quality it has and how much customization options are available to improve the girls stats. The cabaret managing thing could be a standalone game by itself lol\n\nMy only nitpick about Yakuza 0 is the combat. It's not bad but it's not good either. It is a bit clunky and heavy to control, but it was never really an issue since the combat parts are easy and you can easily heal at any time.\nThere are only a few situations where the combat flaws really shows. If it was faster and had more evading or parrying mechanics, it would've been more fun to play.\n\nYakuza 0 is an amazing game and I feel like I should've started playing the series earlier. But at the same time, I think I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if I starred playing it before. The series is definitely targeting an adult audience and there are some aspects about the story that we only understand after we become adults. A child or and adolescent would probably not appreciate this game's story as much as an adult, so I guess starting playing it now with a more mature mind was the right choice.\nThe story was so engaging that I didn't feel like stopping to do a lot of the side quests and minigames, so I focused mainly on the main story missions and it took about 26 hours to beat the game. I will still play the game a little bit more and do a few of the side content stuff before jumping on Kiwami 1.\n\nIt's definitely taking one spot in my Top10 games list. The story is incredible and very engaging that I couldn't stop playing until I finished the game. It's hard to keep writing about these games story deep games without spoiling anything. It's a game that you have to experience yourself to understand why there's so much love for the series and the overwhelmingly positive status on Steam is well deserved.", "timestamp_created":

include it anyway: Much like the game's protagonists themselves, Yakuza 0 tries absolutely everything that comes into the peripheral vision of the game's story path, and keeps a straight face from start to finish regardless of the execution. It manages to pull off a heavy and dramatic plot within the same hour of the goofy Japanese humour you've likely seen clips of online without falling apart at all.\n\nThe story and characters are enough to sell it, but then there's everything else on top of that.\nThis is a HUGE game and is a completionist's nightmare, but is best enjoyed by dipping into whatever side content looks fun and not worrying about finishing everything, playing this way absolutely still feels like a complete experience. It would not be tough to reach the credits of this game in half of the time that it took for me to beat it if you aren't sucked too much into the side content.\n\nI would rather avoid spoiling anything about the game but the story really grabbed me and is a great place to come into the series with no knowledge.\nCheck this one out even if you aren't into brawler type games but remember that Real Yakuza Use A Gamepad.", "timestamp_created": 1694234653, "timestamp_updated": 1694234653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145955982": {"recommendationid": "145955982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080512529", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4893, "last_played": 1692566274}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome genuinely one of my favorites ever.

At its core, you have a fighting/beat'em up type of game with four fighting styles for Kiryu and Majima that you have to learn and master. Aside from that, you're going to encounter a lot of minigames, each feeling different, some requiring learning, and a lot of attention to detail has been put in place. Often, I've asked myself if I've switched games because not only do they look great, but they also feel great in the game.\n\nFrom time to time, you'll have QTE moments that will demand quite a bit of effort from you. I've had moments like JCC, which is a Cat Fighting rock-paper-scissors game that you have to tap the key like a madman, and for days, I've had my right arm tired. The game takes itself seriously in the main story, but not as much in the side quests, where you'll have a lot of fun exploring the world.\n\nThe action takes place across two cities, Kamurocho and Sotenbori, where for the most part, it's defined for each character. Switching between Kiryu and Majima is done only via the main mission until the very last chapter and in free roam, where you can complete quests.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2911493250\n \n[h3] \ud83d\ude04 Fun: [/h3]\n\nOne of the best 325 hours ever spent. This game is not boring. It will have so much content thrown at you that it might feel overwhelming. There are lots of things you can do, and you can do it at your own pace.\n \n[h3] \ud83c\udfde Visuals & Presentation: [/h3]  \n  \nThe game looks close to realism, and there's some great attention to detail in cutscenes. The characters look expressive and well-animated. The world is beautiful and believable. Play enough in Kamurocho and Sotenbori, and you'll get to feel like you're part of it.\n\nThe world is packed with things to see, attention to detail, and stunning light effects. Despite being a game that came out a few years ago, the game will continue to hold up for years to come.\n\nSome cutscenes are not animated and there's some sort of inconsistency regarding that, but overall it's not a big issue once you understand how much work has been put into them.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027200536\n \n[h3] \ud83d\udd0a Sound & Voice-Acting: [/h3]  \n \nThe game sounds great and is very well-voice-acted. Kiryu's voice is by far my favorite, but other characters also perform really well.\n\nThe world feels alive, with attention to detail in cutscenes, and even items falling out of the screen. It's a labor of love, and we can see that.\n  \n[h3] \ud83d\udcd6 Story & Writing: [/h3]  \n  \nII jumped into this game with little expectation for the main story. I was proven wrong. The game has an incredible story that ties together so well until the end and stands strongly by itself and carries over into the sequels.\n\nThe tone of the main story is in stark contrast in comparison to the side quests, which define the protagonists and the characters in the world but can be ignored if you want to.\n\nThe story is about Kiryu, a Yakuza member who gets framed for a murder and has to figure out what's going on, resulting in losing his membership in the Yakuza family. Majima, an ex-Yakuza, resolves to do whatever it takes to rejoin the Yakuza family, although it's clear he has a softer heart than his appearance suggests.\n\nThe chapters are divided into 17 parts each, and for the most part, you'll play two chapters per character in the game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027200124\n \n[h3] \ud83e\uddf5 Length & Difficulty: [/h3]  \n  \nIt's a very lengthy game despite the fact that the world isn't that big. Because it's packed with content, you'll spend a lot of time completing it. You can complete the story in roughly 30 hours if you rush and focus only on it, but it's worth experiencing. There's a Legend difficulty to achieve 100% completion, which makes things tougher. However, the main challenge here lies in the minigames, where you have to learn and play them all to reach 100% completion.\n\n[h3] \u2b55\ufe0fVerdict: [/h3]  \nYakuza 0 is a MUST-PLAY title, in my opinion. Its abundant and detailed minigames, goofy side stories, and incredibly dramatic main story make it one of the best games I've ever played. It's a game I'll always remember and gladly return to after a while because 325 hours in a game is plenty to take a break and focus on something new. The game might not be for everybody, but once you try it and it grips you, it's going to be hard to put down.", "timestamp_created": 1693922338, "timestamp_updated": 1699719744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808072984218597412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145705880": {"recommendationid": "145705880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302117636", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 4348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3318, "last_played": 1696446331}, "language": "english", "review": "yakuzer game", "timestamp_created": 1693917530, "timestamp_updated": 1693917530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145692228": {"recommendationid": "145692228", "author": {"steamid": "76561199172599631", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 308, "playtime_at_review": 482, "last_played": 1700730820}, "language": "english", "review": "violence might not always be the answer but at least it gets your point across\n\nsolid 10/10 game for le funni beatdowns", "timestamp_created": 1693889289, "timestamp_updated": 1693889289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145686134": {"recommendationid": "145686134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039499763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 10772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7144, "last_played": 1695506889}, "language": "english", "review": "I've stopped playing the main game for the moment to focus on my booming Cabaret Club business.

The story is enthralling. The characters are compelling. The gameplay is fun and engaging. It has it all in spades. And it\u2019s such a unique experience. It\u2019s more than the sum of its parts, too. Somehow this game, despite being such a chaotic morass, is just one of the most compelling experiences you\u2019ll have in gaming. \n\nThe story is a slow burn at the beginning, but when it finally hits, it hits hard. And while the game is known for being silly and out there, the story is anything but. The main story is a very serious crime drama that does not pull punches. It isn\u2019t silly. It isn\u2019t played for laughs. It\u2019s hardboiled and utterly riveting. Go in expecting a yakuza Martin Scorcese story. \n\nThe characters are all equally compelling. You will love them. You will hate them. You will cry for them. You will laugh with them. And the voice acting is fantastic. Everyone sells their performance hard and you will be completely engrossed in their performances. It\u2019s always exciting to see them and to hear their interactions.\n\nWhen I said the game was boundlessly cool, I meant it. There are moments in this game that are so damn cool that I couldn\u2019t stop feeling giddy for a long time afterward. I\u2019ve never played a game that had me feeling anywhere as cool as this one. And you\u2019ll know what I mean when you get to those points. Hopefully you\u2019ll have the same experience as I did.\n\nIt is when you get outside of the main story that the game\u2019s tone diverges a lot. The side stories can be heartfelt, but a lot of the time they are outright silly and insane. It\u2019s such a dichotomy, but they make it work. The side stories aren\u2019t amazing. Certainly not anywhere near the scope of the main story, but they can be fun diversions and you get to see the sillier sides of the characters. They are endearing, even. And it is here where you\u2019ll interact with the game\u2019s many mini-games. \n\nThe mini-games run the gamut: card games, pool, darts, bowling, karaoke, disco, pocket circuit racing, so on and so forth. Some are better than others and some are inconceivably cooler than you\u2019d expect, like the disco (although I find it very hard). Still, when you are flowing with the disco and the music is thrumming while you are pulling off a dancing fever, it\u2019s so much cooler than you\u2019d think it would be. There are also some bigger mini-games, like the real estate and cabaret club management.\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of side stuff and you\u2019ll spend a lot of time with it, if you so choose. And you probably will because it can generally be quite fun and engaging. And dozens upon dozens of hours later you\u2019ll wonder where all the time has gone.\n\nSo what can I say now at the end? I love Yakuza 0. I\u2019m so glad I gave it another chance and discovered what a gem it is. It\u2019s in my top games of all time now. And it has ignited a feverish desire in me to explore the rest of the series. I hope you can have the same experience as I have. Just give it a chance and let it work its magic. Don\u2019t put it down until you are absolutely sure it is not for you. You may end up surprised.\n", "timestamp_created": 1693848781, "timestamp_updated": 1693848781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145659533": {"recommendationid": "145659533", "author": {"steamid": "76561199223935333", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 814, "playtime_at_review": 8177, "last_played": 1700757343}, "language": "english", "review": "the cat fight mini-game is really fucking stupid if you plan to 100% this game please dont", "timestamp_created": 1693841680, "timestamp_updated": 1693841680, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145655004": {"recommendationid": "145655004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987120450", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2411, "last_played": 1699369989}, "language": "english", "review": "Yakuza is so cool, I wish Japan was real!", "timestamp_created": 1693836534, "timestamp_updated": 1693836534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521276593208312988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145653946": {"recommendationid": "145653946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126579660", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5128, "last_played": 1680905470}, "language": "english", "review": "DAME DANE DAME YO DAME NANO YO", "timestamp_created": 1693835247, "timestamp_updated": 1693835247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145645150": {"recommendationid": "145645150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805215003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3748, "last_played": 1693253849}, "language": "english", "review": "Not bad I like it", "timestamp_created": 1693822011, "timestamp_updated": 1693822011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145639396": {"recommendationid": "145639396", "author": {"steamid": "76561199000547803", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 900, "last_played": 1693959719}, "language": "english", "review": "Charming and wacky.

This game is a blast to play from start to finish, with a story that can be very heartfelt and depressing, to then go and do some karaoke, dance battle, or do some goofy ass substory, this game has it all. The boss fights are challenging at times, but challenging in a really fun way where you can learn from previous experiences and counter certain moves, recognize attack patterns, and in rare cases go an entire boss fight without even taking a single hit. And as for the plot of this game it's done in a very unique way, with every 2 chapters you switch between Kiryu and Majima which leads to a lot of moments where the chapter is getting really good and then abruptly ends to pick up where the previous chapter of whatever character was played last is left off which makes for a really good way to reel someone into the story of Yakuza 0. The story is badass, fun, shocking, and at times depressing, which I won't seriously dive into as it \nis best summed up if you were to just watch a review or retrospective of Yakuza 0. Last part of this review dives into the games side content, which is so jam packed with substories, and minigames, you can probably forget about the story at times because you'd get so lost in everything else the game has to offer besides the story for example, a substory where you literally protect a Japanese equivalent to Micheal Jackson against zombies as he moonwalks, or getting some random guy his pants after they got stolen, or impersonating a movie producer. To put it lightly this game is a fucking blast, and considering I got this game as part of a bundle during the summer sale which came with Y0, YK, and YK2 for like 10 bucks, this is definitely a must play game as it's such a refresher from all the other generic boring shitty AAA games that are half assed products released early when clearly not finished and sold for 70 bucks.

The strong story and the many, often humorous, mini-games provide many hours of fun.\nAn attractive slip-on in the form of Yakuza 0.\nThis game takes place where it all begins, which is the great 80s.\nYakuza 0 is therefore a prequel which is an excellent choice for the first Yakuza.\n\nThe game also works great on a steam deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRD5ppWpW7c\n\nSince this game is about the Japanese mafia, fighting cannot be missed.\nFrom drunken strangers to tattooed Yakuza bosses, almost no one escapes Kiryu and Majima's fists.\nIn the beginning you can get away with blindly approaching a brawl, but the final bosses in particular require some form of strategy.\nDuring the game you have the opportunity to develop your character. This means that you can buy new moves that you can use in battles.\nThe fighting is quite repetitive, but nevertheless never really gets boring. The opponents are always different and that, together with the use of new moves, ensures that it remains fun.\n\nYakuza Zero is also a great game graphically. The character models of the main characters in the story look good, and the animations are also smooth. Unfortunately, this does not always apply to the NPCs in the area, but we just add this to the humorous part of the game.\nFortunately, it is not disturbing anywhere, since it belongs to the genre a bit. The world of Yakuza doesn't seem huge at first glance either, but the moment you start playing you realize that the world out there is crammed with details and ways to pass your time.\nSo in this case there is clearly a focus on quality of the world over quantity.\n\nYakuza 0 is not only a perfect entry point for new people, it is also the best game in the series.\nThanks to a wonderful 80s vibe, a sharp story and improved gameplay, the series is at its peak.\nYakuza 0 thus transcends the classification of 'simple prequel' and is elevated to an essential game.", "timestamp_created": 1693144417, "timestamp_updated": 1693144417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754493951797485352", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145128502": {"recommendationid": "145128502", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037161657", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 416, "playtime_at_review": 1200, "last_played": 1700233999}, "language": "english", "review": "Too bad Japan isn't real :(", "timestamp_created": 1693141380, "timestamp_updated": 1693141794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145125734": {"recommendationid": "145125734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055730114", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 5127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5127, "last_played": 1693133864}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[i]Yakuza 0[/i] es un pico tanto de la saga como del videojuego en general que juega en la liga de secuelas/precuelas tan memorables como [i]Metal Gear Solid 2 (2001)[/i], [i] Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)[/i] o [i]The Last of Us: Part II (2019)[/i].\n\nSe ha dicho mucho que es un GTA japon\u00e9s, pero esta comparaci\u00f3n solo es acertada conceptualmente, ya que en ejecuci\u00f3n no puede estar m\u00e1s lejos de los juegos de Rockstar.

Siempre te sorprende con su personalidad y forma de hacer.\n\nLa historia principal es la m\u00e1s centrada de toda la saga y habla principalmente de la especulaci\u00f3n inmobiliaria y como la avaricia de unos pocos destroza la vida de muchos. La comedia y el drama tienen un encaje perfecto. Qu\u00e9 decir de los personajes. Las cinem\u00e1ticas son algunas de las mejores que he visto en el medio, los combates contra jefes son incre\u00edbles. El gameplay es divertid\u00edsimo (Majima est\u00e1 rot\u00edsimo) y la m\u00fasica memorable, carne de playlist. \n\nT\u00e9cnicamente es impecable, con un port que no me ha dado ning\u00fan problema. El aspecto visual y art\u00edstico es precioso, Kamurocho y Sotenbori nunca se hab\u00edan visto tan bien. Pocas pegas se le pueden poner, es uno de los mejores RPG de acci\u00f3n que he jugado.\n\nNota: 98/100", "timestamp_created": 1693138398, "timestamp_updated": 1698755494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145098147": {"recommendationid": "145098147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330040652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 346, "last_played": 1698519283}, "language": "english", "review": "Please get this game", "timestamp_created": 1693100809, "timestamp_updated": 1693100809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145093961": {"recommendationid": "145093961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880552310", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1696725511}, "language": "english", "review": "i'm not even on chapter 3 yet but this one of the best beat 'em up games ever made", "timestamp_created": 1693094742, "timestamp_updated": 1693094742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145086463": {"recommendationid": "145086463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027285538", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 5738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5738, "last_played": 1693083640}, "language": "english", "review": "What an incredible experience this game is.\n\nA serious and dramatic story (which is rather terrific) accompanied by some of the most goofy, wacky, entertaining and charismatic side stories around.

At the point of writing this, I was only on Chapter 8 with a reasonable attempt at side quest completion too.\n\nIf you know the good from the bad of proper Japanese cinema in the Yakuza genre, the main storyline is outstanding. SSS standard. It has serious dramatic depth and the voice acting is on point. As is the insane amount of in world \"Japanese\" lore. Whether its the era specific references and quirks, or just the universal cultural \"things\" that make Japan so unique. \"0\" is almost like a celebration of all things \"fun\" about the culture, with a very specific \"arcade culture\" flavour to it all.\n\nThe game is incredibly story heavy, and manages to mix humour and light silly fluff on the side in a very effective way that does not diminish or infect the main storyline. So you need to be mindful that this is not a game where  you can jump in for a quick session, and move on with the rest of your day. I made that mistake several times. There are a lot of surprise missions, both main or side quests, that suddenly spiral out of control with extended story content and combat, Before you know it 40 minutes has passed by before you have access to your next chance to safely save your progress... 40 minutes from triggering a simple \"partial quest\" activity that you were completely expecting to take only 5 minutes tops... and it still remains a \"partial\" completion of that quest. One occasion ended in a difficult boss fight where, if I had bailed, the last Save checkpoint would have had me re-fighting a swarm of underlings to get back to that boss fight (a fight that was not easy).\n\nThe game is good enough that those surprise time sinks don't feel like you are being cheated, but actually suck you in to want to see more, discover more. Very much a \"one more mission\" type of experience.\n\nAnd all of that depth is somewhat ironic, because the open world precincts you have access to are really quite small, and sometimes heavily restricted when certain missions force you to \"escape\" something. It is a huge game experience in what is really a very small game world.\n\nEven the silly side game and pseudo-JRPG grinding elements are actually fun and varied enough that they have value... unlike the many ultra grind mega open world AAA franchises out there today. Any silly side quest and collectable activities are entirely optional, even if some of them genuinely make the main story and mechanics easier to progress through. Therein lies the charm of this gameplay; you don't have to do the side stuff, but the game is successful at making you want to do it.\n\nThere are little quirks and bugs of course. It is a very good console port, but still a console port. So the fluidity and freedom of movement you expect at all times as a PC gamer makes some of the limitations in the ultra-arcadey combat mechanics feel little stiff. Still fun and challenging, and it genuinely requires combo/speed skills... but little things like that, even when freely exploring the streets will stand out as a \"pfft... this is where the highest console standards are at...  peasants\" moment for you. Still.. PC elitism aside, the game is so richly layered and well designed that you can accept those quirks as challenges rather than obstacles to the immersion.\n\nVery unique experience that successfully combines so many different genre mechanics, but cannot really be compared to any other game out there.", "timestamp_created": 1692141744, "timestamp_updated": 1692141744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144295754": {"recommendationid": "144295754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082571467", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4583, "last_played": 1690497717}, "language": "english", "review": "Least violent walk in the streets of Japan", "timestamp_created": 1692140260, "timestamp_updated": 1692140260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144293488": {"recommendationid": "144293488", "author": {"steamid": "76561199040640996", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6645, "last_played": 1692141939}, "language": "english", "review": "corny ass game", "timestamp_created": 1692137466, "timestamp_updated": 1692137466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144289092": {"recommendationid": "144289092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836147014", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2700, "last_played": 1695534822}, "language": "english", "review": "Always will be a place in my heart!", "timestamp_created": 1692132390, "timestamp_updated": 1692132390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144279948": {"recommendationid": "144279948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197637350", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4650, "last_played": 1679490167}, "language": "english", "review": "nani", "timestamp_created": 1692123011, "timestamp_updated": 1692123011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144263729": {"recommendationid": "144263729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031266613", "num_games_owned": 1059, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 3465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3465, "last_played": 1645831549}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love great, deeply carved-out legitimate stories in which so much dedication is poured; if you love gangster themes; if you love Sega; if you're a (closeted) weeaboo...

Temporary fix is to got to the settings ini file and put a # sign behind the window and fullscreen so it forces it to stay in fullscreen. if you alt tab too much your stuck in windowed mode and youll freeze again if you try to change it back to fullscreen. 3rd and most heinous of all is that if you try to get things out of storage box and you accidentaly or intentionaly press the up arrow then the game just exits you. I dont know if its oversight issue or just my game but thats bad considering if you wanted to get something out of storage and then save and you do this you just lost progress.

In every previous Yakuza game, Majima was one of everyones favourate non-playable character, in this Yakuza Zero game, you get to see some scenes that tie into the first Yakuza game, which is nice. \n\nI would definately recommend to play this one first before jumping into Yakuza Kiwami (remake of Yakuza 1). \nWould i recommend this game?\n\nOf course i would, if you want to experience the underbelly of Yakuza in the 1980's, you won't be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1692031034, "timestamp_updated": 1692031034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144187955": {"recommendationid": "144187955", "author": {"steamid": "76561199118068737", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 4627, "last_played": 1700306087}, "language": "english", "review": "gud geim", "timestamp_created": 1692025912, "timestamp_updated": 1692025912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144157690": {"recommendationid": "144157690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312771292", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 452, "last_played": 1682390683}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta caro gracias", "timestamp_created": 1692001110, "timestamp_updated": 1692001110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803258657455444", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144150536": {"recommendationid": "144150536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325486281", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2033, "last_played": 1691991355}, "language": "english", "review": "I would pay one billion yen for it", "timestamp_created": 1691991493, "timestamp_updated": 1691991493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144140609": {"recommendationid": "144140609", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007619860", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "playtime_at_review": 622, "last_played": 1700271210}, "language": "english", "review": "Sunao ni I LOVE YOU!\nTodokeyou kitto\nYOU LOVE ME!\nTsutawaru sa kimi ni\nNiau garasu no\nKutsu wo sagasou\n\nFutari\u2005de\u2005STEP & GO!\nItsu\u2005made mo\nShinya juuni-ji wo\nSugitatte bokura no\nRabu\u2005majikku wa\nToke wa shinai\n\nOide meshimase ohime-sama\nDoku no ringo wo\nTabete nemucchai sou na\nSunao sugiru kimi ga\nTotemo itoshii\n\nAtarimae \uff1d (iko) takaramono sa\nChikyuu wa mawari\nHi wa nobori\nKimi wa hohoemu\n\nSunao ni I LOVE YOU!\nTodokeyou kitto\nYOU LOVE ME!\nTsutawaru sa kimi ni\nNiau garasu no\nKutsu wo sagasou\n\nFutari de STEP & GO!\nItsu made mo\nShinya juuni-ji wo\nSugitatte bokura no\nRabu majikku wa\nToke wa shinai\n\nIji no warui mama haha ni mo\nKyuu na ame ni mo\nSamishii yoru ni mo\nHekotarenai kimi ga\nYahari itoshii\n\nTooku hanarete aenai hi wa\nHoshi ni negatte\nYume de aou\nAsu wa HALLELUJAH\n\nIsshou I LOVE YOU!\nKawaranai sou sa\nYOU LOVE ME!\nEien sa kimi ni\nNiau daiya no\nRing watasou\n\nKore kara nanzenkai\nTsumazuite sara ni\nNanmankai\nKoronde mo\nKimi no garasu no kutsu wa\nNuge wa shinai\n\n\n(min'na!)\n(notteru?)\n(konkai no Goro, nanka aidoru!)\n(sou!

I ended up switching the difficulty to Normal around 1/3rd of the way through the run and was satisfied with the difficulty of enemies and bosses. \n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone and I genuinely hope that this review urges people on the fence to give this series a go.", "timestamp_created": 1691878608, "timestamp_updated": 1691878608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.80127328634262085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144036099": {"recommendationid": "144036099", "author": {"steamid": "76561199175469623", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 7226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5354, "last_played": 1692065409}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego", "timestamp_created": 1691877384, "timestamp_updated": 1691877384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508196711540222168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144032898": {"recommendationid": "144032898", "author": {"steamid": "76561199105630761", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4576, "last_played": 1692118043}, "language": "english", "review": "I was expecting a serious and emotional story filled with memorable moments and instead I got...\n\n...Everything stated above plus an inmense amount of stupidity, hilarious scenes and even more surreal sidequests.

an engrossing and immersive world. i also found myself particularly loving the fishing and bowling mini-games (which i'm not usually a big fan of). it's a treat for the eyes too ... i only had a performance issue on one occasion (which was a known save game glitch where strange items appear in your inventory in place of what you should have), but not a gamebreaker. i simply reloaded an earlier save and never experienced the problem again. i LOVE LOVE LOVE this game ... i need to retire now so i can devote time to the many other instalments in this series, which i can't wait to have

the miracle johnson quest aka michael jackson boot leg for kiryu like doing a zombie fight and dance battle with him \ncombat quite good , not gonna lies but the lock on system of the yakuza series alway bother me just something about it dont feel right other than that , the combat is pure sandbox you 4 style which you can mix and match or turn it into devil may cry if you good at the game which make this even more satisfying once you learn the game\nmusic of this game very memorable even the boss theme or the track playing in the cutscenes and combat section but the thing i remember the most are the dance music and karaoke song (baka mitai,24 hour cinderella) oh boy these have been stuck on my head for quite while just make me want to laugh when ever see those song being sing by the main character and their facial animation truly the fantasy every one want \nside story ,mini game and random stuff you can do are plentiful you could do them when ever you want as long as the story mission dont lock those section like please tell me that you dont like doing the claw machine,arcade machine ,dancing, karaoke and many more \nif you are a completionist then yakuza series is quite painful to do tho because they can easily take up to +100 hour and above \nand the best thing of all it have mods support now i can play as anything the biggest example is CJ mods from GTA \n\n",

Sometimes when you save it will not display the \"save complete\" message. This will turn your equipment into food items. You can fix this by saving until you see that message. Besides that, no bugs that I have encountered\n\nI kinda just paragraphed off in this. So enjoy a mostly unorganized review :)\n\nThe real estate was pretty fun. Nice and simple money goes up sorta dealio. The fights were fun, and unlocking your styles abilities was great. But my problem with it is that it seems optional but if you treat it as that, you miss out on a lot of the games combat abilities. While yes you can use a shrine ability to unlock the extra abilities, you simply will not be able to afford them. I liked how everything in this game felt optional, and this took a bit of that away. Granted, it was fun and all (Besides the last area, it got really slow), but it was portrayed as optional, when it is technically, but not really. Besides that, the real estate was a like 8/10 game within this game. If you don't have a spare 10 hours for this segment of the game, just cheat to get the unlocks\n\nI did not bother with the Cabaret club. I wanted to just play the story and well...\n\nThe game punishes you for not doing the business mini game. Like heavily punishes you. I was playing on Hard and everything was dying so easily as Kiryu. Once I was as Majima though, it got much tougher. The character progression is tied to the businesses. I think this is awful and frankly the biggest problem with Yakuza 0. It seems optional, but it isn't. Skip on the businesses and you miss out on most of the abilities, a secret style, and a ton of Completion Points. With Kiryu, the combat was fun and balanced because I had sunk the 10 or so hours in real estate. With Majima, the combat was much more basic and mind numbing. Enemies barely took damage. I will admit, I cheated in the secret style for Majima just to see what it was like, and it sucked. Super low damage, heat gain, and only 2 heat actions. I am glad I skipped his minigame because putting all that effort in for that would have made me quit.\n\nI had liked the combat at first, but it overstayed its welcome. I enjoy simplier combat systems like this. Not everything needs to be Devil May Cry. But my problem with it was the slow progression mixed with how long the game is. Everything felt so dragged out. At the end, I only enjoyed Kiryu's gameplay but not really Majima's at all. All because of the messed up progression system. In smaller burst, the combat is fun. I think 60 hours was a bit too long for it though.\n\nMusic was sick. I never really liked dubstep, but gosh the battle themes just do it right. I have not much else to say, it just be good music.\n\nI liked the open world a lot in this game because it was compact. There is very minimal mindless walking in it. A lot of larger open world games have emptiness problems, but by staying small, Yakuza 0 ends up feeling much bigger and real.\n\nStory was great and the main reason I played near the end. It made me tear up, get pissed, and the whole 9 yards. It is a very \"small deal spirals out of control\" story which was nice. The end kinda confused me though. \n[spoiler] Also I had people tell me this was how Majima \"breaks\" but he never does? He kinda just chooses to live crazier at the end which was pretty unsatisfying. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, it is a good game, but one with a major flaw.

"review": "Where to even begin? This game is great. The story, the characters, the combat, the city life... everything! So much happens so quickly and you can't help but feel hooked. The story of Kazuma Kiryu's life in 'the family' is such a time and a half. It's filled with excitement, camaraderie, tragedy, heartache, highs and lows, everything you could want for a yakuza story. Without divulging too much, Goro Majima's story gives an equal amount of thrill and sadness and both people make for such great protagonists. The combat... oh man, the combat! It's violent it's brutal, and nobody dies! Or at least maybe they do, but uh... Kiryu never kills anyone. Never. There are Heat Actions to perform and there are a LOT of them just waiting for you to witness. Upgrades, upgrades, and more! The combat is satisfying and you'll be earning money in the process, so beat 'em up!\nSubstories! There's a LOT and they're all their own little adventure. Some are... questionable but there's always a goal to reach for each of these little breaks from the main game. It's these substories you can do that really do help the city feel alive and of course it helps the protagonist feel more human and allows you understand their personality better through the actions and dialogue in all of these.\nMinigames! There's a handful! Some are not the faint of heart if you're a completionist and an achievement hunter. So if you're ready to take on Japanese Mahjong from the ground-up, dance the night away, bowl some strikes, bet on wrestling, and race some snazzy toy cars, then good luck!", "timestamp_created": 1691175248, "timestamp_updated": 1691175248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143405973": {"recommendationid": "143405973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198818160305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 9240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4402, "last_played": 1694473118}, "language": "spanish", "review": "el mejor juego que jugue nunca\n", "timestamp_created": 1691175093, "timestamp_updated": 1691175093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143390382": {"recommendationid": "143390382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119038613", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 6451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "playtime_at_review": 4962, "last_played": 1700473231}, "language": "english", "review": "peak", "timestamp_created": 1691157935, "timestamp_updated": 1691157935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143385802": {"recommendationid": "143385802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133065976", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1446, "last_played": 1692051185}, "language": "english", "review": "he couldn't be more yakooza if he tried", "timestamp_created": 1691152554, "timestamp_updated": 1691152554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143378381": {"recommendationid": "143378381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282866384", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4967, "last_played": 1697961320}, "language": "english", "review": "Rich Content!

It's very interesting to see the origin stories of two of the most iconic characters, and it provides a lot of background that makes you appreciate the rest of the games in a new way.\n\nThe battle system is as hilariously unbalanced as always, but you have multiple ways of becoming an all-star fighter with both characters. In this game, money is used for everything up to and including leveling up, so you'll find you need more cash than you ever have in any other game to date. While this was an interesting premise, I found that I had to level up in fits and starts, and didn't really get a steady advancement of skills. As soon as both characters get their businesses going, you have good seed money, but even then you can't really max them out easily unless you use an exploit exclusive to Kiryu and then pass the benefits to Majima near the end of the game.\n\nAnyway, even if this game doesn't really do much new for battles, I found the story very enjoyable, and I liked seeing how the characters change. You see many, many people in this game that have been in the other titles. Sometimes they just appear as cameos, other times as significant story characters.\n\nI find it very remarkable that as the game went on, I became increasingly more interested in Majima's side of the story than Kiryu's. Kiryu's isn't bad by any means, it's just that you kind of already know what you're going to get with him: Thousand yard stares and punching people to advance the plot. Majima's content fills in a lot of gaps in his character, and overall I found his changes to be the more compelling of the two.\n\nAll in all, a pretty good entry in the series, and really great for filling in the plot.

At the time of writing this review I still haven't finished the main story and I am only on Chapter 7, probably around the mid point of the game. And yet I've clocked in about 60 hours already in to the game.\n\nNow you might be asking, surely the game isn't that long that it's 60 hours of slow paced story just to get to the middle of the game. Short answer: No. No it is not. The long answer is a little more complicated. This game does an amazing job at giving the player options in the open world. There is plenty of side content in a smaller but much more detailed and filled in open world segment. The game walks a perfect balance between content and how the open world is presented.\n\nWhat makes this game so unique is that it features two protagonists, two main characters that remain fundamental to the whole Yakuza story even after 0. This is where I am most amazed at this game because they made both protagonists equally as interesting which we all know is an incredibly difficult feat to do. They're nuanced, they have character, they're fully fleshed out and most important of all, they both have some of the most badass moments I have seen in any game topping the set pieces of games like Uncharted.\n\nThe combat is some of the best combat I have ever played and seen in a game. It is fluid, smooth, exciting and brutal. The controls are intuitive and making combos is easy and engaging. The skill tree is expansive and detailed leaving for some great growth along the way as you make the journey through the game's story and open world.\n\nAnd yes, there is an \"achievement list\" or completion list as they call it in the game to keep track of all the side content in the game which you get rewarded with CP = completion points that you can use at the Shrine or Temple in the game to permanently upgrade your character or businesses. I forgot to mention, you can become the CEO of a Real Estate Company or a Manager at a Cabaret Club which both have their own mini-games.\n\nTLDR: This game is fun, exciting and amazing all the way through with great story pacing and an engaging gameplay loop.

For the gameplay, the combat is great and it managed to be flashy while still intresting, difficult and not just button marshy. This is also one of the most random games I have ever played. In the first hour you go from beating someone up in an alley to singing kareoke to getting accused for a murder, which is surprising how a murder can happen in the yakuza world since people can be stabbed like 15 times in the chest and still be up and fighting, speaking of, the special moves when fighting were amazing and comically funny. The amount of things to do aside from the story are also crazy. You can be calling babes on the phone, then go bowling, then hit up the batting cages, then gamble all of your money away, then make some back at the cabaret club, then invest in real estate and finish the day with some fun arcade games. The hundredish side missions were also very fun and super intresting, yet I skipped a lot of them as about a third were tied to the cabernet club and real estate side games. Overall, Yakzua 0 was an amazing game with one of the best stories I have ever seen and so much variation that sometimes you will forget that you are playing a Japanese crime drama. The game is not for people who cannot get invested however, as it is very long and some of the cutscenes take forever to get through, but it is all worth it in the end.", "timestamp_created": 1690407403, "timestamp_updated": 1690407403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142852061": {"recommendationid": "142852061", "author": {"steamid": "76561199154469870", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 7664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1693268549}, "language": "english", "review": "yeah", "timestamp_created": 1690399725, "timestamp_updated": 1690399725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142850205": {"recommendationid": "142850205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350039751", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2488, "last_played": 1690513139}, "language": "english", "review": "Just Grown ass men throwing hands at the Highest level", "timestamp_created": 1690397636, "timestamp_updated": 1690397636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142849964": {"recommendationid": "142849964", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026643675", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2787, "last_played": 1688060086}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs (if ur trying to mod the game)\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2611 10", "timestamp_created": 1690397366, "timestamp_updated": 1691060890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142846053": {"recommendationid": "142846053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271479254", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 1608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1608, "last_played": 1690392223}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games i've ever played\n\nI loved the character development, and don't think there's any other game that made me absolutely hate its antagonists/villains at first but grew to respect and even love them by the end of the game.\n\nMusic is amazing and gets you pumped up when in combat. But even out of combat, the soundtrack is great.\n\nCutscenes make you feel like you're watching a film. I played in ultra and enjoyed the graphics - every pore and scar on a character's face makes them so much more alive. The nuance of expressions and body language is captured well too.\n\nThe main story is so good that close to midgame I started ignoring minigames and sidequests, and all the other stuff because I was too invested in the main story. The cliffhangers after each chapter, twists and turns - some expected, some not so much. It's really a ride.\n\nWith all that said, I don't think it's for everyone. If you can't stand long cutscenes (and I mean VERY long) with a lot of talking, aren't a fan of the beat em up/brawler combat style which can get tedious after a while (though the game allows you to literally throw away money to avoid combat later on - which I did), or don't usually play games with subtitles on, this game might not be great. \n\nwonderful game, i really liked it\n",

One example is near the end of ch4 the game really picks up but the start of ch5 the brakes are slammed hard, sending the story out the front windshield and causing it to crawl and then limp along for a while.\n\nCharacters were also not that interesting, having to see literally the same character personality across pretty much all the villains, I just start to get annoyed seeing the the same acting style as yakuza characters all act and scream the same way, it was really annoying. The main characters weren't all that fleshed out either and as someone who has yet to play Yakuza 1-6 I found myself not really caring about these characters. It's obvious this game expects you to play the other games cause I don't see too many new players caring much about these characters.\n\nGameplay was fine but a bit repetitive.\n\nNot much variety in maps, you just run back and forth through the same two maps for the most part.\n\nMusic was decent.\n\nGraphics were decent.\n\nOverall, I would say this game is decent but not great, don't come in expecting something high budget like Star Field and you should have some fun but if you're gonna finish it, you gotta be patient and suffer through the boring parts. \n\nLot's of ups and downs with this one for me, but not the worst game I've played.

But the level of detail of everything, amazing sidequests, characters, and surprisingly dramatic, emotional story with many twists and turns dragged me through the entire game. I couldn't stop playing and spent several evenings in a row just to see what would happen next. Yeah, there're some anime bullshit moments throughout the main story, the level of absurd in certain sidequests might not be everyone's cup of tea, and some characters, including the main protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, act and look like they came straight from [b]JoJo's Bizarre Adventure[/b]. Still, overall I was impressed, and I will play through the entire series now.\n\nSo yeah, in short, if you like a quite primitive beat 'em up combat, intriguing story, painfully detailed minigames, and everything Japanese, then definitely give this game a go.", "timestamp_created": 1689784761, "timestamp_updated": 1689784864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523650884628295898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142412800": {"recommendationid": "142412800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058803491", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 7654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7586, "last_played": 1695261567}, "language": "english", "review": "60% of Yakuza fans Quit after 0", "timestamp_created": 1689781774, "timestamp_updated": 1689781774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142402270": {"recommendationid": "142402270", "author": {"steamid": "76561199120808668", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4699, "last_played": 1692983174}, "language": "english", "review": "epic shit ngl", "timestamp_created": 1689770051, "timestamp_updated": 1689770051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142398701": {"recommendationid": "142398701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198935989606", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1276, "last_played": 1697511337}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont want to ever finish this game.

A lot of the non-joking top rated reviews already do a pretty good job on selling you on the game.\nEven if you have no plans to play the rest of Ryu Ga Gotoku studio's titles, Yakuza 0 is a must play for almost anyone with a system that can play it. Its default price being as cheap as it is makes it even more of a steal.\n\nFittingly for something that's the first in the series chronologically, Y0 embodies almost everything that makes the series great. Hubs that, instead of being massive open worlds with nothing in them, are several city blocks that you'll come to know like the back of your hand in the best way. Combat that, this time around, has 6 fighting styles (plus 2 bonus ones) that are super fun to experiment with even if they're not balanced in the slightest (though literally no RGG game is balanced). Tons of minigames and side modes to try, from original Karaoke songs sung by the characters' VAs, to what may be why you get into Riichi Mahjong or Shogi. A soundtrack that's 88 tracks long, with contributions from at least 16 composers. Tons of substories that tell some of the most ridiculous and hilarious tales in the series yet. And, of course, a dramatic main story that unexpectedly pulls you in after hearing about how goofy the game is with amazing characters and voice acting.\n\nI will say the game isn't the perfect instalment as it falls in places that other Yakuza games don't as much:\n-Catfight club is god awful and can actively hurt you with how much it encourages you to mash.\n-Collosseum is extremely grindy for no real reason, Yakuza 5 is unfortunately similar. Kiwami, which was developed after 0, isn't as bad with this though.\n-Telephone Club is badly thought out with unskippable cutscenes every time you go through it and needing to go through it at least 7 times to unlock its substories (and you will be going through it quite a bit more than 7 times), which are needed to face the game's fun bonus boss.\n-Upgrades have weird progression. In past games you are rewarded in exp for fighting and doing substories, upgrades coming gradually throughout your playthrough. In 0, because of upgrades happening through money, you go from the stage where you get upgrades from fighting and selling plates, to when you unlock the businesses and get better profits (even then not that much with Majima), to when you're able to exploit mr shakedown and get basically unlimited money for every upgrade at once. Even then Majima can't do this and must wait until Kiryu can transfer enough money to him which is kinda late in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1689086627, "timestamp_updated": 1689086627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141831162": {"recommendationid": "141831162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315436428", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7364, "last_played": 1688526562}, "language": "english", "review": "I would recommend this to people who are starting to play Yakuza series", "timestamp_created": 1689081459, "timestamp_updated": 1689081459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141828702": {"recommendationid": "141828702", "author": {"steamid": "76561199236129997", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1829, "last_played": 1688283754}, "language": "english", "review": "based", "timestamp_created": 1689078668, "timestamp_updated": 1689078668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141823777": {"recommendationid": "141823777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198431381231", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1689072782}, "language": "english", "review": "Based", "timestamp_created": 1689072864, "timestamp_updated": 1689072864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141812522": {"recommendationid": "141812522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331110046", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1534, "last_played": 1688891059}, "language": "english", "review": "Game was very good, one of the best stories I ever played.

Overall its not a difficult game mechanically, even on the hardest difficulty.\n\nThe setting is where this game truly shines. Set in a fictitious red light district of Tokyo in the early 80s, its a fascinating combination of grime and glitz. Seedy characters in leisure suits get curbstomped next to piles of garbage. You befriend convenience store workers, cabaret workers, arcade workers, fishermen, sushi chefs, and the odd homeless person. There's no shortage of serious, silly, and raunchy in Kamurocho.\n\nCombined with all the side activities engrossing everything from baseball, to bowling, to telephone dating, to betting on cat fights there's just so much to enjoy about this game.

Also with the protagonists learning new abilities, it was fun to try different techniques during fights.\n\nThis game truly has a brilliant story. And the acting is top notch.
