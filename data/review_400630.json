I found it one day browsing the stream store. I decided to give it a try, and I am so happy I did. I had no idea that I would have so much fun playing this game. It does take some time to get use to the controls (I decided to use a controller instead of the keyboard); however, just keep playing and they get easier to remember and use. This game is such a nice experience.\n\nMy recommendation is to explore everywhere. The game encourages you do so. Talk to everyone you can. Help people and be kind to everyone. To me that was such a rewarding experience. I got so much happiness (a game mechanic that gives you health) by just helping all the characters I could. I was completely satisfied when I beat the game, but I still need to 100% it. \n\nYou can tell the game developers put love into this game. The characters had all different personalities and interactions (the game gives me a Paper Mario Thousand Year Door feel). The world building is well done. I did feel like the NPCs and background characters were active in the world of the game which allows you to get sucked into the story and atmosphere of the game.

I tried to change it, but then some buttons (A) just stayed on the old layout in some cases, so things didn't work correctly anymore. I had to use the default layout, which I really didn't like.\n[*] Some puzzles don't make a lot of sense and you have to guess. Especially the one near the end where you are underground was pretty bad. \n[*] After talking to an NPC, I often initiated the conversation again by accident (there is an additional misleading speech bubble at the end).\n[*] I found both the shop interface and the player inventory to be unintuitive.\n[*] The game makes you wait at a few points, which can become annoying.\n[*] There are many (mostly cosmetic) items sold by vendors, but without \"grinding\", you hardly have enough money to buy anything.\n[*] There are a few bugs (see other reviews).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIf you're looking for something like Metroid or Hollow Knight, this is not it.

As [i]Wums[/i] hold items on their heads he leaves a huge mess behind him! That's enough for the Wumhouse manager and our little hero is thrown out from his balcony! Out in the wilderness begins his search for a new home. And maybe he will even solve a few mysteries from the past and even save the world before an unexpected destruction.\n\n[i]Wuppo[/i] is a charming game full of funny characters and silly moments. Both hand-drawn graphics and catchy soundtrack suit the game well. Wearing items on your head is a great feature and I have enjoyed changing my appearance through the game. The items are also nicely varied (purely cosmetic, weapons, food, for stealth\u2026) and it was fun to try them out. Lore of the world is interesting and you can uncover it even more by collecting filmstrips which record the most important historic events, basic information about the world or some mysterious writings from the long forgotten past.\n\nGameplay wise it's a metroidvania. There are no basic enemies, except for some pests in one location, but the game is filled with a lot of bosses! Some of them are mandatory for a story progression, others are optional. Few of them are rather hard even on lower difficulty, but luckily there is no penalisation for dying, you just start the fight again. Playing on hardest was quite a challenge, but still fun.\n\nWhole game can be experienced in co-op as the second player can assume the role of our sidekick, a talkative bird Denksnavel. Sadly his possibilities are quite limited - he can fly around and attack (some of the enemies can't be hurt by him, but he can at least protect our [i]Wum[/i] by blocking some of the projectiles - that was pretty handy actually). And that\u2019s all for the second player. Also he is bound to us as there is no split screen and he can't leave the screen on his own. This part is lacking, it would be a lot more fun if there could be two [i]Wums[/i] together. Quite disappointing is the fact that your friend can't help you in Boss rush\u2026 yeah, I suck in it on my own.

"[h1]Introduction[/h1]\nWuppo: The Definitive Edition is a game developed by Knuist & Perzik and published by SOEDESCO. It was released on Sep 29th 2016, with first development footage (as found on the \u201cPerzik & Knuist\u201d channel) available all the way back in March 2013. The game follows a nameless protagonist, who\u2019s a \u201cwum\u201d, one of the many creatures inhabiting the colorful world of Wuppo. Thrown out of his house, he\u2019s thrust into the wild, to brave a perilous world of adventure and secrets galore.\nFor brevity\u2019s sake, here is a list of PROs and CONs, before the more long-form review:\n\n[h2]CONS[/h2]\n- A little obtuse sometimes (x)\n- Grindy coin farming\n- Some bosses are a little more hit or miss\n- Wait times (i.e. for the [spoiler]Popo Train[/spoiler], the [spoiler]Wondersplenk[/spoiler] rides and public transport in [spoiler]Popo City[/spoiler])\n- Length of passages (e.g. the bridge in [spoiler]Popo City[/spoiler])\n- Way too long sequences (e.g. performing a job that requires you to throw 150 newspapers onto different wums, [spoiler]Fnakball[/spoiler])\n\u2192 Exploring can (at times) be a bit boring and tedious\n\u2192 Kinda feels like the game is wasting your time/testing your patience at times\n- Weird sound mixing (particularly the sounds of one boss \u2013 [spoiler]Breevis[/spoiler], and hit sounds); brief, very loud distortion, when using fast travel\n- easy to skip too much dialogue, by trying to fast forward it, via LMB (using spacebar can mitigate this a bit)\n- game often starts minimized, and locks cursor in the top left corner of the screen, you have to fiddle around with Alt + Tab to get into the actual game\n- Lots of actions are slow or tedious (such as having to go through the menu every time to sell stuff)\n- Fast travel unlocks only shortly before the game\u2019s ending, and some locations still require quite a long trek to get to\n\n[h3]Minor:[/h3]\n- Some dialogue was off-screen a few times, i.e. the cutscene after the final boss fight, getting [spoiler]tourist info in Popo City[/spoiler]\n- You have to figure out where every fast travel point takes you on your own\n- Water is poisonous at fishing docks, even after clearing Kneft infestation (the rest of the water no longer hurts you)\n\n[h2]Neutral:[/h2]\n~ The base difficulty of the game is pretty easy\n\n[h2]PROS[/h2]\n+ Fantastic, unique visual style\n+ Awesome OST by Thomas de Waard\n+ A world that feels incredibly alive (lots of other characters, just walking around, quite a bit more populated than the usual game world)\n+ Enormous amount of attention to detail\n+ A particularly pleasant story, with imaginative twists and turns, which also happens to touch on some interesting topics, like self-actualization, predestination, division, friendship, the value we place on work (plus some other subtle political and philosophical topics)\n+ An unexpected amount of lore, and really great lore at that\n+ Really witty and well-written dialogue\n+ Fun secrets (though, refer to \u201cx\u201d)\n+ Some very interesting bosses and encounters (+ One super unique boss!)\n+ Combat is pretty fun, if very simple, for the most part\n+ Really great, miscellaneous mechanics, and sections utilizing different, sometimes one-off puzzle ideas\n+ Constant updates, very active and passionate dev team, adding new content every once in a while (though this may have ceased with the release of \u201cDefinitive Edition\u201d, I am unsure)\n\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\nWuppo is what you get, when someone has an idea in middle school about wanting to make an incredible game, from their childhood notebook full of doodles. It\u2019s a beautiful, tried and true method \u2014 tried, for one, by Eiichiro Oda, creator of the Manga \u201cOne Piece\u201d. In this way, Wuppo is also an exercise in love and authenticity. The art of the game is inspired, it lives and breathes and marches to the rhythm of its own heart. The score by Thomas de Waard is a diverse selection of pieces, all setting the stage for the equally idiosyncratic visuals, characters, environments and gameplay. It\u2019s a game full of laughs and comedy, and quickly, humorously, wittly resolved conflict, and yet, it still has interesting things to say, mayhap even teach. Brought to a point, Wuppo is an almost iconoclastic sweep into the often serious, dark and brooding artistic environment. It is jovial in a way, which can scarcely be likened to anything other than a Disney movie or Nintendo property.\nIt is a game I had my problems with, a myriad of them, as evident in the bullet points. Some of these problems are simple differences in philosophy (I\u2019ll elaborate in a moment) and others genuine problems I have with the flow of the game (and some smaller bugs, here and there). Chief among these issues, is a general sense of your time being wasted. There is an elevator to get into one of the main areas of the game, but, like all public transport throughout Wuppo, it works on an actual timer, making you wait multiple minutes, as you would in real life, to catch the elevator, and then making you sit in it, for quite a while longer, till you finally reach your desired destination. In the following area, called [spoiler]Popo City[/spoiler] you will find trams, these too, work on a timer, making you wait each time to cross a giant bridge in the center, or making you walk the bridge\u2019s length; a length that rivals the comedy of the infamous ladder of Metal Gear Solid 3 (at least I think it\u2019s 3, never played the games), but it only does so the first or second time you have to cross it. The shell shock of repeated tedium hits you soon enough.\nThese wait times have actually been explained by the developers in the Steam discussion forums [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/400630/discussions/0/350544272220383836/#c350544272221403914]here[/url]. To paraphrase briefly: [spoiler]Popo City[/spoiler] is meant as a cinematic setpiece, and riding to it for only a few seconds would be inconsistent with its image as a faraway place, thus causing ludo-narrative dissonance. The wait times for certain [spoiler]theme park attractions[/spoiler] are based off the developer\u2019s experiences of excitement, while waiting in line for a [spoiler]ride[/spoiler] in real life. The case they make is a fascinating one. Putting emphasis on wait times as a form of artistic expression is quite striking in video games, not unlike the deliberate use and exploration of silence in music (John Cage) or the study of negative spaces in art.\nThough I enjoyed what the developers attempted to do here, I still found myself, on the basic level of enjoying or not enjoying something, to be rather annoyed by this at times, and felt like my time was being wasted a little, and my patience tried. Similar feelings were evoked by some of the game\u2019s activities (e.g. jobs) and coin farming \u2014 which I felt could\u2019ve been streamlined much more \u2014 as well as other miscellaneous actions.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nNevertheless, going beyond the basic, knee-jerk responses I had, Wuppo was an incredible game, with amazing dialogue, a beautiful, eccentric world, with equally interesting characters and expansive lore, with an overall flair all around it; combat, which \u2014 while simplistic \u2014 somehow fits the \u201cmiddle school\" feeling I spoke of at the beginning of this review perfectly.\nWuppo is an effort of many years of hard work and love. As an artist, I may only tip the hat to  Knuist & Perzik, as well as everyone else who helped create this splendid piece of art. The game pushes the boundaries and experiments, and while I couldn\u2019t find it within myself to 100% it, for reasons of personal tedium and time constraints, I can recommend it beyond the shadow of a doubt. I feel it is always important to see what makes a piece of art special, and what the artists were trying to say, make you feel, create \u2014 going beyond the simple \u201clike\u201d/\u201ddislike\u201d paradigm. So despite my slightly mixed experience:\n\n[h3]Much Love To Knuist & Perzik \u2014 as well as SOEDESCO \u2014 For Sharing Their Beautiful Art With The World![/h3]", "timestamp_created": 1667419972, "timestamp_updated": 1682624633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671299159526824951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124127762": {"recommendationid": "124127762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057405014", "num_games_owned": 568, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 855, "last_played": 1666273649}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuppo is a 2D metroidvania with a charming visual style but unfortunately that is the only good thing about it. Game has minimum combat and character development as you could expect from a metroidvania. Instead it is focused on story, dialogs and quests. That is not a bad thing by itself but... story makes no sense at all, some random events happen one after another and none of them is actually interesting. Character are boring and dialogs never go farther than jokes and gags.\n\nGame has almost no common enemies and combat but it has plenty of bosses. Solid boss fights could compensate for a mediocre gameplay but most bosses are plain bad. Early game bosses are pathetically easy and basic while late game ones are hard for all the bad reasons including bad camera angles, poorly telegraphed attacks, lots of RNG etc.\n\nWuppo is not terrible but it is just boring to play. Nothing really happens, you do boring stuff for no reason and with no reward and keep doing it until it is (finally) finished.

You can visit shops to customize and dress up your protagonist and upgrade your tools or just buy useless silly things. It's light-hearted and fun, giving kind of a warm fuzzy feeling to the whole thing. It's almost a childlike wonderment.\n\nI honestly have had significant difficulty figuring out how best I want to summarize and review Wuppo and I think I have to give in and say: Wuppo is a fun warm and fuzzy game with some light platforming, a small but fun world to explore, and engaging experience. I finished it in roughly 6 hours and in that time I enjoyed every moment of the game. I only finished with around 57% of the game completed and having missed 5 of the optional bosses so if you're looking for even more it's there to be found.\n\nI sincerely with a smile on my face recommend Wuppo and cannot precisely pin down why.

I've played this game a couple of times and it is certainly one of my utmost favourites. A lot of times with games they're not as good the second time around, much less third and so on, however with Wuppo it's always seemed to be just as good every time I play it. There's a lot of awesome stuff about it, more than I could neatly fit into this review.\n\nFor starters, it features some of the best world-building I've ever seen. The places have a feel to them, a mood that is similar to how real life places sometimes have a mood, their own personality that you can feel. Plus the inhabitants of the world often have their own things they are doing, going about their business as if you were indeed just another stranger. All of the characters feel real and interesting in their own way, and everything you encounter makes sense to be there. Take for example bosses: a lot of times in games you may find a boss at some place and it makes sense why they are in that location, but not really why they are there at that time, or what they were doing before you got there, they just exist and you defeat them. In Wuppo all of the bosses contextually made sense and fit perfectly into the story, while also being engaging to fight. I just love how creative the game is, and how all of these great things together really make you feel a part of the world. \n\nThen there's the cute, endearing artstyle of the game. I haven't seen any games (apart from An Untitled Story) that feature a look like this. The way it is all wobbly and fuzzy and cute, I love it! Its broad selection of palettes brings joy to my heart. Also, I should mention that the funpack for this game has a Wuppo science video, and it is glorious.\n\nOn a different note, there is also the delightful soundtrack, which compliments the moods and events happening in the game, while also being great to listen to on its own. There are some particularly fresh tunes from the game's radio (because Wuppo has its very own radio station), which I listen to regularly. Speaking of nice sounds, one thing that really helps to sell the world of Wuppo is the ambience. Whether it's the sound of a tram leaving or just the local critters, having all that happening makes the world feel lively and rich, I love simply being in it.\n\nThe worst part about Wuppo is that I bought it on sale ;o; (         WHY!!?                           WHYYYYYYY?!!!!!). Do not make the same mistake as I did, dear reader; If the game is on sale, don't buy it, wait till it's full price.

The gameplay itself is passable, but just the variety of locations, and situations you get thrown into is fun. \nQuests can vary from a gladiator fight to saving cooks from their own creation to becoming a paper boy in a city to solving puzzles in a haunted ancient ruin to evicting uncooperative tenants to diving deep underwater to fight a sea monster. This game really goes places, it's a bit surreal thinking back at it all now. \n\nEspecially the first 5 mins of the game are hilarious, tho I felt the first half of the game was quite barren story wise but it picked up again later in the game. So you do need some patience with the game. \n\nThe races, lore, and even the origin story of the world are actually really consistent and encourage exploration and even theorycrafting. \n\nThe inventory is a clunk fest, especially the further you get in the game and the more items you carry. And the controller support has a bug where sometimes it just likes to shoot to the left randomly which is a shame cause otherwise it's perfectly controller friendly. So ye, gotta use Mouse and Keyboard. \n There's also so much to keep track off if you would want to 100% this game. There is no log for side quests and so keeping track of those is entirely up to the player and you are really bombarded with story from all sides sometimes it's very hard not to get overwhelmed. \nIt may be a Metroidvania but sometimes you're literally spending an hour in a town just talking to people ;D\nNot sure if the average Metroidvania fan appreciates that. But you can skip some NPCs and locations which is what I did, especially Wondersplenk.

Your experience on future versions may vary.[/u][/b]\n\n[h3][b][u]Short Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] An underrated metroidvania filled to the brim with content, though not always the best at guiding you through it all. With a great visual style, expansive soundtrack, and at least 7-8 hours of main story story content alone, it's well worth its $15 price tag even if you aren't pushing for 100% completion.\n\n[b][u]NOTE[/u]: This game comes with a bit of an [u]epilepsy warning[/u], as some sequences have rapid flashing visuals that cannot be disabled. For a detailed explanation, see below.[/b]\n\n[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Wuppo[/i] is a metroidvania game about a little 'Wum' who travels the world in search of a new home, and gets involved in a bunch of shenanigans along the way. [b]The game juggles a healthy mix of platforming, combat, and puzzle solving, and it balances it all very well[/b], making sure that none of these gameplay elements feel underdeveloped. Along with a decent-sized main story to run through, [b]the game is chock-full of secrets and side content[/b] to keep you busy, and nearly all of them provide a reward worth your time if you choose to pursue them. All of this is made more fun to run through thanks to the [b]wide range of colorful characters[/b] that populate the game, making sure every new area you visit provides you with a unique experience. Top things off with a [b]charming hand-drawn art style[/b] reminiscent of Paper Mario series, as well as a a [b]large and pleasant soundtrack[/b] throughout, and you've got a game that's almost certain to give you a good time.\n\nGood as it is, though, it's not without its problems. While being filled with content is certainly a positive thing, [i]Wuppo[/i] occasionally struggles to guide the player through it. [b]It doesn't always do the best job at steering you in the right direction[/b], both for secrets and story content, so you may find yourself running around in circles or consulting a walkthrough if you miss a stray piece of dialogue that hints at where to go next. Post-release patches have alleviated this issue somewhat (especially for completionists), but still doesn't always get it right, so don't blame yourself if you wind up getting stuck every once in a while. For those opting for 100% completion, also know that you'll almost definitely need to spend time grinding for money; and doing so is a slog no matter how you approach it, as even the fan-discovered money farming tricks still take a long time. It's not a huge issue, but [b]the need to grind for money made 100% completion drag in some parts more than I would have liked[/b].\n\nAt the start of this review, I said that [b]this games comes with an unofficial [u]epilepsy warning[/u][/b], as some parts of it involve sequences of bright, flashing lights and/or strobe effects that cover the entire screen and cannot be avoided or disabled during your playthrough. They don't always come with much warning before they happen, so I've outlined where in the game these take place, and what to look out for to signal that they're about to happen. Obviously, some spoilers ahead:\n[list]\n[*]Early game: [spoiler]The first major boss of the game is this giant stone idol, and its death animation--which occurs once he runs out of health and starts floating towards the center of the chamber--causes the screen to quickly flash white for a couple seconds.[/spoiler]\n\n[*]Late game: [spoiler]Once you reach the bottom of Redav Kned's Guest House, the underground ruins under Bliekopolis, you'll find an altar with five pedestals, and you need to place food on all five of them to activate it. Doing so summons a spirit with a very bright light and some minor strobe effects that slowly build in intensity for a bit. This sequence happens again a little later, albeit with a bit less intensity.[/spoiler]\n\n[*]Late game: [spoiler]After you summon the spirit a second time, it gives you something called a Warp Mask. Each use of the mask requires you to hold the Use button as a random sequence of symbols starts to strobe quickly across the screen. It's probably the least intense of the visuals here, but gets a warning just to be safe.[/spoiler]\n\n[*]Final boss: [spoiler]Just as the final boss fight is coming to an end, bright flickering lights will appear randomly across the screen as a character is summoned to deliver the final blow. The cutscene that follows contains an extremely intense sequence of bright flashing lights and strobe effects, bad enough that it could strain your eyes even if you aren't at risk of epileptic seizures. If you reach this point and you are at risk, fight normally until the last bubble of light (next to the boss's health) begins to drain--the music will pick up in intensity and you'll notice flickering lights come into view once the sequence is starting. Eat a health item if you can (as the boss will keep firing), then look away from the screen and keep pushing the A button until the white noise that accompanies the cutscene stops and the game goes near silent.[/spoiler]\n[/list]\nThis isn't an exhaustive list of \"epilepsy warning\" sequences, just ones that caught my eye while I was playing, so feel free to let me know if I missed anything. These aren't something that would make me tell people to avoid this game altogether, but they should come with some kind of in-game warning beforehand, or means to disable the effects altogether.\n\nFor my save file on normal difficulty, [b]it took me about 7 hours to beat the main story, and another 6-7 hours to reach 100% file completion[/b]--and that's not including the time I could spend beating the game on harder difficulties or the Boss Run mode you unlock in the post-game. While the game had its ups and downs, I found myself enjoying the game much more often than not. [b][u][i]Wuppo[/i] is an overall charming game that's packed with content, and it's well worth the $15 price tag for how much you can get out of it.[/u][/b] What Knuist & Perzik made could certainly be considered an underrated gem, and I hope that time will bring more deserved recognition to this game as well as their future endeavors.\n\n[quote]For more game reviews, check out my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42524563/]Curator page[/url]![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1640995786, "timestamp_updated": 1656104887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571676313877105713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106918792": {"recommendationid": "106918792", "author": {"steamid": "76561199148204253", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1695269885}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuppo is an actual masterpiece.

It has great art style, amazing music, fun worldbuilding and writing. But that's not why I'm recommending it. I'm doing that because this game triggered some kind of mystical revelation within me.\n\nLet me try to explain why. The game's setting, characters, music, and the combination thereof create this very strong feeling of being in a living, breathing world. Getting lost in Popo City, waiting at the train station, lazing about in the Wumhouse. This is not a game board that exists for you to play in, it's a world that you just happen to be a part of. And this is a world that welcomes you, that loves you - even if you disagree sometimes.\n\nIt's a very optimistic game. There are conflicts, there is danger, but in the end the game whispers \"it will all be okay\" into your ear - and you believe it. \n\nEverything else, the gameplay, the plot, they're all just means with which the game conveys its optimism. As such, they almost tend to blend in. That's a good thing, though - it 'flows', so you never have those 'oh, it's a game' moments. Which is all we can ask for, really. If you ever played Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, you probably have an idea what I'm talking about, except it's much stronger here.\n\nOh, and before I played this, I was roughly aware of this game and it seemed generic and uninteresting (wacky funny creatures? yaaawn). I was so, so wrong. I implore you: do not make the same mistake as I did. Play Wuppo. It will change your life.

This game is relentlessly enjoyable with some of the funniest, most memorable characters I\u2019ve ever seen in a game brought to life by the whimsical and endearing art style and amazing soundtrack which gave every area a distinct atmosphere and mood. This is the most I\u2019ve been invested in an indie game\u2019s world since Hollow Knight and the number of details in the world is stupidly high like a real-time transportation system and unique dialogue based on when you encounter them. It progresses like a mix of a Metroidvania and a classic JRPG with a heavy emphasis on environmental puzzles, dialogue, exploration, and bullet hell boss battles. Due to this variety this game\u2019s main quest never really gets old and the pacing is pretty damn good as a result. Exploration is encouraged with the vast amount of side quests, bosses, and collectibles with a great progression system and almost perfectly designed economy with Popocity being the location where the stars align with great exploration, puzzles, bosses, and dialogue. This is honestly such an amazing game and one of the best indies I\u2019ve ever played, while it does have some polishing missteps, they are pretty negligible and it doesn't drag the game down. I never would have bought this game in a million years if not for a very special recommendation from someone so I\u2019m telling you now that you should play this game, it already holds such a special place in my heart and is one of my favorite games and probably the funniest game I\u2019ve ever played. \n", "timestamp_created": 1636652055, "timestamp_updated": 1636652055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581909358501434326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102599820": {"recommendationid": "102599820", "author": {"steamid": "76561199033951471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 862, "last_played": 1697674140}, "language": "english", "review": "circle plus gun = yes", "timestamp_created": 1636650838, "timestamp_updated": 1636650838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102583578": {"recommendationid": "102583578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996690770", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 203, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 605, "last_played": 1636628246}, "language": "english", "review": "ok i had this game as a meme but its actually very good i fuckin love wuppo", "timestamp_created": 1636628270, "timestamp_updated": 1636628270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102403525": {"recommendationid": "102403525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099842150", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 415, "last_played": 1636315006}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

It really gives me the feeling of blending in and being one of the community of this wonderful Wuppo world.\n[*] Tons of heartwarming/funny side quests/dialogues/interaction with the NPCs.\n[*] Tons of save points, especially before and after each boss or difficult-to-get places.\n[*] Filmstrips spread throughout the map tell a coherent and vivid background story of the Wuppo world.\n[*] You need to queue up for [spoiler]theme park (the Wondersplenk) attractions and entrance to the city (the Popocity)[/spoiler]. You also need to wait for [spoiler]trains, trams, and the fall of night for certain quests[/spoiler]. I know lots of players hate this, but I find  it a nice touch since it makes the Wuppo world feel even more immersive.\n[*] No missable collectibles/locations/achievements.\n[/list]\n\nWhat I don't like or even hate about this game:\n[list]\n[*] Certain locations or collectibles require performing precision platform actions. This makes the game less casual than it should be.\n[*] Boss fights are not very interesting, especially the final one.\n[*] The first (the Wumgarden) and the last final location (the Sinkhole) are quite boring to explore.\n[*] The final puzzle [spoiler](Redav Kned's Guesthouse)[/spoiler] is notoriously difficult. It is mostly nonsensical and is supposed (according to the devs) to be solved by trial and error.\n[*] The game does not give enough guidance on how to progress. You have to explore every nook of a location and interact with each NPC to have a clearer idea on what's going on and what the game needs you to do. I have to frequently rely on guides and walkthrough.\n[*] Some achievements requires farming or RNG events and therefore are really grinding to get.\n[*] The game does not display correctly when you change resolution.\n[/list]\n\nTo be honest, I almost rage-quit and refund the game at the beginning when I wander in a mostly empty location (the Wumgarden), jumping up and down in the jungle, avoiding thorns and dying a couple of times without meeting a new NPC. Consider that I got the game 92% off, I decide to keep it and to press on. Well, my effort pays off when the game just gets better and better after the garden. The story and the world progressively unfold and the game becomes really intriguing.\n\nOverall, I do not regret the dozen of hours I spent on this game and I strongly recommend it to other players Just a little caveat: do not expect to rush through this game, otherwise you cannot reap any pleasure from it. This game certainly has a similar vibe to A Short Hike, another great casual exploration & adventure game.

A messy wum. You get kicked out of your apartment because you're a messy goon. You then spend the first quarter of the game attempting to get back into your apartment. I'm not going to bother describing anything else that happens in the game because it's simply too difficult to describe what's happening in this game.\n\nWhere Wuppo excels is that it is an incredibly unique/creative game. It's cute and charming. The boss fights are well done. Dialogue ranges from well done and humorous to slow and plodding... which also describes the pacing of the game. You're going to be exploring for most of it and having no idea what's going on or what you're doing.\n\nWuppo's main issue is that it was designed poorly. The menus are a hassle. The controls are a bit awkward as well but you get used to them over time and they're not terrible, just awkward. \n\nThe game has a map you can pull up to get around, but it's not particularly helpful in helping you navigate a lot of the time since rooms don't show where they connect. There's also no quick travel points... until you get to the very end of the game just before the final boss. This isn't a big deal as you don't need to backtrack very often, but it's weird that they threw in a quick travel system but don't give you access to it until the very end of the game.\n\nThe game has puzzles and there are a couple that are obscure for no real reason. They're not hard, simply placing objects on pedestals, but they're needlessly cryptic. \n\nI see some people complain about parts with waiting and while that might be bad if true, there's only one part you actually have to wait and sit around. That's for a train that takes you underground. Once you go underground, you don't need to come back up. So it's one segment and there's even a clock showing you when it's going to arrive so you can go off and do something else until it shows up, which isn't that long in the first place. I don't remember there being any other part in the game that requires waiting around. Every other part with waiting, such as getting in lines at the theme park, are 100% optional.\n\nWuppo is above average to good. It basically boils down to this. If you're looking for something unique, this is it.

At first I thought: \"No no no! Even I have some standards, I might be playing crap every other day but I'm still not going to play that!\". But somehow, I managed to go against that impulse and give it a try, and boy was I right to do so.\nFunny absurd humor, unique art style, good gameplay, daunting challenges, this game has it all. It's by no mean a masterpiece, but man is it good.\nThis game is a very unique blend of what I'd call point-and-click-style exploration and humor with tight and challenging boss fights. The art style and the absurd humor make me feel nostalgic as they remind me of my childhood flash and RPG maker games. Like Shadow of the Colossus, the bosses are basically the only action part of the game, and here, they come as a reward, or a sort of break from the other half of the game, the world's exploration.\nAnyway.

The problem is that this game has some really big fundamental problems that keep me from recommending this game even to the most hardcore metroidvania fans. \n\n1. No in-game map: In my opinion, every metroidvania game MUST have an fully integrated in-game map of some kind, because one of the main ideas of metroidvania is to open new areas with different skills and items, which then takes the player forward in the game and makes the player stronger as the player is progressing in the game. In addition, metroidvania games usually contain a very large area / map where player then progresses. Because of this, other metroidvania games (even the more older metroidvania games) have a in-game navigation map that tells you where to go roughly. In this game, though, it\u2019s very hard to understand where you must go to, what this object does, what area I\u2019m in, and so on. This then leads to situations where you have to travel around a large area several times without being sure where to go and what places I\u2019ve already explored. In the Ori game series this was done well, as one had to understand the ways to get somewhere, but players were given the opportunity to use the map and navigate through it. Ori also has a really nice navigation system which tells the player where to go next (roughly). This may sound like a minor problem but trust me, this aspect can completely ruins otherwise really great metroidvania games when the player is frustrated with a very poor navigation mechanics.\n\n2. map design: The next very annoying side of the game is that sometimes it is very difficult to understand which object a player can jump to and which objects are so to speak \"transparent\", i.e. which are only part of the background. For example, in Ori games, it was very easy to understand which objects were available to the player and which platform to jump to. The game is also not helped by the fact that the objects used in the game blend into the background too well because of the art style that the game developers have taken for this game. This doesn't sound like a really big problem at first, but later in the game this becomes VERY problematic for the player. This is after all a metroidvania PLATFORMER. \n\nIf these aspects had been fixed times ago, then I think this might be a really good game full of personality. Unfortunately, I have to say that this is not a very good platformer nor is it a good metroidvania game. For these reasons I do not recommend this game in a current state.", "timestamp_created": 1627483404, "timestamp_updated": 1627485815, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428571432828903198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96347625": {"recommendationid": "96347625", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981700493", "num_games_owned": 1448, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1627218164}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun metroidvania game", "timestamp_created": 1627218245, "timestamp_updated": 1627218245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96219245": {"recommendationid": "96219245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024340430", "num_games_owned": 1968, "num_reviews": 6499, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1627014507}, "language": "english", "review": "GOTHAM CITY IMPOSTERS IS STILL A GOOD GAME IN 2021 CAW CAW \n\nIT'S LIKE QUAKE CHAMPIONS WITHOUT THE LIZARD DUDE CAW CAW", "timestamp_created": 1627014545, "timestamp_updated": 1627014545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.258706450462341309", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96020507": {"recommendationid": "96020507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050533155", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 904, "last_played": 1570367336}, "language": "english", "review": "this is genuinely the best game I have ever played in my life and I can't quite explain why", "timestamp_created": 1626704577, "timestamp_updated": 1626704577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96020499": {"recommendationid": "96020499", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085992665", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 779, "last_played": 1634200688}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay is nice\nGraphic is not bad good looking pixel art style\nstory is nice\nBoss fight is super good\nplot twist are not bad\nhighly recommend \n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1626704570, "timestamp_updated": 1626704570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95874229": {"recommendationid": "95874229", "author": {"steamid": "76561199111349050", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1206, "last_played": 1681600517}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy Wuppo", "timestamp_created": 1626486116, "timestamp_updated": 1626486116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662961125373840332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95779201": {"recommendationid": "95779201", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969062133", "num_games_owned": 2051, "num_reviews": 1210, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1626349801}, "language": "english", "review": "A 2D platformer and exploration game where you play a cute little blob creature in a world full of cute blob and non-blob creatures with quirky dialogue.

Eh, it\u2019s okay I guess.\n\nWuppo is an extremely cute, satirical, side-scrolling adventure game featuring platform jumping puzzles, boss fights, some simple character dialogue options and a few frustratingly obtuse puzzles. While initially charming, Wuppo loses its sense of fun exploration once you leave the area known as Popo City, roughly 2/3rds of the way into the game. Wuppo\u2019s final segment feels increasingly obtuse as you attempt to solve an increasing number of puzzles which lack detailed dialogue informing you where to go, what to do or even what your objectives are until after the puzzles are complete. As a result, I found myself frequently consulting a walkthrough guide (Wonderful Walkthrough of Wuppo by TemmieNeko) to help me figure out how to finish, what I had initially assumed would be a far less conventional and less obtuse game. \n\nAfter watching Wuppo\u2019s previews I had thought I was getting into a sort of slice-of-life, open-world Stardew Valley (except with no farming) side-scroller about a cute thing looking for a new home in a strange city (and maybe dealing with some of the social issues in that city) which might wind up taking a hundred hours or so to play through. Wuppo is actually much shorter (roughly 11 hours) and far more conventional than that, encouraging you to progress through the game in a largely linear fashion, fighting one boss after another before going on the next big area. \n\nTo its credit Wuppo does try to include a few open-world gameplay elements here and there (like getting a job delivering newspapers in the city or doing a few simple fetch quests) but they never end up feeling very deep or even entirely finished. Wuppo does deliver an interesting, often bizarre but still fun, heartfelt story though. It also mentions issues such as racial/historical prejudice and even a little about environmentalism but again these topics are almost never thoroughly explored. Altogether, Wuppo is 2/3rds fun and 1/3rd frustration making it not a truly great game but merely okay. \n\n+Highly responsive controls which worked well with my keyboard and mouse. Movement controls are handled well with the keyboard and aiming and shooting is handled easily with the mouse.\n\n+Interesting music with some nice music scattered here and there unexpectedly. The Definitive edition gives you 2 soundtracks (located in the game\u2019s steam folder which it installed to) which, when combined give you every song in the entire game.\n\n+Nice sounds. Every single sound has a particular meaning and is useful. The sounds do not become irritating.\n\n+Nice plot with a nice, though pretty \u201cfar out there\u201d ending. \n\n+Platform jumping puzzles never get too frustrating.\n\n+Good satire of what crowded amusement parks are usually like.\n\n+Good satire of what crowded cities are usually like.\n\n+Good satire in general.\n\n+No errors or bugs that I noticed.\n\n+Several difficultly levels increase replay value.\n\n+Lots of side/unnecessary things to do in this game (like go on rides in the amusement park or be on a TV game show) also help increase replay value.\n\n+/-The plot becomes increasingly bizarre and \u201cfar out.\u201d It really goes off the deep end eventually when it starts referring to alternate worlds. However the plot points also become increasingly irrelevant.\n\n+/-Should I really have to wait 5 real-world minutes for the Popo City train to arrive?! Though the nearby amusement park was a nice touch.\n\n+/-This game looks like its intended for kids but I don\u2019t think it actually is. At least, it\u2019s definitely not ONLY for kids. \n\n+/-Lots of text-bubble dialogue, much of it quite cute. Unfortunately, the game gives you no useful or real choices to make in the dialogue which have much of an effect on how the game progresses.\n\n-Some really confusing puzzles which might be too complicated/frustrating for kids especially towards the end of the game. A few areas where you have to jump off the screen and onto a platform on the next screen.\n\n-By the final third of the game (after you leave Popo City) you stop receiving detailed instructions on what to do, where to go or what is needed to solve critical puzzles to advance the plot. You are quite suddenly left to fend for yourself in the deep end of the pool after having had your hand held up to that point (with one exception early in the game). The puzzles also suddenly become much harder to figure out.\n\n-You can blow your character\u2019s money on items to make your character look even cuter (but they don\u2019t actually help you in any way) but you can\u2019t sell them back to shops. The descriptions of some of these items make it sound as though they would actually be useful for your character to have when, in fact, having them makes no actual difference.\n\n-Only one alternate bad ending which you can get only by doing something monumentally stupid while characters urge you not to do it. The game\u2019s main ending (Which comes from defeating the game\u2019s final boss) cannot be changed or altered through your actions or dialogue options up to that point.

The bosses are inventive and sometimes challenging (on easy, admittedly). The storyline is fun, as our protagonist learns (or doesn't learn) to be less of a jerk to others as he explores the world. The worldbuilding is sufficient and fun. The collectibles and minigames and dialogs are fun. It all comes together so enjoyably.\n\nI can tell this was a work of love, with plenty of detail I have yet to see, despite being the sort of player who reads all the dialog and investigates all the crannies. (For one thing, there are still four bosses for me to find . . . and I haven't bought the plot items to find out what they do either . . .)\n\nThat said, this is not a game to be sped through, so if you have a pile of fifty unplayed games waiting for your attention you might want to wait on this.

Adding a fast forward wouldn't have hurt and would have saved a lot of time in the long run, the fighting was really fun and helping Wum's out was pretty cool too but I can't help but feel like this game wasn't explained very well, I had to look up a few parts of the game to see where to go or what to do. The story is very bland at best apart from a few chuckle moments, I didn't know what the heck I was doing half the time. Above all else was the dialog, it's broken to what I can see and can't be enjoyed without it.\nTotal Score = 38/100.\n\nSIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:\nHollow Knight.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nWuppo is a two man passion project, with hand-drawn visuals, animations, music, sounds and a huge world to explore.

It is a weird experience for sure.\n\nOnly thing that is annoying would be the screen transitions. If you jump out on the left you come back in with the same speed and hight on the right on the next screen... which can you have running into a pit and fall down again. Or sometimes you have to do blind jumps between screens to reach a platform. \n\nOverall a very unique and weird game.", "timestamp_created": 1596372237, "timestamp_updated": 1596372237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525316417217254639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73546302": {"recommendationid": "73546302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202958064", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 1832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1832, "last_played": 1595652640}, "language": "english", "review": "Play it on hard or higher, get kraaaanked on the megakrank, release the totally innocent prisoners and swim with some kneft!

Other than getting kicked out of my apartment for spilling ice cream on the floor and having to flop around through little side quests as I try to find a new place to live, I don't see a plot or a reason to care. There's a lot of world \"fluff,\" meaning the world looks bigger than it actually is (some places are there for the sole purpose of making it look bigger and not adding any challenge or obstacle to the game, such as random empty rooms, large open spaces you have to walk across, so on and so forth).\n\nI feel like you'd only get your money's worth if you went for all or most of the achievements. They're what make you explore everything, try all the pointless mini-games, find all the bosses, so on and so forth, but it's not enough motivation for me when the game just isn't fun. Plot-wise and mechanics-wise.\n\nAdd to that the few bugs I've encountered, such as the game lagging when I click on a dialogue option and my Wum literally sitting there, sometimes for an entire minute, with the dialogue option I chose frozen in place and no one doing anything. I have to keep resetting to get it up to speed (that or sit there for an entire minute just so my Wum can say, \"Okay!\" to someone, which no thank you). And one time I got stuck in a pipe because the game brought me in through the floor and I had to reset.\n\nI just can't look a friend in the eye and legitimately say, \"Yes, you should try this game.\" So I won't to any of you, either.

There are tonnes of npcs jumping around and moving, making most places feel really cluttered, there are tonnes of vendors and stores selling a lot of stuff, but most of it is fluff or pieces of flavor, which doesn't detract that much but gives you an impression that the city is kind of a waste of time.\n\nThis is compounded by the day/night system where you have to wait for certain events and the general pacing of the game. It suffers from JRPG syndrome where the best way forward is just talking to EVERYONE until it becomes clear what to do, which means a LOT of text and although well written, it starts to wear on you. Then the city section of the game has you doing sidequests to build up \"credit\" in order to improve the city, meaning tonnes of mini quests that pad the already short playtime.\n\nWhich is a shame because the game starts out fairly action heavy with motivation to find a new home, then starts to meander in a large world with many little distractions and oddities, becoming a sort of generic JRPG with reams of text and waiting in the effort of \"immersion\".\n\nThe combat is also fairly shallow but entertaining, working as a sidescrolling shooter, but with limited customization and basic dodge/shoot encounters. The main criticism is that the gameplay is good, but there is far too much walking around in cities/populated areas and listening to dialog that brings the pace to a crawl.\n\nIt reminds me of Paper Mario but with poor pacing, no combat system and about 4x the NPCS.

The music is also way better than it should be. So in terms of aesthetic, this game gets a 10/10.\n\nThe story is very compelling. I don't want to spoil anything in this so I will not. But there is a lot of lore, and a lot of depth in  the story. The story is a 10/10 for me.\n\nThe gameplay is not difficult to understand. Anyone can start up this game and play it. If you are an experienced \"gamer\" then this game has a lot of different difficulties to challenge you. The platforming is not hard either, no where near Super Meat Boy levels, so you don't need to worry about raging towards the platforming. The bosses aren't too hard. I would probably give the gameplay an 8/10, very good.\n\nThe characters are unbelievably lively. Every single character you interact with feels real and genuine. This game rewards you when you interact with characters, but I wasn't trying to find every character and filmstrip due to a reward, I was doing it because I wanted to, because it was super fun learning about this world and the wums, blussers, fnakkers, and splenkknackers. Characters get a 13/10.\n\nLiterally the only thing I would change about this game is for there to be a little epilogue where you can actually be in the world that was described in the credits. And I am well aware of how big of an ask that is. Basically, I wish I could continue playing this game forever!!\n\nSeriously, this game is great!!!

It put a big dumb smile on my ace and always put me in a good mood. :)\n\nIt wasn't without its flaws however. Keep in mind this is an indy game made by two guys.\n\nPros:\n-Really colorful artstyle that's very cute (think Paper Mario)\n-Well developped world building which sets up expectations, then defies them in clever ways\n-Really big, impressive bosses that often appear out of nowhere and move with gusto\n-Puzzles that are pretty easy to figure out but satisfying. Your 8-year old probably could no problem.\n-A ton of optional surprises, secrets, side-activities, minigames & bosses along the way.\n-Really strange characters/enemies that make you go wtf (as intended)(this game's artist has a peculiar obsession with lips)\n-Fast travel unlocked late in the game which lets you find some neat stuff you may have missed or some new things.\n-Plenty of items to find, buy, sell, collect and play around with, which will satisfy the collector player.\n-Though simple, the world has a lot of lore & history, which can discovered and your knowledge of it can be put to the test in an actually really fun quiz minigame (think Paper Mario x100).\n-The game may seem directed only to kids, but there is some surprisingly mature, witty and smart banter.\n\nCons:\n-Waiting. There's a lot of waiting for things, for the sake of immersion I guess? This would be fine if there was an item to speed up time, but there isn't!\n-Bosses are quite intimidating the first time around, but aren't all that fun to fight more than once.\n-Due to previous point I wasn't interested in the Boss Rush mode.\n-Train didn't show up in Popo City. Bug? This was exacerbated by the waiting.\n-The rides in theme park were VERY underwhelming. Again, exacerbated by waiting in line (yes, you literally wait in line for a while for them to finish the ride).\n-Some important secrets are a little too obscure to figure out, to the point I had to seek info online. This is true for one strong powerup in particular.\n-There is a TON of items with no use apart from being esthetic. Especially the hats. This is almost a crime. There so many times I talked to someone with a hat (talking to an NPC with a disguise) but got no reaction. Not to mention the cost of said hat. Just a waste. Now, there are SOME reactions (namely those required for the main story), but this should have been much more developped.\n-Non-boss enemies are never more than an inconvenience or an annoyance, or ally with you. Even on hard combat is never challenging.\n\nBottom-line:\nI think this game is great for anyone, regardless of age. It's very impressive for a two-man team to have built such a neat and creative world.\nIf you're a fan of Paper Mario, you'll probably love this, too.\nI feel like all the cons I mentioned could have been remedied.

It doesn\u2019t have a lot that makes it stand out, but it's a fun experience nonetheless. \n\n*Overall Star Verdict is calculated by finding the mean of the seven different categories; that is, adding them all up and dividing them by the amount (7) to calculate the Verdict. Generally, the initial Verdict will be rounded up for the final one.\n\nWuppo is about a tiny journey of a little creature known as a Wum who got kicked out of his apartment for spilling ice cream throughout the hallway. Clearly, the game isn\u2019t very serious. Instead, it\u2019s a fun, cute yet utterly short and puzzle filled adventure. It\u2019s a bit like Cuphead in the sense that it has a high emphasis on boss fights, minus the extreme difficulty. The game is almost entirely linear, with little choice in how the story progresses. Even if you don\u2019t do certain events you don\u2019t miss out on much. Still, you\u2019ll get around 20 or 25 hours out of this game for your first playthrough, depending on your competency in puzzle solving. There are other difficulty options for playthroughs, but again there is little reason to replay the entire game again on a higher setting. At that point everything has been seen and nothing new will really come from it. I suppose if you enjoy achievement hunting then you might spend a lot more time into this game. \n\nThere\u2019s kind of a second gamemode in Wuppo called \u201cBoss Rush.\u201d As the name suggests, you have to beat all the bosses in one life and get very few items along the way. This again has its own difficulty settings, and they are considerably harder than the default game just due to how little healing you can get. It\u2019s a lot of trial and error to try and do it right. Again, this might be perfect for achievement hunters. \n\nThis game does have a co-op feature.

And even if not give it a try even if sidescroilling shooters aren't quite your favorite thing. As I am sure you can find something cool to take away from this unique quirky gem. \n\n Okay so here we go, this game is going to be something you DEFINITELY want to play as long as you like side scrolling cursor shooters. And if you don't I would still recommend it if you are open to that game type because Wuppo all be it a very comedic game and doesn't take itself serious it is still such a new experience. There are so many facets to the gameplay beyond just a sidescrolling shooter. It honestly surprised me with it's nuances, details, and little curve balls it throws at you through the story. It is a fun and worthwhile experience, and granted I feel I might talking it up too much right now cause really it is an indie game. But I personally love indie games and this thrilled my socks right off my feet. And those are definitely my favorite things that have really gotten my attention so far.\n\n The Base story isn't much really but the adventure it takes you on is where it really shines. The world feels so lush, active, and alive despite the fact that it's all 2D. The characters are fun and even at times you will find yourself kind of attached to some of them. And the places the adventure goes will really surprise you if you are used to expectable linear stories. Granted this game is linear as well but it feels different in the places it takes you places that I personally didn't quite expect. And the sarcastic goofy atmosphere just adds to it. Even only 5 hours in I am so enthused on this game and have yet to finish it even. And the combat is fun and dynamic depending on how you play and what you use. \n\nOVERALL if you want a game that can give you a a light enjoyable experience and throw you some curve balls. Even give you a break from a lot of the same old same old of game progression with a good difficulty incline and a fun story. Then definitely dig right in ya hungry soul. And even if you aren't a fan of the genre I still say give it a try if you want something different to really refresh your palette cause I am sure there is something you can enjoy and take from this game. \n\nThe score I would give it is an absolute 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1591597644, "timestamp_updated": 1591597644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70456597": {"recommendationid": "70456597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307522846", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1247, "last_played": 1637785825}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable, and all around good game.", "timestamp_created": 1591559223, "timestamp_updated": 1637770869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70305243": {"recommendationid": "70305243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121977676", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 555, "last_played": 1591307771}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Wuppo es un juego muy creativo, muy vivo, (en ciertas partes), que te hacen sentir en un mundo real, en donde no eres m\u00e1s que otro Wum del mundo.

The quaint art style, the lovable characters, and the surprisingly deep world all come together to make [i]Wuppo[/i] a sleeper-hit.\n\n[h1]Of Bluss & Wum[/h1]\nThe crowning achievement of [i]Wuppo[/i], is the game's ability to organically let the player discover the world. And what a world there is to discover! For a game with an incredibly small \"map\" to physically explore, [i]Wuppo[/i] instead packs all of the detail into the NPCs the player interacts with. NPCs aren't just filler, they have emotions, goals, and story-lines of their own. The genius of [i]Wuppo[/i] is that the game gives players a reason to discover this world: to discover [b]Happiness[/b]. By making NPCs happy, your Wum's heart also grows and in-turn makes you hardier. This sort of incentive for the players to interact and [b]really[/b] have a dialogue with the NPCs never feels shoehorned in and is a great example of the organic world-building I mentioned earlier.\n\nLooking past what's in the game, it's also good to note how much is achieved with the resources given. [i]Wuppo[/i] isn't an expansive game but there's no lack of things happening. It doesn't try to put in a ton of unnecessary weapons and crafting and collectibles to beef up the content cause the game knows what it has is good enough. The first weapon you're given, the Gumgumgun, is pretty much the only weapon you'll use throughout the game; players can buy very minimal upgrades to attach to their Gumgumgun, but that's really the extent of the crafting system; and the only collectible in the game, [b]Filmstrips[/b], aren't just shiny doodads, but are utilitarian in that they provide a lot of narrative. [i]Wuppo[/i] doesn't try to impress by delivery a ton of half-baked ideas, but instead keeps what it serves lean, but well-polished.\n\n[h1]Breakdown[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[olist]\n    [*][b]Squigglenautic:[/b] The art and music of the game never overshadows the gameplay, but complements it perfectly. Certain aesthetics of the game does feel strange, but the purposefully janky graphics never feels like a negative.\n    [*][b]Positive Reinforcement:[/b] One of the most important ways we see [i]Wuppo[/i] reward exploration is that save points are literally everywhere. You're rewarded with going outside the lines and searching the nooks and crannies, but if you make a mistake, you can reset without punishment or significant loss of progress.\n[/olist]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[olist]\n    [*][b]Real-Time Travel:[/b] This is ultimately a minor quibble, but having to wait for the trains and trams in real-time was a tiny bit annoying.\n    [*][b]I'm Just a Poor Boy:[/b] The currency in the game, [b]Smurt[/b] is a bit hard to come by. While it's understandable to limit the amount you get before you go to Popocity (so players don't just buy a ticket and bypass exploring the Wumhouse), after you reach Popocity, it's really a bit of an unnecessary slog to farm for Smurt afterwards.\n[/olist]\n\n[b]Score:[/b] 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1587852842, "timestamp_updated": 1604859150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68006722": {"recommendationid": "68006722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198960273465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 602, "last_played": 1676579382}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an extremely unnoticed game, everything about this slaps. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1587833577, "timestamp_updated": 1587833577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578742146492004395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67796042": {"recommendationid": "67796042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198223142564", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 369, "last_played": 1587580047}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game. good story. better than most games.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1587530773, "timestamp_updated": 1587530773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489018529653549194", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67766262": {"recommendationid": "67766262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062069924", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1844, "last_played": 1635439944}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really good and fun indie platform/puzzle style game (and you are a blob).

The boss run difficulty exponentially increases from Easy -> Normal, Normal -> Hard, Hard -> Insane (this is really insane!).

As a game, though, it feels like a lot of loose ends that all lead somewhere else but none of them are quite finished.\n\nOne issue lies in the open-ended design of the game; at any given moment, there is a plethora of stuff you can do and several places you can go to. There is a \"main quest\" of sorts, but it is not really definitive and as such the game feels a little bit directionless. You can gather filmstrips and watch them for money, interact with other tribes and listen to some funny dialogue, all with the end goal of finding a new home in the big city. You are essentially solving a bunch of side quests and helping people with that goal in mind, as well as increasing your happiness (health). \n\nIt is all well and good, but then there are problems. There is a ton of stuff you can buy, all of which seems to enable small side quests or different dialogue or upgrade your weapons, but there are not enough ways to earn money; I have rarely seen a game with currency this sparse, and I was watching film clips and solving quests as much as I could. There are a lot of bosses, but none of them feel very creative in their mechanics and some are downright cheap or annoying. The fighting mechanics in this game are also a bit clunky (you have different guns you can aim and shoot) and the difficulties are just balanced by making the enemies do tons of damage the higher you go, killing you in three to four hits on the highest difficulty on bosses that can take over 5 minutes to defeat. The game also forces you to wait up to 5 minutes periodically for trains or other in game events.\n\nIt is a charming and witty game, but the *game* part just felt very disjointed to me. Once I arrived in the PoPo City and got essentially 5 different tasks to help people out, none of which were explained very well (how do I get newspapers to give to people? Where do I have to go to solve the factory puzzle?) I kind of gave up. Whenever the game gives you a task, you are expected to figure out how it works - which sometimes works, and sometimes it doesnt. I have no problem with such games (Dark Souls is a good example of a directionless game done right), but the weak mechanics and flimsy platforming as well as the unbalanced difficulty and huge lack of direction in both design and gameplay turned me off in the end.\n\nLong story short, it is a charming and witty game with an interesting and cool world to dive into for a little bit - that is definitely the huge strength of the game. Sadly, the actual active *game* part lacks direction and solidity, and was just not a lot of fun to me.

The way there was so much extra dialogue and so many extra choices (that ultimately still lead to the same conclusion but just offered a different path to get there) were nice. Those really made the game feel much bigger than it actually was. The story was good as well. It concluded a bit weak in my opinion at the very end, almost like the developers wanted to wrap things up quickly, but that is such a small part of it that it didn't really do any harm, just a little sad.

Emphasis on \"hidden\" because even though it's got \"overwhelmingly positive\" reviews, I see and hear almost no one talk about. I stumbled upon it by complete accident while browsing metroidvania games. People say that this is is \"two man passion project\", and seeing the amount of work and creativity that was put into this game, I can totally get behind that.\n\nThe gameplay is actually pretty simple. You control a little marshmellow spider guy called a \"Wum\" and you basically platform around, solve puzzles, and occasionally fight stuff. Like most metroidvanias, exploration is very rewarding, with lots of secrets, items, and little bonuses stuffed into every nook and cranny. But unlike most metroidvanias, backtracking won't be something you'll find yourself doing a whole lot. As the story progresses, you'll be traveling from location to location, constantly moving forward. You do get new abilities in the form of new items to let you progress, but while they can sometimes help you explore areas that were previously blocked off, it's by no means a requirement. It's mainly again for advancing the story and moving forward. I don't see this as a bad thing, in fact, considering that fast travel is only available SUPER late in the game, it was a smart decision to encourage exploration without making a requirement. As for the controls, they feel smooth and responsive, just the way I like it. It may take you a bit to get used to the control scheme, but that's hardly a complaint. This game is pretty easy overall, the main challenge comes from the bosses and figuring out what to do. I occasionally found myself overthinking a puzzle during my playthrough, only to realize the very simple and honestly somewhat obvious solution. The game can have those \"What am I supposed to do now?\" moments, but try not to overthink them, as hints on what to do are plentiful and will point in the right direction. The bosses on the other hand are hard because of their hard to dodge attack patterns. There aren't many moments where the boss will present itself to be hit, meaning you have to blast away at them while simultaneously dodging their attacks. Almost like a bullet hell when you think about it. But like the core gameplay, they're simple, and it's not too hard to figure out what attacks do what before you get it down. You may get your little wum butt kicked again and again, but it's all about memorizing what they do and finding an ideal time to open fire. And if you want some more challenging battles, there's a boss rush available after beating the game.\n\nBut gameplay aside, the REAL hero here is the presentation. This game literally feels like a child's art piece come to life. The way everything is drawn with this adorable childish style just oozes with charm. Everything about this game is super adorable, from the silly looking characters, to the cartoonish sound effects, I mean you literally shoot CANDY as your primary attack. Everything feels like the imagination of a 5 year-old, and to my surprise, it works, and I love it. The story matches that tone to a T. Basically, a bunch of creatures called Fnakkers wanted to rule the world, but together with the Blussers and Splenkhakkers, the clever Wums pushed them into a sinkhole. You play as a Wum who got kicked out of a hotel for spilling ice cream and now you need a new home. It's simple and charming, but I was really surprised by the how the actually expanded upon these ideas further. There's actually some legitimately interesting depth and lore to this game, and that surprised me! But don't worry folks, there's no super dark twist or edgy villains or anything, the game maintains that quirky whimsical charm the whole the through, it even gets straight bizarre too! I adore the presentation, and I feel like it alone makes it worth your time.\n\nNow normally, this is where I'd put my complaints about this game, but I'm in a weird spot. See, when I played, my main issue was how you can only hold one item at a time, having to flip through a menu everytime you wanted to switch, but since then, the devs have actually added a quick select to fix that problem. So yeah, no complaints here!\n\nOverall 10/10 game, I love it to pieces.

It has many mechanics within it, ranging from light RPG systems to a surprisingly detailed world, and even includes a decent amount of fighting and some platforming. I personally got a little tired of it, but it doesn't mean that the title was bad by any means.\n\nThe game is very open in terms of its story, while there are generally objectives to complete within this title, you are able to travel around the semi-open world and complete various activities and meet different creatures. I found the lack of direction sometimes to be frustrating, since it would only say to \"find x item\" or \"complete y objective\", but I assume it is because some goals can be accomplished in different ways. This freedom is nice for an indie game that I assumed would be a basic platformer, but it is pretty rich in content. \n\nThe world is definitely larger than I expected in this title, with an entire city to explore, an well-sized apartment complex, and multiple types of areas ranging from a jungle, to an underground tunnel, to a chain of islands. There are a LOT of items in this game, and most seem cosmetic, but the options are there for those who want to grind out money to try different outfits/items out. I thought the opening section was fun, with a good platforming sequence and a couple of cool boss battles, but the middle stretch of the game is where I got bored personally. I didn't like the fact that multiple odd jobs would have to be completed in order to progress the story, and it dragged the gameplay to a screeching halt. This was disappointing because I felt the game had a cool style to it, but it runs into the issue of trying to do too much without fleshing any one thing out.\n\n[b] Wuppo - Definitive Edition [/b] was an interesting game to try out. While I didn't get a chance to fully complete it, I found it to be an interesting experience nonetheless. The game has a boatload of systems, yet doesn't flesh out any one particular aspect out very well.

Story-wise, I'd say it's pretty similar to a Paper Mario game, with a unique world, fun dialogue, and interesting and silly NPCs. I enjoyed slowly learning about this weird little world with its weird little inhabitants; there's lots to look around at and explore, and tons of tidbits of information lying around (mainly in the form of \"filmstrips\", a collectable you'll find in various places that contain a mini slideshow of sorts)\n\nGameplay-wise, it's pretty simplistic and kind of makes me think of those old web browser flash games. Very simple controls and combat, you run, jump, and fire your weapon (which has optional upgrades and variations), and little much else besides using items to advance the story or solve small puzzles. Personally, I'm okay with this. I enjoy simple games like this every now and then, especially ones that are just charming and fun for the sake of being fun. The only thing I'm a little disappointed with are the bosses, which are waaay to easy and can all be easily beaten by continuously firing at them and bringing a good supply of healing items.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this little game! I definitely recommend it to anyone who's into what I described above, but I don't think it'd be very enjoyable for any hardcore gamer that dislikes simplicity. Of course, it's not very expensive so I still recommend giving it a shot anyway! the worst possible outcome is that you spend some time looking around this cute, charming little world and decide it isn't for you", "timestamp_created": 1572038715, "timestamp_updated": 1572038715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55692810": {"recommendationid": "55692810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272033122", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 918, "last_played": 1515047317}, "language": "english", "review": ":)", "timestamp_created": 1571598283, "timestamp_updated": 1571598283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506538689136505127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55583365": {"recommendationid": "55583365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347044261", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 560, "last_played": 1594479930}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

Yes, Kirby is one of my favorite characters ever, mind your own business.\n\nI picked it up on sale along with a handful of other cheap games that piqued my interest, and Wuppo stands out as one of the most charming games I've played.\n\nWuppo is like if a game developer was challenged to create a full game using a Game Jam prompt, and the staff consisted of 13 year-old Timmy from next door on Art Direction, that one class-clown theater kid from high school English Lit as the writing staff, and the two college students in charge of coding and music that somehow keep it all in line.\n\nAnd it works fantastically.\n\nIn spite of only being about two hours deep - apparently that's about a fifth of the game's entire playtime (non-100%) - the game swept me up in its passively sarcastic tone and straightforward plot. It's childish simplicity done right, where instead of feeling juvenile, it feels lighthearted and silly. It's tongue-in-cheek in an aggressively playful way that practically forces you to un-bunch your grumpy-pants and lighten up, whether you want to or not. Exploring the world is satisfying thanks to the tight controls that allow for fun platforming while offering some light puzzle-solving.

Wuppo has enough under the hood to scratch your platformer/exploration itch.\n\nThis game really brings to mind oldskool indie platformer classics like Knytt or Seiklus.  In fact, if you like either of those titles, it's probably a given that you'lve love Wuppo.  It helps that the game has the great advantage of also NOT feeling like a platformer in the sense that it feels more like a fully-realized world that you incidentally platform your way through.\n\nIt also has light Metroidvania and RPG aspects, as you definitely need to have certain items to proceed through certain areas, and there can be frequent backtracking to previously inaccessible areas.  You also have a weapon that you can improve and modify, which adds a little bit of that RPG grind feel to your progress.\n\nBoss fights can sometimes be challenging, and there are a number of puzzles, but the real way in which Wuppo shines is simply observing/taking part in the living world that all these adorable little critters live in.  It is somewhat reminiscent of Mr. Saturn from Earthbound, not only in how the Wums look, but also how zany their society operates.\n\n[i]Become Wum of Many if...[/i]\n\n[list]\n[*] You want an interactive, exploration-focused experience in a convincing world.\n[*] You want a platformer that's a little more laid back and off the beaten path.\n[*] You are looking for a game that is as cute as it is clever.\n[/list]\n\n[i]You're not the Wum if...[/i]\n\n[list]\n[*] You are looking for a very mechanics-focused platformer.\n[*] You need hardcore difficulty.\n[*] You need lots of action and combat.\n[/list]\n\n[u]The Bottom Line[/u]\n\nWuppo is an overlooked titan of exploration-platformers.  Unlike other, similar indie platformers, Wuppo goes the extra mile in terms of making you feel like a true, weird little world is happening all around you, and it also helps that there is plenty of clever writing and dialogue that is every bit as charming as the visual presentation.\n\nIf you have the patience for a somewhat leisurely-paced, exploration-focused metroidvania-lite experience, you really would be missing the train (it has that too!) by not giving Wuppo a try.", "timestamp_created": 1562025737, "timestamp_updated": 1562025806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53009500": {"recommendationid": "53009500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112454233", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 554, "last_played": 1560820784}, "language": "english", "review": "Super under Rated \n10 out of 10 for sure", "timestamp_created": 1562018888, "timestamp_updated": 1562018888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52992783": {"recommendationid": "52992783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055353042", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1590112477}, "language": "english", "review": "You got it set to M for mini, when it should be set to W for Wuppo.

After being kicked out of his residence we get to follow him on his journey of jumping, shooting gumballs, making friends, and finding happiness. It may come off as saccharin on paper, but is implemented quite well. Throughout the game your HP (happiness points ) can be increased by doing things like riding a roller coaster, helping people , making friends, learning something new, etc. It\u2019s a neat mechanic and does a great job showing heroes growth. There are many optional things to do just for the sake of doing them: the aforementioned rollercoaster costs many you have to earn on your own time, and then you have to queue up like any other citizen, the game will not let you on the ride if you cut in line. It\u2019s a neat way to tie the narrative\u2019s idea of character growth through the mechanics.\n\n What began as a selfish wum who was so consumed by TV he consumed it, ends with a wum exploring relationships and maturing. One of the notable fights includes a boss\u2019s confused and sad reactions that reminded me of Earthbound. It\u2019s a running theme that a lot of the beings in the game, enemy or not, are just misunderstood.  Such as a pet whose owner didn't teach him better. The racism and prejudice in Wuppos\u2019 world is treated in a light hearted manner, but it\u2019s still a major schism in the game. \n\nIt\u2019s not too long but there are plenty of secrets and sidequests. It\u2019s a rich world with lots of lore. What could be silly world with little context is actually fleshed out quite well, mostly through collectible film reels, or through talking with characters. The epilogue ties everything up nicely- and a sequel would be more than welcome. \n\nThe whimsical style and bright colors hold a rich heart warming game.\n\n*** update, they have made the game even better with a number of changes including co-op.

It has a very unique MSPaint-like cutesy art-style. Most of all - it has character. Neither the story nor its heroes feel copy-pasted from the checklist of video game clich\u00e9s, as it is often the case. Even names sound like they come from an original exotic language that is meant to twist your tongue in funny ways. It all starts with a lazy icecream-loving creature called Wum being thrown out of its house for being messy and one thing leads to another in organic fashion. I haven't finished the game yet but the dreaded save-the-world clich\u00e9 has yet to rear it's ugly head. Instead we follow our Wum on a journey of self-discovery and exploration, full of humour and wit. And while it all sounds very childish on paper, and indeed what I've seen of the game has all been very kid-friendly, the story is sprinkled with light socio-political metaphors that add a deeper layer underneath the surface, and the design of the world is so creative that it never stops filling you with wonder.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes it's a metroidvania where you point your mouse where you want to shoot (I don't play with controllers). However, it has more emphasis on exploration, dialogue and even inventory use, like an adventure game, so it's really a mix of genres. It does have its share of fun and bizarre bosses that can take a few tries if you crank up the difficulty like I did. \n\nWhich brings me to two negative points I have: the difficulty setting seems to be tied to game speed. So if you play at lower difficulties your game will get unbearably slow. It should have been kept as a separate setting in my opinion. Also, the game displays a comic-book style effect each time you or something else gets hit - these can obscure the area so much that it gets hard to see where what is, especially if you add a lot of similar looking characters. Sometimes it's also unclear what can be jumped on and what is just background, a problem haunting many platformers.\n\nNone of these problems sour the experience too much as the game has a strong core and most of all, it has soul. Unique, quirky, interesting - it embodies everything I love about indie games. #loveindies", "timestamp_created": 1560015449, "timestamp_updated": 1560015449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51115750": {"recommendationid": "51115750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066512174", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 157, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1559985014}, "language": "english", "review": "Come on, give them the ice cream and leave them do mess.\n\nI recommend this game, if you are into this.

Check out our Forum here.[/url]\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\n[i]Wuppo[/i] is a strange mix of [i]Paper Mario[/i],  a twin stick shooter platformer, and an adventure game. Something about this mix made people think \u201cMetroidvania\u201d but overall to me it feels like [i]Monkey Island 3[/i] for structural reasons I\u2019ll talk about a little later on. I think if you\u2019re looking for a Metroidvania style experience, [i]Wuppo[/i] has flavors of it, but the primary focus is on quirky characters and adventure game style puzzles, and for what it is it\u2019s a ton of fun. \n\nThe entire premise of the game is that your fat Wum is a slob and gets kicked out of his halfway house thus kicking off his (her?) hijinx filled adventure where he haphazardly saves the universe. All of your interaction with NPCs is done with the kind of flair that you would see in a Nintendo game. Every character has a personality quirk that makes them humorous because they\u2019re larger than life, but they\u2019re also grounded in a reality that makes them feel almost real. Your character is a \u201cWum\u201d, a species of armless Kirby creatures with tiny bug legs, and he reacts to conversation with amusing facial expressions, giving interactions a delightful energy. The game sort of forces you to learn about the different species in the world \u2013 there are at least eight that you interact with \u2013 but in spite of it being something of an exposition dump it does it in such an entertaining way that I didn\u2019t mind it.\n\nIn fact, that world building is something that [i]Wuppo[/i] strangely does very well. In spite of being a surreal mishmash of both cringe and curiosity, it\u2019s all constructed in a way that made me almost believe it was real place. From an escapist standpoint, [i]Wuppo[/i] is a world that welcomes you in and quietly entices you away from whatever worldly cares you have in real life. The overarching story is a product of weirdness, but perhaps as you play you\u2019ll start to care about the individual characters in the game \u2013 or at least \u2013 you\u2019ll care about preserving its world as much as possible. A lot of the game\u2019s content is completely optional \u2013 only opening up more and new interesting things about its history and characters rather than providing any tangible in-game benefit. But interacting with all of those elements is rewarding in itself, firmly establishing that this is a game less about gameplay and more about its world.\n\nIn that vein, puzzle solutions are less rigid than many adventure games. In two of the four major sections of the game, your primary goal isn\u2019t to just get from point A to point B, but rather you\u2019re given an objective that has multiple solutions for accomplishing. This lack of rigidity sets it apart from other adventure games \u2013 so while you have several items to brush against things, in many cases they don\u2019t act as \u201ckeys\u201d gating your progress as much as they [i]feel[/i] like logical solutions the problem. Not that there aren\u2019t [i]any[/i] key-like puzzle solutions, but the method of getting the key is often open and up to the player on how they want to obtain it. This is all ingenious game design helps to keep the game to that high level of immersion, but it also opens the game up to players that don\u2019t necessarily like the 90s style of adventure game. \n\nOf course, the more casual 90s adventure gamers would also potentially have some difficulty with [i]Wuppo\u2019s[/i] combat. I played the game on hard mode, but even on the normal difficulty I can only imagine some of the game\u2019s bosses giving less action game oriented players some trouble. There aren\u2019t a ton of \u201cregular\u201d enemies throughout the game world \u2013 the ones that are there go down pretty easily save a few annoying fish monsters. The real challenge comes from the 17 bosses. Wuppo is a twin-stick shooter, meaning you\u2019ll be jumping and shooting using your shoulder buttons and controlling your movement and aiming with the analog sticks \u2013 if you\u2019re playing with a controller. In twin-stick fashion this means most bosses are a balance of bullet-hell-esque barrages and while continually applying damage to weakpoints as you move. From the boss pattern to your Wum\u2019s controls, everything feels just a little loose, meaning it took me a few tries to get used to new boss patterns before everything clicked. This isn\u2019t necessarily bad, especially since every boss has a checkpoint just prior to facing them, but it\u2019s perhaps not exactly the industry\u2019s best when it comes to combat. But like everything in [i]Wuppo[/i], encounters are more than just a mechanical challenge, there is also a high level of entertainment coming from who and what you\u2019re fighting at any given time. Overall I\u2019d rate the combat as above average. \n\nAs far as [i]Wuppo\u2019s[/i]  \u201cMetroidvania-ness\u201d goes I mentioned previously that it reminds me more of [i]Monkey Island 3[/i] than it does [i]Super Metroid[/i] or [i]Castlevania[/i]. While you can technically go back to any old area as new areas are opened up, you\u2019re given little incentive to do so. Each area plays like a chapter, and once you accomplish the primary goal you move on. There isn\u2019t ever any feeling that you\u2019re exploring to find power-ups to progress, but rather you\u2019re exploring to find information. Because of that I think there might be some crossover in interest for fans of [i]La-Mulana[/i], just with less Metroidvania factor and the combat isn\u2019t quite as difficult. Because of the previously mentioned fluidity of the puzzle design, you\u2019re also not solving riddles in the same way as [i]La-Mulana[/i] \u2013 most of the time. There are a few that do require you to know about the game\u2019s world to progress, but they aren\u2019t nearly as prevalent, and if you\u2019re paying attention to the game\u2019s NPC interactions they\u2019re not particularly difficult. \n\nThe primary draw of [i]Wuppo[/i] is its quirky characters, its entertaining method of storytelling, and the overall immersion that its world provides. It has just enough challenge to it to make it more than just an escapist fantasy, but escapism is definitely its main strength. If you\u2019re looking for a break from every day life, and just want a fun and inviting video game world to stay in for a while, [i]Wuppo[/i] is practically unparalled within the confines of its limitations as an indie title. \n\n4 out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1555335876, "timestamp_updated": 1577201096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712771117687225342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50128710": {"recommendationid": "50128710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305255377", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 649, "last_played": 1671436041}, "language": "english", "review": "smol white laddie covers people in his white paint on the streets", "timestamp_created": 1555246731, "timestamp_updated": 1570173050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.393700778484344482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50118272": {"recommendationid": "50118272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044991542", "num_games_owned": 627, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 812, "last_played": 1555189316}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuppo is an adventure platformer with a bit of a metroidvania vibe, although it is mostly linear.

What starts as a quest to go back home, turns into a engaging story about friendship, politics and meaning of life (with a dash of saving the world thrown in). \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nI feel like the time spent in the game is split between three main elements pretty evenly. Those would be fighting with your trusty Gumgumgun, jumping around and solving puzzles and talking to other creatures.\n\nThe boss fights were well-made, I played on normal difficulty and they were challenging enough to make me sweat a little, but not too hard to make me feel frustrated. Each fight was also pretty different from another, regarding the boss mechanics. I'd often die on the first attempt, just to understand the boss' move pattern and breeze through it the next try.\n\nIf I had to point out one thing that was constantly bugging me while playing, it would definitely be the inventory management. As you progress through the game, you get more and more items and even through you can set up hotkeys, if you're playing with a controller, there's just not enough buttons to have all the useful items easily accessible, which means you'll be browsing your inventory pretty often. This wouldn't be that much of an issue, however, Wuppo doesn't feature active pause. So, if you're in a boss battle and don't have any healing items bound to a hotkey, you will most likely die. It's not that bad on the normal difficulty, as I didn't find myself using healing items too often anyway, but I feel it might be a huge annoyance when playing on the harder modes.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe game was made by only two people and it shows. I mean, don't get me wrong, I actually think it looks pretty great, as the rather crude but childish style actually fits the whole game perfectly. However, you might notice that some elements, e.g. the purple tubes in Popo City can be a bit of an eye-sore. Despite that, I do love how the game looks. \n\nIt's often a case with Indie games that even though they look good-ish on the first look, the more you play, the more boring the scenery becomes, you just notice the copy pasting of assets and plain, empty textures covering most of the screen. This is definitely NOT a case with Wuppo. I feel like the devs have spent A LOT of time creating the world, there's a lot of work put into every level. Be it some weird plants in the background, mysterious runes carved into rocks or even some moss in long abandoned ruins. Every part of the world is refreshing in it's own way and I loved exploring them.\n\nOne more thing that deserves praise, especially for an indie game like that is the liveliness of the portrayed world. The locations feel really alive. The city is full of Wums rushing somewhere in hurry or just working on something. Creatures are queueing to the Wondersplenk attractions or interacting with each other. Many AAA open-world games could learn a thing or two from Wuppo when it comes to adding a 'beating heart' to the world.\n\n[h1] Sound & Music [/h1]\n\nThe music in Wuppo is perfectly made. I felt like every piece was actually carefully chosen for the level I was in. Wumhouse music was really warm and sort of melancholic. The dark passages and ruins had more mysterious and weird soundtracks. The city's music was work-inspiring and fitting the general rush everyone was in perfectly. It's often a bit goofy sounding, which also fits the general theme of the game. The combination of the graphics, sound design and story really reminded me of the time long ago when I played The Neverhood. It just sparked the same warm and melancholic feelings in me and I think it's great that games can still do that.\n\n[h1] Plot and Character Design [/h1]\n\nThe story of Wuppo starts rather silly, but develops nicely. It's nothing too original, it's easy to predict how most of the events will unfold. But it's still solid and with a dash of humour added, I was happy to play through it and even watched most of the filmstripes just for the fun of it.\n\nThe dialogues can be really brilliantly written. I think I talked to all of the NPCs and always went through all possible options. There's a lot of information hidden there, as well as, jokes or some general life wisdom.\n\nThe life wisdom, which actually deserves a paragraph of its own. I think the story is merely a pretext to talk and think about real life and it's problems. It may not be obvious immediately, but the game touches upon a lot of real life topics. For example, the four main races present different approaches to life, or types of people. Wums are more outgoing, Blussers are the introverts, Splenhakkers like building and constructing and Fnakkers seem to be centered mostly on the physical development. But even within one race, like Wums, there are differences. Wums in the Wumhouse like their lazy, relaxed life, while the Wums in Popo city are focused only on work. There's also the focus on making friends, which yet again reminded me of The Neverhood. And let's not forget about the stereotypes and how they're often misleading and disrupt our communication attempts.\n\nAll in all, I think there're a lot of topics regarding real life and its meaning embedded into Wuppo. It's not too much 'in your face' though, it doesn't really push any agendas on the player. It mostly just presents how different people have different priorities in their lives and how we should respect that.\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n\nTo sum up, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Wuppo. If you feel like setting out on a mystical, but a tad goofy journey through life with boss fights and some puzzles, this is a game for you.

Time moves on its own, as do the hundreds of background characters who are all doing their own thing, living their own lives.  And the Wum you play as isn't some prophesied hero and doesn't even have any particularly noteworthy abilities by the end of the game; you're just one small citizen like anyone else in this big ol' world, which keeps the whole experience down-to-earth.\n\nThe heartbeat of this game also comes through in the way it progresses.  There aren't many moments that clearly define progress in the story, because just as much care and attention was put in the optional content as the main adventure, so it rarely feels like you're following a script.  The game still gives you suitable hints for making progress, but I didn't focus on them too much, because exploration is perhaps Wuppo's greatest focus.  Wandering around is often rewarding, if for no other reason than being able to witness more of the game's charming personality.\n\nIf I were to break down my minor gripes with Wuppo, one would be the combat.  The controls are very simple and generally effective, but dodging enemies and their attacks isn't always reasonable, so there were times when I wished for some sort of dash move.  Some of the enemy fire is also difficult to see, either because it's small or somewhat dark.  The inventory system is mildly cumbersome, and even though the button shortcuts help, they still leave something to be desired.  There were also a couple points in the story where I wasn't sure how to progress, although the game does remarkably well at keeping the flow most of the time, thanks to a number of its presented problems having multiple solutions.\n\nWuppo was clearly made with a vision.  It's a gem, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to explore and wants to smile.", "timestamp_created": 1554873409, "timestamp_updated": 1555047569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825988829135894775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50042258": {"recommendationid": "50042258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056999380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1614115885}, "language": "english", "review": "Insane game, you can tell it's crafted by love and and ambition", "timestamp_created": 1554791512, "timestamp_updated": 1554791512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50041430": {"recommendationid": "50041430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027748338", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1554785509}, "language": "english", "review": "A criminally under-rated game with a fantastic soundtrack and extremely charming animation.

The dialogues are so light-hearted and fun, but at the same time I can\u2019t help but think that some actual talent and passion was put into writing all of the jokes or just build the comical atmosphere. Almost all of the humor comes from the situations, characters and the setting itself.

[I]Wuppo[/I] is a long, complex, and challenging platformer adventure. Though it's crammed with characters and lore (and many dialogs), it contains delightfully diverse gameplay throughout. Most of it is about finding or buying items and using them to solve puzzles, but there is also some good combat (many \"boss\" fights), platform jumping, and mundane activities such as fishing and ... waiting in line for a roller coaster.\n\nAll of this takes place in a deliberately silly and funny world that nevertheless makes sense. It's immersive enough to provide the backdrop for a coherent and engaging story, as good as you would find in game worlds that take themselves much, much more seriously. It seems that the creators worked hard to avoid any associations with our own world and its history, but if you squint just enough you'll see some subtle parody and commentary. Blink and it's gone, replaced with a pleasant and bubbly society in which life is carefree and strife is rather toothless.\n\nI strongly recommend [I]Wuppo[/I], but it's still worth pointing out some faults to keep your expectations in check.\n\nThe music and sound design are consistently good. The visual style is ... consistent. It's charming, to be sure, but the choice to use a very low resolution and meager color palette are a sure sign of trying too hard to be \"retro.\" There are less grating ways to be minimalistic. At times, this style can be frustrating, as when it's almost impossible to see where you are in a screen crowded with fast-moving low-res blobs. Could we at least have made the protagonist a unique color? I also was distracted by by the \"helpful\" bubble following you around to tell you how many hit points you have left. This should have been pushed to a corner of the screen.\n\nThe diverse gameplay does sometimes stumble. Pacing, for example, is uneven. The game starts with a lot of action platforming, but then slows down to spaced-out puzzle solving. It almost feels like you're in a different game. These styles should have been more intertwined.\n\nSimple activities are sometimes made hard by obfuscating them via a lack of cues on how you're supposed to use items. Oh, I'm supposed to press a button, hold it pressed, and [I]then[/I] move? How about an in-game tutorial to explain these things? I only found out midway through the game that I can create shortcut buttons to access inventory items. This, too, should have been explained.\n\nFinally, though [I]Wuppo[/I] is at heart a platformer, the controls are far too loose. It's too easy to slip and slide instead of neatly landing at your intended destination after jumping. Usually it's just annoying to have to go back and jump again, but during a boss fight it could be frustrating. Luckily, there are few enough boss fights and platforming areas to make this not too big of an issue. But if the balance were any different...\n\nAll in all, [I]Wuppo[/I] as a whole works so well that it's impossible to dwell on any of its faults.

To my surprise this did not turn out to be a lemmings clone but an interesting adventure platformer.\n\nThe visuals are a bit off putting at first with a hand drawn art style. But it somehow fits the games theme and if nothing else its consistent throughout. Some areas do look better others but luckily there's just a handful of ugly areas. But you do get used to it and as mentioned it does fit the game.\n\nThe game is a mixture of platformer and adventure game. The world has surprisingly quite deep lore despite being a little silly. But you do get attached to all the wums, fnakkers, blussers and other creatures inhabiting the world and they are a quite lovable bunch. The dialogs are well written and really funny at times.\n\nPlatforming is solid and the boss fights quite well designed. Challenging but rewarding with a very good boss design and variety. \n\nThe adventuring is a bit old school. The game does not lead you by the hand and very often you're left to your own to figure things out. This can be both good and bad and I'll admit I was forced to use a guide here and there but figuring stuff on my own was very rewarding I'll admit.\n\nSo whats bad about the game. For starters it lacks a clear goal. For most of times it feels like giving you little goals but without proper motivation. And it feels like you're not sure what to do. You're forced to explore and eventually you figure out your next move but there's never a good \"why\" - things just sort of happen.\n\nSome puzzles especially later on are extremely annoying, hard and frustrating making me drop a star from the final score.

The characters can be pretty humourus and the game offers some dialogue choices for futher interaction (depending on your choice your wum even makes different expressions or mumbles the words at a different speed). The game does have a few standard enemies, but the combat mainly takes place in boss battles in which you essentially shoot blobs of gum at your foes. The boss fights were pretty memorable in that some of them popped up out of nowhere and the boss designs themselves are all distinguishable and unique. \n\nI would say the only issues I had with the game were relatively minor and mainly me nitpicking some things. I wish you could equip a usable item, such as a weapon, and some accessories at the same time, such as cosmetic outfits. \nI personally played using a controller and this made the game a bit more difficult as all movement is done with the left control stick (meaning no d-pad for precision movement) and equipment hotkeys are restricted to the d-pad and a few face buttons. There are quite a few items I liked to have on hand so having to go into the menu to rebind things was a little annoying sometimes. I also found the max jump height hard to achieve which made some platforms difficult to get over. These are all minor complaints on the whole though.\n\nThis game has so many nice details in it that just make me happy. I mentioned that your wum can change expression, but they can change color based on what they have done, such as turning a pale green for a while after getting nauseous. The game has an internal clock that events like the day/night cycle and some transportation arrival times are based on. The game also has some segments where you can wait in a line and the other characters get angry if you try to cut in front of them. There is also a bit of background lore that can be discovered, but it is entirely optional and isn't neccesary to enjoy the game.\n\nOverall, if you want a cute, relaxing platformer to play and that isn't really that difficult or frustrating, then play Wuppo.

With few exceptions you run, you jump, you collect powerups, you deal with enemies and traps, and you head for your goal. What exceptions there are can be eye-opening, and Wuppo is a prime example of just such a curveball. Presented as a platformer, edging dangerously close to a metroidvania, this charming little adventure is really just a day in the life of a simple little creature in their strange, fantastic world. And it just happens to be a day that could change everything forever.\n\nYou are a wum, a tiny, spherical creature on four stubby legs. You reside in the Wumhouse, a grand edifice in which you spend your days eating ice cream and watching TV. Unfortunately you\u2019re a bit too slovenly about it for the management, which has you booted out into the wilderness to find a more accepting home. This sets you little wum on a grand odyssey, meeting other sentients like the rowdy blions and serene blussers, learning about the long and storied history of the world, and uncovering existential threats to the wum\u2019s way of life. There are items to find, friends to help, credit to earn, and bosses to defeat on your journey, and what starts as a search for a new pad ends with the fate of the world resting on your adorable little dome.\n\nNow, when I talk about a \u201cgrand odyssey\u201d, you might be envisioning something like Hollow Knight or Ori where you\u2019re exploring a vast, untamed land. That\u2019s really not the case in Wuppo for a couple reasons. For one, the map is mostly concentrated around the actual settlements of the wums and their peers. When you get chucked from the Wumhouse you\u2019ll do a little hiking through the forest and some caves, but after that it\u2019s back to civilization and the towns and cities of the world for pretty much the rest of the game. Instead of spelunking and mountain climbing, you\u2019ll be navigating the busy streets of Popo City, and exploring the villages of other species on the edges of wum society.\n\nThe other thing about Wuppo is that it\u2019s more of an adventure game than anything. Combat tends to be the least of your concerns here, relegated to occasional enemy appearances and the isolated boss fights. There are plenty of those, mind you, but they\u2019re spaced out between long sections of exploring, talking, and problem-solving. Your wum has a robust inventory of items they can wear on their tiny head and huck at other creatures for whatever reason, like returning lost hats or sharing food. You\u2019ll get some clever hat-based devices like a cleaner that spreads suds for you to scrub and eat, and a newspaper launcher that delivers papers straight to willing heads. Most items are found or received but a few can be bought and sold, exchanging smurt or wondersplenk for goods like hats and food.\n\nYou may have noticed by now that there are some colorful names floating around in this one. Perhaps Wuppo\u2019s greatest strength is in the world it has built for you to putter around in, full of rich histories and lore for its weirdly precious inhabitants. The optional filmstrip collectibles scattered throughout the game will teach you all about the shared history of the wums, blussers, splenkhakkers, and fnakers, as well as how Popo City and the Wumhouse came to be, where kneft come from, why the city runs on credit instead of smurt, and far more eclectic secrets than this. It\u2019s all told with a familiar charm and hilarious writing, from the tall tales of Burt Smulder to the intense drive of Uberhenk. It\u2019s adorable through and through, and encourages loads of exploration just to see more of the charm tucked away here.\n\nThe rich presentation helps a lot, because Wuppo can feel like a rather aimless game at times. Like I said, it\u2019s not really an epic quest or a series of challenges, it\u2019s just your little wum trying to find their place in the world. You\u2019ll have objectives at any given time but they\u2019re things like \u201cfind a new place to live\u201d and \u201cearn some credit\u201d. It\u2019ll take some effort to figure out what you should be doing next and how to do it, and in the early parts of the game before the full scope of events becomes clear, this can make it hard to stick with. My first attempt at playing Wuppo ended about two hours in, when I got stumped trying to get to Popo City and lost interest in the game. I needed a few clues to point me in the right direction the second time I played, but once I actually GOT to Popo City the game picked up significantly and kept me engaged all the way through the mind-bending conclusion.\n\nYou may also run afoul of technical issues on this one, owing to its GameMaker roots. Wuppo can be extremely temperamental about refresh rates, slowing down or speeding up to uncomfortable degrees. A few of the events can break as well, particularly the lines in Wondersplenk when you\u2019re waiting to get on a ride. And that\u2019s another thing, in the game\u2019s quest to simulate an actual little society, there are things you need to wait in line for. The train between the Wumhouse and Popo City actually runs on a five-minute rotation, meaning you might be sitting at the station whistling (there\u2019s a dedicated whistle button) as you arbitrarily wait to get on with the game.\n\nThese issues make Wuppo a bit more of a challenge to get into than more conventional platformers, but that\u2019s also the beauty of it. Wuppo is a very different kind of platformer, one that\u2019s not afraid to confuse you with its strange histories or unexpected conventions. It\u2019s a game where you\u2019re not a hero, you\u2019re really just some little jerk who ends up making more of a difference than you\u2019d ever expect, in ways you won\u2019t be expecting either. It\u2019s unique, which is rare for a platformer, but still manages to be unrelentingly fun. And that\u2019s the thing, if you can get over the initial weirdness and hurdles, Wuppo rewards you with some of the happiest, most charming gameplay around.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

The major things i had a problem with were the bossfights; the unreasonable amount of money you need for all the upgrades; and the difficulty of the game in general. \n\nThe bossfights were nothing but tedious. The biggest problem with them were the untelegraphed attacks and the zoomed out camera. This means that dodging anything in a calm manor was imposible and just running away was usually the best option. The pattern of projectiles from bosses was seemingly random in almost all cases which isnt very good in a game like this and made the fights feel more like coinflips than a test of your skill, the last fight comes to mind. \n\nThe upgrades felt like a big part of the game when you got to them but it is so idiotically time consuming to get the money necessarry to buy the upgrades. It just feels so pointless for it to cost so much when there already is a lack of variety in the combat. \n\nThe third problem was how easy the game was even when playing on hard. I might not be the demigraphic they are looking for but nothing felt very challanging at all and the few deaths felt more like bad boss design or bad leveldesign, the corridors with the jellyfishes for example. \n\nIt is in my opinion impossible for me to recommend this game with these flaws. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1542579735, "timestamp_updated": 1542579735, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534469008445739746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45884282": {"recommendationid": "45884282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052618545", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 615, "last_played": 1639379719}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had several dreams about Wuppo", "timestamp_created": 1542558221, "timestamp_updated": 1542558221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45875858": {"recommendationid": "45875858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059791728", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 149, "last_played": 1636253899}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm sure this is a fine game\nbugs have prevent me from enjoying the game\nif I open Vsync it runs at 30fps slow motion\nIf i disable Vsync it runs at 200fps and its too fast so I can't make any of the jumps\nthe speed of the game is determined by the framerate it runs at\nThis game is buggy \nplease fix", "timestamp_created": 1542525825, "timestamp_updated": 1542525825, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50205761194229126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45823867": {"recommendationid": "45823867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151468956", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1697633871}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuppo is a very charming, cute, and bubbly metroidvania-esque game. \nI would strongly recommend giving it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1542282685, "timestamp_updated": 1542282685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45818776": {"recommendationid": "45818776", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960788425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1540266506}, "language": "english", "review": "Adorable, delightful, does the unexpected", "timestamp_created": 1542247104, "timestamp_updated": 1542247104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45795971": {"recommendationid": "45795971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855228616", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 3459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2663, "last_played": 1627969928}, "language": "english", "review": "this is soooooo underrated \nthis game is fucking amazing", "timestamp_created": 1542119647, "timestamp_updated": 1542119647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45759847": {"recommendationid": "45759847", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989328210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 703, "last_played": 1541937171}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyed every second of it.

It's insanely cute and adorable without ever being childish. The humor is witty, sometimes subtle and always quirky. The game had me grinning like an idiot for the majority of my playtime. The premise and story are pretty basic but the world and characters just sucked me in for an immersive experience I haven't had in quite some time. There's so much to explore and silly stuff to do it's legit crazy. Everything just oozes with charme, character and soul. The attention to detail is extremely impressive.\n\nI very rarely get post-game depression these days but Wuppo reminded me it's a thing. I never played anything like this before. I doubt there is anything like it in the first place.\nThe game was made by a team consisting of a whole two dudes from the Netherlands. Kudos to them.

It's incredible that such a small team was able to produce this. It really should receive more attention!\n\nThe writing is great. Everybody is worth talking to. Even all of the text describing things like items is good - much like your character, you'll just devour everything in this game. The settings are varied and meaningful. Stepping off the train into Popocity gave me a strange feeling of entering a city unlike in any other game I've played (even something like GTA). The forests and caves and buildings are all great, full of detail and polish. And there are save \"buckets\" smartly placed just about everywhere, so while dying can and does happen quickly at times, especially facing one of the 19 bosses, you're almost never more than a few seconds away from where you left off. This game has zero filler. It doesn't make you do things twice. It's brisk. It's swift. \n\nThe sense of progression is great. And I have no problem with the overall length of the game... I certainly didn't do everything, and I think I missed at least one area to visit, but I clocked about 7 hours at \"The End\" screen. I like that length. But the pacing does get a little weird at the end. It feels kind of abrupt. The quality of writing is so high throughout the game, I guess I expected some more things to call back to the beginning, some characters to show up, some of the game's early challenges to reappear in new ways. But it kinda just goes off an a tangent, and then - that's it! (And for a game about making friends, basically, it IS a bit odd that violence solves so many issues, but, oh well, it's fun.) I guess it's a testament to this game's quality that I did want more. I would have loved another large area or two to explore.\n\nIn almost every way, this game exudes polish. From its soundtrack to its menu interface to its inventory system and the items (and friends) you'll discover, it's constantly impressing me.

Most of the combat in the game revolves around the bosses. Early in the game you get a gu which shoots colourful gumballs which you use to fight the bosses. The boss fights are pretty enjoyable. They offer a decent challenge initially without being too punishing, though once you've figured out the bosses attack patterns they are easy enough to beat.\n\nYou'll meet a lot of strange and quirky characters throughout the game and some interesting locations like the Wondersplenk, a big theme park, and Popo City which is an underground city full of Wums. I enjoyed the games artstyle which looks right out of a childs colouring book and the music suits the game perfectly.\n\nMy only criticism is that there were a couple of occasions where I wasn't really sure how to proceed.

It was given that tag by people who I assume have never played a metroidvania in their lives. You can upgrade your weapon but it's never useful besides one upgrade that has a chance to make your next shot do more damage. There's one other weapon you can get (the bazooka) but as far as I can remember it has no upgrades and a fully charged from it does not out-damage the upgrade I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe game's also strangely cryptic, giving you almost no hints for certain puzzles that are required to progress, such as one where you have to use the bazooka to splatter paint on a canvas. However, it HAS to be in a certain color and the color that the bazooka fires is entirely randomized. You're barely told any of this and my solution was to randomly shoot all over the area and rub up against everything until something magically happened. \n\nThat wouldn't be a deal-breaker if it wasn't for the world design. Wuppo, I think, is a prime example of how NOT to design game worlds. The train that takes you to most major locations in the game is on a real-time schedule, meaning you have to literally queue for the train, get on, and then wait several minutes before you arrive somewhere else (there's a mini-game you can play and a coffee shop you can visit but you only get like a minute at that coffee shop and the conductor yells at you if you take too long.) It adds absolutely nothing other than tedium.\n\nA small aside I want to mention; around two or three bosses I fought in either playthrough had instant kill attacks that you would never know were coming until you already got killed by them.\n\nI never finished Wuppo despite its cute artstyle being very appealing to me, and I tried earnestly to give it two playthroughs. Ultimately if you want a game that's somewhat similar in style (an open but linear 2D platformer with a neat artstyle) I'd seriously recommend you go play Outland. This game just wasn't worth it to me.\n\n(also also: the entire game is about \"a lost Wum searching for a new home\" but if you go back to the hotel at the beginning of the game, the guy there just says you can have your house back.

The gameplay is something of a mix between a platformer and an adventure RPG. You jump around and shoot monsters with your gumgumgun. The controls aren\u2019t always as great, but that doesn\u2019t damage the experience much. The graphics are unique and cute. There are lots of really fun puzzles in the game, but some of them are a bit too hard to solve in my opinion. The boss fights are fun too, though sometimes a bit quirky. There even is an extra game mode called Boss Run, where you can try to defeat all the bosses in the game (19 in total). \n\nThe soundtrack of this game is amazing and cute too, and compliments the setting of the game very well. Wuppo also has a lot of collectibles, including hats, weapon upgrades, film strips (slide shows with cool lore and solutions to puzzles) and happiness points (your life total). These things make the game much more interesting, especially for a completionist like myself. \n\nAnother thing that I really like about this game, is that it is made by Dutch people. In the game, lots of names are made of two different weird-sounding Dutch words, forming one gibberish word. Funny examples of this are Smakmoffel, the Bankkrent, the Denksnavel, the Allesweter, etcetera, etcetera. Games like these make me proud to be Dutch.\n\nThis game is incredibly fun to play, due to the cuteness, wholesomeness, the cool dialogue, the puzzles and the bosses.

Or you can just wait and the amount of points is slowly increasing, even when you do nothing at all. This made me quit - I had zero fun when doing these quests.

I thought I missed something so I even checked a walkthrough that only confirmed that I'm supposed to just do these quests until I get enough points.\nSecond issue was lack of a clear goal (only sometimes, but still) that again, kind of wasted your time as you walked and hoped to stumble upon anything that will tell you what to do.\n\nIt's a pity, because this game was really fun for some parts, but I felt that I'm wasting my time too often, having no pleasure doing so.\n\nSo, in the end, I regretfully can not recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1529690773, "timestamp_updated": 1529690773, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600221395492553711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42919180": {"recommendationid": "42919180", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970801416", "num_games_owned": 2759, "num_reviews": 204, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 619, "last_played": 1502591219}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuppo is my dream game.

Gameplay is super varied and it's very hard to explain all that you'll be doing. It's kind of like a 2D Super Mario except with one giant world. There is also a boss rush mode after beating the game with alot of interesting and unique mechanics that are not part of the main game.\n\nIs it fun?\n-----------\nFor the first few hours not really but as you get further into the game and start exploring more and more the game becomes very interesting with gameplay becoming more and more diverse, bigger areas opening up, more weapon upgrades and just so many things to explore. It's very different to alot of other platformers.\n\nIs the story good?\n------------------\nYou play as Wuppo, a small fluffball who gets kicked out of his house for eating too much ice cream. While trying to earn your way back into the house you'll unravel an adventure in the making, meet all kinds of different races, journey to the thriving Pop City and ultimately save the world. Or will you? Yes, the story is great.\n\nIs the design good?\n-------------------\n10/10. While the handrawn graphics may take a while to get used to there is no denying the soundtrack is absolutely stunning. World design is a 10/10 with every part of the game world being interconnected with each other. Pop City is especially amazing, you'll see thousands of different furballs going about their day. Never once do you feel like some kind of unique hero, you'll always feel like you're part of a living breathing world that will move on without you which is astounding and very welcoming.\n\nIs the game hard?\n-----------------\nNot really. Some of the bosses are difficult if you don't have the right weapon and some of the puzzles are tough to solve but ultimately I wouldn't consider the game hard (except for the final boss).\n\nAre the controls responsive?\n----------------------------\nHmmmm yeah i'd say so. There always seemed to be a delay between my button press and the action especially when it came to firing my gun but movement was fluid and I had no complaints about the layout.\n\nIs it repetitive?\n-----------------\nBoss Rush is but the main story isn't. The game constantly throws interesting things on you that keep the pacing at a great level and make you want to proceed.\n\nIs it aggravating?\n------------------\nOnly the tough boss battles can be aggravating. However I did feel it was tedious having to travel such long distances on foot to do specific things. There were times when the majoirty of the quests had you walking from one of the beginning areas to an almost end game area and it took a long time. There is no fast travel so you'll spend alot of the late game doing ALOT of relatively slow paced walking.\n\nDoes it have any replayability?\n-------------------------------\nMain story not really unless you super enjoyed it but I can absolutely see myself coming back to it in a few years. Boss Rush is replayable (that's its purpose) but can be frustrating and not really worth playing.\n\nIs the achievement list varied?\n-------------------------------\nVery. Most of the achievements are collectible related but you get alot for doing different things during the story mode. There is also a bunch of boss rush achievements that are really varied but pretty difficult.\n\nAre the achievements hard?\n--------------------------\nBoss Rush achievements are, but the majority of the ones earned through the main story isn't. The hardest one is collecting all the \"happiness\" (collectibles earned through doing quests or doing specific actions). There is no tracker for them and there is over a 100 points so you'll never know which one you missed.\n\nDid I like it?\n--------------\nI loved it, alot. Apart from the final boss and the slow intro I thought the game was an amazing example of how game should be made. Also, the game is REALLY funny.\n\nShould you buy it?\n------------------\nIf you like good stories and 2D platformers at ALL, then yes.

For the first half of the game, I was infuriated by it. How is it so well reviewed on Steam, and paced so horrendously? The music can be extremely repetitive, the combat doesn't feel great, doesn't have a lot of variety to it, and a lot of the bosses seem to have too much health. And sorry, what? You have to wait in fucking line? What?! I couldn't play it anymore, I just didn't get it; The game was bad. I put the game down, and didn't pick it back up again for what was probably a couple months. \n\nI played Paper Mario in that time, and finally returned to Wuppo afterwards. I originally was recommended the game because I'm a fan of Metroidvanias. Well, it's not that at all. The best genre I think I could tag it to would be Action/Adventure, but really the best service you can probably do is compare it to Paper Mario (or at least the first two games in that series). Paper Mario's got its own set of rules for the universe, its own creative cast of quirky characters, and is an adventure that connects you to them. Wuppo is like that, but take the universe and the quirkiness and crank it up to the maximum. Don't even get me started talking about... What was it? Plump? Fnuist? And then there's the Fnakkers, and the Blussers, and... Well it's all entirely unique, and very weird. And you really do learn almost every minute detail about the world by the end. It's really interesting in that way, and I can't think of much else like it. That, along with the great writing and art makes every character you meet really endearing, and this insane world somehow believable. And for that, I recommend Wuppo.\n\nSo yeah, you heard me right. I recommend a game that for a good while I passionately hated. And it's not because I think I just had the wrong mindset, it's because the latter half of the game that I played made it all worth it. I think it's still laden with flaws early on, but I think there's still plenty to love after that. Here's what you need to know so that you can hopefully enjoy the game when I didn't:\n1. It's not a Metroidvania, it's a weird adventure where you sometimes shoot at stuff, and other times give items to characters.\n2. Explore just enough as to not get bored, so that you can get the filmstrips and learn more about the world and get some cash on the side. Anything extra is too much until you're later on in the game.\n3. The best place to finally stop and start smelling the roses is [spoiler]Popo City[/spoiler]. Really, go for filmstrips and explore or min/max no further than you find enjoyable before you get to this place.\n\nSo...

He gets thrown out and needs to go looking for a new home, in a strange world with all kinds of creatures. Adventure awaits him with monsters and dangers ahead, but he also makes a lot of friends on the way.\n\nThis game\u2019s story is quite interesting, with lots of funny dialogue with random NPC\u2019s. The gameplay is something of a mix between a platformer and an adventure RPG. You jump around and shoot monsters with your gumgumgun. The controls aren\u2019t always as great, but that doesn\u2019t damage the experience much. The graphics are unique and cute. There are lots of really fun puzzles in the game, but some of them are a bit too hard to solve in my opinion. The boss fights are fun too, though sometimes a bit quirky. There even is an extra game mode called Boss Run, where you can try to defeat all the bosses in the game (19 in total). \n\nThe soundtrack of this game is amazing and cute too, and compliments the setting of the game very well. Wuppo also has a lot of collectibles, including hats, weapon upgrades, film strips (slide shows with cool lore and solutions to puzzles) and happiness points (your life total). These things make the game much more interesting, especially for a completionist like myself. \n\nAnother thing that I really like about this game, is that it is made by Dutch people. In the game, lots of names are made of two different weird-sounding Dutch words, forming one gibberish word. Funny examples of this are Smakmoffel, the Bankkrent, the Denksnavel, the Allesweter, etcetera, etcetera. Games like these make me proud to come from the Netherlands.\n\nThis game is incredibly fun to play, due to the cuteness, wholesomeness, the cool dialogue, the puzzles and the bosses. The graphics, the gameplay and the soundtrack are all amazing. I would definitely recommend people to play this game. 8/10.

It's fairly easy but the game is not without it's problems. In some aspects it's similar to Kirby. It has a lovely atmosphere with great music. The artstyle and animation is simple and adorable. The story is straight forward and easy to follow.\n\nGameplay is a mixture of platforming, puzzle solving, and basic action shooter. \n\nControls are simple and easy to get to too. The hotkey for items feels like it could be improved a little. I'd have liked mouse button support for this. Overall it feels pretty tight on controls. \n\nCombat is pretty easy. You don't know how many hits an enemy needs to take to kill them. This can cause some close shaves. Being swarmed is the easiest way to die.\n\nUsing healing items is risky as they have an activation time. If it's not hotkey'd then you aren't pretty much done for in a fight. To open up your items menu you have to hit tab and then left click on the blue icon. This is simple enough but if it's during a fight then expect to get hit a lot whilst doing this. \n\nPlatforming can be frustrating at times. Some things look like platforms but sometimes they aren't. There is no fall damage but that may mean back tracking. Other than that it's fairly easy there is no feeling of slippery surfaces etc.\n\nExploration of the world by running around or with side quests is rewarded with extra happiness, back story, weapon upgrades etc. \n\nI hope more people pick this up and enjoy this delightful little adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1519856697, "timestamp_updated": 1519856697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40429026": {"recommendationid": "40429026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333905771", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1507, "last_played": 1690770802}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game so much, cute and interesting, and it calms me down", "timestamp_created": 1519700457, "timestamp_updated": 1519700457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40404791": {"recommendationid": "40404791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046442811", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 528, "last_played": 1595992837}, "language": "english", "review": "Silly, happy little platformer.

Shooting the gum gun to the enemy and try to dodge the attack if you can if not it's okay there is food to eat that heals HPs. Pretty casual game, yeah. Even though, there is an insane mode which I wouldn't play it for sure. Puzzle is another thing that makes Wuppo's gameplay from good to great. I pretty impress that all of puzzles are well made this much for an adventure indie game.\n\nStory is pretty decent, but kinda cute in its own way. A wum gets kick out because of being too lazy, so the wum needs to find a new home. What a grade AAA story-plot.\n\nArt and sound kinda good but it's not that memorable. But I very like that when you shoot the gum gun to yourself, your character will change the color a bit as the color of the gum. Pretty neat, Knuist & Perzik. The soundtrack feels silly and lazy just like the character of wums, silly and lazy. It's a good match of art and sound.\n\nNot gonna lie but in the middle of the game it's kinda boring. It feels more like the map is big, but it's not necessary to be that big. At the left of the world map, there is a sea, I wasted my time like 2 min to go to the edge of it to find if there is anything useful but it ended up nothing there is nothing there and I got instant kill for being there also.\n\nAnd there is a boss rush mode that's pretty challenging to beat and get the achievements which the record will be shown globally in the game. If you're good enough the name on rank 1 will be yours.\n\nIn conclusion, Wuppo might not be as good as people keep saying but it is still a pretty good game to play. And, damn it, the last Happiness, I couldn't find the last one. The game took me like 12 hours to beat and get all the films, but it's gonna take me forever to find the last Happiness.

I absolutely adored all of the characters and the world on whole, I'd certainly kill for Wuppo2 or something similar! It's rather story based, there's a lot of talking to characters and solving their issues but this is the first game in a while that hasn't bored me with too much talk - I was really interested in what was going on in the world of Wuppo and it's adorable little inhabitants. Usually I don't care to learn more when playing games, but I wanted to do everything and see everything I could find in this one!

You play as a wum (a type of furball race) who goes by the name Scallywag. Thing is, Scallywag loves ice cream. This little wum lives at a place called Wumhouse. But is later kicked for spilling ice cream and giving Carlos a hard time. Now, this is where the journey begins. Scallywag must get back to the Wumhouse somehow and then look for another place to live since Carlos does not want him to stay there anymore. A great game for people of all ages.\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]\n\nThe game requires patience. Everything needs to be perfectly timed for you to even proceed to another level. Fortunately, there is also difficulty options for you to choose while playing. The game runs smooth without any lags or stuttering. One thing is, while high graphics is set, even though I see no lags or stutters, while moving from one area to another, The game slows down a little. Only for a short period of time though. There are over 3+ save slots and you can also choose to play on more than one save game for 1 user. That's even better if you have any siblings or friends who want to play this game and you don't even have to let them play your save file.\n\n[h1][b]Graphics[/b][/h1]\n\nThe game looks very bright and colorful. The graphics are great and the Wums look cuter than ever. For low graphics, the game is more pixelated but still enjoyable. With high graphics set up, the game looks wonderful. I love how they have made every little details as clear as possible. The colors are bright and not very dull. Overall, this looks great without anything to pull it down the list.\n\n[h1][b]Bugs and glitches[/b][/h1]\n\nHere's something that really annoyed me; When I was randomly selecting stuffs I had while scrolling through near the stone pillar, I accidentally pressed on the place marker which is there to place things on the pillar. That's pretty normal but the thing is, I had nothing selected so what was placed on the pillar, was nothing and yet, the pillar did go down. That wouldn't be a problem if the pillar went down or not, but what's a problem is, you need to put appropriate items on each of the 4 pillars. So the bugged pillar prevented me from proceeding with my game. I tried loading my last saved games but sadly, the pillar was still down since I saved the game after placing \"Nothing\" on the pillar. \n\n[h1][b]Content[/b][/h1]\nThis is not one of those 2 or 3 hour games that you think you can finish easily. It takes time to complete each task. You earn in-game currency and you have to spend it on things to complete said missions. It will definitely take time because even I have only gotten to 20% completed progress for 2hrs of gameplay.\n\n[h1][b]Total average and final notes[/b][/h1]\n[h1][i]I had lots of fun playing this game and haven't had any major problems with it. I'm gonna give this game a score of [u]7/10.[/u] You guys should really give this game a try.

It reminds me a lot of Simon's Quest and other super cryptic games. The difference is this game brings a certain charm that makes you want to try to solve the mystery of what the hell is going on. Why did you click on this game? Why are you considering buying it? Why are you reading my review? Because this game's uniqueness is enough to make you want to dive in. It happened to me one college debate trip as me and my best friend were strolling the steam store to kill time. \"Da fuq is that?\" I asked...and thus....an adventure was born.\n\n[u]the Charm[/u]\nTo detail out what charm I'm refering to, I'll create a list of the things this game does well in the unique department.\n\n[b]-Wums[/b]\nThese are the main race of the game. You play as one and are surrounded by tons of them. I think the wum looks like a mound of bird poop, my friend who discovered this with me called them potato balls and my girlfriend calls them marshmellows. What exactly is he? He is....a wum....like the game doesn't compare them to anything we know but rather invents something new. It'd be like trying to describe a human to an alien who comes from a world where humans are not present. Like imagine if an alien race didn't sit in chairs, they didnt have a need to sit. Trying to explain why a human sits might be rather difficult. Wums are...beings that kinda just...mill about doing stuff....while shooting gum out of a gun at enemies...yeah it's kinda hard to explain these characters.\n\n[b]-Lore[/b]\nI'm not ganna lie, I'm not a big story person. I do not like games that have a huge focus on story, where you end up watching/reading more than actually playing. However, there is some games that have amazing lore that is told in ways that keep me captivated. A few examples is Doom 3 with the use of PDA Audio Logs to immerse the player in the world of the UAC, Dark Souls with mysterious characters and item descriptions that give hints to what's happening, or lastly Bethesda games that rewards exploration with explainations of what is happening. Wuppo follows this scheme by borrowing from all of these elements. You explore, you find film strips which are like Doom 3's audio logs, meet strange unqiue potato balls and discover that the lore is as deep as the pacific ocean. The developers invented an entire ecosystem, civilization and history.\n\n[b]-Soundtrack[/b]\n9 times out of 10 I turn off game music. It takes a lot for me to leave the music on, the soundtrack has to be something magnificent for me to leave it on. Doom 1993, Starbound, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Saints Row, Grand Theft Auto are examples of games where I leave the music on. Wuppo's soundtrack is expansive, it has a lot of tracks, and they are all really catchy. I end up singing some of the songs that get stuck in my head. Just in case you thought there was lyrics to these songs, by singing I mean going \"boop boop booooooooooo looooo dooo choooo\". The music reminds me of retro titles on Nintendo or Sega consoles. \n\n[u]the Meh[/u]\nIf I'm going to mention the charms, I better point out the so-so elements to the game.\n\n[b]-Gameplay[/b]\nI dunno, platformers are so...bleh for me. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is one of my favorite games of all time but almost purely for nostalgic reasons. This is kinda how platformers are for me as a 21 year old, memories of a time when I used to like platformers. In Wuppo you do some hardcore parkour to get to places you need to go. Considering that some areas have no parallax and the screen just changes, it makes it hard to get from point A to point B. In Sonic you run left to right and the screen scrolls, this is parallax. In Fallout 3/NV/4 when you enter a door it has a temporary load screen then you pop out on the other side, this is screen change. Now pretend the screen change is instant without a load time, I am having a hard time coming up with an example in another game, because the screen doesn't scroll it leaves you disoriented and wondering where you are on said screen. This is Wuppo in some areas. Sometimes there is parallax, sometimes there isn't. Last part of the gameplay is combat. You shoot at gun at enemies, it does a certain amount of damage, you got to evade the enemies to survive and you can use health items to keep yourself alive....nothing special. It's not bad, just meh.\n\n[b]-Story[/b]\n\"But MoonKat, you just said the lore is part of the charm!\" Here is where you need to know the difference between story and lore. When I say lore I refer to the world, when I say story I refer to your character's storyline. Audio logs in Doom 3? Lore. Cut Scenes where your character is spying on a conversation? Story. Wuppo's story is boring. Without spoiling anything it's basically a Wum learning to not be a giant douche.......meh.\n\n[u]the Crap[/u]\nWuppo is not Game of the Year, it has some glaring issues that keep me from considering it a perfect experience.\n\n[b]-Lack of Explainations[/b]\nWhat hat does what? Am I supposed to kill this thing? What's my objective exactly? What's the advantage of being fat versus not being fat? How do I sneak? Oh...I can go in some boxes but not others? Why do I need to whistle? There is so many more questions I could bring up but it would spoil some story elements. I am not complaining about challenge, I don't need a minimap or hand holding tutorials, but actually knowing what items do would be helpful. Some of the solutions to puzzles are almost impossible to solve by yourself. A spoiler-free-example is when a fisherman needs a hook, where do you get the hook? A store right? Of course! But wait, there is a bunch of hooks...which hook does he need? I bought the hook and he fished out an item that I need for what exactly? Some of the cryptic moments are fun, but majority of the time leave me with a guide open.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\nI have a Nvidia 1070 Graphics card with a current gen processor and this game still stutters from time to time on max graphic settings.....why? It's hand drawn! \n\n[b]Only able to use 1 item at a time[/b]\nInstead of typing out a long explaination I'm just going to give you an instance of where this drives me mad. You can only equip 1 item at one time. A candle is used for light and sits on your head. If equipped, you can't use your gun. There is some enemies in pitch black areas......bull$%!#....I hate that mechanic.\n\nIn the end...Wuppo is a game you should definately pick up for 5 bucks when it's on sale. You'll get a lot of amazing experiences out of this game. It's not perfect, but isn't bad, it's actually pretty good. If you want me to cover more areas of the game, let me know and I will update the review. I left some space for any further information that you might request. \n\nTL;DR\nA cryptic platformer with meh gameplay but amazing charm that leaves you with intense curiosity. You will want answers, you will want to explore the unique world to find those answers. I give it a hard recommend as long as you go in with the expectation of playing a flawed diamond in the rough.", "timestamp_created": 1511882914, "timestamp_updated": 1511882914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37718573": {"recommendationid": "37718573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012919391", "num_games_owned": 989, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 782, "last_played": 1509722219}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute game, lots of fun.

Got it in a bundle. Didn't expect anything, didn't know about it. What I ended up with, was one of the best games I've ever played in certain categories.\n\nWuppo offers an immersive single-player exploration \"platformer\" built over the course of 7 years.  Where your actions seem to matter, and the world feels alive.  I voted Wuppo for the \"Suspension of Disbelief\" Steam award, because despite the wild setting, I was totally drawn in.  Wanted to know more, see more of this world.  ... (It ended too soon!)\n\nThere's just a wealth of detail and interestingly executed ideas that you won't find in even the best games that sets this game apart.  Details rarely found in a 2D format.  And this is where the game succeeds the most imo. (Also fun for a wide range of ages I imagine.)\n\nIt also features some memorable use of music, the occasional but interesting battle, and plenty of secrets to uncover.  It's just a really good example of an indie game.  A two person crew spend 7 years creating a game, no kickstarter/crowdfunding.  And they made something special.\n\nWhat can I say, but think about it!  It's currently 70% off and less than Undertale's soundtrack on sale.  I call that a good deal.\n\nIf you want some cons...? \nSuprisingly I prefer mouse and keyboard for this game.\nI admit I got stuck near the start by behaving unexpectedly.

The wuzziest, roundest and possibly laziest wum in the entire Wumhouse. So lazy, that you are a constant nuisance to the Wumhouse's main manager. When you spill your daily dose of ice cream all over the corridor, manager loses it and orders security to throw you over your room's balcony into the garden. After you lose few pounds when somebody steals the TV out of you (which you apparently ate previously) the new quest awaits for you - the search for a new home, happiness and your own little place in the world.\n\nAnd what a world it is! Don't dismiss this game by its child-like graphics! The biggest draw of Wuppo is it's extremely cohesive, vibrant and unique world to explore and experience. Game goes lengths and miles to deliver locations and places that allow you to breathe in the atmosphere. Areas are not only large and visually distinct, but they are also filled to the brim with NPCs, interactive elements and details.\n\nStreets, cities and homes are full of creatures which seemingly have lives on their own, trams and trains have their own timetables that are real time and not only for show, amusement park rides have their waiting lines that you need to endure, cities have council meetings you can participate in... This game reminded me of Shenmue of all things! Yes, Wuppo doesn't go to such lengths as the Dreamcast classic, but the attention to detail and player interaction make for one of the most inviting and entrancing game worlds in my recent memory... and [i]EVERYTHING IS CUTE AS HECK TO BOOT![/i].\n\nGame world also greatly benefits from the fact that Wuppo heavily rewards you for careful exploration, helping other people along your journey and being generally a good person. Thanks to that, player agency is high and time spent roaming through all the attractions was enjoyable, happy-go-lucky experience, especially when the dialogue and humor is quite good here all across the board and plot kept going naturally at reasonable pace.\n\nAnother unique aspect of Wuppo, is that it doesn't label itself as a particular 2D platformer. Game world is semi-open, seamless and expansive, but it lacks upgrades, doors and interconnectivity of metroidvania. There are bosses and combat, but it's quite simplistic and most of the time you will out of the danger in secure, inhabited areas. There are some small puzzle elements, but this game cannot be called a puzzle-platformer either. This perplexing mix is hard to categorize, but works out very well, despite some wonkiness here and there. I need the commend developers that they sticked to their own breed of 2D platforming game and didn't make another washed out metroidvania. This makes Wuppo [i]an adventure[/i] and not only a set of doors to open sequentially.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a place I need to drop some negatives, because there are a few to speak off. My few first moments into the game weren't so great, because I had a quite difficult time adjusting to the control scheme and inventory management. I played on gamepad and constant visits at inventory screen, to shuffle through the countless items wasn\u2019t very comfortable and felt sometimes pace ruining even further down the line (especially in action sections). You can set up a quick-selections and overall you can get used to the control scheme (which default sets jumps on [i]triggers[/i] of all places), but first hour was pretty difficult for me to grasp. You need to keep that in mind.\n\nIn addition, while I praised the mix of the gameplay mechanics, not everything gels in 100%. I found the default running and gunning lacking a bit of the punch and many puzzles in the areas felt a bit that they escaped from the classic adventure games with some noticeable obtusiveness. Fortunately, since the exploration is the main focus of the game, those problems aren't the dealbreakers, but Wuppo probably won't satisfy more mechanically oriented gamers that would like more snappy combat and/or more puzzle focus.\n\nTake everything I mentioned, add a quite expansive and lovely soundtrack that I consider buying and sincere plot full of silly lore and you get everything to make your final purchasing decision. For me, Wuppo isn't an ideal or exceptionally amazing game, but it remains remarkably unique, full of charm and rare quirks that makes it difficult not to recommend for the asking price, especially if you want to play something really different. You could beat the game in around 7-8 hours, but I personally spent twice of that. I will leave the game quite satisfied and I hope that you will also enjoy your stay...\n\n[i]\"Now go...

I really liked the look. The only thing I could really say negative about the visuals is that the coloring/shading of certain objects make it difficult to tell if they're in the foreground or the background for platforming purposes, and sometimes things don't visually stand out as important, because they blend so well with everything else. I was stuck in a section with vines early in the game, because I thought there was no way through, but the different dulled shades of brown on the screen actually were meant to convey a passage to drop down lower. Even knowing it's there now, unless I stare directly at it on my screen, I can still miss it.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nIf I was asked to describe Wuppo's music in one word, it would be \"pleasant.\" It's easy listening, and fits well enough with the world and its art style. As soon as I close the game each time, I cannot for the life of me remember a single string of notes, but it does the job just fine and I'll say it's pretty decent while you're playing the game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is a mish-mash of three major game types: adventure games, platformers, and...well, not a game type, but Metroid-style boss fights. I have enjoyed these things in other games: solving puzzles /opening new areas up in adventure games (a la the Space Quest or Deponia series), getting around by jumping from thing to thing to explore the world (a la Ori and the Blind Forest and older titles like Super Mario 64), and Metroid-style boss fights (a la Super Metroid, etc.). However, in Wuppo, I did not feel like any one of these gameplay types was handled well.\n\nAdventure games typically work well when you put the player in a fairly small area, rife with vibrant things to interact with, be it characters, contraptions, inventory interaction, etc. The solution should not always be obvious, but if you listen to characters and put the hints together, you can figure out what you need to do. Wuppo puts players in large areas, requiring platforming to navigate to different screens, giving the player hints like \"head underground.\" This means the player should be looking for digging utensils, right? Or stay close to the ground to find an entrance, right? Or find a machine or character who mines/tunnels, right? Nope. You go to the highest point in the entire region to go underground. \n\nYour only clue in the many screens is a bird saying \"this area seems important.\" It doesn't tell you that it's important right now or toward going underground, though. Why in the world would a person think that? The game gives you a completion percentage, and it was around 10% or so at that point, so I figured this would be an important place much later in the game, and immediately looked elsewhere for ways to get underground. This led me to wandering around aimlessly for a couple of hours, platforming my way back up again and again, lost until I finally used a walkthrough to continue. This is a poorly designed puzzle with no alternative solutions and you cannot complete the game without doing it.\n\nAfter that section, required actions to progress became much clearer. However, once you get to a city, many hum-drum side-quest-like actions are needed to raise a number called \"credit\" for the city to 100,000 to expand the city. I found the city already too large with various largely empty screens with a few statues or signs in the background, and a bunch of wums (people) walking around. I didn't want to expand the city due to a lack of motivation, but I'll talk more about that in a moment.\n\nPlatforming can be fun, but when mixed with backtracking due to not knowing where to go became annoying. I was hopping up to the top of the jungle-y region repeatedly, randomly looking for ways underground, and had to do the same platforming over and over again. It was dull. There are also typically no enemies in the game, aside from bosses. I think enemies might worsen things, thanks to the backtracking, but imagine if Super Mario Bros didn't have enemies and there were maybe 5 or so coins to collect in a level. No time countdown, no power-ups, no dying, but numerous places to fall and have to platform your way back up again each time you make a mistake (sans rare shortcut exceptions).\n\nThe Metroid-style boss fights are often big, you shoot them with charged or automatic paint gun shots, and they can often come at you out unexpectedly or with a small hint, which is in line with Metroid as well as Resident Evil games. I actually liked these for the most part. I handled the first 9 bosses, according to the game's boss-kill tracker, and not one boss fight was like the others, which I liked. One boss underground did zoom the camera out significantly, and it was quite difficult to keep track of my character in the mess, which made hitting the boss and avoiding attacks unnecessarily difficult.\n\nThere was also a single stealth section. I needed to steal something from two people. You can only do it at night, so you need to wait until the sun sets, and if you alert the people in the room, you get thrown out and have to do it over again, waiting until the next night, or loading your last save. Stealth elements in games are actually something I love, but Wuppo handled this poorly, in my opinion. Dishes are stacked up in the room, and you have to jump over them and land close to them to avoid alerting the people in the room, but if you knock a dish off, you have to do it over. The worst part is that the thing you need to steal is sitting on a big, breakable container, and the only way to grab what you need, is to land [i]on[/i] the breakable container. Unless you land [i]just[/i] right, the container will fall and break. I probably spent 20+ minutes repeatedly trying to do this, loading my game every time that container fell. It was incredibly frustrating and at no point did I enjoy this part of the game. Any delightful visual charm and peaceful music was undermined by this event.\n\nYou can purchase things in the game, but money seems finite, and many of the items you can purchase are incredibly high-priced. I felt like the economy needed some work, or at least a way to grind a little cash to buy things. I normally get excited when I see shops in games; not so in Wuppo, because I never felt comfortable spending my severely limited funds.\n\nThere [i]is[/i] a train on the west side of the world, and I won't spoil anything about it, but I thought it was charming and a neat idea, and there's a pit stop in the middle of the journey that was pleasant as well. I know it's vague, but I have to admit I liked that, and thought that was kinda innovative.\n\n[h1]Story & Motivation[/h1]\nWuppo has very little story. I would go so far as calling it a \"slice of life\" storyline, actually. I got just over 39% in, and the world isn't in danger, people aren't dying or kidnapped, there's no deep lore, few characters exist and each could be detailed in full in one or two brief sentences, and you are not on any huge quest. You're just trying to get a home. It's quaint and I like the idea of it, as well as its execution for a couple of hours. \n\nBeyond that, however, the lack of story, when mixed in with the large areas without much direction on where to go, made the game eventually become very boring for me. It got so bad that I went days and even weeks without touching the game.

I love the characters, I love the world design, I love the humour (although I might be a bit biased because I'm Dutch, and a few jokes you'll only notice if you speak Dutch). I even like the combat system in contrast to what some people say. I definitely do not regret buying the game.\n\nThe reason I wanted to emphasize that it is a good game is because of one thing that I can't let go. The final bossfight. I'll try to elaborate by not giving any spoilers.\nSummed up: it's really difficult, but not for the right reasons.\nDifficulty in itself is not something that's bad. Just look at games like Dark Souls. The reason that it's not done correctly in this case, in my opinion anyway, is because there are elements to it that make it incredibly annoying. Firstly, there is an attack that is unavoidable. I've read somewhere that it has a pattern and that you can dodge it, but after more than two hours (yes, it actually took me two hours on the highest difficulty) I haven't been able to dodge it more than once, and that was pure luck. \nSecondly, there was a lot of downtime in the fight. I had no choise but to use an exploit in the game to gain enough health to survive. If you know the game, I'm talking about [spoiler] using the coffee hat to slowly regain health while standing in a spot where you don't get hit much [/spoiler]. To my knowledge there isn't another way to gain enough health than to buy loads and loads of food, which requires loads and loads of money, which requires a lot of grinding (= also a lot of downtime).\n\nMaybe it's just me. I don't know. I do not have these complaints about any of the other bossfights.\n\nAnyway, just know that if you're a completionist and you're going to complete Wuppo on higher difficulties, I wish you good luck.", "timestamp_created": 1503861491, "timestamp_updated": 1503861491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34531189": {"recommendationid": "34531189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354512145", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1503794351}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuppo is a game with a cute art style and a few charming NPC interactions. Unfortunately, it's not enough to make it a compelling game. I really wanted to like it. It was clearly made with a lot of heart, but in the end it just fell flat and couldn't hold my interest.\n\nOne thing that comes up in other reviews is mention of Metroidvania game play. I think this is doing this game a huge disservice because it lacks any of the hallmarks of a Metroidvania game and it's clearly not trying to be one. If these reviews caught your interest, you will be disappointed.\n\nI honestly wouldn't recommend Wuppo to anyone I know, so it gets a \"no\" from me. However, I wouldn't outright dismiss the game. It has a strong following, so others must be finding something rewarding that just wasn't doing it for me. Proceed with caution.\n\nPros:\n[olist]\n[*]Cute art style\n\n[*]Great soundtrack\n\n[*]Some charming interactions with NPCs\n[/olist]\n\nCons:\n[olist]\n[*]Pacing. The game is mostly running around empty areas doing small errands with little story, mystery or reward to compel you to move forward. When you do finally reach something interesting, like a boss fight or puzzle, it is easy and short lived, making it ultimately unfulfilling.\n\n[*]There are several annoying mechanics, most of which involve waiting. Waiting for the subway in real life can be rewarding. You get to relax, think about things, people watch, etc. Waiting for the subway in a game is just boring.\n\n[*]The world is large, but exploration is neither compelling nor rewarding. Moving around the map feels more like a chore than an adventure.\n\n[*]The combat is clunky, largely unchallenging and simplistic. I feel like combat could have been left out and the game would have been better for it.\n\n[*]The currency used in the game is extremely scarce. I found myself entering survival horror levels of paranoia about spending so I wouldn't miss out on the big upgrade/item.

The game also doesn't hold your hand so it can be somewhat difficult to figure out what you're doing at times, but I personally really like that because it reminds me a lot of the old Nintendo games I grew up playing. I'm really tired of modern games just pointing an arrow in the direction of your next objective all the time. There's also no map so you better know your way around the world.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that your character doesn't look very unique and it can be easy to lose track of your character in certain areas of the game where there's lots of NPCs that look identical to you. My other complaint is a certain train system in the game that runs in real time and it can be a pain waiting for the train at your stop when you just want to move to the next area. Other than that, I don't have any real complaints.\n\nSeriously though, this game is definitely worth checking out! It's a hidden gem amongst all the garbage on Steam nowadays. Pick it up at full price, on sale, or however you can get it, just buy this game and support the devs!", "timestamp_created": 1503367047, "timestamp_updated": 1503367047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549884378910064697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34385704": {"recommendationid": "34385704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002601282", "num_games_owned": 567, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1503275583}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, So this is currently a Humble Bundle game, and as such, I don't normally hold out a lot of hope for some of the filler games.

It isn't a 50.00, 30.00, or 20.00 game.  It however is a lot of fun if you go into it with realistic expectations. I mean you are a little bouncy ball in a cartoon world. \n\nOverall, I liked it, and had I paid 10.00 for it, I would have been happy with my purchase.

At first i absolutely loved this game, because the introduction of the game is really well done, the interaction between the main character and the hotelier is hilarious. My love for the game quickly faded when it turned out that the gameplay is mostly superficial platforming and point & click style puzzles with a couple of nice bossfights thrown in there.\n\nGameplay:\nThe first puzzle was already confusing, there are 4 pictures of different races below a switch puzzle, however you had to throw random items on these. I really don't know how they thought a cooking pot resembles a race that looks like a potato.\nSure you have a bird that can sometimes be helpful he basically tells you what to do for the first puzzle but as often he can obfuscate the solution even further. In a later puzzle where you need to summon a dude the bird says the dude can't be summoned right now, so i thought well maybe i have do something else first, turns out he could be summoned you just need to turn off the lights again.\nThat is how i generally felt about the game, i had no idea where to go or what to do most of the time, so i just wandered around aimlessly until i found something to do, reminding me more and more of point and click games \u2013 a genre i hate.\nOther gameplay issues are that you can run out of money to buy an item that is necessary to beat  the game. In Popocity you need to buy an item and there are some jobs you can do to get money, however eventually these jobs become unavailable and then you have no way to get enough money other than going back to old areas and gather some money there which is boring and slow and i was almost ready to abandon the game right there.\n\nPacing:\nWhile the characters and the story are amazing, the pacing isn\u2018t. Throughout the game you can find filmstrips and because money is always tight you have to pretty much watch all of them because you get money as a reward for watching them, they are usually long and boring reading sections, wouldn\u2018t be so bad if it was voiced or funny cutscenes but it is just huge textboxes with a little picture in the background. Right before you are ready to fight the final boss they slap you in the face with a 10 minute read about how the Wuppo world functions.\n\nUser-interface:\nI wouldn\u2018t recommend playing this game with a controller, i couldn\u2018t find a good keybinding steup to make the platforming and using items work in a good way. It is better with mouse and keyboard because you can assign hotkeys to items but it still feels off. Probably because the mouse-wheel scrolls through every single item you have ever collected instead of just the ones you have hotkeyed? Or maybe i dislike it because you can\u2018t aim properly in this game and you can\u2018t hit an enemy that is directly in front of you? Or maybe i dislike that they designed some menu-items for a controller and others for mouse and keyboard? Maybe a little bit of all of these, it just doesn't feel right.\n\n\nTo summarize my experience in one sentence: In Wuppo you go through a bunch of frustrating puzzles for two hours to have a 2 minute fun interaction with an NPC and a cool 5 minute boss fight.", "timestamp_created": 1502101283, "timestamp_updated": 1502128801, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486856073141098022", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34071975": {"recommendationid": "34071975", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988186917", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 426, "last_played": 1502065919}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuppo starts off as a frabjous adventure through a whimsical world and snowballs itself into a dream fugue while teaching you to be nice to people even if you disagree and directly engaging the humerus bone.\n\nGreat for kids, too - might need to help out with a puzzle or two, and the last fight can get tricky even on Normal.", "timestamp_created": 1502066674, "timestamp_updated": 1502066674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34069236": {"recommendationid": "34069236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013513985", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1502054993}, "language": "english", "review": "neat little game, don't know how long it is so hard to say it's worth the full price.

Wuppo doesn't need a combat system. \n\nThe things the game does best are most certainly not combat based. It's the world building, the quick characterizations that leave you attached to so-and-so. The facial expressions used to convey an idea or a feeling, and the dialogue that is pretty genuinely inspired. The different races and their history and the borderline feeling of awe as you discover what the game is actually going to be about.\n\nSlapped on to all of that is a platformer-shooter combat system that could have been a fairly direct rip from any game of the NES era. But the controls aren't tight, your aim is clunky, and your mobility is lacking (so you can't dodge some of the bullet-hell-ish attacks you'll be dealing with). You have different weapons, but even though you can bind them to number keys, switching is kind of inconvenient given the number of other important items you'll want to have on that row. So really, you're more or less trading blows and stat checking against every opponent you fight. It just doesn't belong.\n\nAnd that would be forgivable if the combat weren't so large a part of the game. But you probably spend about a third of your time in combat, about a third of your time walking from one place to another, and another third in conversations and actually exploring your current objective.\n\nWuppo does a lot of things right.

It's the kind of game kids should grow up with, look back at, and feel nostalgia for. It's a metroidvania-esque 2D shooter with adventure and bullet hell elements in a mostly civilized world inhabited by charming creatures with a surprisingly well thought-out lore. For the detail oriented: a playthrough was 13 hours for me, the game is about 50/50 story to boss fights, and there's really nothing similar to RPG elements (other than the strong story) despite what people say. Honestly if you like the look of it, it's worth buying. If you're not convinced, try the demo.\n\nI feel like, the best things about [i]Wuppo[/i] (of which there are many) are best experienced rather than summarized, so I've glossed over those and I'm going to go straight to my gripes. I have a big criticism that has to deal with the game's story, and a minor one that frustrated me endlessly.\n\nStory spoilers: [spoiler] I feel like the game missed a real chance to talk in-depth about race problems. I mean it's there, the discussion about \"superior races\" and the subtle ways the wums oppress the other races, the way you're lead to believe the wums basically committed genocide against the fnakkers and that they're proud of it. I'm sure people will say it doesn't fit the tone of the game, that the game did it just fine, or that it doesn't matter but clearly the developers were making some kind of attempt to have the game comment on this. There's so much in the game that's about the races and their differences and the unreliability of one race's narrative over the others (e.g. You never hear what the blussers' characters are like, only that they were the wums gardeners and that they were happy with it. It's only after meeting one and also watching the blusser filmstrips do you understand how wums reduced them to that when their actual ideas and feelings about being gardeners were much more complicated, leading to the reasons they left the garden). I think the devs tried, but there was a real disconnect for me when I saw the fnakkers for the first time and not only were they portrayed as primitive (with African-styled instruments of all things) but their dialogue made them only slightly less violent and cartoonishly evil than what the wums paint them as (not to mention cannibalistic). So ultimately what, the racists who rule the world were right? The people in power should just throw those who oppose them down an endless hole and hope they all die? If anything doesn't fit the tone of the game, I would say it was that likely unintentional conclusion. [/spoiler]\n\nBut what's done is done, and I enjoyed the game irregardless. There's enough breathing room for a potential Wuppo 2, and I hope that if the devs are devoted to the ideas they committed into this game that they'll refine them for another.\n\nWhat I can't forgive was that gotdamn Simon Says music segment right near the end.

Public transports also move in real time, reinforcing the illusion that the world doesn't always just wait for you to show up.\n\nIn the end, I was just pleasantly surprised to have found a game world that was easy to get invested in, and to have found a game that just made me feel happy.", "timestamp_created": 1499456709, "timestamp_updated": 1499456709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560163378715515137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33347033": {"recommendationid": "33347033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051890325", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1399, "last_played": 1607709904}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the greatest game of all time", "timestamp_created": 1499443830, "timestamp_updated": 1511492095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33324641": {"recommendationid": "33324641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067809735", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 669, "last_played": 1548224877}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun, cute, 2D platformer that will keep you playing.", "timestamp_created": 1499375752, "timestamp_updated": 1499375752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33298504": {"recommendationid": "33298504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062060695", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 628, "last_played": 1498812743}, "language": "english", "review": "Good.", "timestamp_created": 1499309496, "timestamp_updated": 1499309496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33253474": {"recommendationid": "33253474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103297039", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 720, "last_played": 1499770929}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed it.

Before I tell you why you should BUY THIS GAME AND LEAVE A REVIEW, I'll explain why I had the change of heart.\n\nFirst, it was the Steam summer sale, I had a budget. I wanted adventure games. And Wuppo initially frustrated me. I knew the game would not hold my hand. But I didn't expect by how much. In the beginning of the game, I got lost. Queue frustration, I requested a refund and spent my money on another game.\n\nI wrote my negative review originally criticizing the lack of a world map which I felt was a detriment to the game. I soon learned that really, I was just spoiled by other games because Wuppo really doesn't need a world map.\n\nSoon after the review, I'd received a friend request by someone by the name of Knuist. :) I originally thought... \"Uh oh, it's one of the developers of Wuppo. Am I in trouble? Are they mad because of my negative review?\" Well, that certainly wasn't the case.\n\nKnuist wanted to have a conversation about what I found frustrating or difficult about the game. He was very nice, extremely courteous and understanding. He let me know the process behind the game design decisions and encouraged me to give it another shot through the demo.\n\nWell, I gave it another shot. ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE END. :)\n\n----Game Review Starts Here----\n\nWuppo is an EXTREMELY unique looking game with a fully realized and living world that has an entertainingly cute story and terrific music to boot. Now some of that might seem like buzzwords to you. But let me tell you how \"living\" these worlds are.\n\n- There are multiple societies with different lore and cultures.\n- Traversing through these worlds, you'll witness hundreds of npc's just carrying on about their day living their lives.\n- The world has a day/night cycle with weather effects.\n- There are trains, elevators and trams that run independently of the player. They operate with or without you.\n\nThese elements really make the game feel like a big world that you're just lost inside. It's really well done.\n\nThe gameplay is much of what you'd expect from a metroidvania, shooter format. But it's unconventional and that's what sets Wuppo apart. Your weapon is a gumgumgun that shoots multicolored gumballs at an arc, not straight. And the design of the worlds is EXTREMELY organic. Rolling hills and inclines abound, you won't be exploring boxes and hallways as you might in most metroidvanias.\n\nThe story is also unique. Seriously, there's not much about Wuppo that borrows staples from other games. The story is reminiscent of a saturday morning cartoon mixed with a fever dream. I know that sounds odd, but damn it, it's enjoyable.\n\nThe boss fights range from small skirmishes to TREMENDOUS bullet hells and they're all varying from one another. Some take strategy, some take brainpower.\n\nAs I said in my original negative review, there's no world map. This game doesn't hold your hand. Were you looking for an adventure? WUPPO IS AN ADVENTURE YOU WON'T FORGET. Were you looking for an easy adventure? Wuppo can provide that as well. It's not an impossibly difficult game for those who have the patience to enter it's world and actually expect something different.\n\nDon't make the mistake I did by playing Wuppo and expecting a game like any other. You'll be better served by opening your mind and accepting that, this excellent game is being given to you in a totally unconventional albeit highly entertaining way. :)\n\nAfter having beaten the game, I can thoroughly recommend this title. And if you decide to buy it, please leave it a review. This is Knuist & Perzik's FIRST game. And for a first, it definitely goes beyond the call of what many other indie developers start out with. We need more adventures like Wuppo and I say we definitely need to encourage developers like Knuist & Perzik. \n\nThanks for giving us something we've never seen before guys.

Like a microcosm of the earth, complete with separate populations, nations, war, intrigue and politics. You begin as a simple face in the crowd (in fact it's easy to become literally lost in the crowd, to forget which little guy is you among the hundreds of onscreen characters) but over time you work with or against the various parties, tribes, nobles, organisations and gods to make the world a better place.\nIt would be difficult to play this game without immediately falling in love with the strange and charming world of Wuppo.

Essentially you're a white fluff ball trying to save the world with a Gumgumgun. It is a unique and entertaining 2D RPG.\n\n[h1]Positive:[/h1]\n- Quirky but great art style and music.\n- Love the small details, like how certain words shake or are bold when an NPC speaks (for emphasis or emotion) or that you can't cut the line at the amusement park.\n- This game does not hold you by the hand. There are no arrows telling you were to go. No quest log. No map. You have to figure things out by yourself. Talk to NPCs, read what they say.\n- So many side-quests and little interactions. This game really rewards you for exploring.\n- Filmstrips will give you more background information about their world. If you're not interested, you don't have to watch them.\n- Bosses can be challenging. You really need to learn their patterns.\n- Every death is fair. You need to dodge those projectiles or position yourself properly. Get good, scrub.\n- I love that the NPCs are active. They're constantly running around, changing hats, buying items/food.\n- Shoutout to the Dutch developers who sneaked in Dutch words into their game. Big respect.\n- Your happiness is important.\n- Boss run is hard and shows you no mercy.\n- Large number of items, hats, consumables.\n\n[h1]Negative:[/h1]\n- I came across some bugs. Nothing game breaking.\n- Waiting for the train and trams can be boring (but the NPCs have places to go too, the world doesn't revolve around you).\n- I would have liked to have a map.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nWuppo feels like a testament to older games: (1) you're expected to figure things out by yourself, (2) if you die, it's your own fault.

Well, to be fair with Carlo, the Wum at the Wum House service desk, it\u2019s not fun at all cleaning ice cream off the beautiful rugs at the entrance and on the fourth level. Especially now, when all the cleaners have run away to Popocity. It\u2019s only part of the reason; the real reason is that Carlo dislikes cleaning (I\u2019m with you, Carlo), but throwing a Wum out of the Wum House for this, it\u2019s a tad extreme. Hey Wuppo! Did you hear what I say? You have to find a new place to live. Well, start cracking!\n\nWuppo is a platformer/adventure game with good puzzles where you control a cute, round character who has four legs and can make great double jumps. He is part of the Wum race, who are the most intelligent of four main species in the world, but lack of abilities.  The other three races are the Blussers, Splenkhakkers and the nasty Fnakkers. \n\nYou\u2019ll meet a bird, \u201cDenksnavel,\u201d fairly quickly in the game. This bird will give you hints every time you select him. The Allesweters is another character who you will be talking a fair bit with and can be found in different locations. He has a projector and can play the filmstrips collectable items you\u2019ll find within the world. \n\nThe world is extremely well-designed with great locations to discover, and it\u2019s not hard to navigate. Within the main places, you\u2019ll have to help other Wums or species to move forward in the game. Some will be challenging puzzles and others will lead to a fight with big, scary monsters! Please don\u2019t scare the kawum out of me! When you successfully help these characters and make them happy, you\u2019ll be rewarded with extra health points and items which in turn will help you to resolve the next puzzle or challenges in the world. There is a fair bit of reading in this game and you really need to take your time to go through it or you will miss important information. Bear in mind that you can come back to individuals and re-asked questions. The dialogue is really fun and you can select different answers when you interact with each creature.  \nIn some of the destinations, you\u2019ll find stores where you can buy or sell items using the smurt currency. You can obtain additional smurts either by helping other individuals, or when you kill enemies. \n\nFor me the game shines in the puzzles. However, you\u2019ll be fighting interesting bosses and some are not that easy to eliminate. Oh, by the way, you\u2019ll be armed with a GumGumGun which shoots coloured gums. There is a place where you can upgrade your weapons at a specific store in Popocity.\n\nSplendid artwork and the soundtrack is very cute. For the controls, whether you use the mouse and keyboard or the gamepad, they work fine and it is very easy to allocate binding keys to your inventory.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tSplendid artwork\n-\tWell-designed world\n-\tGreat puzzles\n-\tFun fighting bosses\n-\tFun dialogues\n-\tAchievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~    \n\n-\t I think the fighting bosses could be a notch harder\n\nThis game is a gem - thoroughly entertaining and fun to play!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this game. It's very reasonable in length for its price and doesn't outstay its welcome by throwing at you boss after boss, and you discovering new environments and new sights to see at a very constant rate. \n\nPROS:\n+Excellent, ADORABLE art style. \n+SPECTACULAR environments for multiple hub areas that were a delight to explore\n+Legit, GOOD bosses that were fun to fight even with the simple controls\n+Wide variety of fun items to use and try out. Even if some didn't serve a purpose, they were still SO CUTE. SO MANY HATS!!\n+The collectible filmstrips that are hidden throughout the game are a DELIGHT to watch! Collecting all of them, even using a guide, is a must!\n+High amount of polish in the game's interaction with characters and items. You can bring a character or item to a character who mentioned the former, and you will almost always get a delightful, distinct conversation.\n+Interesting lore included in the game regarding the various races you meet and play as.\n\nI hesitate to call the below flaws because they are mostly nitpicks and doesn't bring a detriment to the game. I enjoyed my experience regardless.\n\nAreas of Improvement:\n-Respawning enemies. Every new area that you get to (the next screen) will spawn a set number of enemies every time. You can never clear these out and they get irritating after you kill them the Nth time around.\n-There is a part of the game where you have to navigate a huge puzzle room to pass through. This segment was a grind and I spent way too long figuring it out. Coupled with the above complaint, this segment takes points away from an otherwise perfect game. You are definitely rewarded upon completion though.\n-Near the end, a certain character will give an expository lore dump about the world and how to defeat a certain final boss. This was extremely dry and confusing. I appreciate the dev's efforts to flesh out the world, but this could have been done better.\n\nAll in all this was one of the most interesting and enjoyable single player games I've played in a while. If you aren't fazed by the nitpicks, this is a must-buy if the trailer in any way appeals to you.

It just caught my interest and I thought it'd be a fun explorative endeavor to try this game out. But oh boy howdy, I totally didn't expect what was coming next. To sum it up, I guess I found out why the game has a 100% rating.\n\nEverything in this game is just so captivating and weird, it makes you want to explore more and more and learn all about it. The world of Wuppo is colorful and happy, perfectly crafted to keep a smile in your face for the entire duration of the ride. It reminds me of the times I first played videogames, seeing big worlds and exploring everything they had to offer with a deep child-like interest. I didn't think that any games of this generation would be capable of recreating this sensation, but I can safely say that Wuppo does that with utmost grace.\n\nBut enough with vague statements, let's go straight to the precise details about the game:\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a metroidvania/shoot-em-up/adventure mash-up. It has a big emphasis on exploration and interaction. The game doesn't have much combat in it, which would make it rather easy... That is, until you meet the bosses. They might be a bit tough at first, but all are a fair challenge. Most of the actual challenge of the game is in solving puzzles, going through some simple obstacles and fighting bosses. But while you're not actually doing any of that, you'll be mostly looking for interactions or items to collect. The game doesn't really guide you much, so exploring all you can is the best method of progressing.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, it is extremely colorful and happy, and pretty much everything is criminally adorable. But even with the seemingly simplistic looks, the world feels filled to the brim with life all around. Wherever you go, you will find other creatures just minding their business, moving back and forth while sometimes carrying something. All the movement makes the world feel incredibly lively and believable.\n\nNow about the story... It starts quite small, with you just simply trying to find a new home, but it then somehow manages to go all around. The complexity of the story grows surprisingly fast. There is plenty of lore and backstory to uncover, all only limited to how much of the game you explore. Also, you better keep track of all the new words you'll be learning from the game, there's gonna be quite a lot of them.\n\nAnd about the content. As of writing this, I got 17 hours of play time for the game. And 17 hours is exactly what I needed to finish it with a meticulous search for collectibles. But after reading through the guides, there seems to still be a bunch I've missed. There is plenty of stuff to uncover like new items, more maximum health by doing things that make you happy (yes, you gain more health by merely searching for happiness), the collectible filmstrips to reveal more lore, and the boss fights that are sometimes rather well hidden. And even after finishing the game, you can still try and show off your skills on the boss rush mode you'll unlock then. Exploring the world is extremely rewarding, giving you quite a bunch of surprises.\n\nOverall, I REALLY liked this game, and I am absolutely certain that you will like it too.

Pain and suffering has no bounds and even video games are not afraid to show these issues. \n\nLovingly rendered blood and body parts fly apart realisticly more and more every generations, and always remind us that its your fault that you caused this. We either become heros in the darkest of times, shattered from what we see, or become the monsters of no boundries to continue the cycle of killing.\n\nand then theres Wuppo\n\nFirst thing i want to say that i really like this game, even though im the sort of person that laughs at dead baby jokes, watches robot chicken, and shockingly of all, enjoy's POSTAL 2 Like 99% of the world population, if they were raised like me. \n\nSo what we have here is a game made by two people and i don't know if their a couple or not, and ironicly their names sound as jibberish as the words you'll hear in the game.  Who comes up with the word splennaker, if i spelled it right. So it throws at you a nonsense dictionary, for a world of nonsense. So after beating the game you'll know more words from this game, then any of the unusual words from a spelling bee.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\n\nNow how do i say this.... its a very unusual metroidvania. How the game works is that it pulls a shadow of the collosus on you, or LISA if your a masochist who thinks suffering is fun, by making alot of boss encounters put to their fullest. Each boss encounter is unique and has the flaws of what happens when you add to much boss varerity. What it means is that the mid-way bosses will be harder then the end game boss. That giant ball of lint has killed me more times then the world ending uhh... attempt at drawing a human face. \n\nThe only way to kill these bosses, (YES i said kill in a game that has the Nintendo kid friendly vibe to it) is to use a varerity of weapons like.... some sort of tube that shoots paint, and a  'bucket' that makes you spit water. This review is gona have more full stops then the prince of persia: sands of time script. They are all ranged and you are always encouraged to use the full mobility of the, Wum? did i say that right and when you defeat enemies, sometimes the drop smurt OK HOW IS THIS DUTCH!?! So you must be confused with all this nonsense as i am, well if you really want to know what the story is, that you are guy finding home, ok end of plot. \n\nSo in between the slightly engaging boss fights it has one of the best use of pacing i have ever seen in a game. What it does is that it makes you uncertian of what will happen next. One time i was talking to an elevator operator to my own whim, and then i see a bunch of chefs run down the hall. I stoped the dialouge and went to see what is going on, then boss fight. If it was most games it would wrestle the controls from you for a cutscene or make you go down an obvious corridor to continue the story, but events naturally unfold in the game. So it feels like something that is worth the time and effort to be involved in, instead of a fancy script sequence with explosions and, oh look the sky looks slightly more realistic.\n\n[u]atmosphere[/u]\n\nEverything about this game has this cuetsy artstyle of a saturday morning cartoon without the bad script writing. It has the perfect blend of crudness and attention to detail to make a massive world. After all were stuck with a cotton ball for legs and have the defensive capability for ourselves as a cotton ball. So its designed to make everything look big and cluttered with special affects.The game can manage under a hundred ai walking simutaniously, and enough bullets going around the screen to embarase a Bethesda RPG. Impressive for something made in a free game maker engine.\n\nSo why does it have this, well to make this strange world of nonsense. Everything is made as it needs to, and makes alot of strange locations that are worth checking out. Especially having to wait real time in a line, A LINE, what other game makes you wait in a line and i spent over 10 minutes waiting for the worst rollercoaster ride, not even worthy for an addition to LEGO land. But i went on, because it felt believable and everyone in the game isn't another dull npc that does their predictable routes.... like a bethesda RPG, ok i'll stop.\n\n[u]conclusion[/u]\nWuppo not even that name links to anything in the game, is a fantastic metroidvania game with satisfying uh, paint gun play. Full of charm, hardwork, and creativity to make something 'Magicaaaaaaaaaaal', ok its a good game, no more sarcasim. It has the friendly 'anyone can play it' vibe without feeling forced and artificial. \n\nIts a game thats you will end up playing once through two days, which is enough. Whats made is made perfectly without overstaying or underwhelming and the best part is, no sequel bait. So the two Men, Women, couple i dunno im not dutch, will make another game and i will look foward to their latest installment.\n\nSo in short BUY THIS GAME.\n[spoiler]unless your busy i dunno i have to much free time, everyone keeps telling me to get a job, but thats ok because its a free country and no ones stopping you from leaving and dying from the cold... am i gonna die.

This cuteness is not is not just added for its own sake, but its aesthetic and style really serves the purpose to complement and add to the feel of the world. What I mean by this, is that the world is very friendly and open to exploration and has generally a very laid back atmosphere. Most of the world's inhabitants that you encounter are friendly and can be interacted with for some possible rewards or information. Some can be triggered into attacking you, but if this happens when you have the bird equipped for example, I can't really blame them.\n\nAt the start of the adventure you are kicked out of the room you live in and become forced to explore the world and find a new place to live. You traverse the world through platforming and this doesn't mean going from left to right; you are free to choose where to go, but you'll quickly find obstacles that you have to overcome in order to reach the newer parts of the map. The platforming itself is very satisfying with good reactive controls and almost no frustration due to there being almost no enemies or hazardous pitfalls. Should you die, or miss a jump and fall all the way down, there are plenty of potential save points that you can quick load to. This may sound that this makes the game too easy, but I feel this was just done to not hinder you in exploring the world. The real challenge lies in the bosses and \"puzzles\".\n\nShould you encounter an enemy, then you can take fire at them with the weapon you have equipped -- this will mostly only be necessary for the boss encounters.\n\nThe controls itself were straightforward enough, but they did require me to get used to them. I use a controller and when you fire your weapon you control where the attack goes with the right analog stick (360 degrees). I normally use the \"A\" button -- XBOX controller -- for jumping, but this makes attacking while jumping hard to pull off. The game therefore starts with the jump button being assigned to the left bumper (LB), but after some experimenting I decided to switch this to the right bumper (RB) instead. The game lets you re-assign any button you want. It does seem that because of the way you control your attack, this is a platformer that is easy to be played with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nMost of the weapons you use will fire an continues stream of particles at the location you are pointing to. This means that the bosses have plenty of hit points and you usually have to hit them a lot of times to whittle them down. The bosses can be quite challenging, but they often are also a highlight of the game. I can think of 7/8 off the top of my head that had some really creative and memorable designs in both their looks as well as in their way of fighting -- usually with multiple stages -- that can easily match up with the ones from various classic 2D platformers in terms of the quality of gameplay. They didn't add the boss run as a feature for nothing.\n\nTo make the boss encounters easier, you can up your health from 100 to a maximum of 200. You can get these bonus \"feel good\" health points in a variety of ways, like simply just talking to certain NPC's, or participating in events. I once got a point by just passing a painting I had made that had been hung up in the hall. The most straightforward way is to find and collect the various \"filmstrips\" hidden throughout the world. When watching them some of these will give you a point, but by collecting all of them in an area, this automatically gives you 5 life points. It doesn't sound like much, but the bosses can hit hard and most boss encounters have parts where you can get back lost health. So, any way to survive an onslaught, raises your chance to be victorious.\n\nOne part of the game that can be off-putting to some, is that it features situations where you have to come up with a solution in order to proceed further into the game -- it has adventure game elements after all. I'm hesitant to use the word \"puzzles\" even if it is what it boils down to, because this can be associated with the minigame-like scenarios you can find in point and click adventure games; Wuppo is more action oriented. Most of the time you are required to search for certain items, which you then use to open a new path. Talking to the NPC's can give you info to what items you need and what use they have. Also, equipping certain items can trigger events. Personally I would say that I encountered only a couple of situations where I was stumped for a bit, but I can understand that some people don't like this element. However, there are some good guides available now, so you can look up a solution for if you get stuck.\n\nWhat I consider to be the best part of Wuppo is its fantastic world and the amount of world-building that goes on in it. A lot of  people are raving about the \"charm\" of this game and indeed, it oozes it. This is of course highly subjective on my part, but my experience with Wuppo, I can best describe as Nintendo-esque. Honestly, while playing Wuppo, I immediately started comparing it to the Zelda and Paper Mario games. Of course, Wuppo is not as polished as what Nintendo produces, but we can't hold an indie game to those standards. Anyway, the background of the world; all the interactions with its characters; the situations you find yourself in; and how the characters behave in all of the different areas in relation to each other, it all fits and comes together wonderfully. You really get the felling that you are walking around in a fleshed out world where all of the characters have their own lives and way of thinking. As an example, in one part of the game you have to use a train, this train has an in-game schedule, so it can be that you have to wait in line during which time you get to observe Wums going all over the place. Then, when the train arrives, you have to wait a bit for the departing passengers and after that the cleaning crew. The wait isn't very long -- less than a minute --  but these little details add so much to the world and they can be found everywhere; clearly a lot of love went into this game.\n\nThe soundtrack fits the game perfectly and adds so much to its charm. Looking back, there really are quite a lot of terrific tunes that build up the atmosphere.\n\nAll in all, it's hard to give Wuppo an objective numerical rating. I could say it deserves an 8 out of 10, because it does have some rough edges, but when the game works, I felt like playing a 10 out of 10 game. It has such a uniquely genuine feel to it, which is too abstract to really factor into the sum of its parts; the people that are attuned to its vibe, will enjoy it immensely for this reason alone, but this will not necessarily apply to everyone. Neverthelessl, the world-building; the interactions with the varied colorful charactars; the boss encounters (most of them); the art style; the terrific soundtrack; the sense of humor and whimsical nature; the fun platforming; and the writing of the story and various dialogues, all contribute to an amazing game, that will put a smile on almost anyone's face and deserves to be labeled as a \"gem\".\n\nWow, this review went on longer than I thought it would, but I had some free time on my hands.

The game's technically structured into levels or I guess the more fitting description would be regions, as you keep unlocking the next one as you progress but the world is still open and explorable if you want to backtrack for instance, and you even do unlock fast travel very very late game, each area will have a different objective to progress to the following one which will usually be about solving a puzzle, obtaining a certain item or fighting a boss of which there are 17 of them\n\nI think most of the bosses are generally well designed and fun to fight against but they do get a little bit bad near the end of the game, where you'll fight what feels like just a bunch of regular enemies, but they're considered a boss for some reason as if it was inflating the total boss count and I don't want to spoil too much here but I don't really like the final boss all that much either, sure it's hard but I think that fight is more of a clusterfuck of projectiles than anything else, also your weapons aren't really all that great at shooting directly upwards but that guy tends to float around anyways often times just barely out of range for your weapons, but then there's the Giant Dust Monster or the Rock Statue which are some of my favorites which were challenging but also really enjoyable to fight, they all have their own unique patterns which you have to learn to tackle them efficiently, sure you may die a few times finding out those patterns, but that's part of the fun of fighting these bosses to me, difficulty varies between normal, hard and insane, which changes how much damage enemies do to you, I personally went with hard for a decent challenge but nothing too far out there\n\nThe puzzles on the other hand even if there are few of them, they are all well put together in my opinion, they're not overly complex or anything but they play on the game's lore quite nicely, there's a big temple near the end and I think that's the best example of it in the game, it really is something quite good and there are definetly some crazy surprises there, part of which is some of what I mentioned about the sountrack too but I really don't want to ruin it for you\n\nAlso about the objectives I mentioned earlier they're usually good too but there is one big exception around the mid game where you go to this city and it has this \"credit\" system, where you can contribute to increase an overall score of sorts of the town and you can do it through a couple different minigames which are fun don't get me wrong here, but the overall score that you need seems to be way more than it should've because you have to repeat these minigames a looot to get there, to the point where it gets really repetitive and almost feels like it was done to pad out the game a little bit, I'm not a fan of waiting mechanics in general but I do think they have their time and place, like in the Splenkhakker park for instance where you have to wait around for the rides and stuff, I mean it's just a fun optional thing and I think it adds some charm to the region overall\n\nAnd that's one thing I think that this game's honestly full of, charm, I mean Splenkhakker park? The names of these races are kinda wacky, I don't know if it means anything, I mean the developers are Norwegean so there is a language barrier there I suppose, but there's also the humour in the dialogue and it's all upbeat and lighthearted, it's definetly a really nice experience when you meet a new character and get to talk to them which will usually make you smile just reading what they have to say, the story is rather simple in the grand scheme of things, but it's things like these that carry the game and elevate it to something really unique and special and that ties in to the collectables that this game has which are Filmstrips which show you a little bit more about this game's world and lore, or just some funny situations and then there's Happyness, which you can get by doing all sorts of stuff around the levels or on conversations with NPCs where you choose a specific dialogue option or do something for them, not your typical quests or anything by the way, the game's more clever than that, there are also a few fun secrets and easter eggs out there so I'd definetly recommend you keep your eyes peeled while exploring and also return to some older areas once you're late into the game\n\nSo overall this game's gonna take you around 12 to 15 hours to beat depending on how much you want to explore and all that, but personally I really think this game's worth it, it's a really nice fun experience that doesn't really take itself all that seriously and I think we need more platformers like this, it kinda reminds me of Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit, which was a similar game in spirit in my eyes, like the way I felt playing it, it's hard to explain and I'm probably sounding kinda pretentious here so I'll just say this, I'd definetly recommend Wuppo for pretty much almost anybody and it's gonna make you really happy while playing it and for just $15 dollars or your regional equivalent I think it's a nice purchase", "timestamp_created": 1479928519, "timestamp_updated": 1479928569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500525772571563721", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26780471": {"recommendationid": "26780471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029629140", "num_games_owned": 902, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 614, "last_played": 1636208084}, "language": "english", "review": "This is really enjoyable game with interesting world!

The storyline and dialogue can be a bit abstract at times, but I found the humor in the game spot on, and amidst much laughter I came down with several lingering cases of permagrin! Certain cutscenes along the storyline are very visually intense, and I found myself very immersed in what was occurring. The ending of the game becomes a bit... confusing (as the lore gets dramatically expanded and [spoiler] you're given \"fast travel\" access throughout the world, to tie up loose ends or keep exploring [/spoiler]), but I felt very satisfied after beating the game and pleased with my accomplishment.\nSome of the bosses are quite challenging, and the inventive/creative design of the world and its inhabitants always kept me smiling and impressed. The music was also quite catchy! At some point I will certainly buy the soundtrack, as I'm finding certain songs stuck in my head throughout my recent days. Wuppo's music will continue to play in my head as serve as a mnemonic draw to the unadulterated fun I had while playing this game.\n\nOverall, I sincerely enjoyed my time with Wuppo, and believe it deserves a lot more recognition that it currently has.

The combat is also good, although simplistic, with unique and challenging bosses that appear in the most unexpected places.

A world filled with Wums, Blussers, Splenkhakkers, Fnakkers and a handful of other races. You are a Wum living in the Wumhouse, a house where every Wum can live in leisure, but seeing more and more Wums leaving to the new underground city of technical development Popocity. After you've made a mess of the hallways in the Wumhouse, AGAIN, you've been thrown out of the house. Now homeless, your adventure begins where you meet other characters, fight strange bosses, solve enviromental puzzles, help communities, save the world, and find a new home.\n\nStrong Points:\n\n+ The world - Building a world ain't easy, especially one with races and technologies so different from ours. But the developer managed to not only create a consistent world, but one that feels very alive and full of things to explore. A great achievement.\n\n+ NPCs and their interactions - The world is filled with small little creatures with small little lives. They don't feel like static objects that speak the same sentence their whole lives, but as real and alive creatures. Big plus for writing and coding all these dialogues for all the little interactions, even when they are insignificant to the plot, just to keep the immersion.\n\n+ Music - The soundtrack is gorgeous and fits to every situation our little Wum is thrown into. A great achievement by the composer.\n\n+ Animations - Very fluid. Love how the expression of our little Wum changes at different dialogue options.\n\n+ Difficulty - The bosses and environmental puzzles are sometimes hard and challenging, but never unfair. Great job.\n\nAverage Points:\n\nT Gameplay - You don't play Wuppo for it's inventive gameplay: it's your average Indie Metroidvania. But that isn't needed for a game like Wuppo, the gameplay is the medium you use to explore and interact with the world, and it does that just fine.\n\nWeak Points:\n\n- Art style - Sorry Lars, but most of it looks like it was made in MSPaint. Sometimes it looks nice, and sometimes it's just plain ugly. However, the art style is consistent throughout the game, so it doesn't break the immersion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWuppo is a charming game with a great world to explore that feels very alive.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE MAJOR ISSUE.\n\nI think about games that hit the closest to real, honest classic gaming. Authentic and not forced or fabricated. For example, I think Bleed is the closest an indie game has gotten to a legitimate Gunstar Heroes successor. With Wuppo, I think this is the first indie game I've played to feel, in its presentation, with its cast of quirky characters, with its music, its gameplay systems, etc. like a Nintendo-made game. It may not LOOK like one (The art is more like a very cute spin on An Untitled Story), but it sounds, acts and feels like one in just about every way. If you don't like the direction the Paper Mario series has gone, this game is not Paper Mario, but it has that same kind of writing, and worldbuilding, and overall fun and adorability.\n\nThere is a huge amount of bosses (17!!), a theme park with rides you can ride on, an underground city with jobs (we'll get to that), an apartment complex full of nutty people, a forest tribe of flower people, islands in the sea to find, another dimension entirely-- the world of Wuppo is enormous. Not quite the size of a game like Opoona (another similarly quirky and wonderful game), but much larger than you'd expect on first playing the game.\n\nThe combat and general interface are relatively simple. Point and click to fire, WASD to move. You can throw items on pedestals and give items and money to people for trade. Part of the fun of the game is finding things in shops that you have no idea what they are, and sometimes you might need them. Why does a city sell a diving helmet? Why does an apartment sell rocks? You'll find out!\n\nOkay, let's talk about the elephant in the room, and I haven't read reviews lately so I dunno how people will feel about this, but: THE POPOCITY SECTION OF THE GAME IS REALLY TEDIOUS. You will spend about 3 hours in Popocity, an underground city underneath the Wum village, trying to build Credit for the city in order to finance the city's big expansion. This means getting jobs, performing tasks, buying items from shops, staying in the hotel, etc. \n\nThis is all fine, and I liked the concept INITIALLY. The problem is that there just isn't enough to do here. You can sell newspapers (and after doing it 8 times you unlock a side quest, which-- by the way, that tells you something about the tedium doesn't it? Doing the same minigame 8 times?) but the only change is how many papers you deliver, and whether it's to Central or to Old Town. You can participate in debates at City Hall once a day, but there are very few topics (we already decided on the painted smakoffel!! Three times!!) . You can find Kneft monsters for Credit once a day, which only varies slightly in how the enemy waves spawn. You can buy items from a seedy shop at outrageous prices for 1000 credits a pop. And you can work in the factory, which consists of jumping up and down on a seesaw over and over again.\n\nThere's just not enough to any of these jobs to make grinding out the credit fun. Each time you do several jobs and go back to the Credit final tally you'll be left with a feeling of \"really?? I still have that much to go??\". I feel like this can be fixed either by increasing the credit that jobs give or by providing more variety to the jobs. For example, why not more topics at City Hall? Why not a police job tracking down criminals in the city? What if a machine breaks down at the factory and you can get extra Credit for fixing it? If the message is \"work is supposed to be tedious\", then it comes across the same as the infamous treadmill from Super Paper Mario -- in the end, it's still tedious and that's all that matters.\n\nALL THAT SAID, Wuppo is a fabulous game. I can't not speak about that section because it makes up a third of the game, but the other two thirds are so weird, so wild, so wonderful, so witty, so silly, that it kept me smiling all the way to the end.

The controls and animations are fluid and feel natural, and there's so much to discover and learn in the early game that I have to give it a quick review for those curious.  Wuppo has the same charm that I would expect from an entry in Yoshi's series of games or better yet, Kirby.  The world is immediately presented to you as being well-established and it makes no apologies for bringing you, the player, in before you have any clue as to what it's all about.  Tutorial nonsense is kept at an absolute minimum, with only the most obtuse details being presented in easy to digest comments from NPCs.  The music is brilliant and adds a level of depth you'd think was only reserved for games in much different calibers; the soundtrack is refreshing and simply breathtaking, with some elements being pseudo-rhythm based.  The first couple boss (I think?) encounters were super hard but gave off that lightbulb moment when I realized the pattern and how the arena had to lend itself to my advantage.  \n\nAn open world that doesn't hold your hand but also doesn't try to diminish your abilities at every turn- why can't more games understand this simple concept?  Yes, there is a gap between Nintendo Hard and Tryhard Hard.\n\nWuppo is not a game that panders to anything, really.

But the deeper you fall down the rabbit hole, the more you realize how much this game has to offer. It has a lot of charm and a lot of heart, especially seeing how it mostly comes from only two indie developers, and the soundtrack is very engrossing (I'd recommend getting the ultimate edition if you've got the money for it).  The puzzles can be very tricky at times, but they're never too overwhelming--especially since you have an in-game guide that can toss you hints if you're stuck.\n\nThe game has quite a few bugs here and there, but there are save spots all over the place and it literally takes a second to save, so as long you don't forget to pop into one, you should never lose more than a couple minutes' progress from a crash.  The devs have been VERY involved with taking feedback from players and are actively seeking out bugs to fix for their next update, and it just goes to show how much they care about the game and their fans.\n\nAll in all the game will take up about 13 hours on your first playthrough, many more if you're a completionist or want to give one of the higher difficulties a shot.  Between the cute characters, beautiful scenery, enchanting soundtrack, and fascinating story, I'd say this is definitely worth a buy.\n", "timestamp_created": 1475367503, "timestamp_updated": 1475367503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525878548622131348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25807159": {"recommendationid": "25807159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050794696", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1698184292}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who is not a fan of platformer games, I'm so impressed with this little gem.

There are a variety of bosses and challenges packed inside the game waiting for you to face them.\nI enjoyed collecting film strips and reading into the backstory of the world I was in (along with hilarious NPCs that threw their two cents in every now and again).\n\nThere are so many hidden secrets in this game, its almost impossible to find them all on your first playthrough. You can challenge yourself with INSANE mode, or just kick back during normal mode.\nThe enemies in the game aren't repetitive, and all the boss fights are pretty unique. You can tell the developers put a lot of hard work into this game.\n\nYou also have an insanely large inventory, so you'll most likely never run out of room during your adventures. With that, there are a good handful of hats to collect in the game to customize your character whenever you please.\n\nThe game's overall smooth controls make it very nice to move around in. (I often found myself jumping all over the place whenever I got the chance because it was honestly really satisfying seeing a little blob do sick backflips).\nThe game also pays attention to small details such as kicking rocks around as you walk past them, knocking over dishes if you jump around them, etc, so that's kind of a big deal.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the game is Wonder Splenk. Its literally a theme park. You don't need to go there to progress through the story, however, there's no reason to pass it up. At Wonder Splenk, you can go on rides, get your fortune told, and play mini games. Be careful though; venture too far out into the sea and you'll be greeted by.. well, that's for you to find out. IF YOU DARE.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes platformers, quirky stories, and / or challenging boss fights.\nSo take out your gumgum gun and get ready for a trilling adventure filled with Wums and other cute, small creatures!", "timestamp_created": 1475160046, "timestamp_updated": 1475160046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25766218": {"recommendationid": "25766218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029189482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1475179356}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been following this games' production for a while now and have had a chance to play it while it was still in the early stages of beta.\nBack then the story was already solid and the gameplay was smooth and fun.\nNow that it's finally released I didn't even hesitate to buy it.

Well, you might like Wuppo. \n\nFull disclosure; I have been given a key before the time of writing this review. However I can confidently say I've enjoyed my time with the game thusfar. What starts off as a silly plot about a Wum dirtying a hallway, quickly throws you into a world and quest bigger than yourself. A very charming world, I might add. From the angry desk manager Carlos to elevator boy to loudmouthed Denksnavel, the first minutes set a great atmosphere. Don't let it's cartoony silliness fool you, however, when it comes to the gameplay. Wuppo asks you to pay attention and a lot of it.\n\nExploration is a big part of Wuppo and it rarely outright states where you have to go next. It's story is a puzzle as much as individual sequences and boss fights can be. Wuppo has little intention of holding your hand and it will let you know. Early, frustratingly and brutally. Fortunately there are save points a plenty and the reward of solving a puzzle, beating a platforming section or wooping some boss ass is all very satisfying. Don't get discouraged by some of the harder or more hidden bits, it pays off in the end.\n\nWhat I liked most about Wuppo is how it marries it's world and gameplay with it's overlapping atmosphere. There's a boss somewhere midway that the further down you get his health, the more you feel like bullying him than vice versa. There's a boss whose projectiles you have to get hit by just to survive, instilling a feeling of desperation. There's a part in the game that tells you to [i]get a job[/i]. It's filled with characters going about their lives, whose actions are just as important to the world as yours and individual NPCs their decisions are reflected in map and level design. All of this makes Wuppo, even with it's silly exterior, feel like a strongly immersive game. Just... Be ready to work for some of that experience.\n\nOverall, if you like puzzle-platforming, possess the power of observation and enjoy a zany sense of humour, I think you'll enjoy getting lost in the world of Wuppo.", "timestamp_created": 1475158197, "timestamp_updated": 1475158197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669844210147857666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1462, "total_negative": 113, "total_reviews": 1575}, "cursors": {"AoJ4sPiRu9cCd/ukYg==": "Thu Nov 23 12:46:45 2023"}}
