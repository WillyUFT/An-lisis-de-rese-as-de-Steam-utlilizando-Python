The graphics and soundtrack along with how Ori looks while escaping areas in this game are definitely worth watching without all the death frustrations.\n\nExploring in this game was very frustrating because I was constantly dying in one hit.  Once I learned how to get past this spot I would die at the next spot within less than five minutes.  This cycle continued repeatedly over and over again.  I wish there was some breathing room in between these deaths to enjoy exploring this beautiful game.  Ori would also sometimes not perform certain actions at critical moments leading to more deaths.  I also do not like it when these deaths are related to something that was off screen or very hard to see.  It feels cheap and adds to the frustration.  \n\nCombat was boring.  Only one button to press for a limited range homing projectile to attack a random enemy.  There were also no bosses to do combat with.  Escaping seemed to be the bosses.  Ability upgrades were also generic and did not add much to the game-play.\n\nOverall I was more frustrated getting through this game rather than having fun.  I was given the next Ori game as a gift and heard it improves a lot from the shortcomings of this game.  Watch and enjoy someone else complete this game and then play the next Ori game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1700434738, "timestamp_updated": 1700434738, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0,

The main advantages of easy mod are that:\n\n-Resources (spirit light, energy, life) are more abundant, and upgrades cost less (helpful for sure)\n- Enemies have less health and deal less damage, but there are still looooots of enemies/obstacles that will kill you instantly. Overall, i found the combat difficulty to be easy even as someone who doesn't usually play these sorts of games, but then you land on a spike and you have to do it all over again anyway.\n-  The boss sequences (e.g. [spoiler] escaping the ginso tree, battling kuro, etc [/spoiler]) have a checkpoint in the middle so you don't have to do the entire thing in one go.\n\nTL;DR: this game requires a lot of precision (often under time pressure), and the sheer frustration of some sequences made me question why I was willingly doing this with my free time.

Es un juego maravilloso, eso est\u00e1 claro, pero si comparamos cada juego metroidvania con \u00e9ste, nadie se sentir\u00eda satisfecho porque no llenar\u00eda sus expectativas. Ori no es Hollow Knigth, y eso no va a cambiar.\n\nPara iniciar mi rese\u00f1a (y esto es algo que dudo que alguien me vaya a discutir) el OST es maravilloso. Es m\u00e1gico e inmersivo, adem\u00e1s de que busca innovar en algunos detalles (Un ejemplo de esto es que uno de sus temas est\u00e1 hecho con la escala Hex\u00e1fona). Es fabuloso cada detalle de su banda sonora, y por momentos cuando estoy jugando simplemente quiero ir a abrazar a Gareth Coker y agradecerle por existir.\n\nEn cuanto al apartado visual, aunque considero que su secuela hizo un mejor trabajo, no creo que est\u00e9 mal en lo absouto. Ninguna parte de los fondos o dise\u00f1os luce fuera de lugar, y la iluminaci\u00f3n me parece fant\u00e1stica.\n\nLa historia, por otro lado, se me hace simple de entender, y el enemigo es un personaje con el cual se puede empatizar. Adem\u00e1s, tener a sein como un guia, pero que no est\u00e1 constantemente hablando y molestando (Como personajes al estilo Paimon, que buscan guiar pero llegado un punto se vuelven irritantes)\n\nPara finalizar, la jugabilidad es super interesante. Aunque sea una f\u00f3rmula basica de todos los metroidvania y pr\u00e1cticamente no innovar en el tema, todas las mec\u00e1nicas se me hacen divertidas, permitiendome volver al inicio del juego y acceder a zonas que permanec\u00edan ocultas o lejanas hasta el momento.\n\nRecomiendo este juego a cualquier persona que disfrute de una banda sonora inmersiva, los metroidvania, o simplemente apartados visuales lindos.", "timestamp_created": 1699528685, "timestamp_updated": 1699528685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149798095": {"recommendationid": "149798095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047560727", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1579185461}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome looking and fun too.", "timestamp_created": 1699512072, "timestamp_updated": 1699512072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149797950": {"recommendationid": "149797950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207206767", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 886, "last_played": 1698300360}, "language": "english", "review": "nice graphics and music", "timestamp_created": 1699511724, "timestamp_updated": 1699511724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149767168": {"recommendationid": "149767168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110242503", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 703, "last_played": 1699528698}, "language": "english", "review": "cryment", "timestamp_created": 1699463198, "timestamp_updated": 1699463198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149741107": {"recommendationid": "149741107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080064268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1699416327}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun experience!

Buy this game RIGHT NOW. Then go and buy its sequel (Ori and the Will of the Wisps).\n\nThis is one of those games that kinda peaked my interest because I love metroidvania's. So, I bought it, put it in my \"I'll get to it later pile\" and left it there for years..... what a mistake that was. I cannot believe how long I waited to play this masterpiece. And that IS what this is, a MASTERPIECE and so is its sequel.\n\nI won't spoil the story here but I will say that this game is all about loss and dealing with loss. While there are moments of true sadness (this is one of 3 games ever to bring me to legitimate tears, The Last of Us and Mass Effect 3 [Mordin!!!] being the others) but it is so much more than that!\n\nGameplay - A masterclass in metroidvania design. Exploration, discovery and character advancement and development are at their best here. Combat is very well done. Simple but still possesses depth. Challenging but  not overly so. It's definitely not Soulslike levels of challenging. But it is also rewarding and rarely feels unfair. Movement (especially late game with some added abilities) is seriously satisfying. \n\nGraphics - Incredible! Beautiful! The art style perfectly compliments what this game is trying to achieve and accentuates the themes and mood that permeate every aspect of this game. There are also some seriously breathtaking set pieces on display here.\n\nMusic & Sound - The sounds are completely adequate. More than is needed for a game of this type. The music is again, best in class. Yet another example of a perfect pairing between theme and mood to fit the game.

I know it's not fair to review an older game using a newer game as comparison, but after playing Hollowed Knight, you realize just how absolutely annoying every enemy in Ori is and how it is a chore instead of fun fighting them. Also, your one main attack is one that you constantly have to button spam; no just holding down the attack button because we are apparently going back to the 80s Nintendo days. The only reason why the game doesnt let you to just hold down the attack button is because it would just reveal how weak the combat is; since there is never a moment in the game where you shouldnt be attacking and there's no punishment for always attacking regardless of the enemy and situation, the game would just devolve into holding down the attack button from the moment the game starts to the moment the game ends.\n\nThe level designs way overuse floor spikes, with many of them impossible to see until you land on them and will immediately end your run. Levels are not designed in such a way that they are fun to explore, because they are not made so that the players intuitively know where to go next, and it's never clear if you are in the right area the game wants you to be or if you are in an area that is designed to come back at a later time. And before someone calls me a casual, understand that every single game with deep exploration and branching paths, even Dark Souls, cleverly tricks and guide the player into going where the player needs to go next, in such a subtle way that the player doesnt even realize it. This game doesnt know how to do that at all.\n\nIt's objectively not a bad game; it just doesnt deserve its overwhelming score.", "timestamp_created": 1698790679, "timestamp_updated": 1698791678, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476510077714920044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149269080": {"recommendationid": "149269080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000418865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 776, "last_played": 1698779421}, "language": "spanish", "review": "D", "timestamp_created": 1698779316, "timestamp_updated": 1698779316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149253270": {"recommendationid": "149253270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057504861", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 987, "last_played": 1698763655}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1698761771, "timestamp_updated": 1698761771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149250885": {"recommendationid": "149250885", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969928503", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 567, "last_played": 1698758990}, "language": "english", "review": "Stutters alot.

On one hand it's beautiful to look at, has an incredible score and a well-presented story: clearly a lot of love has gone into its development. Unfortunately I also found it very awkward to actually play it. For a start, Ori controls like he is on ice the entire time. Coming from just having played Hollow Knight, it just feels so floaty and imprecise and it's sometimes very frustrating to pull off the platforming needed in the more difficult sections because of this. When you die in Hollow Knight, you feel like it was your fault every time because of the tight controls, but it can feel unfair sometimes here.\n\nMy other complaint is about the game backgrounds. They are very busy and the edges between background and foreground are not always clear: to the point where you have to keep a very sharp eye out for spikes and other hazards. It's also hard sometimes to differentiate between pickups, the light that buzzes around Ori and enemy projectiles.

While it boasts stunning visuals, the gameplay falls a bit flat. The character movement lacks precision, coming off as floaty. The save system is peculiar; there are times when you can frequently save your progress, and other times when you're left wanting. Intriguingly, the game uses the same currency for saving, opening gates, and executing powerful attacks. This system might have been tolerable if the health mechanism was effective. However, the game is riddled with instant death attacks, thrusting you back to your last save point. It almost feels as if this was their solution to complaints about the sudden death challenges.

This enchanting adventure, developed by Moon Studios, takes players on a captivating journey through a lush and mysterious forest.\n\nVisually, the game is a masterpiece. The hand-drawn art style and attention to detail create a stunning and immersive world. The forest's beauty is juxtaposed with its danger, giving the game a unique atmosphere that keeps players engaged and in awe.\n\nThe game play is equally impressive. The platforming mechanics are tight and intuitive, offering challenging yet satisfying experiences as you navigate through the forest's perilous terrain. As Ori, the game's agile protagonist, you'll unlock new abilities and upgrades that keep the game play fresh and exciting.\n\nOne of the game's standout features is its storytelling. \"Ori and the Blind Forest\" weaves a touching and emotionally resonant narrative as it explores themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the power of determination. The characters, particularly Ori and Sein, are endearing, and players become deeply invested in their journey.\n\nGareth Coker's musical score is a perfect companion to the game's visual and emotional elements. The music sets the tone beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of the story and the game play.\n\nWhile the game is a true gem, it's not without its challenges. Some players might find its difficulty level to be on the high side, with certain sections requiring precise timing and quick reflexes. However, this difficulty adds to the sense of accomplishment when you overcome obstacles.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Ori and the Blind Forest\" is a must-play title for fans of platforms, artful storytelling, and immersive experiences. It's a visually stunning, emotionally engaging game that leaves a lasting impression. This game is not just a gaming experience; it's a work of art that showcases the potential of the medium.", "timestamp_created": 1697948464, "timestamp_updated": 1697948464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148646850": {"recommendationid": "148646850", "author": {"steamid": "76561199532077280", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 882, "last_played": 1698561038}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything I like", "timestamp_created": 1697948154, "timestamp_updated": 1697948154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148638873": {"recommendationid": "148638873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440642123", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1697920320}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game in like 2020, backlogged it, and then finally beat it today.

The music is pretty and the environments and puzzles can be quite creative, but I find myself distinctly un-immersed. \n\nThe game balance shifts from careful save energy management to just letting you drop a save point after every jump so rapidly that it feels like the game's only way to compensate is to throw more no-mercy challenges at you to kill you with a single mistake. It could have easily had you respawn at the last safe platform when you fall into a pit, but instead it forces you to save literally everywhere just in case some bullshit enemy is around the next corner and one-shots you and your pitiful health pool. Not helped by the fact that sometimes its difficult to tell what's in the foreground and whats a danger on your plane of movement, or the fact that all the blurry light particles flying around sometimes makes it difficult to tell what's a threat in time to dodge it.\n\nAnd the story, while presenting a veneer of wholesome adventure about love and family, falls apart at any level of scrutiny. It feels like the morals of the story are that it's fine to behave with reckless disregard for others' safety if you miss someone (whom you've never properly met), choosing found family over biological family is a mistake, anger over legitimate wrongs done to your family is bad if the target of your anger is more important than you, and so on.

For main quest, there is no need to backtrack to places been to b4 just to use the new skills unlocked to help in reaching areas unreachable without. this is because in every new level, corresponding skills needed to clear it is given and thus ur able to clear it without needing to return to other areas just to clear the game\n\nMovement is smooth and input are very responsive especially since some levels require minor jumps etc. This allows for a more smooth gameplay experience. Difficulty is appropriate where even a newbie player like me can easily clear the hard difficulty. the ability to put your own checkpoint is a very good feature, allowing you to plan your gameplay yourself and do trial and error of levels more efficiently\n\nHowever, despite all the good points, players should take note that after every clear of a level, there is a final part that is like challenging a boss fight, which in this case is escaping from a natural disaster of a element, eg water, and since you cant use checkpoints, you are required to clear it in one go which can be frustrating as some can be difficult and long. Butttt, do not fret for there will be only 3-4 of them in the whole game so overall your experience will still be a fun one\n\nAlso, the music and visuals are out of this world!!! They are very beautiful and you will find yourself just enjoying the view. Plus storytelling is great, with all the right visuals and music to complement, its a 10/10 masterpiece for the visual and music department!!

gets brought up whenever video games as art is discussed. I understand that it's a beautiful game with a memorable soundtrack. The themes are there and the characters get introduced in a natural way without too much explaining.\n\nHowever, art or not, it's still a video game. I want to play it. The very first moment I get the control of the intro character, I want to see what happens when I try to walk off a ledge. You cannot, there's an invisible wall. It's a minor flaw (barely a flaw at all) but personally it's infuriating and lazy design. You want to put a mandatory slow walking introduction but you don't want to think outside the box [i]at all[/i]? You could easily put an alternative hidden route there and you don't need an invisible wall. Art games and invisible walls, Mona Lisa and rotten teeth.\n\nNot to mention Ori's very much a game for kids (and manchildren). If I was under 15 I could see it becoming a favourite. The story seems simple and effective and the visuals kick ass.\n\nHow about the gameplay? Brace your mouse arm to get tendonitis because you are going to mash the mouse button for a ridiculous amount of time. For the short while I played the enemies got noticeably more bullet-spongy and every time you plan to hit an enemy once, it's one mouse click. I see no reason for it, you could easily just hold the mouse button to fire continuously. Wall jumping controls felt awkward and most of the reviews state that the end game platforming gets more and more difficult.\n\nI'll leave this one to people who instantly want to immerse themselves into Ori.

Regardless, this game is a genuinely wonderful experience that I wish many more people would play. The story was handled amazingly well despite having such little dialogue.

Desarrollado por Moon Studios y publicado por Microsoft Studios, este juego es un testimonio del poder del arte, la narrativa y la jugabilidad en la industria de los videojuegos. Es dif\u00edcil exagerar la calidad y la belleza que este t\u00edtulo ofrece a los jugadores, y en esta rese\u00f1a, exploraremos a fondo por qu\u00e9 Ori merece un lugar destacado entre los mejores juegos del g\u00e9nero.\n\nDesde el primer momento en que se inicia el juego, se siente una inmersi\u00f3n absoluta en un mundo de fantas\u00eda magn\u00edficamente detallado y dise\u00f1ado. La narrativa de Ori es conmovedora y emotiva, llevando a los jugadores a trav\u00e9s de una historia de amor, sacrificio y redenci\u00f3n. Nos sumergimos en el papel de Ori, una peque\u00f1a criatura luminosa que debe emprender un viaje \u00e9pico para salvar el Bosque Ciego de una inminente destrucci\u00f3n. La trama se desarrolla de manera sutil y efectiva, sin necesidad de un di\u00e1logo extenso, ya que la narraci\u00f3n visual y la m\u00fasica excepcional hablan por s\u00ed mismas.\n\nEl apartado visual de Ori and the Blind Forest es sencillamente deslumbrante. Cada cuadro parece una obra de arte en movimiento, con un estilo de dibujo a mano que le da vida al mundo del juego de una manera que pocos t\u00edtulos logran igualar. Los colores vibrantes y los contrastes entre la luz y la oscuridad son una delicia para los ojos, y el nivel de atenci\u00f3n al detalle es asombroso. Cada rinc\u00f3n del Bosque Ciego est\u00e1 lleno de vida, desde las majestuosas ramas de los \u00e1rboles hasta las criaturas diminutas que pululan por el entorno. La animaci\u00f3n es fluida y realista, lo que contribuye a que la experiencia sea a\u00fan m\u00e1s inmersiva.\n\nLa m\u00fasica es otro aspecto en el que Ori brilla con luz propia. La banda sonora, compuesta por Gareth Coker, es un acompa\u00f1amiento emocional perfecto para la historia y el entorno. Cada pieza musical se adapta perfectamente a la atm\u00f3sfera del juego, ya sea en los momentos m\u00e1s emotivos o en las fren\u00e9ticas secuencias de plataformas. La m\u00fasica es capaz de hacerte sentir la tristeza, la alegr\u00eda y la tensi\u00f3n a medida que avanzas en la historia. Es un logro musical que merece reconocimiento por s\u00ed mismo.\n\nLa jugabilidad es donde Ori and the Blind Forest se destaca a\u00fan m\u00e1s. El juego combina elementos de plataformas, exploraci\u00f3n y resoluci\u00f3n de acertijos de manera magistral. El movimiento de Ori es suave y \u00e1gil, lo que permite a los jugadores realizar acrobacias y movimientos precisos. A medida que avanzas en el juego, desbloqueas nuevas habilidades que expanden tus capacidades y te permiten explorar \u00e1reas previamente inaccesibles. La curva de dificultad es perfecta, desafiante pero justa, lo que te obliga a mejorar tus habilidades sin caer en la frustraci\u00f3n.\n\nLos acertijos y los desaf\u00edos de plataformas est\u00e1n perfectamente integrados en el dise\u00f1o del mundo. Cada \u00e1rea presenta un conjunto \u00fanico de desaf\u00edos que requieren ingenio y habilidad para superar. La sensaci\u00f3n de logro al superar un \u00e1rea dif\u00edcil o resolver un enigma complicado es inmensa y gratificante. Adem\u00e1s, el juego te permite guardar en cualquier momento, lo que evita la frustraci\u00f3n de repetir secciones dif\u00edciles una y otra vez.\n\nOtro aspecto que merece menci\u00f3n especial es la progresi\u00f3n del personaje y la personalizaci\u00f3n. A medida que avanzas en la historia, puedes mejorar las habilidades de Ori y adaptar su estilo de juego a tu preferencia. Esto a\u00f1ade una capa adicional de profundidad a la jugabilidad y te permite abordar los desaf\u00edos de diferentes maneras.\n\nEn cuanto a la duraci\u00f3n, Ori and the Blind Forest ofrece una experiencia que puede variar desde 8 a 12 horas, dependiendo de tu estilo de juego y de cu\u00e1nto te detengas a explorar y recolectar secretos. Esta duraci\u00f3n es perfecta para sumergirte en el mundo de Ori sin sentir que el juego se alarga innecesariamente.

tree is the least useful, as by the endgame, your main damage will likely be from the abilities that you've picked up along the way and not your main attack.

But I don't.\n\nI've played 2D platformers for years.  Decades, really.  Metriod, Zelda, and Mario; Castlevania; Mega Man, and the wide plethora of knockoffs.  I wouldn't brag, but I certainly would categorize myself as reasonably competent.\n\nThis game's gorgeous graphics pulled me in right away.  The plot, while simplistic, was captivating.  The intro was moving, even.  And off I went, to solve puzzles, earn experience, and gain power-ups, all the while keeping a weathered eye on my mana and life totals.  Very throwback; very classic; with a touch of newness.  I was hooked.  Oh, look; an [obstacle] that I can't circumvent; surely therefore I'll find [power-up] to help me with that, later on.  Don't forget it's there!  Probably something juicy behind it!\n\nThen I started encountering some more challenging areas.  More difficult enemies.  More convoluted jumping around.  Eh, no problem.  Just takes getting used to.  I got used to Mario.  I'll get used to this guy.  That's part of the fun; it's a puzzle world, filled with danger, interlaced in jumping around challenges.  If you like that sort of thing.  And I do!  So I pressed on.\n\nThen I started encountering some *really* challenging areas.  Skin-of-your-teeth jumps.  Unforgiving monsters.  But you can save your game almost anywhere.  So repeating attempts is not that inconvenient.  Aside from the tedium and frustration of attempting the same series of jumps, dodges, and attacks over and over until you've circumvented the situation.  Only to find a similar scenario right around the corner.  Hrmph.  But hey, that's, uh, still part of the fun, heh, right?  It's a challenge!  It's uh... it's an experience!  Something to relish when you finally triumph!  Yeah, that's it!\n\nThen I started encountering some really, REALLY challenging courses.  Like, five or more absolutely flawlessly timed jumps in sequence, in different directions; or instant death.  Ouch.  And you know what?  After my eleventeenth attempt, it just stopped being fun.  Mind you, I'm only a small fraction of the way through the game at this point.  And I'm already frustrated beyond my tolerance point -- which, I really do want to say, is pretty flexible when it comes to these sorts of games.\n\nSince I'm throwing the game under the bus, at this point I'll also mention its somewhat silly experience point system.  It'd pretty easy to farm exp if you really wanted to, since if you walk five steps off the screen after defeating a big, fat monster, you can walk back and find that big, fat monster has respawned.

"review": "Do I recommend this game? Yes, but this is one of the cases where I kind of regret there is no mixed button on Steam for reviews. It is one of the most visually stunning games I have had the pleasure of playing, the art style is great, the sound fits the game very well, the story while simple is told in a way to evoke very powerful feelings and the basic platforming is very very enjoyable. What is my problem with the game then? Simple, it is the chase scenes and I will try to explain why.\n\nFirst of all to understand my point of view, you have to think where platformers started. They were made to be arcade games where every try cost you a quarter (or an equivalent), thus the games were made to be hard, but if you yourself got better at the game you could definitely feel it throughout the game. Also there was no cheap difficulty of having to replay the level several times to know exactly where damage will come from, since it would have been a blatant money grab. In this game death means nothing (except for a waste of time), but the frustration lingers.\n\nNow imagine two worlds, in one world the difficulty of chase scene is dynamic, meaning no matter how well you executed the first part of the chase scene, it gives you nothing. No additional time whatsover. Thus the whole chase scene is just a series of precisely executed moves, that even if you make just a small mistake at the end, means you are replaying the whole thing again. When you finally finish the scene, you are not happy you did so, you feel relieved.\n\nIn the other world, the chase scene itself is on a timer.

If they annoy you like they do me, maybe think twice before picking it up.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest offers a certain experience, and it just wasn't for me. I enjoyed most of my time with it. It was fun - not necessarily amazing, but good. But over and over, I found myself getting annoyed by small things - unclear mechanics, puzzles that require you to do something you've never done before, the fact that you can practically softlock yourself by saving deep in enemy territory with low health (you respawn with the same amount of health you save with). Individually, they wouldn't be a big deal, but there were a lot of them, and they added up.\n\nTangent (no spoilers): [spoiler]That last one might sound like something you'd only do on purpose, but because you can save anywhere [i]and the game is designed around you being able to do that[/i], it's easy to repeatedly save with a little less health and a little more progress and run out of health before you reach the next heal. It is possible to reload a previous save, but it's really not obvious that it's an option, and in my opinion it's a mistake that it has to be an option at all.[/spoiler]\n\nThe best analogy I can think of is Apple products vs Android/Windows/Linux. Apple products are smooth, sleek, and easy to use by default, but a lot of people dislike them because (among other reasons) there are so many limitations and lack of advanced features/customization/tweakability. If you want something to just work with as little effort on your part as possible, I would guess you like Apple products (a totally valid opinion), but if you want it to work [i]well[/i], I'd imagine you prefer to avoid them (which is where I personally stand).\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is the embodiment of an Apple product here.

I absolutely adored this game, and while I went through it pretty quickly, my 14 hours of gameplay were a very memorable and enjoyable experience.\n\nVisuals: 10/10\nThe visuals in this game could not be more perfect. Everything is lively and detailed and every area is unique. I don't have much else to say besides that, the graphics are just really good.\n\nSoundtrack: 8/10\nThe soundtrack provided some nice ambience and added a lot to the game, it just simply isn't something I'd actively listen to on it's own. Still really good tho, just not on the level of games like hollow knight\n\nStory: 8/10\nWhile not as complicated and heavy as some other games out there, I liked the basic story, and it was honestly quite beautiful.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nThe gameplay in this was honestly fantastic. The movement was super fluid and once you collect all the abilities moving around is super satisfying. My favorite parts were escaping the ...temples?? I honestly have no idea what they're called. \n\nReplayability: 6/10\nHonestly games like this don't tend to be very replayable, however the different difficulties provide a challenge that deffinitley adds to its replayability\n\nExtra Notes:\nOverall I really enjoyed this game, and I'm excited to dive into the sequel.

I'm slightly biased now because whenever I think of Ori I'm reminded of my Ma and funny memories with her while playing this game, but the story should resonate with most people. Loss, hurt and anger are all emotions we've felt at one point in our lives.

while i loved this game, i have to say i feel like will of the wisps is just all around more polished and in depth. though, i strongly urge that you play blind forest first even still as it is a great game in its own right and has a beautiful story that greatly enhances the experience of will of the wisps' own story... as sequential stories tend to do lol\n\nthe main focus of the gameplay is 2d platforming and it is really well done. it feels fluid and stratifying and though some segments can be quite challenging, it is downright euphoric once you manage to get it right. \n\nthere are a few parts of the game i call \"Chase sequences\" for lack of a better term, where some hazard or similar obstacle  progresses along an area and you have to stay ahead of it. these sort of serve as this games equivalent to boss fights in terms of level design and are typically quite challenging albeit short and have no check points. that last bit was a matter of some frustration for me at first but once i completed the sequence i found the lack of checkpoint served to make the sequence extremely visually satisfying and gratifying enough that i didnt mind, not to mention the satisfaction of the actual feel of the platforming through the sequence once it all plays out perfectly. despite the comparative difficulty to the rest of the platforming, these are easily my favorite moments of the entire game.\n\nnow, this game does technically have combat but it is very minimal and simplistic. if you are coming into this looking for like, hollow knight or something thats not what you are going to get. as i mentioned earlier, there arent exactly boss fights that you conventionally fight and more often then not enemies feel more like a part of the platforming more than obstacles you have to

is very hard and frustrating.\nThis is another example that proves that graphics aren't everything. Gameplay is what matters most.\nThe graphics look good, the story is light and interesting, the music is great, but the crushing difficulty broke everything for me. I tried to get through the game to see how the story ends, but the extremely difficult gameplay made me rage quit at every session.\nThe developers were really creative in making the enemies really annoying, designing insta-death traps everywhere, weird platforming mechanics and other shit. I give them that.\n\nControls are a big issue as well. The character always moves a bit further than you intend, the movement acceleration is weird (I can't find the correct words to describe this). You can easily get stun locked to death or get snapped to a death trap, which feels really cheap. I'm not new to this kind of games and not a newbie gamer. This game has serious issues with controlling movement, which is a crucial aspect of the game. I could swear I can make all jumps and platforming with much more ease if it was any other game of the same genre. I like a good challenge, not cheap artificial so-called difficulty.\n\nMost of the skills you unlock feel useless. I'm already past half of the game, unlocked half of the skill tree points, and they only have very little to non-existing effect on the gameplay.\n\nFYI The game doesn't have auto-save. You save manually anytime and almost anywhere as long as you have a power cell left. So save often.. if you still decided to play the game...\n\nI didn't want to win a medal or get a world record, I just wanted a good game to enjoy and relax, and have a good time. This game clearly doesn't offer that. I would rather play Dark souls than this game. At least Dark souls is fair, Ori isn't.\nI'm glad I didn't buy the second game (Ori and the will of the wisps).

The game also suffers from lack of ability to reload, so you have to basically constantly commit suicide if you take a hit because there is no point in going any further if you screw up early in long segments as enemies and spikes do so much damage. I probably spent half my time just wasting time killing myself on spikes on purpose. I used to hate instant death spikes but ori made me want them back because the time waste trying to kill myself was immense. The devs knew this too - there is a death counter. How many platformers have a death counter?\n\nThe game accidently let me save on spikes and softlocked. You can find many posts on steam forums you will see lots of posts of people with softlock situations. You have to quit to menu to find the hidden mechanic to load a previous save. It's not hinted to exist at all. \n\nNow the art style. It's nice, high def, muted pastel asthetic, but has a lot of visual clarity problems. Spikes and hazards blend in and often overlap with edges of what is normally walkable areas. The problem is even non-spiky parts of spikes will hurt you. How do sides of long shafts of spikes hurt you? Some of your and enemy projectiles look the same and are the same color, especially with spiders. You are both making big multishot flashes all over the screen and so you can't even see their projectiles. You have to stop shooting so you can even see them shoot back at you. \n\nThere are also areas you can't ever get back to with upgrades that can be missed forever. Fun! Oh, I and hope you enjoy playing 5 minute long escape sequences from these forever gone places where you die in 1 hit and have to redo them over and over to find that couple pixel on the map where you can hide don't die. Die at the 4 minute mark, well start over before you can find those pixels.

I sound like a broken record. At least this one has a good narrative. It's simple, but the themes it presents, it presents them emotionally and without filler. It's prologue literally made me buy the game.\n\nBut I don't recomend this game, not at all. The level design is kind of all over the place. The distribution of challenges is well done. The problem is within those challenges, and the dynamics that ensue from the game's mechanics.\n\n(played the default difficulty; don't know about easier or harder ones)\n\nBasically, there are a lot of challenges that you have to know beforehand. There are some that are literally random. And some that are kind of random - skill mix, but let's just focus on the first ones, which are sufficiently abundant. The game gives you, surprisingly, a save button to save anywhere in exchange for resources, and it even has the kindness to let you recover health by doing so. This sounds great: auto-balancing challenge with resource management. It is all, however, a dirty lie, because the resource is so abundant that you can just save after every challenge, practically.\n\nThis makes the game a constant back and forth between saving, the devs laughing at your face for not knowing what was to come, then you avoiding the trap, and repeat. The game does have difficult sections, so it's not like it's all a breeze. My favorite ones, are, however, those in which they don't let you save, but still set a bunch of gotta-know traps so you have to reset from the start of the level sequence.\n\nI can't say much about level design of secrets, because although I began taking notes of places I wanted to re-visit and clues for that, I dropped it when the game dropped the ball. Also, minor complain, why is it so frequent in this game to have foreground elements that look like background elements. Which kill you. Aa.\n\nBesides all of that, it feels mechanically nice. Maybe a bit too much buttons to press, but that's just getting used to it. I don't like how Ori just accelerates like a motorjet, but again, that's just me. Also, the game pretends to have mini-bosses. They are not, they are a joke. And not even a funny one.

Very glad to have gotten around to it.\n\nPros:\n- This game is absolutely stunning visually. Every environment feels distinct, and the vibrant color palette ties it all together to bring this intricate world to life; animations are also fantastic. The game manages to be melancholic, oppressive, adventurous, and lighthearted all in the same breath.\n- You can't mention Ori without talking about the soundtrack. Each song is composed beautifully, accentuating key moments and making exploration all the more enjoyable.\n- Ori himself controls phenomenally. Every movement feels fluid, and all of the many abilities you will unlock over the course of the game fit together to make some of the most satisfying movement from a platformer I've seen in quite a while (Bash is the greatest thing ever).\n- Combat is basic but there is still a good amount of enemy variety that helps to keep things fresh.\n- The narrative is executed very well for the most part, and delivers a simple yet touching story.\n- Exploration is great, and each level was a joy to go through, especially the action-packed escape sequences following each of the three main 'dungeons'.\n- Extra Definitive Edition content is also a welcome addition, providing yet another fun and well-crafted area to traverse.\n\nCons:\n- For a metroidvania, Ori is almost completely linear. This is not a bad thing inherently, as each section of the game is masterfully crafted your first time through. However, side content/exploration/backtracking that followed the main story did not feel particularly inspired, and ended up being lots of locked doors that I simply needed late-game power-ups to access (Which I do not mind, but most of these were simply that and nothing more. I would have liked to see a bit more effort here - such as extra puzzles or combat encounters). It can't have been that bad though, because I still decided to 100% my save file.\n- Soul Link is an interesting and unique mechanic, but I do still have somewhat mixed feelings about it.\n- Despite the commendable enemy variety, the combat mechanics themselves are a bit lackluster, and fighting enemies did feel somewhat repetitive by the late-game.\n- There are admittedly a couple story moments that I found a bit pointless, lowering the impact of other events considerably (will not be elaborating to avoid spoilers).\n\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is a triumph, and it's insane to think this was Moon Studios' first game. I am greatly looking forward to playing the sequel.\n\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1690208987, "timestamp_updated": 1690208987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142699394": {"recommendationid": "142699394", "author": {"steamid": "76561199046051363", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 858, "last_played": 1630333852}, "language": "english", "review": "Very heartful game", "timestamp_created": 1690200608, "timestamp_updated": 1690200608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142691504": {"recommendationid": "142691504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057436343", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 667, "last_played": 1685912797}, "language": "english", "review": "\nOri and the Blind Forest is a great platformer, but it might be lacking in replayability if that's something you like about metroidvania games.\n\nThe platforming itself feels great, with every new mechanic you get access to throughout the game lending itself very well to making movement feel fluid and seamless. Combat is a bit on the dull side, with very few differing enemy designs across the whole game, the player often getting to meet reskinned enemies with slightly different behavior and upgraded stats as they progress. As such, there are no bosses, with chase sections that test your platforming skills taking their place. This admittedly fits the game's strengths to a T.\nOutside of gameplay, the game's visuals, sound design, OST and the storytelling complement each other perfectly to deliver a great atmosphere and make the forest of Nibel feel alive. Exploring the wilderness is made very intuitive thanks to how the in-game map functions, though it might make it a bit too easy if exploring is what you enjoy most out of a metroidvania.\n\nVery fun, and I'll likely play it again!

The animations, the backgrounds, the enemy designs, the cutscenes, it's all just breathtaking. The soundtrack and sound design is just as good, really fitting the tone of the situation and feeling like a movie. I'm afraid, though, that the gameplay doesn't live up to this game's presentation.\n\nThe platforming physics are incredible. Near the end of the game, after obtaining all of the abilities, platforming through the final section felt immensely satisfying. Being a long-time Mario fan, I love 2D platformers to death, so needless to say, those segments were my favorite part of this game. Of course, since I've already played so many 2D platformers, I've become quite good at them. This, I believe, is why I enjoyed this game so much. Which leads to my next point.\n\nHere's the big platforming nitpick: This game can be hard. The wrong kind of hard, the frustrating kind. The way you save your game is quite unconventional, using entirely manual saves that take some of your magic energy to create. Imagine Celeste's respawn system, but instead of it triggering at the start of every room, saving is entirely done by the player, and can be created on any solid ground. Forgetting to save and needing to replay sections can be discouraging, and I ended up doing that throughout the entire game. even up to the final area I was forgetting to save at times. If you're out of magic energy, it can be very tough to make progress. And if you're in a section with very few energy pickups, you might just get stuck there for a while.\n\nAnd now we talk about the combat, the weakest part of this game for most people. It's just as simple as people say it is. The whole thing is just spamming the X button, which is less than ideal, but I didn't mind it much. The enemies can be tough to dodge at times. I don't know what it is about them, but some enemies' attacks are so frustrating. Think of the Primal Aspids from Hollow Knight, but this time there's more like 3 or 4 enemy types in this game that are like them.\n\nThe Definitive Edition adds two abilities to the game which I have mixed feelings about. These abilities are the Dash and the Light Burst, and they make platforming a bit too easy. They are entirely optional pickups, but the strange thing is that the skill tree lets you unlock upgrades for these two powerups without ever picking them up in the first place. For example, I saw an upgrade on the skill tree with the description \"Allows Ori to also dash in midair.\" (something like that) and when I spent my points on it, I was quite disappointed when I realized it was an upgrade to an ability I hadn't found yet. So please, if you end up playing this game, and you unlock or see something you don't understand, just look it up. This doesn't mean the Definitive Edition is the worse version though. It adds a fast travel system, which I used extensively during my playthrough, as well as more accessible difficulty options. So in the end the positives of the re-release outweigh my problems with the new abilities.\n\nThis is the longest Steam review I've ever written, but I've never played through a game where I had this much to say about it. This game isn't perfect, It's quite flawed actually. But I really, thoroughly enjoyed playing through it, and I hope whoever is reading this decides to try it out.

Apart from being in the same genre (metroidvania 2D platformer) Ori and the Blind Forest and Hollow Knight have very little in common. Mainly because the first Ori game focuses on platforming, escape sequences and puzzle solving rather than fighting or exploration. The game is essentially linear compared to Hollow Knight's multitude of ways you can traverse the map.

You could truly get lost in the visuals which might be some of the best in any video game ever. It's truly that breathtaking and evocative.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3007766422\n\nThe audio is similarly well done. Not quite to the peerless excellence of the artwork, but the OST is ethereal and pretty, and the in game tracks all are perfect for what they are.\n\nThe platforming and combat are extremely tight and the controls are as responsive as I've seen in such a game. Also, the upgrade system gives you a very real sense of progression, allowing you to access new parts of areas you've already visited, and just to enjoy a steady flow of new abilities.\n\nThe story, so far as I got into it, was pretty dark and sad. The intro can really make you feel pretty bad, and as you progress, you realize that while the game steers you in a hopeful direction, the path is littered with heartache.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3007766385\n\nSo, this all sounds like a winning combination of aspects that come together into a brilliant gaming experience, and that is actually factual. What I realized however, is that I don't have the patience for the increasingly complex puzzles, which require very precise platforming, multiple reflex based phases, and aiming that I can do, but not without getting pissed off lol. The actual solutions are pretty obvious, but the actual act of accomplishing them is more than I am personally willing to put myself through.\n\nSo...I definitely recommend this game if you are patient and don't mind repeating the same thing over and over trying to get it just right, rinse and repeat. If instead, you are at all impatient or prone to rage quitting games, this is a game better YouTubed instead.\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated.

Not offensively bad, but far from being remarkable. The combat was way too simple. Your basic attack essentially boils down to button mashing at a distance and the other skills presented (with maybe a single exception) are just somewhat generic and boring at times.

That isn't to say this is a bad much less weak game, it's still a great metroidvania worth your time! The way the world begins to open as you go somewhere new, gain a new ability, have a tutorial built into the environment as you climb/explore outwards, and then backtrack through once unreachable paths is handled to a masterful degree. As well as most mechanics overall working for what the game wanted to accomplish.\n\nI will say, some sections can easily feel uncomfortable to play, and they can easily overstay their welcome due to issues I find in the movement system and pacing, I find that the ice temple (I forget the name of it, sorry!) is generally poorly communicated as well as designed, the puzzle mechanic is hard to pick up on because it never gives you a space to tinker with the gravity mechanic used there, as well as the chase section being unreasonably difficult and poorly communicated to the player in most aspects, this made it hard to trust that I would enjoy following chase sections, and sadly, I think the final chase before the credits is also pretty bad in communicating to the player. Adding on to that with the end-game area being a massive spike in difficulty from the rest of the game, it can get frustrating to play with generally poor pacing of difficulty and easily frustrating execution of mechanics. However! I find that majority of the game is a genuine pleasure to go through and experience, the rough edges do not ruin the whole package for me, as there's lots of great aspects here! (This is also where I mention I think that Will of the Wisps executes basically everything here I had problems with to an extremely phenomenal level of game design and you should totally play that game too)", "timestamp_created": 1689143552, "timestamp_updated": 1689143552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141881939": {"recommendationid": "141881939", "author": {"steamid": "76561199194957190", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 915, "last_played": 1689137807}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10 de 10", "timestamp_created": 1689137390, "timestamp_updated": 1689137390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141871527": {"recommendationid": "141871527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079350339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1333, "last_played": 1687116219}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall: 8/10 (great)\nRecommended: yes\nTime to complete story: about 8 hrs\n(49/57 achievements)\nTime to 100%: about 13.5 hrs\n(2.5 runs, 54/57 achievements, all but the 3 hardcore achievements)\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10 (great)\nStory: 7/10\n~ a simple one exists, but you're mostly playing for the gameplay\nCharacters: 7/10\n~ little interaction and development (again, mostly focusing on gameplay)\nWriting: 7/10\n~ some things are left unclear, but overall ok\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nAudio: 8/10\nSettings/UI: very good\n\nScore comparison:\nHLtB:         8.5/10 (2,530 votes)\nMetacritic: 8.7/10 (2,810)\nSteam: 95% positive (51,540)", "timestamp_created": 1689123093, "timestamp_updated": 1689123093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141853497": {"recommendationid": "141853497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321390136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1012, "last_played": 1689102614}, "language": "english", "review": "Story 10/10\nVisuals 10/10\nMusic 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nA beautiful Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1689102936, "timestamp_updated": 1689102936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141852417": {"recommendationid": "141852417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021705395", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1689107097}, "language": "english", "review": "Burned some Owls Alive", "timestamp_created": 1689101832, "timestamp_updated": 1689101832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141844172": {"recommendationid": "141844172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017428923", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 583, "last_played": 1689093167}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a little bit sad that I have to give Ori and the Blind Forest a negative review.

The game looks like a high quality animated feature every step of the way. The gameplay is all about mobility. The world is built to be a playground that you slide, twirl, jump, and bound through making Ori feel like they're truly at home in the forest through control alone. \n\nEvery motion naturally flows into another and the world design encourages you to make use of every option, with the later movement unlocks only making every journey even more swift and natural to counterbalance the world map's constant expansion. Combat is simple and revolves around button mashing to bypass foes but this game isn't about fighting its the puzzle platforming. Using the high quality movement mechanics to navigate spatial challenges in beautiful spaces collecting items to continue forward. \n\nEach area has an elemental gimmick that is used to provide new movement challenges keeping things fresh throughout. It goes to show that creativity doesn't require crazy new ideas, even basic platforming and old level themes can be executed well to provide a rewarding gameplay experience. This game even foregoes boss fights, instead presenting big cinematic platforming sections that challenge you to get from A to B using all the tricks you've learned in the previous area. It's actually really clever to see Ori playing constantly into its biggest strength.\n\nThe story is minimal but revolves around the cycles of life and death in the large ethereal forest setting. Just as the gameplay focuses on doing one thing well, so too does the story focus on singular strong themes that resonate throughout the entire game and left me tearing up on several occasions.\n\nOverall Ori is a solid metroidvania and while it doesn't have flashy tools or hardcore combat its game design goes to show the strength of minimalism and remains a masterclass in moving through 2D spaces.", "timestamp_created": 1688903936, "timestamp_updated": 1688903936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141673052": {"recommendationid": "141673052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040706188", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1688825777}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game, some really fun platforming sequences, awesome soundtrack - just a bit annoying at parts.

If I had to summarize it in a sentence, I'd say it feels like an unusually ambitious game development project for college that expectedly falls short of actual \"game\" quality.\nI spent a good amount of time on this game when I was younger (10, 11, 12 maybe) and tried to pick it up again to finish it which I had never done before. I did this because one of my most trusted game reviewers said it was one of his favorites of all time and because it was on sale for cheap. I still refunded it because it didn't feel worth keeping.\n\nWhat are the issues? From what I either experienced or looked up on YouTube after refunding it, this is what I can gather:\n- The environments are ugly and dark. No, this is not a setting on my computer. Everything feels so abysmal, even the lighter and cheerier areas. Never once did I see something and go \"Wow! That looks visually impressive, or even visually tolerable!\" \n-The story can literally be explained in thirty seconds or less. There are no captivating details or lore or intricacies to the world that make it worth mentioning. When I say within thirty seconds, if you're a fast enough talker, you can probably explain every lore-related game mechanic in an additional twenty.\n-The save system is so lame. I don't want to have to see the same cutscene over and over again because I don't have energy or just forgot to save. Either they should have done autosave or they should have just done a more integrated and widespread checkpoint system of sorts, making ability upgrades a mobile endeavor.\n-The mechanics are truly awful. What kind of combat is there? You click a button and it hurts enemies. No aiming or anything rewarding associated with it. You can also hold down a button if you feel saucy. The platforming is punishing, but not really punishing for the sake of difficulty, more like punishing because the jumps aren't outlined well enough to land consistently. The jumping, climbing and other mechanics didn't feel polished at all.\nIn summary of that section of the review, traversal, managing saves and combat were just chores on the way through a semblance of a story that literally could have been cranked out in twenty minutes in a conference room.\n\nWhat does this game have to offer? It's not intellectually challenging or emotionally moving enough to grab my attention, but the \"spiritual\" adventure that it pushes is almost equally underwhelming when the world feels so uninspired almost all of the time. I might just be a hardass but this game is an incredible letdown. I'm going to buy the next one at some point to see if it improves upon the formula, but if it doesn't then I really have nothing good to say about this series.

It's not bad, I just personally think there are better alternatives for pretty much everything it has to offer, and my experience didn't come close to the hype surrounding it. The art is outstanding, but as a metroidvania, it feels to me like it falls short on every single aspect compared to its peers \u2013 which is apparently a sentiment [i]not[/i] shared by many people. I'll go into detail below, spoilers will be marked.\n\nThe exploration is not very interesting or rewarding \u2013 the game tells you exactly where you need to go, and due to its extreme linearity, you get absolutely nothing from going off the beaten path; in terms of secrets, most of what you get is XP that you'll have probably maxed out by the time you get to the last dungeon regardless of how much you've actually explored, the rest is health/mana upgrades that become basically useless down the line due to unlocking skills that drastically reduce damage received and mana costs. The only case where I can see these secrets being actually meaningful is in hard more, but it's pretty clear that this difficulty setting was not intended for a first playthrough due to the fact that almost everything one-shots you in the early game, aka the part where you're supposed to play around the most to figure out the \"rules\" of the game.\n\nCombat gets stale real quick; bash is a very cool power \u2013 if you play on controller, that is \u2013 but it completely erases the need to dodge enemy attacks, so encounters become a matter of mashing the (auto-aim) attack button as quickly as possible while holding the bash button as soon as you see something move. It could've turned out interesting nonetheless if the devs had gotten more creative with enemy designs, but alas, only two of them have gimmicks that actually require you to approach them differently; for everyone else, spamming attacks and bashes is more than enough. The other powers are basically useless in combat, aside from the insanely powerful ground stomp whose AoE is so humongous that you're more likely to hit enemies by accident than miss them.\n\nPlatforming is nice, arguably the best part of the game, but it's not as good as dedicated platformers, and I personally don't think there's anything that makes up for the difference. Besides, I feel like some sections are somewhat poorly balanced, with hazards either dealing so little damage that you can just walk on them without issue or instantly killing you for a single mistake \u2013 in which case, you'd better have set up a save point not too long ago, or you'll have to make your whole way there all over again. Admittedly, the sheer speed you can traverse the map with in the late game is quite satisfying, but it feels like the game actively tries to slow you down at times, making it feel kinda pointless.\n\nFinally, the story. It starts off great, and you get the sense that things aren't quite the way they seem from the beginning. But in the end, it left me really confused about its message. Like okay, [i]\"don't let hatred consume you or you'll lose the things you care about the most\",[/i] but how can you look me straight in the eye and tell me that [spoiler]Kuro is the bad guy for desperately trying to protect her only remaining child from the god that murdered her entire family along with Ori's adoptive mother just because he lost track of Ori, and [i]HE's the good guy???[/i] The one you serve throughout the entire game with no second thoughts? It doesn't make any sense to me. I was expecting a nuanced take on the balance between light and darkness, something about neither of the two things being inherently good or evil, and as such, neither deserving to be overwhelmed by the other. What I got instead was a banal [i]\"light is good, and if darkness has to be suppressed for its sake, then so be it. What's that? Innocents dying because of this? It is what it is, man.\"[/i][/spoiler]\n\nThat's about it. As I said in the beginning, I don't think the game is terrible, but I just don't see any reason to recommend it over pretty much any other metroidvania I've played, unless you're a fan of platformers trying to get into the genre and you're put off by \"traditional\" combat, or conversely, you've exhausted all other options and are itching for yet more metroidvania (which was more or less my case, but in hindsight, I should've picked something else).", "timestamp_created": 1688760602, "timestamp_updated": 1688760602, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141543232": {"recommendationid": "141543232", "author": {"steamid": "76561199104761789", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1697293147}, "language": "english", "review": "still one of the prettiest", "timestamp_created": 1688755785, "timestamp_updated": 1688755785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141541828": {"recommendationid": "141541828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397607170", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1385, "last_played": 1692399035}, "language": "english", "review": "this is my first introduction to metroidvania genre, and its a great opening for me.  \n\nPros:\n- Very good graphics for a 2016 game, i love it. even my friend said the same thing when playing it the first time\n\n-Good story telling  and world building.a little guardian ghost charged with restoring the forest's equilibrium following a disaster.

actually misery to play. Other than the art style and music, I have nothing good to say about this game. Game play is awful, power progression is awful, clarity is awful, exploration is awful and story is awful.\n\nTo start off, the combat is almost non-existent in this game, it consists of button mashing a single button to kill enemies while standing completely still and once you are 30% through the game there is really no reason to ever kill enemies again. the damage done to enemies is so small its a complete chore to sit there for 15 second to kill a single standard enemy. Once you get the ability to launch off enemies, I think I maybe killed 10 enemies the rest of the game. You do not scale with the enemies and the abilities you obtain through the skill tree are all but useless.\n\nMovement in this game is not smooth in the slightest, it is way to floaty and non consistent. CLimbing up walls is a headache, trying to land precisely on a platform is a gamble and waiting for a specific enemy to line up perfectly for a platforming section is a casino slot machine.\n\nWhen traversing the world, it is near impossible to see what is going to kill you. Are those just boring bushes or are those spikes? It is so unclear when something will damage you it is hilarious. This game greatly sacrifices any clarity for the sake of art direction. The least enjoyable parts of the game were the \"escape\" portions in each of the area. These were not a test of skill, but a continuous beating your head against a metaphorical wall until you finally escape. You are running along and a rock falls on your head with no visual clue, time to restart the entire sequence until I get surprised again by some BS. The only way to know is through trial and error, so you end up being forced to do this portion a ton of times until you know all the gimmicks that will be thrown your way. A skilled individual should be able to do these in just a few tries not be forced to die at every step of the way because of lack of clarity.\n\nExploration is almost non existent in this game unless you are trying to 100% the game. Extra health doesn't matter, extra soul doesn't matter, getting new skills in the skill tree do not matter. Unless you want to explore to see a hole in ground and get a shiny orb to get more useless stuff, exploration is worthless. There are no cool ares or power ups that you get from going out of your way to explore the world. Also there are so many points in the game where you can't go back and get something you missed so if you are trying to get everything and miss it once, you're fucked.\n\n(spoilers) And for a game that is known for its \"great story\" I was appalled at what was going on. The purpose is for you to restore the forest and save this magic tree while trying to escape the wrath of an owl. Turns out the tree absolutely murders the the owl babies and now we are still supposed to save the tree?? Fuck that I'm teaming up with the owl and burning this place down. I'm not trying to save a baby owl murderer. And at the end the only way for the owl to save his last baby is to get himself killed by the tree. That is so fucked. I hope in the sequel I get to burn the tree down.", "timestamp_created": 1688621164, "timestamp_updated": 1688621164, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476377934217453003", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141422825": {"recommendationid": "141422825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357299888", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1683207080}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful and emotional", "timestamp_created": 1688619198, "timestamp_updated": 1688619198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141422114": {"recommendationid": "141422114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329569718", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 676, "last_played": 1688618058}, "language": "english", "review": "the most visually stunning 2d platformer i have played. more frustration than fun in the last act for me. loved it and hated it.", "timestamp_created": 1688618244, "timestamp_updated": 1688618244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141406422": {"recommendationid": "141406422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137185055", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 414, "last_played": 1689111927}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hermoso, como vos \u2665", "timestamp_created": 1688597704, "timestamp_updated": 1688597704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141401204": {"recommendationid": "141401204", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993564357", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 131, "last_played": 1688591579}, "language": "english", "review": "As far as I can tell this game is a \"sliding down a wall while you slam the jump button endlessly until you hit the inevitable spikes on the wall and die again\" over and over simulator.

While the challenge is very clearly present, it doesn't make world progression overly cryptic which is quite nice - most of the challenge comes in navigating hostile environments, which  can get a little annoying at times. To give an example, some environmental spikes have extremely deceptive collision detection, and there are certain parts of the game involving extreme timing and perfection and may require several restarts. There were a few areas that felt like some of the harder levels in Super Meat Boy (very challenging). That said, if you play the game right, you won't be backtracking too much, which is a particular peeve of mine typically present within this genre. Acquired abilities are useful outside of their progressionary intent, which is also refreshing.\n\nI can't however mention enough how beautiful this game is. The art style is lush and vibrant; terrain and backdrops look almost as though they have been painted, creating a truly joyful atmosphere. The soundtrack is also pretty solid and only adds to the games charm. There is a story present, albeit a basic one, but this certainly doesn't detract from the general gameplay, and some feels were had in certain parts of the game. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and will look forward to playing the sequel! The most important advice I can give regarding this game, is to not be fooled by the Ghibli-esque visuals. This is a TOUGH game, harder than Hollow Knight and instead more comparable to the Path of Pain sections at certain points.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\nBeautiful game design.\nIntuitive and responsive controls.\nWell thought out level design with regards to backtracking.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\nSometimes unfair collision detection.\nBrutal platforming challenges at times.\nChanges of pacing that can give you a false sense of security.\nEnemy variations are a bit lacking.", "timestamp_created": 1688503162, "timestamp_updated": 1688503162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541666686534881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141314543": {"recommendationid": "141314543", "author": {"steamid": "76561199111730096", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 741, "last_played": 1695046843}, "language": "english", "review": "An awsome game with beautiful music\nHighly recommended", "timestamp_created": 1688497042, "timestamp_updated": 1689979793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141309990": {"recommendationid": "141309990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198840984101", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 462, "last_played": 1688822127}, "language": "english", "review": "banger", "timestamp_created": 1688493020, "timestamp_updated": 1688493020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141309768": {"recommendationid": "141309768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260697978", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 656, "last_played": 1587386656}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1688492822, "timestamp_updated": 1688492822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141308742": {"recommendationid": "141308742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198908117360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1491, "last_played": 1682113529}, "language": "english", "review": "Unbelievably beautiful graphics.

The controls and mechanics are introduced at a pace that keeps the game interesting, while also giving you time to learn them so you don't get overwhelmed with all the moves and abilities that can be used. I have completed the main story on normal mode, and the gameplay is challenging (and sometimes a bit rage-inducing) but it stays interesting by giving you a vast range of unique areas to explore, and puzzles to solve. The main character, Ori, is animated so well and when using all the different abilities, the animation is smooth. While there are no 'bosses' in this game, this is greatly redeemed by having [spoiler]various fast paced escape sequences where you utilise what you have learnt in a challenging race against dangers that are so beautiful and they make you feel so good once you complete them :)[/spoiler]\nMy only criticisms are that the manual saving is a bit awkward and a lot of the enemies are just re-skins of previous ones, with slightly different abilities.  \n\nHowever i have a few tips for those who are new:\n- You will die a lot, Don't let the graphics fool you, this game is difficult. If you wanted a relaxing game, this is not what you are looking for\n- Save your game a lot. The game doesn't autosave very often and if you die you will go back to your last save so do this to avoid losing your progress.\n- Early game spoilers: [spoiler] Collect as many life/energy cells as you can earlier on so that you will find late game a lot easier. Often in late game you wont be able to save due to a lack of energy so more energy points helps with this :)[/spoiler]\n", "timestamp_created": 1688327130, "timestamp_updated": 1688327130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141159998": {"recommendationid": "141159998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987292649", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 803, "last_played": 1688329699}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story.

It is a gorgeous game, and has some really great level design. I especially loved the escape sequences for their added tension, and the feeling of flow that they create. I do have one complaint that took away a decent bit from my experience, though.\n\nI typically enjoy the hard difficulty on most games. But on Ori, I would recommend avoiding this. The combat in this game is a bit of an afterthought, and hard mode REALLY demonstrates this. Mashing one single button while an orb does all the work for you is NOT fun, especially when hard mode just nerfs your health and damage making these sections last even longer. Pop it in on normal or even easy to hide these issues and you're in for a fun time.\n\nThis game deserves praise for its good ideas (the bash move is especially genius), but even more for its presentation. The visuals and soundtrack are both stunning. Combined with the story, this feels like playing through an A-tier Pixar movie.

Movement feels AMAZING, and the visuals are stunning, but these seems to sadly be the only great things about Ori. This game is a metroidvania, which means that exploration is given an enormous priority, and that felt great as well... at first. But the game is one fundamental flaw: the skill tree. I cannot state how easily this game could have turned out better, if only the skill tree was given less of a priority. \n\nFor example, as I said ,exploring should be at the forefront of this game. And yet, one of the very first upgrades you get is a tracker, which tells you exactly where every collectible is found on the map, INCLUDING PLACES YOU HAVEN'T VISITED YET. So, very early in the game, you're basically shown the entirety of the map through these collectible locations, and you're no longer incentivised to explore as much as you should, since your experience with the game turns into a simple matter of opening the map, checking where the next closest collectible is, go there directly, and repeat. Exploration is no longer relevant, because you're constantly given a direction to move towards. And this is only one of the problems with this skill tree, although I feel like I've rambled enough about it already.\n\nThe thing is... tuning slightly these systems would have improved the user experience tremendously, and it's such a shame that such a polished game was built around such weak mechanics (except for the movement, that's still awesome).\n\nSorry... I would not recommend playing this game... but you do you, hopefully I'm just wrong and you'll enjoy it :)", "timestamp_created": 1688057729, "timestamp_updated": 1688057729, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140913692": {"recommendationid": "140913692", "author": {"steamid": "76561199058567567", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 686, "last_played": 1688055803}, "language": "english", "review": "I brought this game for \u00a33.74 on Steam sale which i figure is a steal since Ori took me 9hrs 42mins to beat.

Ori is hard!\n\nThe baked in death counter (great feature, every game should have it) showed me how bad i was at the game. I've never had anywhere near 480 deaths in all of my Dark Souls, Bloodbourne and Elden Ring playthroughs combined!  Thankfully though loading back in is instant so just remember to save often...\n\nThis is one of the most frustrating games I've ever played but once it clicks it's great. \n\nIf you want a good looking game and a decent story with some fiendishly difficult traversal then i highly recommend.

The story relies on cheap tear-jerker plot elements to get the player emotionally invested, and doesn't have much to say beyond \"family is good\" and \"be nice to people.\" The gameplay vacillates between simplistic but workable sections and frustratingly precise scripted sequences.

It might be better with a controller than with a keyboard, but a [i]remastered[/i] version of a game should just get this right. But that's only where it starts; it's often very hard to estimate, from looking at the environment and having had some exercise with your motion, whether you should or shouldn't be able to make the jump with your current abilities. If you're making a Metroidvania platformer, this should be a disqualifying quality.\n\nNot only is it hard to estimate whether you can make that jump, but also whether the enemy that's barely even on screen can jump on top of you. This makes you want to run away at the first sight of any enemy that you haven't seen before (or sometimes even that you think you've seen before, but this shapeless blob looks slightly different and has wildly different attacks), and get ready to spam your attack when it gets near, because enemies take a ton of hits before you're done with them. And this is \"normal\" difficulty.\n\nBut what prompted me to uninstall the game, where the two times that the game design, in the sense how the game signals to you how to progress towards a goal, wasted my time.\n\nIn [spoiler]the first half of Black Root Burrows[/spoiler], the game will teach you a new mechanic by sending you through a whole obstacle course. After you're done with it, you're in a nearly empty room ([spoiler]the jumping puzzle immediately before you dispel the darkness in Black Root Burrows[/spoiler]). This is usually a game's way to tell you that [u]you don't really have to learn any new tricks, you just have to apply them[/u]. And that will leave you stuck, until you figure out that you can also drop the object you're holding, which is not something you were taught (through necessity, or hints, or by accident) during the obstacle course. What's worse, once you drop the object, all your dynamics have changed, so you'll jump over [spoiler]the ghost platform next to you[/spoiler] the first time around. You're going to need a few attempts, which each take a frustrating half a minute of retrieving the object and using it to get back up again. There's a reason that failures result in fast retries in games in this genre, but this game missed that memo.\n\nI only did that puzzle because I was stuck on another puzzle. I had pushed a rock into what clearly was a \"slot\" near [spoiler]the well near Thornfelt Swamp[/spoiler]. If an object \"slots\" into something, then that's usually a game's way to tell you [u]it is in the right place and you don't have to touch it anymore[/u]. At that point, I could wall jump, so I tried jumping up from this rock onto a wall next to it, but I only grazed the corner of that wall each time. I didn't have the double jump ability that the ability tree hinted on, so I figured I needed to get that first. After scouting the entire map for something I might have missed, and getting stuck in the aforementioned part of [spoiler]Black Root Burrows[/spoiler], I returned to the rock. As it turns out, you can't push or pull the rock out of the slot, but your attempts to do so ever so slightly rotate the rock, giving you just enough pixels of extra jump height to jump up that wall.\n\n[i]Ori and the Blind Forest[/i] really has nothing on [i]Hollow Knight[/i] (Metroidvania platformer) and [i]Celeste[/i] (not a Metroidvania, but a focus on skillful platforming). Those games at least left me with the feeling that I should've known better and could've done better each time I died or failed a jump.", "timestamp_created": 1687887406, "timestamp_updated": 1687889416, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140794292": {"recommendationid": "140794292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125436952", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 635, "last_played": 1687875881}, "language": "english", "review": "Visuals 9/10\nMusic 10/10\nAtmosphere 8/10\nGameplay 9/10\nControls 6/10\nStorytelling 9/10\nDifficulty - Advanced", "timestamp_created": 1687877689, "timestamp_updated": 1687877689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140792822": {"recommendationid": "140792822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283586232", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1629116611}, "language": "english", "review": "Still one of my fav games great stuff", "timestamp_created": 1687876003, "timestamp_updated": 1687876003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140780473": {"recommendationid": "140780473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138884370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1688091207}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1687857629, "timestamp_updated": 1687857629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140778399": {"recommendationid": "140778399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198840095700", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 566, "last_played": 1689155066}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Ori and the Blind Forest is an outstanding game with excellent visuals, audio, and story.

[/b]\nBought the game to relax from my examination week. However, to my surprise, the game turned out to be an exceptional experience, surpassing my expectations of it, so I decided to create a review. Ori and the Blind Forest effortlessly blends stunning visuals, enchanting storytelling, and tight gameplay mechanics to create an unforgettable gaming experience(mainly due to dying), like literally I can't recount how much I died from this game, which made me more stressful which is a good thing right?..\n\n[b] Story [/b]\nThe game introduces players to Ori, a small guardian spirit tasked with restoring the forest's balance after a catastrophic event. Through the course of the game, Ori's journey becomes a metaphor for self-discovery, friendship, and sacrifice. The storytelling is done primarily through visual and atmospheric cues, with minimal dialogue, yet it manages to tug at the heartstrings and elicit genuine emotions from me.\n\n[b] SOUND DESIGN [/b]\nThe game's sound design and music deserve special mention. The orchestral score composed by Gareth Coker perfectly complements the game's visuals and emotional beats The melodies are hauntingly beautiful, capturing the essence of each moment. Combined with the atmospheric sound effects, the audio immerses players in the world of Ori and adds an extra layer of immersion. \n\n[b] VISUAL [/b]\nOne of the most striking features of Ori and the Blind Forest is its breathtaking visual design. The colors are rich and varied, seamlessly transitioning between serene and tranquil moments to intense and action-packed sequences. The visual beauty of the game is further enhanced by the fluid animations. In short this game is good in sense of atmosphere, visuals, sound design.\n\n[b] GAMEPLAY [/b]\nBeyond its aesthetics and narrative, Ori and the Blind Forest boasts polished gameplay mechanics that are both challenging and rewarding. The platforming elements are finely tuned, demanding precise timing and nimble reflexes. Although I recommend this game [b] I WOULD NOT [/b] recommend it to people who are looking to play [b] tension-free gameplay[/b]. While Ori and the Blind Forest offers an incredible gaming experience, it's important to note that the gameplay can occasionally be intense and challenging, leading to moments of frustration. It's like a relationship with a mischievous spirit that tests your patience, and occasionally makes you question your life choices, but you can't help but keep coming back for more for the sake of completion. \u315c\u315c\n\n[b] CONCLUSION [/b]\nOri and the Blind Forest is an extraordinary game that excels in the visuals, storytelling and.. gameplay(if you like intense challenges I guess). Would I play it again? YES AND NO, I have a love-hate relationship with this game so I can't really decide.\n\nOut of the topic but you can check out my guide for 100% completion, hope it helps!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2992488344\n\nHave a good day^^", "timestamp_created": 1687427282, "timestamp_updated": 1689142177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839072704315185547", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140485281": {"recommendationid": "140485281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078041524", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 710, "last_played": 1687423322}, "language": "english", "review": ":')", "timestamp_created": 1687424111, "timestamp_updated": 1687424111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140480958": {"recommendationid": "140480958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870760147", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 981, "last_played": 1687461481}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome", "timestamp_created": 1687415657, "timestamp_updated": 1687415657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140469473": {"recommendationid": "140469473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799165435", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1004, "last_played": 1687393690}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego es precioso, tanto en apartado visual como historia. \nEs un plataformero entretenido y que a pesar de numerosas muertes no se hace estresante\nAdem\u00e1s, para verse tan bien consume pocos recursos y puede ir bien en la mayor\u00eda de ordenadores.", "timestamp_created": 1687393935, "timestamp_updated": 1687393935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140464576": {"recommendationid": "140464576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409564169", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1687373189}, "language": "english", "review": "graphics and gameplay great\nsoundtracks decent\nstory meh\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1687385158, "timestamp_updated": 1687385158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140463748": {"recommendationid": "140463748", "author": {"steamid": "76561199080251577", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 862, "last_played": 1687394355}, "language": "english", "review": "This game caught me emotionally.

The game was released for Windows and Xbox One in March 2015, and for Nintendo Switch in September 2019. Players assume control of [u] Ori [/u], a small white spirit, and Sein, the \"light and eyes\" of the Forest's Spirit Tree. Players are tasked to move between platforms and solve puzzles.\n\nLet me start off with saying how [u] BEAUTIFUL LOOKING [/u] this game is ( and [b] Will of the Wisps [/b] gets better ). From the first 10 minutes into this game you already are amazed by the beauty this game throws into your eyes alongside tears because of what happens and how they set up the game of telling a story of [b] friendship, selflessness, and loss [/b]. This game indeed made me shed a few tears at a few moments of the game. The [u] Soundtrack[/u] of this game is also super chill and amazing to listen to be it in-game or outside of it. The [u] Gameplay [/u] is pretty straightforward and expected from a platform-adventure Metroidvania game but there is something about the movement that is in this game that is super easy but hard to master. As you play through the game you learn new [u] skills for combat and movement [/u] to use like powerful jump, hanging on walls or slamming into the ground with force BUT with new skills comes new challenges to master, an example is that Ori can fire energy orbs at nearby foes when he isn't avoiding them completely, and those creatures can be difficult to overcome. The blobs that stick to walls and ceilings? They aren't much of a hassle, at least until they coat the surfaces you need to cross and spit acid onto the ground. This game is in no shape easy even on easy difficulty, you need to learn from your mistakes and failure and master every move to be able to move into next area. Not gonna lie i actually did almost rage quit the game or shouted few bad words when i was playing on the hard difficulty but it was not that i was frustrated or game\u2019s fault but instead it was just me failing on a part cause i either miss-timed it or rushed and the custom save system where you can use one energy point to save whenever you feel like to was the best choice developers did for this game \ud83d\udc4f. The best part of this game has to be the [spoiler] the escape sequences few rooms have to offer as you restore light to this lost forest. They are intense and pulse-pounding BUT it makes you appreciate the game's visual artistry.  Multiple layers give each environment a lovely sense of depth [/spoiler]\n\n[b] Overall to summarize. Ori and the Blind Forest is a beautiful, heart-touching and very clever game from Moon Studios and its story, soundtrack, world, graphics and art style is beautiful from start to end. Gameplay is also super fun to play and level design always keep you on thinking to be fast and responsive. I HIGHLY Recommend this game for its price point and looking forward to playing Will of the Wisps next [/b]\n\nGame Link ( Steam

Esto puede sonar a que est\u00e1 mal adaptado a este medio. Nada m\u00e1s lejos de la realidad. Ori and the Blind Forest es un videojuego incre\u00edble. Aunque s\u00ed que se nota alg\u00fan punto flojo.\n\nJugablemente, es genial. Tiene unos controles s\u00faper fluidos que a manos de expertos, son una delicia de ver solamente. Esto si lo combinamos con la cantidad ingente de habilidades que se consiguen tanto obligatoriamente como las que se obtienen en el \u00e1rbol de habilidades, crea un set de movimientos muy amplio en el que puedes hacer aut\u00e9nticas virguer\u00edas. \n\nCon el mapa tengo sentimientos encontrados. Por una parte, me ha gustado, tiene entornos variados, un dise\u00f1o bastante parecido al de un metroidvania (por su \"no linealidad\"), muchas secciones plataformeras que aprovechan a la perfecci\u00f3n el control tan bueno que tenemos sobre Ori, pero por otra parte, me ha parecido muy lineal para ser un metroidvania. Va llev\u00e1ndote de la mano indic\u00e1ndote d\u00f3nde est\u00e1 todo y a d\u00f3nde tienes que ir. Pero en general, es un muy buen mapa.\n\nAudiovisualmente, es hermoso. Pocos juegos he visto con un soundtrack que pueden hacerte llorar o animarte al mismo tiempo. Tiene un mont\u00f3n de temas s\u00faper \u00e9picos que llegan al coraz\u00f3n y quiero dar mi enhorabuena a la orquesta dedicada al OST del juego. Y visualmente es una delicia. Es un juego precioso, con un mont\u00f3n de colores, con dise\u00f1os de personajes y lugares espectaculares... Podr\u00eda pasarme horas diciendo lo bueno que es en este aspecto.\n\nY la historia es muy buena. Lo que menciono al principio de la rese\u00f1a de \"una historia hecha videojuego\" se nota. Se centra mucho en temas como el amor padre-hijo, el sacrificio y la lealtad, creando una trama con momentos muy tr\u00e1gicos que pueden hacer llorar.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, Ori and the Blind Forest es un juegazo que por su duraci\u00f3n (unas 7,5 horas en mi caso) se te puede hacer mi caro, pero cr\u00e9eme que merece completamente la pena.

parts in the game require you to master a newly acquired skill to progress, some sort of a boss fight against the movement mechanics. the timings are a little too tight from my liking in those sections, forcing you to replay that same section multiple times, some might like this - I didn't.\n-Story didn't catch my attention for too long, as the events in it are quite predictable and feel

The game was challenging, sometimes frustrating, but overall a decent balance if you're willing to tough it out. I liked the puzzle sections but I won't lie about some of the solutions being unclear. I had to cheese some of the platformer puzzles to progress in the game lol. \n\nNow let's get down to my skill issues: I had a hard time 100% my save file due to an area that I missed which the map didn't indicate. I guess maybe that can be due to user error but it was literally a small section in the Ginso Tree that I visited but didn't step on. I literally went up and down the whole tree a good half a dozen times and let me tell you, I was about to cry lmao\n\nWith that being said, I didn't have as good of a time that I hoped I would with this game. Maybe it's because of the game's reputation and I expected a lot more from it. That's definitely a me problem though. There's various gimmicks throughout the game, especially in the major sections, most involving puzzles and platforming. I enjoyed a lot of them and when I figured out the solution to some of these section I was like \"Ohhh, I get it now. That's really that's cool.\" \n\nI also liked the save anywhere mechanic but I do realize it could be a problem for some. You have to be strategic as it uses your energy but if you're like me then you did lots of the collectibles and abilities to mitigate this problem. Although, I can totally see this being extremely frustrating for younger players. \n\nI liked this game overall. The story was predictable and a little too saccharine for my tastes. It's the visuals and gameplay which I would say are mostly really good. The music was also good but some of the sections where the music is supposed to be emotional didn't really hit for me.\n\nOnce you get the full arsenal of movement the game becomes a lot more fun and almost trivial once you get the hang of things. I did have lots of fun zipping around and using enemies as bounce pads. The game rewards exploration and searching every nook and cranny to find something that can make Ori a much more fun character to play as.\n\nI'd say the hardest parts about this game for me was honestly the sections with the owl, especially the last one. I was getting so mad after dying over and over that when the ending of the game occurred I didn't really care. I wish I felt some type of happiness or satisfaction with the ending but I didn't. Again, a lot of my problems boil down to skill issues and minor gripes with gimmicks, puzzles, and difficulty in some parts. \n\nI definitely would recommend this game if you're into platformers and/or metroidvanias. It's challenging and it has lots to offer in it's core gameplay loop. Would I play this again? Maybe but I don't plan on doing so anytime soon. If you're a completionist then this is probably gonna be one of more simpler games that you can 100%. I don't like giving out number scores for things but if I had to then I'd say this is a high 7, low 8.

The movement is very smooth - from the painfully restrictive state at the beginning of the game, it gets ridiculously round and multifaceted towards the end. It really is a platforming game, with added combat elements (compared to Blasphemous, Hollow Knight, Gato Roboto etc where the combat is just as if not more important than the parkour). \n\nWhat sours the impression somewhat is the writing. While the platforming is satisfyingly challenging, the story is basically on the level of childrens television - kinda like the Trine series. We solved all our issues with the power of friendship!- and then it ends... rather unimaginative for an IP of this quality.\n\nFurther, the dialogue of the wisp and the tree might as well not be there, as it brings nothing to the table (kinda just worsens the game, really). To compare with a different but similar game - Hyper Light Drifter has literally no dialogue in the entire game, and handles story and would-be dialogue exclusively through images and a wonderfully executed visual design. Gris has no dialogue to speak of either, and it probably functions better for it. Having what's essentially just the wisp from Zelda constantly explaining everything in all-too-concrete terms (we need to go to Fire Mountain and get the Fire Stone!) ruins the immersion more than it helps the player - it's a reminder that it's all Just A Game, and after experiencing HLD (or any other game in which the dialogue is handled in a less obtruse manner), a \"Just A Game\"-game just doesn't cut it. At least not for a perfect 10.\n\nBut while there's some whacky bits in the story... won't lie, I was kinda touched by the final scene.\n\nFirst impressions after just finishing the game - definitely in the upper half of the X/10.", "timestamp_created": 1686339014, "timestamp_updated": 1686339313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508474588394165039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139797681": {"recommendationid": "139797681", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067121346", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 813, "last_played": 1686338354}, "language": "english", "review": "berri good\n", "timestamp_created": 1686338440, "timestamp_updated": 1686338440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486725687980651855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139780784": {"recommendationid": "139780784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340955420", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "playtime_at_review": 904, "last_played": 1700473414}, "language": "english", "review": "Great platformer, a nice difficulty, not too easy or too hard, fun puzzles, a big and not complex moveset, the combat system is a bit boring but that's totally fine.

And unbelievably fantastic representation of the Metroidvania genre with more of a focus on platforming than combat. A must-buy in my book.\n\nStory-wise, this game has only a handful of characters with no dialogue in-between them (other than narration) and yet somehow puts every AAA game to shame with how emotionally impactful it is. A lot of people found the first 10 minutes of the game to be a tear jerker and the ending is somewhat similar. We witness character growth between 2 of the characters and honestly its great how nice and minimal yet well done the story is. \n\nThe game is one of the most beautiful 2D games I've ever played (and the sequel is even better). There's more of an emphasis on platforming than combat in the gameplay and that is mirrored by the level design as well. This is opposed to Hollow Knight - which is more combat based - and Metroid - which is very mixed. It also lacks any of the RPG elements in Symphony of the Night and instead takes a Metroid approach, which is totally fine. There are plenty of times throughout the game when I thought \"That has to be all the skills in the game... right?\" they hit you with another one completely changing the way you can traverse some areas. \n\nUnlike Hollow Knight, which I found to be almost devoid of power-ups, this game has plenty. Although I will say by the end of the game they aren't nearly as useful. The game is chalked full with every corner having invisible walls, and short little puzzles to unlock more health, magic, or XP. \n\nSince combat is not nearly as important in this game its understandable that combat is also the weakest part of the game. You get an auto lock-on projectile, a ground-pound, and an one that lets you bounce off of enemy projectiles. But since combat isn't that important they never really throw that many enemies at you too often and the boss battles are non-existent. The sequel improves on this aspect considerably.\n\nThe Definitive Edition adds two optional new areas to explore and that have power-ups as well. Its not that huge of a difference, and so I wouldn't say its absolutely necessary to buy the Definitive Edition. \n\nAll in all, this is one of the best Metroidvania games of all time. I've played every Metroid game and would have to put this up there next to Super Metroid in my opinion (not as revolutionary though, just enjoyment wise). You're getting a good 8 hours of gameplay with fantastic art direction and great potential for exploration. And for the price it's at? [b] 100% you must purchase this game! [/b] The sequel is also just as good and improves upon many of the mechanics in the game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1685941578, "timestamp_updated": 1685941663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139575830": {"recommendationid": "139575830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416538706", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1686033406}, "language": "english", "review": "I am very very very very conflicted on this review. I wish i could vote mixed instead of thumbs up or down. They attempted to make a game to please platformer fans and metroidvania fans all at once which just doesnt work. I saw a steam review that stated \"Your average platformer fan doesnt want to be drip fed power ups and be lost with tedious back tracking while your metroidvania fans dont desire the more linear powers that have to be given to appease the platforming. It just doesnt mix.\" and as a platformer fan myself i have to agree\n\nThe pros:\n- Amazing art design and world\n- Emotional story that never fails to tug at your heartstrings \n- Decent combat with exceptional parkour.\n- Amazing first 1/3 of the game where i would make no changes.\n\nHugely massive con:\n- The level design is absurdly bad even for a metroidvania game. After the first of the 3 artifacts i had to look up a specific guide for where i was every 15 minutes and this is apparently really common. Every quick 1 minute long \"here is the dumb way to go/solution\" video got posted by unknown channels but they all got 200-400k views. That is insane that so many people have to flock to help because the level design is something to be ashamed of. Even on repeat i would probably be lost replaying an that is no fun so i decided to not go for 100% even tho i love the story and the actual gameplay.\n- Another massive problem on my run was the developers not level designing for agility upgrades, since i got triple jump early i entered areas i should not of even been in...... i was in misty woods before the first artifact and another time i got lost because a crusher also shot me through the floor and i thought it was supposed to happen. When you unlock new areas too the game wants you to go to a specific area that isnt even near the new area because there was a crack in the ceiling that you can now break even tho the room was forgettable and you ran right past it and its in the middle of the map. Sometimes no hand holding just leads to sloppy level design\n\n\nTLDR: Story is amazing and so is the artstyle and gameplay but idk if i would recommend due to lazy level design and unforseen player upgrades that can get you lost with no sense of how to return. I will give a thumbs up but i would suggest watching a walkthrough for the story instead. Literally cant give a thumbs down because the story rocked\n\n\n\nEDIT AFTER 100%. Opinion on level design hasn't changed and this game is a nightmare for achievement hunters. No stone unturned is literally bugged, good thing i had a back up save to do a certain strategy to raise my secret count. Be careful if going for 100%, so many bugs. Even having any save game on your files where you bought an ability will void the achievement to do a run without buying abilities....

This means that by making a platformer metroidvania hybrid, the developers had to juggle several conflicting priorities that arose from trying to please both crowds, ultimately culminating into an experience that does not know what it wants to be.\n\nPlatformer fans appreciate and thrive off the inclusion of fun movement mechanics, engaging and demanding levels and the knowledge that they are improving at their parkouring skills, whereas Metroidvania fans tend to appreciate more extrinsic rewards, where improvement and progress is dictated by the constant drip-feed of power-ups, stat buffs and keys, whether they be power ups or just resi style keys, to open up the world. In essence, one thrives off the challenge faced and the dexterity acquired to match such odds where as the other is more concerned about the power fantasy.\n\nMoon studios has NOT juggled these two divergent demands sufficiently deftly. The metroidvania world is both too simple to satisfy metroidvania fans but enough of a time waster with lack of relevant obstacles to bore even the most patient platformer fanatic. The mechanics are fun, but they are never pushed to their true limit by the level design, souring the experience for platforming fans, yet being too complex for metroidvania fans that want the progression in the game to level out the difficulty rather than feel the technical demand ramp up as the game progresses.\n\nEven when given the chance to mitigate these conflicting demands by having the metroidvania platformer hybrid become more than the sum of its parts via tasteful mixing of platforming and metroidvania ideas, moon studios fails to deliver.\n\nAll optional secrets lead to a power up and little else, rather than, let\u00b4s say more fully fledged levels that rewards players who engage with the game and expand the initial scope of the world map, aspects that both types of players would greatly appreciate. Or how there\u00b4s a dearth of glitchless sequence breaking that the metroidvania genre is known for, creating diverse path for all the players, yet the game prefers to railroad you constantly.\n\nWhat hurts most about any game, is not its faults but rather its missed potential. When I see what moon studios could have achieved with Ori, but ended up compromising with a middle of the road release,  I can\u00b4t help but tear up. \n\nFeel free to buy the game, I am sure it will last you a playthrough; now as to anything beyond that?

It's fun to explore, get lost, backtrack, unlock new abilities and rediscover how you can interact with each of the many diverse environments. Upon completion, I got a very satisfying feeling of accomplishment and well-spent time.\n\nI'm a slow player, but it took me around 15h to 100% the map and get all achievements that are available on the first play-through. At first, I thought it's a pity that the map doesn't have markers, but in the end I was able to get all collectibles and discover all secrets without getting bored with repetitive backtracking or looking up online guides. Once you unlock some abilities or beat some \"bosses\", it becomes easier to traverse other environments, which makes it faster and less boring to go back and get some collectibles that were unavailable before. \n\nThe game is pretty well-balanced in my opinion: there were plenty of challenges that required multiple attempts and a combination of puzzle-solving with precision, but it was never so hard that I would rage-quit. I also liked chase challenges instead of boss-fights, just a personal preference, but it was more fun and less anxiety for me.\n\nI usually play several games in parallel, depending on the mood, but once I started Ori, I couldn't stop until I finished it. Surprisingly, this wasn't because of an engaging story, but because of the fun gameplay and overall very enjoyable experience. I think the story-telling just didn't click with me (the god-like tree talking), but the animation in cut-scenes was amazing, just like watching a professionally made short animated film. The animation in the game itself is beautiful, it has an original style, detailed backgrounds and interesting character designs. I played it on a Steam Deck, but always connected it to the big TV screen to enjoy the visuals in details. And to just add to the complete experience, there is a beautiful, elaborate soundtrack, it really creates a great atmosphere and doesn't get old after playing for a while.\n\nP.S. the \"Definitive Edition\" has a fascinating collection of early prototype sketches and videos of early development.

Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for her. I remember seeing her playing it from time to time, the message indicating that she'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that she was enjoying my gift.\nLast September she committed suicide.\n\nAfter everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up her computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Core keeper.\nShe had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. She had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of loot. It was only then did I see just how much she loved my present. No other game she played quite captured her affection as much as this one. None of her friends really knew about it, however; it seems like she preferred to keep it to herself. Like it was her own little bit of heaven she could turn to whenever she wanted.\n\nAnd because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.\n\nI cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (I'll often find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours.

The only thing that was mildly annoying was some boss fights where you will have to replay an unneccesarily lenghty part of the sequence when you fail. They could have respawned you a bit further in there. But it's not a big deal since there aren't too many boss fights. And while challening, they are not overly difficult just for the sake of difficulty, like in Dark Souls or Hollow Knight. They're a good mix of challenge and fun, and this applies also to the usual enemy encounters.

I've beaten the game so many times now, and three times on its One-Life mode--once on my Switch, once on my friend's Steam account, and most recently again on my own Steam account (with 100% completion!). So even though I'm listed as 23 hours into this game, I've played it for many more.\n\nThere are many things that make this game wonderful in my mind, but I'll give an overview of my favorite things in a non-spoiler fashion.\n\nTL;DR: Give this game a shot; it's well worth it.\n\nGAMEPLAY (Excellent!)\nFirst off, Ori and the Blind Forest has easily some of the best movement in any platformer I've played. Ori feels very responsive.  In the early game, Ori feels good enough as you just run and jump through the map. But, as the game progresses, the various abilities you unlock allow you to soar across the map with high speed and high precision. Ori spends a ton of time in the air, but you always have a ton of control.\n\nThe game isn't easy, either. You're given a wide variety of abilities that string together in very interesting ways, and the game expects you to learn how to use them and use them well. The challenges the game throws at you demand a certain degree of mastery over the controls and Ori's skills, as you'd desire for a platformer. Given how I've played it to death, the difficult is somewhat diminished in my mind now, but I do recall that I took hundreds of deaths in my first playthrough--a good thing in my mind as a gamer who likes a challenge. But, even if you prefer easier experiences, you're allowed to save (almost) anytime and anywhere, so you can typically lock in your progress after clearing a difficult challenge only once. This allows the game to be difficult without being too punishing. The game also has an Easy mode for inexperienced/relaxed players.\n\nAs a side note--you may have heard Blind Forest described as a metroidvania. This is nominally true, but it honestly it plays fairly linearly; if you're looking for a distinctly metroidvania experience, this isn't quite the game to find that. Most of the metroidvania parts will be missed entirely unless you're going for 100% completion, and even then they play more as a \"come back to this area later with a new ability to explore this small nook with bonus rewards.\"\n\nI say all that to say: Treat Ori like a linear platformer game. that's where it shines, and it shines brightly.\n\nSTORY (Simple but Heartfelt--no spoilers, I promise)\nBecause I'm promising no spoilers, I won't say much. All I'll say is that the story is deeply heartfelt, which I always love in a game. It's not particularly deep, so if you're looking for a story that will leave you with something to chew on for an extended period of time, you won't really find it here. Instead, the story is simple--which is the right fit for what Blind Forest is--and it ties the game together beautifully.\n\nGRAPHICS (Beautiful!)\nThis game is gorgeous. If I recall correctly, every environment was painted by hand and then imported into the game. \n\nMUSIC (Stellar!)\nGareth Coker is a stellar composer, and it shows in this game. I do think he outdid even this soundtrack in Will of the Wisps, but I still find myself pulling up the Blind Forest soundtrack on Spotify here and there. Every track is memorable in its own way, and helps the game really hit home with the wide range of emotions it explores throughout.\n\nREPLAYABILITY AND PLAY TIME (Depends on you! But probably honestly not too replayable.)\nIn my mind, replayability is a non-factor for a game's quality, and way too much emphasis is placed upon it in modern game reviews. But that's a side rant that I'll spare you for now. I'll just cover this since I know some people care about that sort of thing.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest's replayability is contingent upon the type of gamer you are. If you like beating a game once and then calling yourself done, Ori will give you an experience that's loads of fun but won't last too long--maybe around seven to ten hours on a first playthrough, depending on your skill with plaformers? (Again, I've played this game to death, so I don't have a good sense of this anymore, but my playthroughs nowadays tend to take three hours to 100% the game--given that I die infrequently, if at all, and already know where all the secrets are.) If you want to get all the achievements, including the ones related to One-Life mode, you'll need to replay the game several times to do so. Again, given the game's linear nature, the repeated playthroughs will be similar to one another, so most of the replay value comes in refining your abilities in the game and watching yourself improve.\n\nIn a nutshell, if you get a kick out of grinding and watching yourself improve your skills--and won't be TOO devastated by dying to an instakill two-and-a-half hours into a One Life run of the game for the final achievement (and there are many, MANY instakills in Blind Forest)--Ori has a ton of replayability. Otherwise, don't expect too much from repeat playthroughs.\n\nCONCLUSION (BUY THIS GAME!)\nBUY THIS GAME! It's well worth the price, well worth the time, and well worth the tears if you happen to be an emotional gamer.\n\n-----\n\n*Yes, I know Ori is canonically ungendered. But also, I've always thought of him as male, not to mention that his voice gets deeper in Will of the Wisps--a distinct indicator of puberty in males. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1683923665, "timestamp_updated": 1683923665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138189837": {"recommendationid": "138189837", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977562871", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1855, "last_played": 1684605533}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful soundtrack, creative platforming and abilities, and a responsive control scheme as well as impressive means of storytelling make this game a great choice.", "timestamp_created": 1683907903, "timestamp_updated": 1683907903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138186822": {"recommendationid": "138186822", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072797148", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3812, "last_played": 1683904008}, "language": "english", "review": "very calming game", "timestamp_created": 1683903875, "timestamp_updated": 1683903875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138169368": {"recommendationid": "138169368", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123816046", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2702, "last_played": 1685169991}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Dios mio este juego es arte , a menos de que decidas hacer el logro trastornado , en todo caso vas a sufrir y vas a sufrir mucho", "timestamp_created": 1683867343, "timestamp_updated": 1683867343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138166762": {"recommendationid": "138166762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198796486511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 589, "last_played": 1683342591}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoyed playing", "timestamp_created": 1683860738, "timestamp_updated": 1683860738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138166537": {"recommendationid": "138166537", "author": {"steamid": "76561199267582521", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 393, "last_played": 1685238312}, "language": "spanish", "review": "hermoso sonora y visualmente.

All you need to is:\n\n- Chain someone to your gaming chair;\n- Make them play first ten minutes of Ori and the Blind Forest;\n- Listen to any \"awwww\" sounds. \n\nSeriously, this game is so awwww-some that I don't think most human beings have a capacity to withhold such overwhelming cuteness, unless something is terribly wrong with them. Going through Ori's intro sequence is like watching a duckling that falls to sleep next to a bunch of small kittens. This game enchants you quickly, sucks you into its world in a matter of seconds and just like someone who failed the aforementioned test, it will never let you forget it.\n\nIn case it wasn't obvious before and by some miracle you've missed all the screenshots, I'll state the obvious: it's a TRULY BEAUTIFUL GAME. Vividly drawn landscapes and happy fluid animations are parts of its charm, but combined with an ABSOLUTELY GENIUS SOUNDTRACK create a true feast for the senses; one that will only be depreciated by inventing edible strawberry-flavored monitors. The simple act of just pacing around is a great audio-visual experience, but along with the looks comes a surprisingly well-written story, giving our movements a deeper purpose. Despite its simplicity and Disneyesque qualities, it's told quite well, shifting the moods along the ride. While Ori is generally a joyful experience, it can also be full of tension or filled with grim solemnity. Each area has its own mood, making the world feel incredibly alive.\n\nGame's great atmosphere and soothing colors are important for other reasons, namely calming us down. Ori has a QUITE HIGH DIFFICULTY LEVEL, that's usually somewhere between \"that's gonna be a challenge\" and \"Oh, hell no\". The whole game area is one giant level, divided into smaller areas, creating something that gaming PhDs would call \"Metroidvania-inspired platformer\". While at first the road ahead is quite easy and straightforward, Ori quickly learns a bunch of new abilities that broaden the area of exploration to the size of New Caledonia. Curiosity and good eyes are often rewarded with the additional XP and power-ups, so there's a good reason to stray often from our path, but it's also incredibly easy to get lost in the huge sprawling environment. And sometimes you're going to waste time trying to beat a challenge that looks do-able, but it can only be done with certain skills that you don't yet possess. Some sections are just also old-fashionably hard, especially when you had the misfortune of saving the game with a low amount of health. When you painstakingly try to make your way through the level for the 20th time even the beauty of the world around can be lost. \n\nDespite giving us a harsh time now and then, Ori and the Blind Forest remains a PHENOMENAL game. The definitive edition is probably the best way to start the adventure with it, since it offers more content, new abilities, option to adjust difficulty and various quality of life improvements, etc., but you still won't be disappointed by going for the original version. It is still one of the best games I had the pleasure of playing and after 200 titles I'm not stating this lightly. It's an incredible experience and a total must-play. 10/10.

I played the entire game, start to finish, and completed all achievements not requiring subsequent runs, so I feel like I have a good understanding of the game.\n\nTo start, I'll admit that the art is objectively, beautiful. However, with so much detail on the screen, combined with the size of your character often makes it hard to understand what is hitting you. Projectiles from enemies can either camoflague into the backdrop, or just be small enough that you can't see them among the many other things on the screen. I understand that the size of your character is supposed to make the world seem bigger, however I feel it negatively impacts the game to an unreasonable level.\n\nThe movement in this game felt like shit to me the entire time. This game is some of the worst implementations of wall jumping and double jumping that I've experienced in my entire life. I see many ways in which this game strives to be unique, with the mechanics being one of them. Admittedly, some of the concepts I like, like the Bash movement allowing you to launch yourself off of enemies. Some I wasn't fond of, but I understand the purpose for, such as the saving. Saving in this game is much more of a risk reward mechanic, and while I personally don't like the way saving works, I don't think the decision to treat in game saving in the way it is is a particularly bad thing. However, referencing back to the double jump, it seems that this mechanic was changed from the typical double jump system just for the sake of being different. Being different doesn't automatically equate to being better. If the goal was to make the game harder, you can do this much more effectively through more difficult platforming sections based on environment, rather than player control. \n\nWhile I did praise the \"Bash\" system earlier, I found that the hitbox within which I could activate the ability was spotty, especially during the tree climbing segment. I found many hitboxes to be illogical, be it some of the spikes or enemies jumping next to you and failing to indicate the area in which you are able to be damaged.\n\nThe damage scaling in this game really doesn't make sense to me. When you have 3 hit points at the beginning of the game, spikes deal 2 damage. As you progress, you gain more hit points, but the damage from spikes and other enemies scales with you. Supposedly this system really forces you to explore and find as many secrets as you can to raise your health, but it still is an illogical way to scale difficulty throughout the game, at least to the degree that it is. \n\nThe story for this game to me is, for lack of a better word, average. Without spoiling what happens, it is at first glance a meaningful story, however if you put even an ounce of thought into it, the story is in no way deep or special. I don't even think this game necessarily needs to have a sprawling beautiful story, but people treat it like its the greatest story ever told by man, while in reality it's on par with a Disney movie. \n\nThe world building in this game feels highly disconnected. While each of the locations is beautiful, they all feel very separate from each other. You have your typical water section. Your lava section. Your forest section. Your dark section. Each of these environments in an echo chamber is great, but as I played through the game I felt no sense of coherence between the areas that had been created. \n\nFinally, the combat system is just all around disappointing. No thought has to be put into any sort of fighting throughout the whole game, it's just repeated left clicking. This would be fine of combat was sparse, but there is frequently enemies that you need to take care of, and the clicking becomes monotonous. \n\nIn short, I feel like there's just always a better game for you to be playing if you feel the urge to play Ori. If you want world building and combat, play Hollow Knight. If you want platforming and a meaningful story, play Celeste.

Directamente, esperaba M\u00c1S. Dentro rese\u00f1a!\n\nLlevo con este juego en mi biblioteca a\u00f1os, de hecho ten\u00eda la versi\u00f3n normal a la que jugu\u00e9 de salida como una hora. Y ahora ha sido cuando me lo he pasado en Steam Deck (60 fps con todo en alto, sin bajones, perfecto) y me ha quedado un mal sabor de boca.\n\nEs un metroidvania con una ost preciosa que tienes en la cabeza todo el rato. La historia, aunque m\u00e1s simple que los teletubbies, suficiente para que te de pena los protagonistas o el propio Ori. Pero ya est\u00e1, texto en pantalla para ir contando el desarrollo.\n\nEl mapa se divide en biomas aunque da la sensaci\u00f3n de que todo se repite constantemente, cada pincho, enemigo o roca. El mapa est\u00e1 muy bien conectado pero me da una pereza despu\u00e9s de las 6 horas para ver los cr\u00e9ditos, volver para recoger todo y mejorar a Ori al m\u00e1ximo. No le veo ning\u00fan incentivo. Ori posee un ataque \u00fanico, 3 ramas de habilidades con pasivas incluidas. Y adquirir\u00e1 poderes para poder volver a las zonas y continuar por caminos que hemos dejado. Incluso bucear. Mec\u00e1nicas de cualquier metroidvania y sencillos.\n\nLos tipos de enemigos son muy escasos, pero muy mucho. Bosses apenas. El tramo final es de lo m\u00e1s jodido que he visto en un metroidvania en cuesti\u00f3n de plataformeo al uso. Una mec\u00e1nica \u00fanica e interesante es que Ori tiene barra de vida y de man\u00e1. Con el man\u00e1 podremos poner puntos de guardados libres a nuestro antojo, es decir, nosotros hacemos los checkpoints. Una mec\u00e1nica bastante curiosa y \u00fanica. Pero quitando eso el juego es un popurr\u00ed de cosas, si bien bonitas, bastante simples para un juego de este estilo. No sientes una progresi\u00f3n inmensa. Tampoco entiendo el bombo de este juego, sinceramente. Blasphemous, Indivisible, Ender Lillies, incluso el Yokus Island me parecieron m\u00e1s interesantes y no se me hicieron bola.\n\nDicho esto, lo puedo recomendar en su justa medida, pero si pienso en un metroidvania, este Ori ser\u00eda de los \u00faltimos de la lista. La ventaja es que est\u00e1 tirado de precio. Acompa\u00f1a a Ori para salvar a los elementos que forman su mundo.

The interconnected regions of the forest are visually and mechanically distinct, though none of the game's stylistic choices break the mold. The level of background detail rarely affects readability, but that problem is far more pronounced when it comes to enemy projectiles, which often blend in with your projectiles or the drops from enemies, all of them being effectively just moving glowy bits.\n\nMy biggest criticism would be that the game does not unlock its full fun potential until your character, Ori, does; that is, until you've unlocked a solid selection of movement options.

I literally cannot proceed from the bash mechanic water run, because it requires perfect reflexes and perfect timing, and there is no room for any error. The water speed should be much slower on easy mode! Most of the \"puzzles\" are not actually intellectual puzzles but reflex tests: You have to brute force the correct timing for pressing each button, by trying the same sequence over and over again. It just isn't fun or satisfying in any way. The game also saves randomly after some sequences and cut scenes, but not all, so if you forget to save after one, time to watch it again!

No part of the game gets frustrating, even the hardest parts seldom require more than ten tries to get past. Also, the saving system is quite nice: basically, you can spend an Energy point to save before a hard passage and then immediately return to this checkpoint if you fail.\n\nThe only critique I might have is that sometimes it requies quite some precision when trying to land on a slim platform - without it, I would probably have died 20% less.\n\nAll in all, it's a superb game.

areas were insufferable and annoying, the escape sequences were too long, there's areas where you're expected to dodge stuff falling from the sky but their timing and position was RNG which made playing a section over and over so much more annoying because your view is so limited/zoomed in that you can't meaningfully react and dodge the falling shit which led to getting hit which meant basically just letting the game kill you because you need that health for a future section and there's no way to regain health besides finding health pickups or investing a dozen points into a skill and wasting your energy to save the game to regen 2 points of health (which is practically useless because every enemy in the endgame does like over 4 damage minimum. although i did finish on hard mode so maybe the other difficulties may have less damage dealt). also the janky hitboxes made climbing so much more annoying than it needed to be. \n\nanyway, it's fun! it's a fun little metroidvania, wish there was more to do, more enemies instead of reskins, and some intended paths were more clear, especially in Sorrow's Pass because i was stuck there for like 30 minutes (tbf it was my fault because i forgot an interaction you could do but still, only time i had to look up a guide), but I still got most of the stuff done (76% completion) without really trying. not gonna 100% because I can't be bothered but I had fun! if you like metroidvanias but don't want much combat deeper than spamming a button or holding it down for a big attack, this will probably be right up your alley. the platforming is really fun and i'm excited to see how the sequel builds on this.", "timestamp_created": 1682642238, "timestamp_updated": 1682642238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

Amazing gameplay, visuals, music, sound, and overall atmosphere. Great level/area design and exploration. Fast travel is well-done and revisiting areas to find missed secrets doesn't feel like a chore. Overall, it's a real joy to play.\n\nThree things you should not expect from this game:\n1. Combat. You take out plenty of naughty critters but the emphasis is on platforming more than combat. Notably, there are special platforming sequences instead of bosses in the usual sense.\n2. Puzzles. There are a few little areas that take a some planning or thought. This aspect of the game could have been taken to the next level while staying true to the overall feel of the game.\n3. Story. There's not a lot going on with the storyline.

This is a perfect game if you want to get into the metro-vanilla genre. Here are my pros and cons \n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\nMusic - The music of games is something that I do not pay attention to much in many games, but this game is special. The music score is so incredible and makes some areas feel very atmospheric.\n\nArt Style - The art style of this game has held up incredibly well considering that it is a 9-year-old game at the time of writing this. The art style of fantastic, and the world and the characters are made incredibly well. \n\nThe World - Each part of the world has its unique look and thing to it. Each part is unique and enjoyable to explore \n\nThe 100% achievement grind - This game will take you around 25 - 30 hours to get all the achievements to expect for the super hard 4. They are the following\n\n-Complete a game in under 3 hours\n-Complete a game without using any skill points\n-Complete a game without dying once\n-Complete a game in the One Life difficulty (This achievement was added in the definitive edition of the game. I would recommend just doing the One Life difficulty to complete the final two in one game)\n\nThe achievements that I mentioned force to you play at your best and are hard to complete. They probably added 30 hours to my playtime. I just completed the last two today, and I broke down crying because of how happy I was. What I like how this game has incredibly rare and incredibly hard achievements. Of course, you can install SAM and get all the achievements with a click of a button, but deep down, you will feel guilty. \n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\nCombat - The game is not combat-focused, which could be a positive to some, and negative to others. Anyway, the few pieces of combat that this game does have is pretty shallow. You just spam your attack button while stomping when you get that ability. Also, the game has no bosses, only escape sections which are very good \n\nThe amount of One-Shots - This con is what made the last two achievements so incredibly hard. There are many, many things that one shot you, no matter how much health you have. Some things do a ton of damage that one hit kills you. \n\n[h1] My Final Thoughts [/h1]\n\nThis is a simple, yet incredibly good metro-vanilla-type game that I would highly recommend you try. You will have fun playing, and be immersed in the atmosphere. However, if you do not 100% of the achievements, it might be expensive due to the amount of playtime. I would recommend waiting until this game is on sale because you can get really good deals. I got the first and second games for only 11 dollars, which is a steal.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1682297703, "timestamp_updated": 1692583336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137199366": {"recommendationid": "137199366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189163123", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 1586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1586, "last_played": 1682287994}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate platformers, but Ori is one of the best games I've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1682288327, "timestamp_updated": 1682288327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137197181": {"recommendationid": "137197181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198876318745", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 769, "last_played": 1673180700}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1682285039, "timestamp_updated": 1682285039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137196479": {"recommendationid": "137196479", "author": {"steamid": "76561199115473542", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 698, "last_played": 1682284102}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo, compratelo ;)\n", "timestamp_created": 1682284128, "timestamp_updated": 1682284128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137196408": {"recommendationid": "137196408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198977425045", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1682281567}, "language": "english", "review": "stupid dog", "timestamp_created": 1682284010, "timestamp_updated": 1682284010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547058820724487305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137192330": {"recommendationid": "137192330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408385666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1690601357}, "language": "spanish", "review": "HERMOSO", "timestamp_created": 1682278881, "timestamp_updated": 1682278881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137192323": {"recommendationid": "137192323", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968579272", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 874, "last_played": 1682365114}, "language": "english", "review": "Game Design Done Right\n\n- Beautiful artstyle\n- Awakens your inner collector.

I don't usually like platformers but the movement is so smooth that it makes this game a joy to play. The projectile redirect mechanic is one of the most fun abilities I've used in a game. All the upgrades feel natural and play into each other to make your movement increasingly complex and satisfying. I didn't think I'd really like this game but I ended up binging most of it in a day, so I think they achieved something pretty special with how this game controls.\n\nThe devs also clearly put a lot of work into the animations and responsiveness of the environment. So many things react to the physics of the world such as floating rocks temporarily sinking under your weight. It really makes the game world feel alive. Coupled with the relaxing, lovely music and art direction, the game looks gorgeous.\n\nMy one major complaint is the amount of camera shake, especially during the escape sequences. It does help add to the tension of the moment, but the amount of shake is completely overkill and makes for a frustrating experience when I can't see what's going on. And the escape sequences in general are just stressful and un-fun because death means starting from the beginning. It can get really tiring.

Ori is tasked with restoring the forest to its former glory, but must first navigate through perilous environments and defeat powerful enemies.

The backgrounds are simply gorgeous, and the character designs are both charming and unique. The game's lighting effects are also top-notch, creating an immersive atmosphere that draws players in.\n\nIn addition to its stunning visuals, the game features a beautiful and haunting soundtrack that perfectly complements the action on screen. The music ranges from sweeping orchestral pieces to more intimate piano compositions, and is one of the highlights of the game.\n\nFinally, the game's story is both touching and powerful. The themes of loss, redemption, and sacrifice are woven throughout the game, and the characters are all well-written and sympathetic.

Siempre le\u00ed buenas cr\u00edticas del juego, y llam\u00e1ndome mucho la atenci\u00f3n tanto por el estilo de juego como por su est\u00e9tica, pues decid\u00ed darle un tiento. Si bien es cierto que al principio no me pareci\u00f3 para tanto, la verdad es que en este g\u00e9nero me pasa que una vez superada una barrera mental inicial luego me suelo picar mucho y me encanta ir a completar todos los secretos y mapas. Y as\u00ed fue y as\u00ed me la he gozado.\n\nEres una especie de zarig\u00fceya albina amiga de un familiar de Totoro que tiene que salvar al bosque de un b\u00faho muy malo. La historia se presenta en peque\u00f1os recuerdos animados preciosistas mientras vas avanzando en el juego. No es que interese mucho pero est\u00e1 bien y es muy \"cute\". Salto, doble salto, triple salto, planear, agarre especial, patada culona, nadar sin respirar, ataque pikachu... las t\u00edpicas mejoras de este tipo de juegos que ir\u00e1n haci\u00e9ndonos m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil o accesible el camino para llegar al siguiente punto deseado. En este juego no hay jefes como tal (un par de combates anodinos) y las fases un poquito m\u00e1s especiales son como de escapar o plataformeo. Por mi parte est\u00e1 bien as\u00ed y es coherente con el estilo de juego.\n\nLo cierto es que a nivel jugable es muy bueno, y da gusto manejar al bichillo por los diferentes escenarios. El juego se va pasando r\u00e1pido y cuando me he querido dar cuenta de que lo estaba acabando (buscando ese ansiado 100% de completado con todos los tesoritos y mejoras y mapa) pues la verdad es que se me hizo corto. Ahora bien, el tiempo de partida me ha marcado 17 horas (as\u00ed que de corto nada) y en Steam marca 22 horas (as\u00ed que supongo que esa diferencia son 5 horas de ser un paquete).\n\nDestacar su dise\u00f1o de niveles, siempre amable y correcto como para saber que habr\u00e1 algo por ah\u00ed que nos ayude a seguir, as\u00ed como a nivel est\u00e9tico que es de lo mejorcito que he visto en el medio. La m\u00fasica tambi\u00e9n es preciosa y acompa\u00f1a fenomenal sin hacerse mon\u00f3tona (al rev\u00e9s). Una gozada para los sentidos (tacto ser\u00eda suave, gusto probablemente a sand\u00eda o fresa, y olor a jazm\u00edn).\n\nEn la Deck el juego va de maravilla. La bater\u00eda dura bastante y obviamente todo a tope de opciones gr\u00e1ficas. La \u00fanica pega, no admite formato 16:10 de pantalla, esto es toca jugar con las dos franjitas negras arriba y abajo. Me ha gustado que se puede manejar con la cruceta. Es una chorrada pero yo lo agradezco para este tipo de juegos.\n\nEn un tiempecillo obviamente caer\u00e1 su segunda parte.\n\nNota final: Muy recomendado. Si te gusta el g\u00e9nero metroidvania se convierte en obligatorio.\n\nPara m\u00ed en ese g\u00e9nero est\u00e1 por detr\u00e1s de Hollow Knight (que es la repanocha) y yo dir\u00eda que tambi\u00e9n (esto ya es muy subjetivo) un poquito por detr\u00e1s de alg\u00fan Castlevania tipo Aria of Sorrow o Bloodstained (me mola m\u00e1s ese rollo oscuro y con un poquito de roleo).", "timestamp_created": 1681032261, "timestamp_updated": 1681032261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57575756311416626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136399273": {"recommendationid": "136399273", "author": {"steamid": "76561199135427822", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1653971825}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]TIPO DE JUEGO[/h1]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Multijugador\n\ud83d\udd32 Cooperativo o versus\n\u2611\ufe0f Individual\n\n[h1]DIFICULTAD[/h1]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Aventura visual\n\ud83d\udd32 No presenta complicaciones\n\ud83d\udd32 Normal\n\u2611\ufe0f Compleja\n\ud83d\udd32 Desafiante\n\ud83d\udd32 Tedioso\n\n[i]Jugu\u00e9 el juego en dificultad Dif\u00edcil y era notable el da\u00f1o que te hac\u00edan tanto los elementos del mapa como los enemigos, por lo que deb\u00ed medir y ejecutar bien mis movimientos a la hora de avanzar, sin llegar a ser ninguna zona o enemigo molesto por esta caracter\u00edstica.[/i]\n\n[h1]GR\u00c1FICOS[/h1]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Malos\n\ud83d\udd32 Mediocre\n\u2611\ufe0f Tienen su propio estilo\n\ud83d\udd32 Buenos\n\ud83d\udd32 Hermosos\n\n[i]Tiene un estilo de 2D caricaturesco bastante agradable y bien hecho.[/i]\n\n[h1]ESTILO VISUAL E INTERFAZ[/h1]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Desagradable\n\ud83d\udd32 Mediocre\n\u2611\ufe0f Bella\n\ud83d\udd32 Pr\u00e1ctica\n\ud83d\udd32 Original \n\n[i]El juego dispone de por si de poca HUD, aun as\u00ed considero que tanto esta como el estilo del menu es agradable y combina bien con el juego en general.[/i]\n\n[h1]BANDA SONORA Y M\u00daSICA[/h1]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Mala\n\ud83d\udd32 Mediocre \n\ud83d\udd32 Buena\n\u2611\ufe0f Hermosa\n\n[i]Aunque haya pocas ocasiones en las que aparezca la m\u00fasica, las veces que pasa son maravillosas, se sienten llena de vida y combinan perfecto con la tem\u00e1tica del juego.[/i]\n\n[h1]HISTORIA[/h1]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 No tiene historia\n\ud83d\udd32 Simplona y/o gen\u00e9rica \n\ud83d\udd32 Rebuscada y confusa\n\u2611\ufe0f Mediocre\n\ud83d\udd32 Bien escrita\n\ud83d\udd32 Intrigante y atrapante\n\n[i]No muy intrigante pero cumple bien con el papel de llevarte por el mundo del juego y no aburrirte.[/i]\n\n[h1]PERSONAJES[/h1]\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Vac\u00edos \n\ud83d\udd32 Mediocres \n\ud83d\udd32 Bien logrados \n\ud83d\udd32 Muy carism\u00e1ticos \n\n[i]No existen personajes suficientes en el juego como para analizar.[/i]\n\n[h1]AMBIENTACI\u00d3N Y ATENCI\u00d3N AL DETALLE[/h1]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Pobre\n\ud83d\udd32 Normal\n\u2611\ufe0f Buena inmersi\u00f3n \n\ud83d\udd32 Perfecta\n\n[i]Las decoraciones e iluminaci\u00f3n de cada zona del mapa logra crear una clara diferencia de ambiente entre cada una de ellas, cumpliendo un buen papel para lograr que cada zona se sienta \u00fanica aparte de mezclarse bien con elementos del gameplay.[/i]\n\n[h1]REQUISITOS PARA SER DISFRUTABLE[/h1]\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Bajo\n\ud83d\udd32 Medio\n\ud83d\udd32 Alto\n\ud83d\udd32 Ultra\n\n[h1]DURACI\u00d3N[/h1]\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Corto \n\ud83d\udd32 Normal\n\ud83d\udd32 Largo \n\ud83d\udd32 Muy largo\n\ud83d\udd32 Sin fin\n\n[i]El juego me dur\u00f3 aproximadamente 6 horas y media completando la historia principal, explorando bien cada zona para obtener algunas de las recompensas de estas.[/i]\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Muy aburrido\n\ud83d\udd32 Dif\u00edcil de divertirse \n\u2611\ufe0f Pasable\n\ud83d\udd32 Divertido\n\ud83d\udd32 Muy disfrutable\n\n[i]Aunque la variedad de enemigos sea abundante, las maneras que tienes para enfrentarlos es muy reducida, las pocas mejoras que puedes desbloquear en el \u00e1rbol de habilidades solo afectan ligeramente al combate o parkour.

Its a narrative setup but displayed in a way that just frustrates the player. Im ok with cutscenes of story elements to kick off a game, but 10 minutes of half forced slow walking and half slow animation, where the transitions are not even clear...it just completely draws you out of the game and was a huge turnoff. \nWhen the game finaply does start the movement feels ok, and you learn your new abilities and the progression felt nice. The metriodvania style of backtracking with new abilities wasnt awful to start but the game got unclear fast. There were lots of frustrating bits where it doesn't feel like you're dying because you did something wrong, but for something on the games end, which is not fun. \nOverall i was so excited for this game from what id heard about it and the look of it was gorgeous. Unfortunately the product i got was a quick refund after ultimately having next to no fun while playiing it.\nDo not recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1680413448, "timestamp_updated": 1680413448, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427807480096817017", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135930067": {"recommendationid": "135930067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022698299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1682948947}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game.", "timestamp_created": 1680409127, "timestamp_updated": 1680409127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135929879": {"recommendationid": "135929879", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963426369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1680393188}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty average and over hyped.", "timestamp_created": 1680408879, "timestamp_updated": 1680408967, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427807480096817017", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135926557": {"recommendationid": "135926557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050938692", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 401, "last_played": 1680569068}, "language": "english", "review": "great for players who are new to platformers + great story + music", "timestamp_created": 1680404574, "timestamp_updated": 1680404574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135925346": {"recommendationid": "135925346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203286403", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1682676323}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything about this game is just beautiful.", "timestamp_created": 1680402953, "timestamp_updated": 1680402953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135921390": {"recommendationid": "135921390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110874709", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1715, "last_played": 1680378411}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego est\u00e1 lindo, buenos gr\u00e1ficos, mec\u00e1nicas y animaciones pero la historia es una poronga.", "timestamp_created": 1680397629, "timestamp_updated": 1680397629, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434782594442367554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135919164": {"recommendationid": "135919164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079550825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 915, "last_played": 1688521930}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has excellent music and world building.

But the fact is, it's not really fun.\n\nThe visuals are stunning, and the sound design is wonderful, but the overall experience is not rewarding. In many cases you get stuck in repeatedly attempting clearing a sequence of events, where the only way to learn the correct set of move is by dying repeatedly. You always go back to square one (the most recent save) and you get severely punished even for the slightest mistake. For example, if you miss a jump and fall onto spikes, you die with up-to four strikes (I played the normal setting). Given spikes usually cover a large surface, there is no way to avoid getting multiple strikes, which effectively makes it 1-2 strikes before dying.\n\nExperiencing this over and over makes the learning curve really steep, and non-rewarding. And when you finally get to clear a sequence, you are just met with another one of similar difficulty, This gets frustrating and dull eventually, to the point I just did not want to play anymore. I gave up in the second tree quick-action sequence (wind) since it was really long, spikes and geysers are semi random, and there is no way to save mid-way (which means, if you die you have to repeat everything from the start). \n\nDon't get me wrong, I am well familiar with action-platform-exploration games, and usually am all down with the \"git gud\" approach. It's just that even when you \"git gud\" the overall experience is not cathartic at all. It felt more like playing \"guitar hero\" than playing a platformer.\n\nIf you are into challenging, rewarding, action-platform games, I recommend \"Hallow Knight\" or \"Celeste\", which are much more rewarding (and boast much better controls).

I sadly just can't recommend the gameplay aspect.My core issue with the game is the checkpoint system, and an overreliance on Trial & Error.Ori has a manual checkpoint mechanic, where you can pop down a respawn point by spending a point of energy. In the early game, this is made frustrating due to you having a very limited amount of energy. It gets better as the game goes on once you have around 5+ to spend, but the game is also incredibly stingy with refills on both your energy and health.Checkpointing saves your state as is, meaning if you happen to scrape by with little to no health, a respawn will bring you back in that condition. This means you'll have to complete long sections of the game starved of your core ressources, or bungling all the way back to a proper savestation to refill. There are energy refills scattered in the world, but the game is incredibly stingy with these drops. I ended up basically never using the explosion attack, since that takes energy too, and why would I spend it on an attack when I might lose out on a critical save later on?The absolute worst part of the game are the escape sequences after every dungeon. These are 95% trial & error, there are parts where you'll die half a dozen times because it just isn't clear where you're supposed to go. I almost gave up on the final one because I could not figure out what it wanted me to do on the final stretch, and keep in mind, you are replaying this ENTIRE section EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. YOU. DIE. At this point, I could probably play the final escape blind.The ability unlocks are also not particularly interesting, and just make number be bigger for the most part. I never ended up finding the dash that is mentioned in the air dash upgrade, which should probably already tell you the game isn't very invested in that side of it.I might just be past tolerating games with instantkill spikes and \"Do it again\" as their core gameplay-loop, but if you enjoyed that part of early gaming, you're probably gonna like Ori too.", "timestamp_created": 1679756854, "timestamp_updated": 1679756854, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135393135": {"recommendationid": "135393135", "author": {"steamid": "76561199043880911", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2136, "last_played": 1680218168}, "language": "english", "review": "I love owl :)", "timestamp_created": 1679752295, "timestamp_updated": 1679752295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135384899": {"recommendationid": "135384899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029646290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1341, "last_played": 1679746954}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and challenging gameplay, beautiful artwork, incredible soundtrack.

I played through the game on Hard, and some of my feedback may not be as applicable on easier difficulties.\n\nPROS: The art and soundtrack are top notch. The opening sequence is fantastic and is very effective at engaging the player emotionally early on. The movement is fluid and satisfying, and the cinematic 'escape' sequences are exhilarating, at least for the first five or so attempts. Among an otherwise basic kit of skills (wall jumping, double jumps, dashes), a few of them felt innovative and refreshing, like the Bash move that allows you to catapult yourself off of enemies and redirect projectiles, which they utilize to great effect in the platforming.\n\nCONS: Ori lacks the subtlety and ambiguity of its counterparts in the Metroidvania genre. Hollow Knight is a prime example, a game where you slowly unravel the mysteries of what happened to the broken world around you, and each new discovery spurs the player onward in search of more answers. Ori places you in a similarly shattered world, but by contrast, every time you happen upon something new or interesting, your Great Value brand Navi companion tells you exactly what took place and why, sucking all mystique and wonder out of it immediately. Good Metroidvanias make you feel like an explorer, and give you the satisfaction of piecing things together as you go along. Ori and the Blind Forest makes you feel more like a tourist:\n\"Here you'll see the abandoned mountain home of a dead race. They were trying to (spoiler), but then (spoiler) happened and they all died. Here's a half baked gravity puzzle, and then it's on to the next attraction.\"\n\"This is the main antagonist. Watch this short cutscene, which will show you their entire backstory and plainly spell out their motivations. Yes, I know we're only 1/3 through the game, but we're on a tight schedule and still have at least three more biomes to herd you through.\"\n\nThe cinematic 'escape' sequences mentioned above could have been really cool moments, but quickly lose their charm. They are littered with obstacles that insta-kill you, and are almost impossible to anticipate until they've already caused you to restart. This turns what would be really cool and memorable moments into exercises of frustration that require you to brute force your way through with trial and error, hitting every snag along the way at least once.\n\nOri uses insta-kill spike pits as a crutch, and while it offsets this by allowing you to spend energy to create your own save points virtually anywhere you want, it really stifles the movement-centric mechanics of the game. Slightly mis-timing a jump or getting the wrong angle on a Bash often sends you straight back to your last save point, and because the onus of placing them intelligently is left to the player, this can sometimes erase so much progress it made me want to turn the game off. It also forces you to sit through any cutscenes or dialogue you went through since your last save (because nothing says \"fun\" like re-watching the same unskippable gameplay interruption over and over).\n\nBefore anyone dismisses these criticisms with \"git gud\", I completed the path of pain in HK. I don't say this to brag or claim I'm some god gamer, only to communicate that these complaints are at least in part due to poor game design, and not just a skill issue.\n\nIf you're still waiting on Silksong and need something to tide you over, there are certainly worse options out there. Ori isn't a bad game, and if you enjoy the genre you should check it out while its on sale. It certainly has its flaws, but none of them are game breaking.", "timestamp_created": 1679587455, "timestamp_updated": 1679587626, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.64801025390625", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135239100": {"recommendationid": "135239100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142420400", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 807, "last_played": 1679584779}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful soundtrack, stunning art.
