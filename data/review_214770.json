All the combat revolves around combo-ing enemies with your arsenal of moves that you slowly acquire, and it's really gratifying when you hit every part of your combo. \n\nPlatforming is tight, responsive, and goes just as far as it needs to. Optional areas have some real challenging screens to clear, and I really enjoyed the harder levels later in the game.\n\nOnly real gripe with this game is the \"humor\", which is 2013 pop culture references.

More than ten years since its release, it has aged rather well, IMO. \n\nFor the most part, the general gameplay is of average difficulty. This is broken up throughout the game with challenges (most are optional) that test your platforming and combat skills. If your goal is to complete them, it's not too bad, but if you want to do them with ~finesse~ (be rewarded in the game with a gold star), then they typically become much more difficult. The metroidvania aspects are well implemented in that you are rewarded with money or permanent upgrades to health or stamina for returning to areas you couldn't previously access. It's pretty obvious where you should go and when to get those rewards, so the exploration aspect isn't the biggest here. The game leans into the Mexican inspiration for the story/characters/setting and is generally bright and vibrant.\n\nIn terms of downsides, I found that sometimes combat could be annoying with a few arenas lending themselves to being stunlocked by enemies with no way to do anything but accept it and die lol. I wish there were a greater variety of enemies and waaay more boss fights (though the boss fights you do get are generally good). The map also looks like something I could create in about 20 minutes with Microsoft Paint, though this doesn't affect gameplay. \n\nThe game took me about 17 hours to complete with 56/60 achievements. I suspect if you're just going for a run through and don't care about 100%ing areas or doing all the challenges, you can complete it in ~8-10 hours. Once you finish the game, hard mode unlocks for an additional challenge.\n\nIn summary, Guacamelee is a fun metroidvania with occasionally challenging platforming and combat. The game doesn't show its age aside from a few aspects (the map, oh god the map) and is still a joy to play today. I mostly enjoyed the game's progression/the implementation of the metroidvania aspects and the bright colors/design.", "timestamp_created": 1698522538, "timestamp_updated": 1698522538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148763306": {"recommendationid": "148763306", "author": {"steamid": "76561199446869123", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1695252789}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, but if you want to use workshop items use Gold edition, not Super Turbo Championship.\nI personally would recommend the Juanny Bravo costume.", "timestamp_created": 1698110691, "timestamp_updated": 1698110710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148671128": {"recommendationid": "148671128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010914579", "num_games_owned": 3139, "num_reviews": 275, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1683393725}, "language": "english", "review": "Better get the super turbo championship edition.\nIt has more features\n\nStill good tho, but basically the same game.", "timestamp_created": 1697981060, "timestamp_updated": 1697981060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596520125865936279", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148403296": {"recommendationid": "148403296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034382627", "num_games_owned": 1077, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1697571879}, "language": "english", "review": "Far from the best metroidvania I've played, but still has a lot of personality.

The fun-to-navigate maps and extremely stylized environment design, the gorgeous art direction, the absolutely crisp combat, the fun abilities that pack a punch and also allow for precise movement, the progression system, it's all pristine. This is peak Metroidvania with exquisite combat and (decently challenging at times) platforming elements.

Despite that, I personally find Gold to be a lot better paced, more challenging, and overall well-rounded. In exchange for more content, STCE has some major pace-breakers while this version is just go-go-go from beginning to end. STCE also gives you some overpowered abilities while in this version, your skills are really put to the test. Trust me, you're going to want to replay this a lot, and there wouldn't be any point in going back to Gold if you played STCE first. It's not that STCE is worse in any way, it is almost a direct upgrade in general, but I still think it's worth playing this version first.", "timestamp_created": 1696628825, "timestamp_updated": 1696629747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147756878": {"recommendationid": "147756878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274237565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 724, "last_played": 1681062600}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd recommend if you like a very story-heavy metroidvania.

Packs a lot of mechanics under the hood and gradually releases them onto you, making you feel like a big boi figuring out traversal in pretty challenging areas. Visually unique, smooth animation and feels fun, though daunting at times where I had to pass a certain section for upwards of 10 tries. Thankfully sections like that are sparse, like 1-3 per level, if any. Game feels balanced and gratifying.

The art-style has a cartoonish angular look, which may look a bit weird at first, but it fits well and establishes the game identity, since it\u2019s immediately recognizable. It has a lot of charm and humor as well. The story is basic, with the game shining in the gameplay. To be honest, it\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019t seen before, but it\u2019s well implemented. The game is fun, and the controls feel right, both in combat and platforming sections. Combat is melee focused, where you combo normal attacks, throws and specials moves. A clever design choice is that these special moves are also used in movement and are needed to access some optional areas, and in true metroidvania style, some areas aren\u2019t accessible during your first visit. The map does a great job marking those spots, so you can easily return later when you have the necessary abilities. The soundtrack is also great. Given the setting, I was afraid it was going to be very Mexican, but to my surprise, it\u2019s way more modern and videogamey, while still being Mexican inspired. I was humming along a lot of times. It\u2019s also a great game to hunt 100% completion. Some optional challenges can be a bit harder, but there\u2019s nothing hardcore in here. More importantly, it doesn\u2019t feel like a chore. However, play the Super Turbo Championship Edition instead, which is the definitive version of the game, with more content added. Not only that, but that content is seamlessly integrated. I only played that version, and I couldn\u2019t tell what was the original and the new content. It was all great. And there\u2019re also more good stuff, like 4 player co-op and a Steam Workshop for custom costumes. I had a great time with this game, and it\u2019s an easy recommendation.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

There is virtually no exploration with the exception of the endgame areas to collect orbs that don't do anything other than unlock a different ending. While you do unlock new abilities that allow you access a handful of health upgrades from previous areas, the real puirpose of the upgrades is to increase the chvariety and challenge of the next set of platforming sequences. This game is a beat 'em up platformer, not a Metroidvania.\n\nThe platforming sections are challenging and sometimes infuriating. I also can't help but feel that a large part of the challenge is the awkwardness of the default controls and the sliding, ungainly movement of the player character. The combat is actually pretty fun in most cases, though there isn't a ton of variety in terms of enemies--perhaps a dozen different enemies or so. The game was at it's best when fighting tons of enemies at once due to the clever way that many moves can be used to crowd control enemies. The constant shields and realm switching required in later combat sections were not as successful but were still mostly fun. The handful of boss fights were generally not as good as normal combat.\n\nThe art style and atmosphere of the game is a lot of fun, and the music is great.\n\nIt's also quite short, and overall I wouldn't recommend it for most players other than fans of difficult platformers.

It even has some references to the chozo tribe statues. It has the basic, be a hero and save the princes story line. Nothing really flashy there. The graphics and story are ok. That's the basic reason why I don't want to say I don't recommend it. It is ok and not that bad.\n\n[b]Not Recommend-ish[/b]\nAs for why I don't particularly recommend it is the following. The controls. There is a delay built in when you hit enemies, assuming to let you land combo's. But dang does it get frustrating later on. At some point I dare say it is even hindering you from playing the game at times. At later levels the enemies get more difficult and they will be spamming moves which you need to dodge or counter. But the freezing makes you play it safe and not be able to execute lots of combo's. Cause if you happen to try hitting an enemy multiple times, another enemy will be spamming a dodge only move constantly.\n\nAlso they recommend you to play with a controller. I did... It doesn't work sometimes. Sometimes it felt like the buttons were not responding. And sometimes it would execute multiple button presses after each other. And the special moves it would execute were sometimes also wrong. I would press right + B button and it would perform a headbutt which is just B.\n\nThe game isn't even really that hard. But the controls made it harder than it had to be. Buy it in a sale if you must. Just look at the achievements. 17.6% of all players actually killed the last boss.. That means a lot of people did not finish the game at all.

Knocking monsters into each others, throwing them around and later in the game, air-combo them to infinity. On top of that they always integrate new monsters and features to challenge you to use your new moves. The platforming is also top notch and challenging and every area and a very unique theme and feel to it. And of top of that, there are plenty of secrets and challenges to discover.\n\nI'm really looking forward to pick up the sequel now!\n\nMy only minor issues are that I was totally lost for the quesadillas side-quest and also, I think the dimension switching gimmick is way overdone in platformers but to be fair, this was back in 2013 and it's very well used in this game.",

First and foremost is the way that despite being touted as such a strong metroidvania experience despite not really strongly embodying a lot of the core traits that form the distinct experience that come with the genre, instead often relying on surface level comparisons without quite understanding the deeper elements of what make them work so well. A similar statement could honestly be said to the game as a whole, taking so many skeletons of ideas and implementing them in an extremely barebones, surface level way that can often feel more like a series of nods to various pastiches and series rather than its own distinct entity. Despite this however, I ended up overlooking a lot of it while playing Guacamelee, because while it might falter in a number of areas, it's often really fun to play nonetheless.\n\nI feel that a lot of the fun this game has to offer can be found in its combat encounters and the way a lot of focus was given to make it feel as good as possible. The player might only have a few simplistic moves, but not only has everything mostly been designed to transition into all of the others smoothly, allowing the player to rack up huge combos, but every attack feels extraordinarily weighty, with this loud, bassy thump with each instance of contact made even more satisfying by how time even very subtly slows down during impact to add that extra something. This makes what is often a rather simple game in how the player approaches each encounter still feel decently engaging, which is fortunate because in a lot of ways, this game really feels a bit lackluster and is only saved by how it looks and feels in my eyes, even if these aspects are mostly handled amazingly.\n\nWhile the combat might feel good, I felt like the encounter design itself felt EXTREMELY economical and rigid in how it was approached, enemies usually only having one valid way of beating them or just being damage sponges without really anything in between to lead to more dynamic action. Enemies usually have one weakness and essentially require you to exploit it, but often it's done in ways that feel very forced and cheap, especially with the yellow skeletons and the way they want you to knock them up in the air. Rather than simply being far more difficult to beat on the ground, it feels more like these enemies instantly dodge after you try hitting them a couple of times and then strike back before this pattern repeats. Not only does this make them feel very formulaic, knowing that you essentially have to play things exactly as the game wants or be subjected to something really frustrating and tedious. If instead, these enemies simply were very agile and unpredictable on the ground, this would not only provide a less intrusive method of guiding the player towards an intended solution, but it would provide more player agency by making it feel less as if the game is cheating you to force your hand.\n\nWhile enemy design like this is present all over the game, it's really when the elemental shields that can only be broken by one specific attack come in that my issues with how the game handles encounters hit their worst. Integrating such an artificial way of having to deal with enemies using your arsenal significantly cheapens the experience from my perspective by not only further removing a sense of player agency, but by then utilising it in such a blatantly \"gamey\" way. I feel like simply colour coding special enemy behaviours could have had similar effects while providing a more dynamic, interesting element to the enemy design to bring it up to that next level. Aesthetically I also think this game works amazingly for the most part, with its cartoony atmosphere and its evocative setting both creating a game that looks and feels like no other that I've played, further backed up by that Mariachi style soundtrack to seal the deal. The issue mainly comes from the fact that while on one hand, the game handles its setting well, it then will fall extremely short through the sheer amount of times a hollow reference will be made or a meme is used, which took me out of the experience a few times when I saw stuff like \"me gusta guavas\" and one of the main villains going \"trolololololo\". It's honestly the game references that annoy me more however due to the way it almost feels as if the game is trying to say \"hey, we're kinda like this game\" while showing off the most simplistic, surface level comparisons like \"we have powerups and gated progression too!!!\".\n\nDrive to explore the world was also very hit or miss due to the way that exploration felt so artificially gated yet again, with colour coded blocks that usually only led to a room with a treasure chest anyway. There was very little drive to actually go back and explore, not only because of the map system shouting at the right direction for the player to go, preventing a more natural sense of exploration to be found, but also that any extra loot you'd find was either a health upgrade, stamina upgrade, or money, none of which are things that mattered for the most part due to how easy the game was for the most part, deemphasising the significance of upgrades purely made for your ease of survival. The way the story and objectives were framed was also really off, with these long stretches where it felt as if the game was building up to an encounter only to go off on a tangent and kill all feeling of suspense, which ended up leading to half the game feeling like a frustrating struggle to have literally anything happen, while the 2nd half was a nonstop, anticlimactic beatdown of all the villains while you kept getting told that the main antagonist had already gone somewhere else. It sometimes felt extremely hard to get at all invested in a narrative that was paced as poorly as this.\n\nIt's a pretty big testament to how good this game actually feels to play that I had so many issues with it on such a wide array of fronts and still ended up enjoying it quite as much as I did however, as while this is in a lot of ways, a rather barebones experience that doesn't really try doing anything that impresses or excited me all that much, it's still a pretty great time if you go through it as you would a typical 2D action platformer game. The game just, FEELS great to play in a lot of respects and is also short enough to have been worth it without really wearing out its welcome either. Despite the complaints I might have made, this is totally worth getting and is probably something that a lot of other people would enjoy a bit more than me as well, I just get that vibe from this.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1639044379, "timestamp_updated": 1639044379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105330509": {"recommendationid": "105330509", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993733439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 482, "last_played": 1638756868}, "language": "english", "review": "Last boss ruined it.", "timestamp_created": 1638756980, "timestamp_updated": 1638756980, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474734038114547729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105286045": {"recommendationid": "105286045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062837523", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 889, "last_played": 1528331960}, "language": "english", "review": "Have a style.", "timestamp_created": 1638705643, "timestamp_updated": 1638705643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105246932": {"recommendationid": "105246932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021449575", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 230, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1403310173}, "language": "english", "review": "a great game, especially in multiplayer, I just didn't finish because I was playing with my wife and she gave up playing.\n\nobs: I can't stand playing multi game anymore with the promise that I'll have someone to play with\n\num \u00f3timo jogo, em especial em multiplayer, s\u00f3 n\u00e3o terminei pois jogava com a minha esposa e a mesma desistiu de jogar.\n\nobs: n\u00e3o aguento mais pegar jogo multi com a promessa de quem vou ter algu\u00e9m com que jogar", "timestamp_created": 1638655963, "timestamp_updated": 1638655963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105187561": {"recommendationid": "105187561", "author": {"steamid": "76561199216930150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1642292047}, "language": "spanish", "review": "NUNCA ME HABIA REIDO TANTO EN UN VIDEOJUEGO .

Lo que trasciende en este apartado es el desaf\u00edo y el ingenio con que cada jugador puede explorar el mapa, a trav\u00e9s de los diversos power ups que se van consiguiendo, que, como en todo metroidvania, abren camino para nuevos secretos, nuevas zonas, y nuevos desaf\u00edos.\n\nNo menos importante son las referencias, cameos e influencias de Guacamelee. Desde referencias mec\u00e1nicas como romper un puente con un hacha para eliminar a un boss, hasta la presencia de los power ups en estatuas con un huevo en la mano, contemplan un par de referencias visuales a cl\u00e1sicos de los videojuegos como Mario y Metroid, as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n como a muchos otros (y m\u00e1s actuales) que simplemente parecen ser un capricho del creador para decir \"oye, me gustan estos juegos\", que, si se entienden, nunca est\u00e1n de m\u00e1s, y sacan una grata sonrisa.\n\nRecomiendo altamente Guacamelee por ser un juego muy divertido, a pesar de no ser extremadamente dif\u00edcil y tener un tiempo de juego bien reducido. No faltar\u00e1n las risas, la entretenci\u00f3n, la exploraci\u00f3n, los pollos, los luchadores, los frijoles y los chiles picantes en este hermoso e ingenioso t\u00edtulo.", "timestamp_created": 1638582409, "timestamp_updated": 1638582409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60000002384185791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105037086": {"recommendationid": "105037086", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049470714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 633, "last_played": 1638541423}, "language": "spanish", "review": "joder como me calienta este juego racista\n", "timestamp_created": 1638401442, "timestamp_updated": 1638401442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104808847": {"recommendationid": "104808847", "author": {"steamid": "76561199221158499", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1638274444}, "language": "english", "review": "<3", "timestamp_created": 1638261482, "timestamp_updated": 1638261482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104790388": {"recommendationid": "104790388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345091083", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1674195104}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esto para mi es una hermosura de metroidvania", "timestamp_created": 1638245502, "timestamp_updated": 1638245502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104246812": {"recommendationid": "104246812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839148460", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1638046772}, "language": "english", "review": "omg so fun sad that it kept freezing", "timestamp_created": 1637977316, "timestamp_updated": 1637977316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103552989": {"recommendationid": "103552989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075061111", "num_games_owned": 1118, "num_reviews": 211, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1637790168}, "language": "english", "review": "24.11.2021.\n\nGame #180\n\n[h1] Replaying a title I remember liking [/h1]\n\nGuacamelee is one of those games I played before in the past and was both looking forward and not looking forward to playing again. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love this game, in fact, it\u2019s one of the best metroidvania games I\u2019ve ever played in my life, but, at the same time, I\u2019ve already played it before. How interesting is it going to be to replay this game? Turns out, plenty!\n\n[h1] A mexican Metroidvania [/h1]\n\nGuacamelee is a game that sets you in the shoes of a Luchadore. You will play as Juan and your job is to rescue El Presidente\u2019s daughter from an evil Esqueleto Calaca. Yeah, as you can tell the main theme of this game is: Mexico. Every single stereotype you know about Mexico is in this game: luchadores, cock-fights, tequila, sombreros, mountain goats, ancient Aztec ruins, enchiladas and let\u2019s not forget evil esqueletos. Ummm\u2026 did I mention that I absolutely love everything about the game\u2019s theme? I can\u2019t get enough of all the cultural references no matter how silly they make them look. Oh and the music is just divine. I used to rock my daughter to sleep with the main town theme. I guess it also helps that the game plays really darn well.\n\n[h1] Don\u2019t need nothing but my fists [/h1]\n\nGuacamelee is a 2D metroidvania game. In true metroidvania fashion, you will visit many different places where you will learn power ups and get stronger and more agile.Using these power ups, you\u2019ll be able to progress through the game but also backtrack and find hidden treasures and collectables. Unlike most metroidvania games, this game is pure Melee (just like the title suggests). Juan does not need any whips or screw attacks to fight his way through hordes of esqueletos, just his fists, feet and nogging. Surprisingly, this works really well in the game. By combining all luchadore abilities for both combat and platforming, the developers created a truly unique, yet familiar, metroidvania game.\n\n[h1] Tight controls and awesome power ups [/h1]\n\nBoth movement and combat feel super fluid and responsive. It\u2019s a lot of fun in the beginning to punch your way through enemies and watch your multiplier go up. The combat is fun. A bit easy but still fun. The game tries to make you use different attack combinations so you can achieve higher scores but, you probably won\u2019t care much about it since you can win most fights with just basic punches.\nNow the power ups you get are a lot of fun. You\u2019ll get an uppercut which will act as an extra mid-air jump, until you get a proper double jump. Then you\u2019ll get a ground stomp, wall breakers and even an ability that will turn you into a chicken so you can fit through small spaces. \n\n\n[h1] Living world vs. Dead World [/h1]\nOne of the coolest features about the game is how you have both the living and the dead world. The dead world is basically a mirrored version of the living world. At first, it may seem interesting to switch between these worlds using portals but later you will learn an ability to switch worlds at will. This creates great platforming sections where platforms will only appear in one of the two worlds and you\u2019ll have to switch between them all the time. \nUnfortunately, the game also uses this feature in combat and that leads to some really frustrating moments. Often during combat, you\u2019ll get enemies that you can only hit in the living and those that you can only hit in the dead world. The problem is that it becomes really overwhelming to doge and switch between worlds all while avoiding everything. Nothing game breaking but still frustrating. I really didn\u2019t care much about this.\n\n[h1] Love Mexican culture? Love Metroidvanias? Play this game! [/h1]\nYeah, I\u2019m totally going to recommend Guacamelee. It\u2019s probably better to purchase the Super Turbo Championship edition https://store.steampowered.com/app/275390/Guacamelee_Super_Turbo_Championship_Edition/ since it adds a few more features but even this version is worth it. This is just an insanely fun metroidvania game that I highly recommend to anyone new and familiar with this genera. Now go and punch some Esqueletos!\n\nNext game: Guardians of Middle Earth\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075061111/recommended/111900?snr=1_5_9__402\n\n[h3]If you liked my review, feel free to follow my curator group.

I love the luchador theme and attack combos.\n\nUpdate: My initial review did not do this game justice.  To say I enjoy the luchador theme and attack combos is an understatement. The game is not only enjoyable to play, but  quite creative in it's artistic renditions and character depictions. If nothing else, this game serves as an interesting ode to lucha libre, mariachi and Dia del los Muertos elements of Mexican culture. The lighthearted theme and quirky (if not out-right corny) humor do not take away from the game play and- surprisingly- are not an indication of the game's difficulty. In one moment I find myself laughing at the humorous commentary and in the next, frustrated as I have failed to scale the Tule tree yet again. And for those who do find the difficulty on the easier side, the game can be played in \"hard mode once beaten...or before that if you know the cheat ;)  For those who find the difficulty too challenging, I might suggest the Super Turbo Championship Edition of the game which- besides offering some extended game play options- is designed to be a little easier. I've heard from many others that there is a lot of overlap between the two, so I wouldn't recommend  buying both unless you REALLY love the game. I do think an easy mode and a few DLCs to expand game play for all difficulty levels would have been a better option than essentially recreating the same game in the STC Edition.\n\nAnd then there are the attack combos which provide you with plenty of fun ways to demise your foes.

Your skills will definitely be put to the test.\n\n- Story -\nIf the plot isn't groundbreaking by any means, the colorful characters you'll encounter during your adventure, as well as the omnipresent humour and references, make interacting worth your time.\n\n- Sound -\nLatin music is cleverly mixed with Chiptune sounds and dynamically changes as you swap dimension. SFX work satisfyingly well in their context and help create a believable world to explore. \n\n- Replay Value -\nApproximately fifteen hours are necessary to complete the adventure and unlock every remaining achievement.

It's not a bad thing though, you get many of the joys of a metroidvania without a lot of the padding or backtracking. \n\nThis game is combat focused, and the combat is pretty good.  You don't have a ton of moves at your disposal, but what you do have is effective, and more importantly, fun.   You are given a strong dodge move, which gave the developers more freedom in making the combat difficult and exciting.  Sometimes there are a bunch of enemies with shields that need to be broken by certain special moves, and some will be in real world and some will be in the dark world and it will be too much and you will take some cheap damage.  That is my only complaint with the combat.\n\nThere are some sidequests and some arena stuff, but i think I am going to skip it and head on to the sequel.

It introduces new mechanics and concepts regularly, which expands the gameplay. From unexpected abilities that allow you to traverse the map in interesting ways, to enhancements to your enemies. I don't know if I'd go as far to call this a metroidvania. I guess it qualifies, but an important aspect of that genre is the exploration of your environment and the eventual discover of the way to go. In Guacamelee there's always a marker pointing you in the right direction when you open the map, so that sense of discovery is lost. On the other hand each area of the map is so big and takes so long to traverse that it could easily become frustrating without that.\n\nThe highlight to me is clearly the combat, specifically the bosses. Fighting the jaguar guy on hard difficulty has been one of the most fun experiences I've had lately. Similarly, the rest of the bosses required some practice, and while I found myself dying often it was an enjoyable experience to eventually overcome. Outside of the bosses the combat is still quite engaging. Enemies acquire new abilities as you progress, which will require you to perform the correct action to disable them. When you have to fight multiple types of enemies, protected by different effects it can lead to a fun chaotic battle where you find yourself constantly dodging and jumping while keeping your combo active.\n\nThe platforming was basic but fun, some sections surprised me in terms of difficulty and what's required of you. Looking back my favourite aspect of the platforming is probably the black and red thorns which require you to roll or dodge in mid air. Your character controls and feels heavy, as it takes a bit of time for him to turn back in mid air. That's why I found a certain power-up way more enjoyable than the default character. \n[spoiler]And that's the chicken[/spoiler] which controls very fast and honestly I'd love to play a whole game as him.\n\nI have mixed feelings when it comes to the visuals. When you're inside temples and areas with walls in the background it looks detailed and good. But outside of those instances the game is kind of empty and flat looking despite its colourful tone. It reminds of Super Meat Boy in the sense that it has a flash art style look to it, but unlike SMB the camera is too close to the character most of the time, which does the game a disservice when it comes to visuals.\nWhile I didn't enjoy the look of the environments that much, I'll say that the character models look quite good and I was reminded of Disney's Aladdin at times for some reason.\n\nI found myself skipping through the dialogue since I just wanted to play the game. I caught glimpses of the story and some references to Super Mario Bros among other games. I'd prefer to be able skip the entire of the dialogue with a simple click, like you do in Celeste, but it's still not too bad.\n\nI found the game to be surprisingly enjoyable and I wouldn't mind purchasing the STC edition down the road to play it again.", "timestamp_created": 1607708451, "timestamp_updated": 1607709080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82038153": {"recommendationid": "82038153", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999210465", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 173, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 409, "last_played": 1693873230}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good metroidvania type game with really good beat-em up combat", "timestamp_created": 1607655929, "timestamp_updated": 1607655929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80648728": {"recommendationid": "80648728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343847457", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1606490840}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Good game, love the art behind it, the culture the game shows about a country", "timestamp_created": 1606490315, "timestamp_updated": 1606490315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80088427": {"recommendationid": "80088427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025081533", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 753, "last_played": 1598833755}, "language": "english", "review": "Likeable to the core", "timestamp_created": 1606359263, "timestamp_updated": 1606359263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79786912": {"recommendationid": "79786912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076479022", "num_games_owned": 1085, "num_reviews": 344, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 614, "last_played": 1540282715}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice gaem", "timestamp_created": 1606281306, "timestamp_updated": 1699467579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79611486": {"recommendationid": "79611486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054724699", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1607278114}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego, buenas mec\u00e1nicas, su te gustas los juegos de acci\u00f3n y plataforma.

Its got so much culture and its own art style that it doesn't feel like a metroidvania. You can die and not really affect the overall pace of the game. Powerups and skills are close by and can be bought. Lovely touch from having to wait and grind so much.  I love the fact it has towns people with unique interesting diologue,and humor. Something thats been missing in games. It needs to be more talked about. Underrated but I greatly appreciate it. Glad its in my collection! \nTheir is nothing bad I can say about this game.  To me its literally perfect.\n\nUnfortunately it is time to go hard on this game. Now it was fun till I started seeing the controls are barely responive. when you double jump and punch in the air you can't control the direction where it is going. And you can only go one way. For some reason they decided to use the back r2 for ps4 controller to change a platformer you need. It would be fine if it had a bigger delay time, but it doesn't forcing your hand to look like you got arthritis in order to go up platformers. Stages were nice till they went the cheap route, hey lets put spikes on top of the pillars for no reason and the side to reappear and dissapear while you do the awkward controls. The point of metroidvanias is you gain a new ability now you can traverse, their is an obstacle but its avoidable. This game has cheap level design platforms to keep killing you or making you start way over. This is a cheap tactic to put in more time. \n\nThe other thing that bothers me is your a luchador, but instead of wrestling your jumping most of the time and not even going against powerful luchadors. Your going against mariachis and the drunk skull bums, and Jaguar, his gang, and creatures.  I feel that the character could have been someone else and the game would be the same. Wrestling has lots of grapling air flying attacks, and this game doesn't have it. This game is over rated. For a while you will love it but then it gets redundent fast thanks to its level design. Your action and pacing will go back alot. \nAnd although its not in all level their is alot of misdirection. The game doesn't make areas clear. And they will have such a great gap that you can't see what you're supposed to get to or even do. You'll end up saying whatever and see if their is a bottomless pit or you have to jump to the right. Or double jump up to see if their is anything there.(If you have it yet.) At times you feel like you been there but no it just all looks alike. The map is terrible as well you can barely tell which gray you are trying to transport.  And although some metroidvanias do have this it doesn't punish you for making a slight miscalculation and the inputs are very responsive. Once I finish this one I hope that the other games are better and have more dynamic. Instead of trying to overload the player controls and tasks in the game to do. i LEFT THE TOP comment because I do somewhat feel this way but with these details I just can't recommend people this metroidvania.  Play blasphemous its hard platform but doesn't patronize the player with tideous. This game needed another look and tested. Also if I have the stamina why is the game limiting on how many times. This is the mechanics I am talking about. Inform the player in some type of way about these things.\n\nLastly again the button choice with the actions are very questionable. As you will find yourself trying to role and do a special but that special goes with that direction as well so it doesn't take the input correctly. I love complex fighters, but this is a platforming metroidvania. Meaning your actions should be concise and movement simple and intuitive so you can fight and get accross and the program with the input able to read it clearly. iT never feels comfortable. Most of all Jaguar is a cheap boss.  So with these issues fighting this character with large health and across air , from above below moves, his shield. Just makes the game tideous instead of good hard. Whats the difference of good hard. Good hard is when you actually have great controls and tools that they are so tight you can't blame the games design.  When i do platforming or fighting in this game it always missreads my inputs because it has commands of the same sequence aligned with it.  This could have been avoided by good tight responsive controls or by making the fall time slower,(giving you time to put the actual intended missed by the bad input choices), give an infinite jump if you have the meter and more.\nIt a good game but its not great to recommend.

Guacamelee doesn't let you rebind controller buttons.\n\nImagine the game \"Getting over it\" where launching into the air required a specific combination of buttons on a controller. Now imagine a section of that game where you had to use the analog back shoulder buttons to swap between surfaces existing. When you press this button the surface that you just launched from disappears and the surface you are jumping to appears. So you have to press this after launching from the first surface and before hitting the second.\n\nIf you are within a wall while you press this analog shoulder button the game will auto revert back to the state before you pressed that button. Now imagine jumping from one surface where you have to press the shoulder button after jumping from one surface so that the wall in front of you disappears, Then after your jump has completely cleared the obstructing wall you press the shoulder button again before reaching the wall you need to land on. When you land on the other wall you must also be holding triangle or you will just slide off that wall, which actually requires you to hold the controller in a claw grip or stick down the button due to the other buttons you need to be pressing during this time.\n\nNow imagine a section where you have to do but when launching from the first wall you need to use a special jump that goes really fast, but has a seemingly random delay before it suddenly kicks off. Now Imagine sometimes that middle wall isn't a wall that disappears but instead is electricity that you must dodge through with perfect timing. One small hitch... your dodge button is the second analog shoulder button.\n\nThis is \"getting over it\" so any mistake in this process will see you falling to the bottom of the map to start all over.\n\nSound like fun?\n\nThere's a bit of an imperfect fix. Basically ,while the game doesn't let you rebind controller buttons, it does allow you to rebind keyboard buttons. Steam then allows you to rebind controller buttons to map them to these keyboard buttons. So given that it's possible to make the game somewhat playable.

The overworld map also lets you know when you've gotten everything from an area.\n\nThe upgrades aren't really hidden behind puzzles, so much as platforming challenges, but these challenges usually just boil down to trying to string the right sequence of movement together without messing up.\n\nAll in all, a satisfying little action adventure game", "timestamp_created": 1594258263, "timestamp_updated": 1594258263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72259889": {"recommendationid": "72259889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070910686", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 350, "last_played": 1594170351}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic Metroidvania style with a fun Dia de Los Muertos theme.

Overall, the game is simple, clean, well-crafted fun, but isn't going to blow any minds. If you're into this genre of game, I definitely think it's worth a try.\n\nFull Review:\nThe combat is fast and fun, though a little on the easy side overall. Unfortunately you have to complete the game once on Normal to unlock Hard Mode, so I haven't tried it. There are some frustrating enemies and situations where it feels like you will get hit no matter what, since you are vulnerable immediately after throwing or dodging without having any options to avoid attacks that might be overlapping you. The enemy variety is a little lean (maybe 12 enemy types overall) but some additional modifiers such as shields which require you to use a specific attack to break them are enough to keep it interesting for a game of this length.\n\nThe controls and movement are good overall, but can be a little touchy when playing with a controller, causing you to sometimes activate moves accidentally or use the wrong move.\n\nThe game is fairly linear and doesn't have a lot of freedom of exploration compared to other Metroidvanias, but it makes up for this with good level design that has lots of entertaining platforming sections interspersed with combat arenas. There's a fair bit of backtracking for optional upgrades, but thankfully getting around the world isn't too tedious and it's easy to spot areas you haven't been to yet just by looking on the map. The game also helpfully includes a completion percentage for each area. \n\nThe main game is quite short, especially if you don't go back to get everything, but there's some optional extra trials which extend the playtime a little and add some much needed challenge. Even so, getting 100% on a single playthrough won't take you more than about 10 hours, depending on how long you spend in the optional challenges.\n\nThe lightly humourous tone and aesthetics of the game are fun and very competently made, but the overuse of dated memes and references to other games makes Guacamelee feel a bit hollow in terms of presentation. I think the game would have been better overall if it tried harder to build on its own style and identity.\n\nAlthough I didn't try it, this game also has fully-featured 2-player co-op which certainly improves its value for someone looking to play the game with someone else, as it is one of the only games in this genre to offer multiplayer.", "timestamp_created": 1593958522, "timestamp_updated": 1593958522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72010783": {"recommendationid": "72010783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031863170", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 820, "last_played": 1600465853}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly addictive.

Juan the (very muscly) agave farmer has his girlfriend kidnapped by Calaca, a skeleton from the world of the dead. After being summarily dispatched by the sombrero-wearing skeleton, Juan finds himself in the world of the dead. There he gets a mask that allows him to return to the world of the living as a luchador (Mexican wrestler) and fight back against Calaca and his henchmen.\n\nThis game is steeped in Mexican tropes and terrible food-based puns. Almost everything in the game is a pun, and the whole thing is wrapped in a very irreverent air. There are silly little screens that pop up before boss fights to announce who is fighting who, the character(s) make silly poses when they get new powers, your helpful wise old man guide is a goat, and one of your important upgrade powers is the ability to turn into a chicken.\n\nYes, it is a rather silly game.\n\nOverall, the core gameplay is pretty straightforward for a Metroidvania \u2013 you have your basic set of attacks, a little trio of punches and kicks, and over the course of the game you gain six additional combat maneuvers, the ability to wall jump, double jump, the ability to turn into a chicken, and the ability to swap between the world of the living and the world of the dead. (And, if you complete an optional sidequest, the ability to fly in chicken form at the very end of the game)\n\nSometimes enemies are surrounded by a colored aura which protects them from harm, and if you want to hurt them, you have to use the proper move on them. You have to use your abilities to break some colored stones to access new areas, as well as some secrets. And of course, you use your new movement powers (including a couple of combat maneuvers) to access new areas over the course of the game.\n\nIt\u2019s all pretty standard fare, and honestly, the game isn\u2019t particularly innovative in any way mechanically. Honestly, the enemies aren\u2019t particularly remarkable either; there\u2019s not a huge number of them, and not a great variety in them, either.\n\nFortunately, the game is pretty short, so before it would become tedious, it\u2019s all over, and you\u2019ve beaten it. Just going through the game would take you five or six hours, and 100%ing it takes about nine \u2013 and the game would outstay its welcome if it was any longer than that, so that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nThe whole game is just\u2026 done competently. It\u2019s nothing particularly remarkable, but the style of the game works quite well, the game is silly enough without trying too hard to be lulzy, the game looks good visually, the overall core gameplay is solid enough, and it avoids the trap of being overly long.\n\nIf there is a flaw to this game, it is that it doesn\u2019t really wow the audience in any way \u2013 if you\u2019ve played Metroidvanias, you\u2019ve basically played this game, and there are certainly better ones than this. But on the other hand, this is well-paced and a nicely sized experience, and it is probably above average overall within the genre \u2013 it doesn\u2019t do anything remarkable, but what is there is done well.\n\nIn the end, I give it a thumbs up. It\u2019s worth playing if you like Metroidvanias, and it\u2019s small enough that it ends before you\u2019re tired of it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1592987025, "timestamp_updated": 1592987025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71127994": {"recommendationid": "71127994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054617119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 1600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1600, "last_played": 1502289877}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice and fun game.", "timestamp_created": 1592745744, "timestamp_updated": 1592745744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71080557": {"recommendationid": "71080557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064490201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1592675547}, "language": "english", "review": "Only 7% of all players finished this game... should explain everything!\n\nTerrible controls, way to many memes, it is basically made of memes...\nand some passages that are needed to be cleasred are way to heard and I am used to hard games...\nbut this is just bullshit at some point, especially when it comes to swapping between the two worlds my pc lags like shit when i do it... so it freezes my screen mid-jump...", "timestamp_created": 1592664726, "timestamp_updated": 1592675645, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435298770666122437", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71058215": {"recommendationid": "71058215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042820204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3030, "last_played": 1680507210}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a nice experience that I quite enjoyed.

No idea how long for the good one, as the game is simply trying way too hard to do too many things to be enjoyable.\n\n- The combo mechanic seems to be important and you have a nice (and challenging) training room where the game shows their potential, but most of the time screens are either unthreatening or on the opposite flooded with too many enemies too think about what you are actually doing.\n- The bosses are quite boring and their pattern is just \"dodge and hit\". Literally. They attack either by jumping or rolling, hit and repeat. The way the game increases the difficulty is by making them faster and the hit window narrower (with a special mention to the last boss where it's almost impossible to bring down the whit shield between certain patterns)\n- The endgame platforming is awful: a level like Treetops just ask you to be a tech death drummer able to achieve complete control over each of your fingers and it's just too much for me. Not only does it ask for really precise timings but also the management of your vertical and horizontal dashes, phase changes and special moves in a single screen. It's just too much for me, I don't feel as great after achieving such level as I felt when clearing a tight level in Super Meat Boy or  a Voodoo Mask in The Messenger's DLC.

For the most part, Guca has pretty decent control.  However, for one to 100% this game to get certain items with ablities  requires extreme precsion of control.  A fine example would be the Tree Stage where to get an optional item to the chest requires to you to wall jump, use your up jump ability, plus changing between dead and alive world for certain platforms to appear.\nThis works on paper but the way it was executed game code wise was not.  I find out that I may ONLY use the uppercut kick ONCE until I've landed on the ground, despite having enough stamnia to use it multipule times to able to accomplish the jump (bad mechantic execution of the ability) \nWhile I know how to solve the puzzle to get there, it is similar to \"Ibb and Obb\" (stay AWAY from that one!).  The control has to be very 99.95% upon executing to accomplish some of the jumps.  Let's face it. We're human. NOT a computer.\n\nWhile I have yet to finish the game, I find it frustrating that games like this which likely will cause carpal tunnel of using over and over movements is just punishing to the player.  It's not challenging developers!  It should NOT have to hurt my hands just to make a series of complex jumps where as with most platformers I've played, there's more than one way to complete a goal.\n\nOverall fun game, and certainly USE a controller when needed.  But if you are looking for precison jumping and platforming with TIGHT control, this ain't the game for you.\n\nWill change \"Not Recommended\" to thumbs in the middle should Steam EVER bother to add that. Because I can't give it a full thumbs up because of what this game demands in terms of control vs mechantics of control executed.\n\nIn addition to control, the hit detection is really hit or miss and usually defavorable to the player - example of this would be fighting the \"Tiger Boss\".  Several of his attacks splash damage WILL count even if you're just within a measly pixel.  While your special attacks that have splash damage will not and must be very precise in order to land.

In fact I'm not entirely sure if I've even come close. Bear in mind that as of posting this I'm just past the first major boss.\n\nGuacamelee has a lot going for it. The graphics are charming, the kitschy dated pop culture references are fairly unobtrusive (and funnier following the release of the sequel), and the combat can be really punchy and satisfying. The music is a treat, too, which perfectly complements the brisk exploration and platforming. That said, for all of these pluses, each one has an ugly side. The visuals can be rather harsh to look at, with bright, saturated colors rapidly flashing when acquiring an upgrade. Likewise, the music can be rather loud and abrasive during these moments. The pop culture references, while funny, deprive the game of its own identity. Many of the jokes and design choices are copied from the internet and other games and are merely adjusted to fit Guacamelee's art style. At my current position in the game I've encountered only one memorable joke that seemed to be original, with the rest being background visual gags that refer to dated memes. Lastly, the combat and exploration are hindered by slightly imprecise controls that seem to devour my button inputs. In addition, I think the combat could've benefited from an additional side tutorial or two to better teach the player about the mechanics, as there were several moments where I took seemingly unavoidable damage.\n\nOverall, the game is fun, but it doesn't take itself seriously enough to meet its true potential, as bizarre as the sounds for a game full of old memes. 3/5", "timestamp_created": 1580270946, "timestamp_updated": 1580270946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62431061": {"recommendationid": "62431061", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963590173", "num_games_owned": 6400, "num_reviews": 344, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 344, "last_played": 1434261375}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun local co-op game.", "timestamp_created": 1580022792, "timestamp_updated": 1580022792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518664002418518066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62416895": {"recommendationid": "62416895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109216491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1580000228}, "language": "english", "review": "BEEFY HITS!

I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down though, because I don't recommend it. The game just has too much hostile design going on. There were way too many times that one minor change would have turned a bit of platforming from frustrating and boring to fun and challenging. It relies a lot on repetition, but poorly. Where as some games, like Super Meat Boy, throw you right back into the action, the game feels the need to pad its platforming out with busy work. This means you don't even have a chance to learn what you did wrong because by the time you get back to it you've forgotten because of all the busy work. It just makes it boring. The platforming was doable with effort, but it just didn't feel worth it after a certain point. The game is, quite simply, dull.\n\nIn the interest of fairness there were things I liked. The characters are interesting, I like that there are little side quests. I even liked backtracking into previous areas to use my new skills, and it felt like an accomplishment. The visuals are very nice, very crisp. The humor can be good at times. It has a very specific style of humor. It's hard to describe, but if you've played games like this, throw backs to older genres from smaller studios with a nice art style, you know the type. It doesn't always land, but when it does it gets a chuckle.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this unless you LOVE platformers.

Where Metroid and DMC were often cold and scary, Guacamelee is friendly, funny, and full of fun characters. With how extreme the makeover is, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was entirely different, but make no mistake: This one has all the smartest design ideas from both of those, and it weaves them together extremely well.\n\nFirst, the Metroid aspects. This game is so dense and so crystal-clear about its gates. 99.9% of areas you can't reach yet, you know why, and when you get the ability to go there, you'll know. It's just a matter of A) remembering, and B) pulling off a tough maneuver sometimes. There are multiple kinds of optional powerups, and there's coins and a store where you can unlock more. Many of the optional rewards are coins, and they're worth it. All the core upgrades are useful, unique, and exciting, not to mention versatile.\n\nThe Devil May Cry aspects work great too. I'm not a fighting game master by any means. This one feels deep enough that I know I'm nowhere near the skill ceiling. You need to chain combos and improvise them as things change, as well as avoiding attacks and using specific moves to counter certain setups. All the Metroid-style powerups you unlock are new moves, and they can be woven into combos in a ton of ways. The enemy variety isn't enormous, but each fight feels unique due to map layouts, enemy combos, and hazards. There's a side challenge that asks you to master a TON of different combos.\n\nThe game is absolutely dripping with Mexican culture, to the extent that it almost feels wrong to play it in English. It's full of jokes, most of which landed for me, and references to other video games are EVERYWHERE. You can really tell the developers are in love with gaming. The character design on display here is really strong and distinctive, and the music -- dios mio! As a purely aesthetic experience, Guacamelee is excellent.\n\nIt does have a couple of flaws. Every once in a while, the game will lock up on me. I think it's when I run past a save station and into another room, but I don't know why. And there are some sections that are too punishing for my tastes, leading to frustration. Some of the fast-travel points are placed oddly. But these are minor issues.\n\nIn summation, I've had a great time with Guacamelee. It's fun, it's tough, it's charming, it's deviously clever, and it's gorgeous.

It's so strong that it almost became one of my favourite Metroid-vania games of all time. Unfortunately, the game doesn't build upon this foundation to any significant degree. In fact, it actually detracts from it and therefore ends up just being a great game rather than a fucking awesome game.\n\nThe foundation of this game is very simple. You have your 3 hit attack combo. When you hit enemies with your attacks enough time, you can \"grapple\" them. This grapple has 3 functions:\n\t\u2022 AOE attack: After you grapple an enemy, you can throw an enemy in any direction. When thrown, the enemy will knock down any other enemies in the way.\n\t\u2022 Attack reset: Right after you throw an enemy, you can repeat your 3 hit attack combo. Surprise surprise, most enemies can be grappled after 3 hits.\n\t\u2022 Invulnerability: While you're grappling an enemy, you're invulnerable to any damage. This allows you to dodge attacks and carefully aim enemies to fly in the direction you want them to.\n\nBecause of how useful the grapple is, the developers have been able to create a combo focused system witch just 2 attacks (3 hit combo and grapple). Simple and effective.\n\nAs you progress in the game, the combat slowly gets built upon using special moves. These special moves are basically heavy attacks that attack in a certain direction (up, down, left/right, stationary). These special moves ALSO reset your attacks. This is very useful for big enemies that can't be grappled. So far so good. You can use grapples to take on multiple small enemies and special moves to take on large enemies.\n\nI thought the combat would progress to link all of these attacks together so that you would be doing really long combos while fighting many enemies all at once. That would've been really cool\u2026.. But unfortunately the enemy design stops this from happening. The small enemies' health pool is too small, so they die in like 2 combos (e.g. 3x attack --> special move ---> 3x attack = dead enemy). You can't do a long ass combo on an enemy that dies so quickly. The big enemies' don't get stunned, and they attack in the time it takes you to do 2 combos. Therefore, unless you want to take damage, you're forced to dodge and restart your combo. \n\nWhile the above is limiting, the late-game enemies are the worst. This is where the foundation of the game starts deteriorating. Late-game enemies, including bosses, automatically dodge after taking a certain # of hits in the MIDDLE of your combo. This was a really bad design decision. Note that it's the # of hits, not the damage. Therefore, combat against these enemies is all about spamming your special moves since they do the most damage per hit.  You almost never want to use your regular attacks OR grapple and so combat is actually more boring in the late game compared to the early to mid-game. Keep in mind that special moves take energy, so you'll be spamming your special moves, waiting until your energy recharges, and repeat the process.\n\nTo be fair, combat definitely becomes more challenging as the game progresses. This is because of the way fights are designed. You're not really fighting enemies 1 on 1 as you move throughout the world like in most Metroid-vania games. Instead, most fights happen in square arenas (e.g. you can be exploring and then walls appear to the left and right of you. Enemies start spawning in and you can't leave until you beat all the enemies). These arenas can have various hazards and multiple enemies can spawn in an arena, forcing you to take on multiple enemies while being wary of your surroundings. Furthermore, late game enemies have \"shields\", which require a very specific special move in order to break the shield. Late game enemies also have some attacks that can't be dodged, forcing you to double-jump/wall jump over them. So while YOUR attacks get more limited (i.e. you're just spamming super moves rather and not normal attacking and grappling), the enemies' attacks and defenses get more varied and interesting. I died multiple times on certain groups of enemies and got a great feeling of achievement when I beat them.\n\nThere's only 5 bosses in the game, but they're all very distinct from each other and require mastering their unique attacks. I particularly liked this boss that's 3 skeletons combined into 1. In the second phase, each skeleton covers a portion of the screen (1 in the top, 1 in the center, and 1 at the bottom). They attack with laser beams that can't be dodged, and always attack 2 at a time. In order to dodge them, you need to use your super moves to stay in the 1 portion of the screen that the skeleton is not attacking. This was a great way to make \"spamming super moves\" an interesting affair and I wish all of the bosses and enemies made spamming super moves as interesting as this. \n\nWhile the combat gets slightly stale near the end, thankfully the platforming stays engaging throughout the game. This is some of the best platforming I've seen in any 2-D game. Your character can wall jump and double-jump. Also, the special moves are worked into the platforming since the move that makes you attack up is effectively another jump, and the move that makes you go left/right is crucial for certain platforming sections. Furthermore, your character can dimension swap between 2 dimensions. In 1 dimension there are certain obstacles/platforms while in another dimension they're different. Swapping between these dimension quickly when platforming is crucial to succeeding, and it made the platforming sections so satisfying to beat.\n\nThe progression system is well done. Beating enemies awards you currency which you can use to buy stuff at checkpoints. You can buy health ups, energy ups, costumes, etc\u2026 You can also find health ups and energy ups in chests while exploring. There are a LOT of chests to scattered throughout the world, so it's always rewarding to go off the beaten path and explore. So you're rewarded for adventuring, so that's fun.\n\nThere's a story that's fairly typical. A villain kidnaps a girl and you as the main hero have to save her. What's not so typical are the characters themselves and their dialogue. This game doesn't take itself too seriously and the characters can be genuinely hilarious sometimes. They have unique personalities and there's a lot of pop culture references. There's a scene straight from Star Wars in one scene and I laughed out loud when I saw it. \n\nOverall, this is a great game with a very strong early game. It's unfortunate that the late game was not as engaging, but what's here is still a great package.", "timestamp_created": 1575218528, "timestamp_updated": 1575218537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58034784": {"recommendationid": "58034784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326523329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1688145558}, "language": "spanish", "review": "tiene un sistema bastante divertido, como una buena banda sonora, esto es para que te lo pases genial lo que recomiendo es que lo compres completo,  uno no se arrepiente de esto", "timestamp_created": 1574818712, "timestamp_updated": 1574818712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57813951": {"recommendationid": "57813951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103490255", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 187, "playtime_forever": 2239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 921, "last_played": 1696366293}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encanto, totalmente recomendado!!!", "timestamp_created": 1574671477, "timestamp_updated": 1574671477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57813217": {"recommendationid": "57813217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111425779", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 21370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19452, "last_played": 1642290947}, "language": "english", "review": "epic", "timestamp_created": 1574669697, "timestamp_updated": 1574669697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57739221": {"recommendationid": "57739221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131473492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1574562894}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is simple yet surprinsingly hard.

It's a six year old game but as is so often the case, the old ones are the good ones.\n\nI'll keep this short; I put 42 hours into this game.  One play through on normal campaign and then again on hard mode.  I also 100%ed both runs, so yeah that takes some time.  With all that time spent, I figure I'm a credible source when I tell you this is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played.\n\nEverything about the game is slick.\n\nGraphics and animation are beautiful and buttery smooth.  Seriously, the overall art style is just awesome and playing this on the big screen is a lot like watching a very action packed cartoon.\n\nThe sound effects are great and the music is quite simply brilliant.  Kudos to the guys behind the OST; the fact that every area has two versions of its thematic music is such a good idea.  One of those subtle little things that is so well handled it takes a while for you to notice just how well implemented it is.\n\nThematically the game never misses; everything just fits into the world.  The lore is rich but lighthearted.  There is a wonderful sense of humour in all aspects of the story and the gameplay.  \n\nThe pacing is absolutely perfect, and each new skill arrives just as you have mastered the previous abilities.\n\nIt's a metroidvania based on Mexican culture, and the land of the dead plays a significant part.  It is colourful, it is fast paced, it is responsive and you feel like the baddest of all bada$$es by the time you deliver the final blows to the final boss.\n\nSeriously, I cannot believe it took me so long to get round to playing this game.  it is practically perfect in every way.  Unless you are looking for a FPS or a strategy game, in which case you will still probably enjoy this game more.\n\nThanks to DrinkBox Studios for absolutely nailing it.\n\nI will play Guacamelee! 2 once all this joy and wonder settles down.", "timestamp_created": 1573148280, "timestamp_updated": 1573148280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590738475322723389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56186976": {"recommendationid": "56186976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166180044", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1596431211}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Gran juego que muestra la cultura mexicana", "timestamp_created": 1572635821, "timestamp_updated": 1572635821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56100089": {"recommendationid": "56100089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198434376346", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1601092100}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played for hours without noticing it, the game is amazing", "timestamp_created": 1572584735, "timestamp_updated": 1572584735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55731217": {"recommendationid": "55731217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081517756", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1401639723}, "language": "english", "review": "Very boring and one dimensional. \nThe story is full of overused deformed mexican clich\u00e9s\n\nNow that I think of, this is like the Taco Bell of games.", "timestamp_created": 1571840126, "timestamp_updated": 1571840126, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433070838451385498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55433856": {"recommendationid": "55433856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016669469", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 540, "last_played": 1407698185}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game, good job to the dev team.", "timestamp_created": 1570147782, "timestamp_updated": 1570147782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55358209": {"recommendationid": "55358209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134306198", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1489977463}, "language": "english", "review": "It's been a week since I finished it and I can't remember a god damn thing.

Foremost is the controls. Many of the attacks and special abilities require you to tilt the stick and press a button, but a disconcertingly large portion of the time it registers the wrong direction. Given the relatively high difficulty of some parts of this game, this can be incredibly frustrating when your character does a side dash instead of an uppercut to gain altitude while platforming (or vice versa), causing you to fall to your death and have to repeat a sometimes lengthy section. Same thing goes for combat, to defeat some enemies you'll need to throw them, but the throws go completely the wrong direction about half the time.\n\nThe second flaw is that the overall difficulty is honestly too high to really be fun for a general audience, especially since there isn't a difficulty slider. Near the end of the game many of the fights end up like bullet hells with screens full of projectiles and shielded enemies (which you can't hurt unless you use the correct special power to break the shield first) and enemies in multiple dimensions which can hurt you regardless of what dimension they're in, but you have to be in the correct dimension to hurt them. On top of that, enemy attacks ALWAYS stagger you. Your attacks do not always stagger enemies. Not all enemy attacks can be dodged. Not Cool, especially combined with the sometimes flaky controls.\n\nHowever, this isn't the main reason I don't recommend this game. The real reason is that there's another version of it, the Guacamelee Super Turbo Edition that's the actual definitive version of this game, which I do tentatively recommend getting (even just to play through the first 90% of the game before the difficulty wall). I have no idea why the devs left this obsolete version up to confuse people, or why they didn't upgrade everyone who had older versions of the game to that improved version.

I'll say all the things I found good about the game first:\n\n- The artistic side as a whole. Both visuals and sound. The game looks spectacularly beautiful with it's simple colorful style. It looks exactly how Dia de los muertos and Lucha libre look in my head when I see them mentioned. And regarding the soundtrack, again, it sounds like I'd think Mexico sounds, with its songs based on tradicional Mariachi music. I think it does an amazing job respecting and honoring the whole culture they went to base the game around.\n- This might fall into the artistic side too, but I think it's worth a special mention how incredibly great the animations of Juan, our protagonist, are. EVERYTHING he does is 100% Lucha libre. He runs like a luchador, jumps like a luchador, kicks, punches, headbutts exactly like a luchador. I absolutely LOVE the amount of detail they added regarding that aspect of the game.\n\nWith that being said, I'll touch upon the not so great parts for me:\n\n- The story. I get that the story of the game is meant to be rather simple and straight to the point as it was on classic videogames like Super Mario Bros., but that's not exactly what I'm criticising. The story really glows in the very beginning (Until Juan becomes a luchador) and in the very end, but on that time you spend in between it doesn't feel like they give you much of a story to keep you motivated to keep playing. It feels pretty linear in a \"Go there, do that, defeat this\" kind of way. I would've loved if they added more cutscenes throughout to maybe give some background to the secondary characters you encounter through the adventure.\n- The difficulty curve. I don't know if it was just me, but to me it felt like the game was pretty easy until the last 2 boss fights. At that point it feels like it goes from 0 (Or maybe say 25) to 100 incredibly quickly. This helps to give a whole climax feeling to the very last part of the game, but it made those 2 last boss fights difficult to the not-so-fun frustrating side, and even though it was entertaining I'd prefer if the difficulty curve didn't go so steep there.\n\nAll in all, I recommend playing it. It is a gorgeously looking and sounding game, with plenty of entertainment to offer and some end-game content for the more completionists.\n\n8'25/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1550965737, "timestamp_updated": 1550965737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531484246253967285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49036021": {"recommendationid": "49036021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026984623", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1548506903}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy if you like\n- Rey Mysterio\n- kapow\n- chickens", "timestamp_created": 1550341307, "timestamp_updated": 1550341307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48898386": {"recommendationid": "48898386", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977742607", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1670759328}, "language": "english", "review": "Great, fun platformer.

After having beaten the main story and having no desire to complete any further, it seems to me like a fairly average game let down by some unfortunate design choices. Got a lot to say so buckle up.\n\nPlatforming is a disappointment, plain and simple. Everything is way too floaty, and with no ledge grab you'll be missing platforms by frustratingly small amounts quite often. The powerups you get (various dashes and slams in different directions) seem like they would help with platforming, but they affect your momentum in such an unhelpful way that they often feel really bad to use for navigation.\n\nCombat is great at first. The slowdown is fantastic, the combos, the throw mechanic, it's really really fun. But it's only when you get later on in the game and things start to get more difficult that the cracks show. For one thing, the \"shields\" they introduce - where you have to use a certain powerup direction to break it in order to damage the enemy - are a good idea on paper, but are used way too often in the late game. When the gauntlets start introducing enemies of all different shields, some requiring a dimension-swap as well, combat becomes a nightmare of trying to hit the special move, using the wrong special move, missing enemies, being hit, the shield regenerating, being hit, being hit. Oh yeah, let's talk about that.\n\nFuck me. Whenever you take damage, you are THROWN backwards and start falling, with absolutely NO air control possible. You'll fall for as long as it takes to hit the ground, and you can do absolutely nothing during this time. This is the single worst aspect of the game for me, and the appearance of projectile enemies (who have a nasty habit of showing up in some later platforming sections, where any damage taken could knock you down with no chance at angling yourself better) make things all the more worse.\n\nA minor nitpicky factor is whenever you get a powerup, or complete an upgrade, there's this splash screen that VERY quickly flashes yellow, pink and blue. Yeah, they weren't kidding about the seizure warning in the beginning. I'm not epileptic, but I could barely look at these screens, they are absolutely abysmal. As far as I know these were removed with the Super Turbo Championship Edition, but apparently that version has its own issues.\n\nI really don't like giving games thumbs-down, especially for ones as well-renowned as this, but I felt it needs to be said that this is absolutely NOT the masterpiece that people give it credit for. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of positives here too. The game is light-hearted and tongue-in-cheek, the story is decently entertaining, going back through older areas is always a joy in these types of games, and combat is fun - at least for a while.\n\nGuacamelee is a few hours of fun, and you will likely come away satisfied, but the frustrating aspects soured my personal experience just a little bit too much for me to recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1544969218, "timestamp_updated": 1545069955, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470623433589935303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47526144": {"recommendationid": "47526144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050501444", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 984, "last_played": 1544802839}, "language": "english", "review": "Nearly got to the final boss and had to quit before I had an aneurysm...

Most of us can appreciate mostly-naked men in masks fighting one another, but DrinkBox takes it a step further with [i]Guacamelee(!)[/i], a Metroidvania brawling platformer hybrid set in a fantastical world of Mexican folklore. As farmer-turned-luchador Juan, we\u2019re tasked with leaving our hometown on a quest to save the President\u2019s daughter from the evil [strike]Osmund Saddler[/strike] Carlos Calaca, a skeleton man in a big hat with ambitions to merge the world of the living with that of the dead.\n\nTo this end, we\u2019re traversing a series of large, branching levels in search of new abilities for Juan S. Kennedy\u2019s arsenal, most of which enable movement in a different direction. This is what helps [i]Guacamelee[/i] stand out from the often bland and irritating Metroidvania genre: progress comes both from unlocking new abilities and mastering the usage of them. There are genuinely good platforming elements at play here, and while the combat can be a jankfest in large fights, it\u2019s a game that, for the most part, plays really well. This (and all the funny [i]Resident Evil 4[/i] references you can make when talking about it (did you see them before? God, I love myself)) elevate [i]Guacamelee[/i] to the status of what real reviewers would call \u2018a love letter to games themselves\u2019, and what I call \u2018a really really excellent game\u2019. Chaining dashes and uppercuts in midair to reach new heights is exhilarating, and one of the later boss fights felt more like an actual \u2018fight\u2019 than any I\u2019ve previously seen.\n\nAside from this, [i]Guacamelee[/i]\u2019s crucial issue is that it can\u2019t decide whether you should be using the thumbstick or directional pad to play it. The pad allows you to accurately pull off the different attacks, but when grappling you need to aim with the stick to actually get enemies where you want them. Swapping between them wasn\u2019t a problem, but chaining attacks with the d-pad was, and the now-permanent dent in my left thumb will always be there to remind me of what a delightful game this otherwise is. Short and sweet (the game, not the thumb-dent), it has a clear goal and attains it, ramping up the challenge and variety more and more until it abruptly ends in a fashion that many TV shows could learn from - that is, before it loses its momentum. The restraint is to be respected in an indie market where the cool thing to do is promise the world and then work and work and work until you realise that your goal was unreasonable and you\u2019ve been forced to compromise on a vision that wouldn\u2019t have been that good even if realised, but even more respectable is the sheer quality of the game itself. It\u2019s sharp-witted, brilliantly paced and uniquely stylish in ways that make it stand out for all the right reasons.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/oked/recommended/275390/]My review for [i]Guacamelee!

That said, [i]Guacamelee![/i]  is something of a standard for Metroidvania game design in the Indie scene. \n\n[url= https://steamcommunity.com/groups/MetroidvaniaReview/discussions/1/1743346190291074544/] Want to hear a different opinion, or want to share your own review? Check out our Forum here.[/url]\n \n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\n[i]Epilepsy Warning - this game contains a lot of flashing screens.[/i]  \n\nIf [i]Super Metroid[/i] and [i]Symphony of the Night[/i] are the Grandfathers of the Metroidvania genre, then [i]Guacamelee![/i]  is the Abuelo of the Metroidvania indie scene. I have often seen it brought up in developer interviews with the creators of Metroidvania games, and in many ways I think its success was a catalyst for the great Metroidvania renaissance we\u2019re experiencing now. While I think some aspects of this Gold Edition are holding it back from being as timeless as the classics that came before it, I believe I can report that its accolades are well deserved. Any of the gripes I have about this game are potentially resolved in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/275390/Guacamelee_Super_Turbo_Championship_Edition/] Super Turbo Championship Edition[/url] \u2013 in fact I know that a couple of my complaints are addressed. However, Gold is the version I decided to try in preparation for the release of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/534550/Guacamelee_2/] Guacamelee! 2[/url] three days from when this review is posted, since I think it gives me the closest experience to the original game that was released and subsequently praised in 2012. \n\nThe story of [i]Guacamelee![/i] is pretty typical. Shy man likes girl, shy girl likes man, they decide to meet somewhere, and then some jerk with the powers of a devil decides to kidnap the girl and brutally murder the shy man. Of course in a world where the line between the land of the living and the land of the dead grows thin, and the tools of deus ex machina are literally on display in the town square, murder just isn\u2019t enough to keep a Luchador down. \n\nAs soon as the game gets going, it\u2019s like a fiesta from start to finish. The brawler combat is stylish and fun, rewarding combos in a fashion similar to other titles in the brawler genre. The object of each fight is to get your enemy into a stun state so that you\u2019re allowed to grapple and toss the poor sap in any direction you please. This gives you a projectile against the ever increasing hordes of the villain Calcuta\u2019s goons and deliciously delivers the fantasy of being a Luchador superhero. On the normal difficulty \u2013 which is the only difficulty available before you beat the game or use a cheat code \u2013 it\u2019s all pretty easy, only getting more challenging later as gimmicks are added \u2013 or with bosses that heavily punish being hit. Most of the time button mashing is enough, but that doesn\u2019t stop a more skilled player from really enjoying the deep combos that are possible and racking up a high score. This is made twice as fun if you bring a friend and take advantage of the local co-op feature, because when you throw a victim, your friend can catch it and continue the combo. For the combat, I\u2019d say the game is best played as a multiplayer game. \n\nThe game\u2019s other challenge though isn\u2019t as good with friends. [i]Guacamelee![/i] is a slightly rare example of a Metroidvania that also includes insane platforming challenges \u2013 rivaling games like Super Meat Boy - as a contemporary example. These are some of the most fun parts of the game, if you\u2019re a challenge seeking type of person, but it\u2019s also representative of some of the most frustrating design as well. At a certain point in the game you get a power that makes platforms appear and disappear, and unfortunately if you\u2019re playing co-op like I was, this means that in the harder sections one player simply has to sit out. The chaos of controlling the platforms is just too much for unpracticed players to do in tandem. However, some of that chaos extends to single player as well. [i]Guacamelee![/i] is a game with a lot of ambition, and I think it\u2019s mostly successful in achieving its unique combination of brawler mechanics and hardcore platforming. But it comes at a price. Some games that came later that attempt the same level of platforming goodness, like [i]Ori and the Blind Forest[/i] and [i]Hollow Knight[/i], manage to keep a relatively simple control scheme and still provide a good challenge for the player. Having fewer buttons \u2013 more versatile functions \u2013 allows the player to adapt more quickly to achieve intentionality, and thus a feeling that the game is hard, but fair. [i]Guacamelee![/i] has you using basically every button on the standard Dualshock/Xbox 360 controller. I did eventually \u201cgit gud\u201d at it, but it was a headache to wrap my mind around some of the Simon Says style challenges, and often the issue of my execution wasn\u2019t timing or not knowing what to do, but rather that I simply hit the wrong button out of the 7 relevant buttons to choose from. It\u2019s completely my fault, and I don\u2019t consider it [i]bad[/i] game design per se. It\u2019s a minor complaint, because even with the complexity learning to play correctly is rewarded with some great feats to accomplish, but it\u2019s also an obstacle players have to overcome that perhaps could have been handled with a little more finesse. \n\nThe other nitpick I have probably has more to do with the game\u2019s age and budget when it was released, but the presentation is a bit inconsistent. Some animations are absolutely fantastic, especially when it's an important scene in the story. The main town is beautifully detailed, even if a lot of those details are filled with dated memes. But, some of the monsters seem to have less care put into them, shifting to basic shapes when they attack, or feeling relatively stiff animation by comparison. And some areas unfortunately lose that ever important sense of place, breaking the immersion and feeling more \u201cgamey\u201d than if it were more detailed and polished. There is a propensity of areas that feel more like the prototype of a level \u2013 the layout of the challenges are cobbled together by rectangular tiles representing platforms rather than walls or tree branches depending on the theme of the area. I appreciate that [i]Guacamelee![/i] put the gameplay first, since the other extreme of this problem is that I can\u2019t tell the platform from the background. But one of the things that makes Super Metroid so timeless is that each area feels like it could be part of the abandoned planet Zebes. I lost that feeling often in [i]Guacamelee![/i]. \n\nBut none of these gripes hold [i]Guacamelee! Gold Edition[/i] back from being great. Far from it. I still think this game deserves the praise it\u2019s been given. The \u201cMetroidvania\u201d aspect is more guided and linear than others in the genre, but backtracking lets you unlock some of the game\u2019s best platforming feats \u2013 sort of like discovering a secret level in Meatboy. The story is simple, but it has soul. Most of all though, it\u2019s fun as heck once you get the hang of it.  \n\nThe [i]Super Turbo Championship Edition[/i] is probably your better bet for the value, but if you want to turn time back just a little further and see what the hype was all about you can\u2019t go wrong with the gold edition. If you enjoy brawlers that are all about scoring high combos, as well as difficult platforming \u2013 [i]Guacamelee![/i] combines the two with a respectable level of elegance. \n\n4 out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1534645591, "timestamp_updated": 1577218983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613976061344146729", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44218503": {"recommendationid": "44218503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067778675", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 1005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1005, "last_played": 1386599657}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Protagonista mexicano + arcade con su buen grado de dificultad + apartado artistico muy colorido = Guacamelee!", "timestamp_created": 1534551246, "timestamp_updated": 1534551246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44152105": {"recommendationid": "44152105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114052171", "num_games_owned": 600, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 155, "last_played": 1527189701}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great, Although it's not a very ambitious project, it's put together very well. \n\nThe visuals and music are good, but probably the combat mechanics and how your character progresses learning new tricks are its best aspects.

Some of them are as follows that stands out from other platformers: Done-right brawler combat system and dimension swapping for the exploration part. The kind of metroid-vania platformer game that will never get too boring to play even AFTER finishing it for the first time. I have to admit something though, I didn't play this clean-handed, and by that, 20% of my [u]first[/u] gameplay was a result for looking at the Steam Guides in terms of secret discoveries. [spoiler]The first ending I got was the good one, too, thanks to the Mask Orbs. At the time I watched the bad ending after finishing the game, I cried... knowing how the Mask was the one keeping Juan alive until he removed it to meet the deceased lover at the Dead World. Was just... man.[/spoiler]\n\nStory tells of an Agave farmer becoming a luchador after being killed by Calaca - the Ruler of the Dead World - to save El Presidente's daughter from Calaca's plan in merging the Living World and the Dead World. Story progression is clear, with humors here and there, except when plot gets obviously serious. Going back from previous area is always an option, as you'll unlock The game has 5 hours of completion (checking YouTube search bar, speedrunners were even able to finish in less than an hour in any%), without the challenges presence. Else in my personal experience, with all the golds, it'd be 17 hours. Worth. 17 hours of my life to get that one, sweet achievement. [i]Yes for some reason getting all the achievements engages me in gaming and I'm glad this is my first perfect game according to Steam XD[/i]\n\nGraphics-wise, I'm always a sucker when it comes to Flash-based art style. When I was looking at the game files due to boredom, apparently it comes with [url=https://i.imgur.com/5YyybTv.png]free main characters sprite animation samples[/url] (:O!!!). If you have Adobe Flash CS6 (maybe lower version is possible as long as it's compatible for Actionscript 3.0), you can see how the frames and the animations are done, as you'd notice they do use most of tweening tricks there and a bit of frame-by-frame technique (I assume either they did them graciously, or they had to convert the tweens into keyframes so they could remove unnecessary frames). Yeah, a bit of warning, it won't be that pleasing for hand-drawn animation seekers, as in some cases the animation post-attack back to idle/stance doesn't have proper transition, making it look slightly jumpy, but that's really about it (this comes from an animator/animation enthusiast, not an expert). I don't have major problem with hitboxes, controls are responsive, too. [i]says the one that completed the game with keyboard, it's kind of hellish without controller but no problema~![/i]\n\nSpeaking of the achievements, there are 60 of them in total, in which are divided into 4 categories; Wooden-framed (general-the most common achievement type), Bronze-framed, Silver-framed, and Gold-framed (rarest achievement type). In my assumption, there might be a very thin boundary for Wooden achievements' difficulty compared to bronze-silver-gold ones, as some are gotten from plot-wise (e.g. \"Become a Luchador\" just a few minutes after you progress XD), some others are from doing one specific thing that you can change in-game freely (e.g. \"I Feel Empty\" where you need to [spoiler]switch your costume into The Skeleton and collect health orbs, berry simple[/spoiler]), OR the more extreme one, the \"Catch The Rainbow\" achievement where you have to combine all the rainbows without touching the ground - this was the last Wooden achievement I got due to harder circumstance it had to fulfill since I got way stronger near endgame). The challenges and secrets are, well, worth the challenge. Could be annoying in some of the levels if you're a gold-seeker, but thankfully manageable the more you try. That is something I can praise in this game.\n\nMusic-wise, they're actually implementing Mexican-based folklore, with most of the names being derrived from there. I can't exactly judge how the cultural adaptation was done (I can see the sombreros and Mexican music style - or maybe Spanish too - just fine), but some music got successfully stuck in my list for a while. Living World and Dead World have their own music - but stil in similar tone, Dead World one has more daunting, shivery kind of style while Living World is full of happy tone and \"beat\" - that will change in-sync as you swap dimensions without losing the flow in that certain ongoing music. The only thing I feel bothersome at is how the final boss music is just the more beat-y version of the normal boss music. Not that I was expecting anything, but the difference was just way too subtle. Wasn't really affecting my gameplay in general, so I gave that a pass. [spoiler]another spoiler alert, when you master SFX analyzing, you can notice the bosses' grunts before executing a certain attack. This was mostly noticed in the very final boss, instead of focusing the movements, I used this SFX-recognition the most to anticipate their attacks. Legit helpful.[/spoiler]\n\nMisc.: Fair amount of game references. Check the posters, don't miss them.\n\nOverall, Guacamelee! provided one of best experiences in metroid-vania platformer genre from nearly every aspects. Definitely looking forward to Guacamelee! 2. I already got pleased by tons of chickens they will have there.

With the release of its sequel coming soon, I decided to give it a try. \n\nThe story is not its forte; you're a luchador, which is sorta a hero in Mexic, on a quest to save the damsel in distress and saving the world. Its fun and thats all that matters in this particual game. Theres also some cool and funny easter eggs that you can find throught the game. \n\nGameplay is as you'd expect melee metroidvania combat. You have a set of skills which you can aquire through the game that also unlock new places to visit. Its fun most of the times and considering the game is short, it doesnt overstay its welcome with repetitivenes. Theres also some platforming involved as expected, that offers quite a variety of fun though sadly it never expands on it. For example you have a portal mechanic which only appears in very late game and doesnt do much but could've had huge potential to expand the game a lot among other features which you'll find quite interesting. You can upgrade some skills and as you'd expect from a metroidvania game, theres lots of secrets, treasures and upgrades to be found. You can also play the game with a friend if you wish which could make the game a lot more fun.\n\nSound design is overall good but the soundtrack is especially well done. Fits well with the game. \n\nOverall Guacamelee! is good and fun game and I fully recommend it.

The way they introduced new game mechanics was brilliant. First, you would start without anything but your movement with your joystick. Then you would play as you learned all the basic stuff. After a while you would get used to those basic movements. You could see these weird colored bricks laying around and wonder what they meant. You could clearly see there is some weird holes around the map, you can't surely fit in those. What is the reason for them being there? I really didn't care about those, but thought to myself, what would happen to me, as the player, so that I could fit in those holes. The holes were small and narrow paths leading to somewhere. I knew that I could reach those places at sometime, later in the game. Those colored bricks had some meaning too. I knew it. But I could only play the game and figure out that as the game progressed.\n\nThe melee moves blended nicely with the super attack moves. The fighting was versatile. You could grab the enemies and throw them back at themselves. I think this was too powerful move, but I only learned how big of a role it was until I was closing to the end of the game. The attacks had very nice combos aswell. You could basically combo everything what you had learned in the game previously. It was nice. Everything had its balance of course. Nothing too silly. Enemies and the ways they came were tough.\n\nThe platforming, jumping and puzzles were in my opinion very good. The puzzles were in the form of jumping in the right time and changing the dimensions which you could switch. You had multiple buttons you had to press simultaneously and in a clever order. It was hard at sometimes to figure what you had to do in a certain cituations. It was nice.\n\nThe game got good and fun story telling. There were tutorials hidden besides it. Everything went smoothly. I wasn't bored at any time. The game kept me moving the whole time. I beat the game again on hard difficulty and did all the steam achievements.

Exploring this beautiful Mexican art inspired world is made easy with the game's great map system and fast travel points. Blocked areas that require specific abilities to enter are color coded and are marked on the map making them easy to go back to once you have the ability to break them.\n\nThe platforming sections are mostly challenging. You'll be combining precision jumping, special moves, roll/dodge, and switching worlds to reach distant platforms. The combat provides a good challenge as well, and as a luchador you will punch and grapple your way through different enemy types that you'll be facing in bunches. As you go deeper in the game, these enemies will have different types of shields requiring a certain type of move to break. Some will also exist in one world or the other and you must be in the correct world to attack them. \n\nIt took me around 8 hours to finish this in my first playthrough, but there's some replay value to it as you can play as other characters with different attributes.

It's up to you to save the president's daughter.\n\nThis is a decent light hearted metroidvania game that focus mainly on platforming and brawling.

Don't get annoyed if the first village bothers you. This game focus mainly on 2D plaforming and fighting. This is not a game that makes you repeat whole sections over and over again just to beat a hard part. When you die or fall of a cliff you return to a nearby spot. For constrast the game can get difficult is in some sections were you have to either figure out a puzzle or have enough skill to beat it. It's not a very frustating game if you only stick to the required parts of the game. The extra challenges on the other hand can get frustating but we'll get to that later.\n\nThis game as a lot of Nintendo references like Mario, Castlevania, Metroid and of some others games like Portal. It's a often a funny game. The characters have their own distinguishable personalities and may be memorable to you. My favorite is the fireball head cowboy. The sections of the game also have they're own distinguishable characteristics and unique challenges. The main theme is Mexican culture based and is very well mixed into everything. The artists and level designers did a good job in this game.\n\nBeing a metroidvania game there are section of the game that require you to have a power ups in order to progress. It is however very obvious when you need these powers. You never really get stuck wondering what to do next. The powers make sense and are fun to use. The game also features shops were you can buy abilities and costumes. The abilities give you something extra to make the game easier. The costumes give you traits that have both pros and cons. For example there's a costume that gives you powerful throws but weak melee. These won't make you over powered but do give you an edge in some parts of the game and are required in some challenged.\n\nTo sum up this is a fun game that isn't very hard to figure out but it does have some small issues. The biggest issue is that the controls are kind of stiff. It's not really bad but it's noticable and that can get frustrating in hard sections of the game. To add salt to the wound, altough the game is smooth, there are sometimes unexplainable micro hickups. Could just be my PC though. Who knows? Both are very small issues but prevelant during the entire game. Other than that the first village music can get annoying but it's only temporary.\n\nIf you are up to platforming and brawling challenges this game has got you covered. However be prepared because some of these can be very frustrating, especially due to the stiff controls. For completionists [spoiler]it's not hard to get everything. You can get to any part of the level any time you want[/spoiler].\n\nIf you like metroidvania games this is a game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1512602875, "timestamp_updated": 1512739683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37897454": {"recommendationid": "37897454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200188581", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1640761803}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es simple y sencillamente una maravilla..... 9.7/10", "timestamp_created": 1511886668, "timestamp_updated": 1511886668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37748291": {"recommendationid": "37748291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124424604", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1577122787}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un buen juego, representado en alto la cultura mexicana y con un arte muy propio y bonito, 100% recomendable si son amantes de los sencillo", "timestamp_created": 1511758072, "timestamp_updated": 1511758072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37735509": {"recommendationid": "37735509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085517871", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1716, "last_played": 1562016989}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game!", "timestamp_created": 1511744042, "timestamp_updated": 1511744042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37735479": {"recommendationid": "37735479", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968897659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1527213342}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best Metroidvania games with a great luchador atmosphere.

I had just finished Shadow Complex for the first time and was thirsty for another game in the same vein. Guacamelee delivered on this note and then some. It's one of my favorite platformers I have ever played, and there is just so much it does right. You play as Juan, an aspiring and then realized Luchador, who has to save the girl and save the world. It is set in Mexico during the Dia De Los Muertos festivities and does a great job setting the scene.\u00a0\n\nI played the Gold edition, before finding out that Super Turbo Championship edition is about the same thing but a little newer and polished. This is info I wish I knew beforehand, but I loved the game so much that I am sure I will make time in the future to run through the newer edition. You can play co op, although I never did personally during my playthrough. If you had someone dedicated to play I can see how it would be very helpful in some situations. There are tons of great character skins for the Gold edition (Nacho Libre, Shovel Knight, The Tick, etc.) and I did see a thread on steam about how to transfer them over to Super Turbo Championship Edition, if you are wishing you had all your great old skins for the new version.\n\nSo in my books for what it's worth, Guacamelee is one of the best at what it does all time. It's difficult (prepare to rage quit), it's got a story that draws you in, it has layers of functionality in the controller scheme, and it ties all of this together in a way that just really works and keeps you hooked until the end. I remember thinking while playing the second to last boss, \"there's no way it can get harder than that\". I was certainly wron about that, but it doesn't push you away to the point that it seems Unreachable, you get better and it runs very smoothly when you get your pacing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor more video game news & reviews be sure to follow the blog & follow on instagram & twitter @SublimeReviews or just follow my blog at http://www.sublimereviews.wordpress.com", "timestamp_created": 1511672663, "timestamp_updated": 1511672663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37459646": {"recommendationid": "37459646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354414666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 123, "last_played": 1511588910}, "language": "english", "review": "At first i thought this game was a joke but its fun to play and the max level badge looks sick...", "timestamp_created": 1511583365, "timestamp_updated": 1511583365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37406784": {"recommendationid": "37406784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005769866", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1392, "last_played": 1537149880}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best platformers I've played in years, great solo or in co-op.

Triple A devs should take note from these guys because they could learn a lot. The game may have flashy and colorful characters however the story is a bit lacking, with the cliche save the princess plot. Thankfully I was invested into the gameplay myself. \n\nThe combat system is one of the best parts of the game, punching and comboing enemies to rack up combo points felt really fun. The level designs are done in a Metroid style with backtracking and exploring of each map. You progress your character by unlocking special moves that can help you make it to new locations that you could not get to before or find chest that you could not reach earlier.\n\nThough the game is well made from a technical standpoint, there are a few issues I had with this version of the game. For starters, I wish there was a way to assign the buttons I wanted on the controller. Mashing down the roll button every nano second on my Logitech controller was not fun and having to mash the trigger to swap worlds for certain sections was a pain int he butt, however, the issue was minor and not game halting in any way.\n\nA second major issue I found with this version of the game was pretty badly designed platform sections where you have to hop from one to another while they vanish semi random locations. You have no idea where to jump due to all the troll dummy platforms cluttering the screen that pop in and out of vision. In the Turbo edition of the game, I believe this is fixed, but it confuses me how they could not simply patch this version of the game as well.\n\nCombat in hard mode is completely unbalanced at many sections, leaving you unable to land any hits on the enemy due to the sheer amount of spam all over the place. Literally impossible to do anything, you'll need luck in hopes that enemies will give you a window to breathe to at least take one or two out. Take that and then apply multi hit shielding and you have yourself a pain in the ass. Again I believe a lot of these sections were fixed in Turbo, why they didn't patch it into this game, no clue.\n\nIn conclusion I would indeed recommend this game if you are a fan of classic Metroid/Castlevania style platformers, however, I can only recommend the re-release as it fixes a lot of cumbersome issues facing the Gold Edition.

Both games were fantastic, but as expected, the Gold Edition had more to offer. Guacamelee! is a combination of a beat \u2018em up and metroidvania, and boy is it a spectacular combination. \n\n[h1]Positive:[/h1]\n- Fantastic fighting/combo mechanics.\n- Very well designed dodge mechanic.\n- Large variety of abilities that are fun to use.\n- Immaculate control scheme for fighting and platforming.\n- Very fair difficulty scaling.\n- Exploration is fun and rewarding.\n- Very well designed maps.\n- Interesting side quests and funny NPCs.\n- Nice music and visuals.\n- Great use of Mexican influences.\n- Many video game references made into luchador posters.\n- Co-op makes it a more pleasant experience. \n- Plenty of fighting challenges to keep you sharp.\n- El Infierno offers even more exciting challenges. \n- Unlock costumes that provide both buffs and debuffs at the same time (good game balancing).\n\n[h1]Negative:[/h1]\n- Not sure if they fixed the co-op dimension swapping issue in this version (if one person presses the switch button, you both switch). Can be frustrating if you don\u2019t coordinate well with your partner.\n- I wish Guacamelee! was longer.\n- When will a sequel come out?\n- You should probably get the Super Turbo Championship Edition.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nGuacamelee! is one of a kind. A truly enjoyable experience, one that I wish I could relive. I have 100%\u2019ed this game and would do it again gladly.

This game has charm, fun references to famous classics, beautiful art, interesting gameplay ideas and it belongs to one of my favorite genres (Metroidvania).  But for the life of me, I just can't recommend it.  See the gameplay time I have on record?  I can assure you, without any shadow of a doubt, that more than half of it has been spent losing and retrying.  This game starts great, but at some point it becomes brutally difficult.\n\nNow, being fair here, the basic portion of the game is easy enough.  The game only becomes harder when you try to find extras and complete challenges.  You might say I shouldn't complain then, but see... this is a Metroidvania.  Its entire premise as a genre is to make exploration fun.  And this game turns exploration into an exercise in maddening frustration.  This should be the best part of the game, and instead it's so bad in comparison to the rest that you'd swear this game started as two different ones that at some point were mashed together for whatever unexplained reason.\n\nSee, the more you advance the more abilities you unlock.  That's par for the course for the genre, and it's one of the most fun parts of these games.  The problem is that, unlike for all the other games in the genre, all your abilities are available at the same time.  That might seem like a good thing at first, except that now you're forced to remember an alarmingly large amount of special moves, because the game will force you to juggle many abilities at the same time to advance through many areas, which becomes even worse when you have to deal with Super Meat Boy -like scenery.\n\nI mean, a game like Super Meat Boy is fun because while it offers a challenge it relies on the simplicity of the controls.  Here you have to deal with the challenge while mastering an increasingly complex set of moves.  This becomes frustrating really fast and it's exacerbated by the fact that the controls are not particularly responsive.  Push Up and the game will do Left instead.  That's not a problem in the middle of walking, but it's definitely a problem when you're trying to do a special move and the game does a different one instead, which will happen half of the time.\n\nI can't help but think that most of the positive reviews come from people who don't try to explore in the game, or that never actually bothered to try and finish it.  Or people that have lots of free time so they don't care how much they lose.  Looking at the game's stats, I think it's quite telling that barely over 15% of the people have defeated the last boss.  Clearly most people are giving up way earlier.\n\nI have to be as fair as I can here.  Yes, I had a lot of fun with the game, but the frustration has severely trumped it.

This is the story about me desperately trying to love Guacamelee but in the end ragequitting and uninstalling the game altogether just before the last two bosses.\nI rate it positive because I hope you, whoever you are, are just better than me in platformers of this sort. Probably, I was just not up to the challenge or whatever.\nI have both the original and Turbo Championship but decided to start from the original to be able to appreciate the improvements of Turbo Championship. If I ever want to play this again, that is.\nI love the game's artstyle, although the colour-flashing when acquiring a new ability makes me slightly uncomfortable despite having no prior history of seizures or epilepsy. Music doesn't get too repetitive and adds to the overall character of the game. The story is simple but fun, I don't have any particular complaints about any of that stuff.\nTo the juicy parts now. Mechanics. I am fairly experienced with platformers and metroidvanias of different sorts and I'm not even that bad at them. Certainly, not a pro, but not that bad either. But the platforming elemets of Guacamelee made me ragequit more times than with any other game in my whole life. I think, it's because precision of the platforming is not high enough, Even after some time you cannot really estimate whether you'd be able to reach that platform with the double jump or you'd have to use the uppercut. Sometimes you reach a platform and sometimes you don't - even if it is one and the same spot and you perform exactly one and the same jump. I have to admit, I am spoilt by Ori and the Blind Forest that for me has what can be called ideal platforming where you just jump and you know for certain what the outcome will be. \nThe inconsistency of Guacamelee was killing me more than anything else. You can jump and reach the platform just slightly - and the game just pulls you up and you're fine. Another time you most certainly reach it but the game is like NOPE and you go all the way down the Tule Tree. Between-the-worlds mechanic is actually very cool as an idea but combine it with inconsistency and lack of precision - and it's just hell. You have to press every button in a very certain fracture of a second or start again from the bottom. By the way, the hitbox of spikes is ridiculous. I would prefer them to have been drawn bigger to see the danger for sure than to be impaled by their invisible extensions.\nFor the amount of actions that have to be performed in a tight sequence, the game is not very responsive and can ignore your button pushing fairly often. When you have to go like jump-jump again-charge-uppercut to, let's say, reach another platform, be prepared that your uppercut, although pushed correctly, can be just ignored by the game or performed too late. So you have to start again. \nThe sheer amount of my frustration was unfathomable. The first game ever I ragequitted every single time after a short session. I struggled for like 5 hours and decided that since it does not make me happy and it's not fun anymore but a tedious frustrating ordeal where you have to try certain sections over and over again because the game is like 'whatever, this time you didn't reach', I uninstalled it dispite being so close to the end. Then I went on YouTube and watched a playthrough to discover that you can reach the True Ending only if you found every piece of a certain item. Also sacrificed your mental health, your soul and 3 controllers, apparently. Nope, thanks.\nI wanted to love this game so much but I just couldn't. At the same time I don't want to rate it negative because I think the game has a lot of work put into it and for some people it certainly works the way it's supposed to. Since Steam does not have 'neutral', I'll rate it positive.\nGood luck with playing.

The game is very heavily based on Mexican culture. You play as Juan, a luchador fighter. He is trying to rescue the president\u2019s daughter who he also is in love with. Across your travels you\u2019ll unlock different fighting moves that also double as a different way to get around the levels. This also allows you to get to certain chests to increase your health and stamina meters. \n\nGameplay is fairly straightforward. Advance through the levels and locations while fighting off enemies and the occasional boss. It will take some time to get used to using all of your attacks but the more fluid you get, the quicker you can kill the enemies. You are also searching for life and stamina chests that are scattered around the levels. Getting 3 of each will grant you a boost in health of stamina. \n\nThe characters and NPC\u2019s are all well done. Even though there is no voice acting in the game, each character had their own voice in my head. They are fleshed out well enough for this type of game. The NPC\u2019s may also contain side quests. The dialog is well done and is pretty tongue in cheek. \n\nGraphics and music are unique. The art style of the game is very minimalistic and extremely colorful. They nailed the Mexican feel they were going for. \n\n[b]Using a controller is a must[/b]. You\u2019ll be fumbling around on the keyboard very quickly. \n\nControls are generally ok, but probably is one of my few gripes with the game. They seem floaty and unpredictable at times. Platforming with narrow areas to jump on really shows this. I feel they could have been tighter.\n\nTwo other gripes deal with fighting. First is the recovery time after getting hit. It\u2019s too short and can lead to some combo attacks from the enemies that feels cheap. Second, certain enemies seem to deal way too much damage. (The enemy with multiple swords comes to mind)\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+Visuals and music\n+Solid 60fps\n+Combat system\n+Mexican culture\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n+Imprecise controls\n+Recovery time from getting hit\n\nThis is a solid platformer.

Afterwards, my friend's like \"Check out this game\" and I'm like \"oh, great. Another Metroidvania game.\" So I picked it up on sale, deciding to give it a try to see whether I'd enjoy it or just quickly get a refund.\n\nIn short, I don't think I'm ever gonna ask for a refund for Guacamelee. \n\nWhen playing this game, I noticed many things that the developers did right about this game that makes it a fair and enjoyable experience to play. For example, when you get a new move to use, the tutorial goat (it makes sense in context) briefly explains the buttons and how it works, then the immediate surroundings provide a safe environment to practice the application of said move before applying it - as well as other moves you've learned prior - to traverse whatever map/dungeon/etc you're going through, as well as using the move in combat. The game does everything in its power to adequately prepare you for the upcoming trials it will throw at you while refusing to hold your hand. That, to me, is excellent game design.\n\nThe combat is based around comboing enemies, and you can even throw enemies into enemies to continue your combo; not once do I ever feel like I'm button mashing, and after seeing what sort of ludicrous combo I've done (shown in the top right) as well as the game rewarding you for such things, it just feels like I'm kicking ass all the time.\n\nAnother thing that makes Guacamelee stand out is the reference to other games (as well as memes) scattered about in the background, and even in the NPC dialogue. Inclusion of such passive easter eggs definitely add to the game's overall enjoyability. The soundtrack is dynamic (and fantastic), the map's puzzles are very clever and well-thought out, and there's many a bilingual bonus for those (like me) who have studied and/or speak Spanish, although I'd like to stress that you can completely enjoy this game without knowing any Spanish at all.\n\nIn conclusion, Guacamelee is very well designed, immersive and entertaining to play. I would like to point out that a controller is recommended (I use an Xbox 360 Afterglow USB controller and it works just fine), but keyboard controls can be remapped to whatever you desire.",

Basicly what I'm saying is this game isn't anything too special but that does not mean it's a bad game. The game has a beautiful Mexican art style that fill the screen with bright colors and is always a joy to look at. The side-scrolling beat-em up gameplay is very fun and introduces the player to many inventive and challenging puzzles along the way. As the story  unfolds you collect new abilities after beating the many crazy boss characters (the most epic being the final boss) and it feels so rewarding to advance through the level.  Now that I me addressed the good stuff about this game now for the bad stuff, Firstly I think that their could have been a little more varity in terms of enemy design because fighting the same enemies over and over can get a little redundent after a while.

Gold Edition is gorgeous. It's interesting. It's full of pop culture references. It's polished. It's rewarding. It's [b]fun[/b]. But most of all, it's [i]challenging[/i], in both good and bad ways.\n\nI'm not usually interested in [i]or any good at[/i] brawling games where hit combos are the focus and often the key to victory. I gave up on Arkham Asylum for those reasons. But Guacamelee!'s combat system is relatively easy to learn, remember, and execute (with a gamepad), even as more and more depth is added. The game made me work to, ahem, \"get good,\" and my fingers definitely imprinted some muscle memories onto my brain, but it was worth the mental and digital effort. Beating the marrow out of skeletons is fun! Dying a dozen times at the hands of the same boss can be frustrating, but figuring out the attack patterns and necessary reactions and finally [b]beating the bad guy[/b] is so... [i]satisfying[/i]. And scoring large combos, while not absolutely necessary for victory, provided me with more upgrade money and therefore incentive to play thoughtfully. I felt less like I was mashing buttons and more like I had a plan, even if I didn't always carry it out perfectly.\n\nThe game does a great job of acclamating the player to the additional combat and platforming mechanics that are introduced as the story is told. I was happy to fail in the face of [i]and then adapt to[/i] the new challenges. But by the end of the game I had hit my own personal skill ceiling. If you're more skilled than me, well, carry on, my wayward agave farmer, but I had had enough.\n\nThe combat and platforming involved in the main story is of moderate difficulty, but some of the optional platforming puzzles and combat challenges are tedious and frustrating, if not almost impossible, especially near the end of the game. While I had failed earlier platforming challenges 30+ times but kept plugging away until I succeeded, I simply gave up on many of the later challenges, particularly in the tree tops and the hallways of hell.\n\nI'm typically a completionist when it comes to achievements, secrets, unlocks, etc., in video games. Like collectable pocket monsters, I want to get them all if I can, even if it takes a large amount of time and effort. But not this time. Sure, revisiting areas to explore previously inaccessible nooks was worth my time. It was enjoyable to do what I couldn't do before. But I'm simply not skilled or patient enough to attain a 100% completion rating.\n\nGuacamelee! broke my will and spirit. It taught me my limits. But it also taught me I could be successful while playing a 2D brawling platformer. No, I'll never unlock all of the achievements. I'll never access that golden elevator. And I'll never collect all the pieces of the Luchador mask.

Beyond the obligatory health and energy boosts, there are scant few abilities to be found as you scale impossibly tall trees and chicken your way through ruins saturated with lava, but the game draws out its platforming sections to such a frankly absurd scale that what abilities it does give you never start to feel tired.  In that vein, the level design is demanding, but also quite forgiving.  Falling off platforms never puts you back more than a few seconds, and the intuitive map makes backtracking for hidden items surprisingly painless.  Combat is frantic but solid, the soundtrack full of energy.  The references to nerd culture populate the latin-styled environments like elderly people at a nude beach, but unlike Old Man Wallace, they remain happily in the background, never forcing you to appreciate them, and the game's off-beat humor holds up all the way through the end credits.\n\nBuy it full price or on sale, whatever fits your budget.

It draws on some of the key features of its heritage (accumulation of abilities which open paths and expose secrets) while departing from others (extended exploration, moody atmosphere, isolation). The story, while basic, is overbearing (compared to ancestors of the genre); there are a lot of monologues and cutscenes that probably aren't necessary\u2013\u2013they're largely used for jokes. Icons like Super Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night give broad goals (reach Evil Guy X at the end) and let you work out everything inbetween. Guacamelee! repeatedly says \"go here on the map\" with small rewards for deviating. But this is a hallmark of modern games, largely.\n\nLike other reviewers have said, this is more of a brawler-platformer. It will appeal to fans of that type of game. The platforming becomes grueling at times, especially if you're using a keyboard. Don't believe other reviews that say it's unplayable with a keyboard; you'll just have to take a break every 45 minutes when your tendons start to hurt.\n\nThis is a weak Metroidvania title but a decent brawler-platformer.

Even though, I can't say it's a bad game, I'm sure it depends on each person's skills, but the thing here is that there's no way around it. There's no difficulty switch for the platforms going up, so if you're not able to do quick and complex combinations of buttons in the perfect exact order and timing, you'll just get stuck there not able to advance the game.

However the music started to annoy me/get samey after a while though, at which point I started listening to my own music, slightly disturbing the atmosphere; however I was way into the gameplay at that point so it didn't matter.\nSomething else, that can be both good and bad depending on what type of game you like, is the difficulty level which to me seems to bounce up and down a bit, some enemies drive you to levels of madness while others feel pathetic. This may however be due to my way of playing the game.\nFinally: I bought this game in a Humble-bundle and just let it sit in my lib for about 12 months, but now I've played it a bit more and I will keep on playing it.

Entire game mechanics are in-jokes which are a small part of the fantastic sense of humor of this title. The game takes place in technically an open world, where you can go to any area at any time, assuming you've unlocked the required move to reach the location. Despite being open, you will ALWAYS know exactly where to go, and the areas area small enough as to not feeling like any time is wasted traveling. \n\nUnlike Metroid, Guacamelee features a fantastic brawling combat system which was deftly designed to grow in complexity at the perfect rate I was learning the game. Without being hindered by petty realism, you get to beat to staisfyingly beat up skeletons and throw them at their friends. Boss fights are almost always challenging but so incredibly satisfying when victorious. \n\nThe game is wrapped in a nice simple ~6 hour story where I always knew what my purpose was and what the stakes are. It's nothing very emotional but it succeded in giving the gameplay meaning. \n\nAll in all, Guacamelee was an incredibly satisfying game to complete and I'd recomend it to anyone interested in the genre of 2D platforming adventures.", "timestamp_created": 1451092079, "timestamp_updated": 1451092079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19933202": {"recommendationid": "19933202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069232559", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1449955760}, "language": "english", "review": "Got hit through the wall and died.\n\n10/10 best game IGN\n\nSrsly though buy it, its really fun.", "timestamp_created": 1451041003, "timestamp_updated": 1451041003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19919996": {"recommendationid": "19919996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081400960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 828, "last_played": 1450990227}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un excelente juego que brilla en todos los aspectos que se presentan: plataformas, lucha y ambiente mejicano. Y es que el juego es solo eso, pero lo hace tan bien, que es todo lo que vas a necesitar.\n\nEmpecemos por la parte de plataformas, al principio te presentan un simple salto y movimientos direccionales y eso es todo, pero mediante mas avanzas vas desbloquendo distintos poderes que te permiten saltar por las paredes, doble salto y hasta triple salto, adem\u00e1s de poder acelerar mediante diferentes movimientos mientras estas en el aire. Todo esto da un sentimiento de curiosidad al principio para descubrir todos los movimientos y otro sentimiento de satisfacci\u00f3n alrededor de la mitad del juego cuando ya has dominado la mayoria de los movimientos y puedes moverte con total control por el aire. Simplemente genial\n\nLo siguiente es la lucha, esta perte y las plataformas son los principales recursos del juego, cuando luchas, los movimientos son exactamente los mismos a cuando saltas y recorres el mundo (ej el movimiento \"gancho\" sirve para saltar en la mitad del aire pero tambien para mandar a un enemigo por los aires) y ademas puedes mezclarlos para unir TODOS los movimientos del juego en un combo enorme, y encima repetirlos en sucesion (para dar una idea mi combo record fue de 372 golpes) con esto ya te puedes imaginar que el juego da una gran variedad y libertad de movimientos que mejor se adapten a ti, puediendo tener dos jugadores totalmente distinos combos y estilos de pelea.\n\ny por ultimo el ambiente mejicano, esto es mas secuandario pero ayuda mucho a que no se haga repetitivo, digo ambiente mejicano y no historia porque realmente la historia no es la gran cosa: raptan a la hija del presidente y tienes que ir a rescatarla (nuca hecho antes en ningun videojuego, nunca) pero el juego no se concentra en la historia y se centra mas en la ambientacion. Los paisajes, los colores fuertes, la musica (por cierto absolutamente EXCELENTE musica) y los personajes, adem\u00e1s de algunas mec\u00e1nicas como cambiar entre el mundo de los vivos y el mundo de los muertos, todo esto genera el ambiente de que realmente estas en un pueblucho mejicano.\n\nTalvez la \u00fanica desventaja es que aunque la ambientaci\u00f3n cubre la parte de la historia, me hubiera gustado una historia mas profunda.\n\nNormalmente har\u00eda una lista pero son muy pocos aspectos. 10/10.

Some of the puzzles and labyrinths in this game had me equally infuriated and addicted. Also, the story is awesome, with a few really cool characters and plenty of humour thrown in.

It tries to be so many things: a brawler with controls like Smash Bros., a metroid-vania, an intense platformer and a collage of gaming memes. In Guacamelee's attempt be all these great things it loses its balance.\n\nFor example, I went back and forth between really enjoying myself to frustration a lot. I would be jamming out to the music, thinking that I was decent at the game and then I spend the next 15 minutes on the same bogus platforming or fighting segments. It felt like I was being cheated, after all, wasn't I good at the game just a minute ago? There are just some places where the game gets brutal and it can really catch you off guard.\n\nMost of the bosses are just repetitive and way to random, making them less of a test then a large thorn in your side. Hence the name Guaca-Melee, this game turns out to emphasize fighting a lot and has a ton of combos. Thing is, they don't work on bosses so what's the point? In a boss battle you can get maybe 5 hits on them until they teleport away, swap dimensions or throw up another shield. Similarly, combos on regular enemies get punished as you can just get more than a few hits in before someone else takes a swing at you. In fact, avoiding longer combos and just going for random stray hits after dodging an onslaught of attacks for long time is the best way to avoid damage in the later stages of the game.\n\nBefore the real challenging bits kicked in, I was ready to buckle down and 100% this game. In order to do this I would've had to deal with Guacamelee turning into Super Meat Boy (Kid you not, saw blades and everything). Some of the collectables have insane challenges behind then while other are way too simple to obtain. It's this general sense of \"Oh, you can enjoy yourself...after banging your head into the wall\u201d, which disagrees with me. Challenge is great. Throwing yourself at a wall until you win isn\u2019t a good challenge and certainly isn't rewarding, for me at least.\n\nGo ahead and buy it. It can get pretty cheap. I loved the earlier stages and I might be a lot of fun with a companion, who knows? Everything is stylized and unique from the music to the characters and to the art.

This is the most fun I've had playing a game in years. Metroid is my favorite franchise, and this takes everything I love about Metroid and adds only good things on top of it.\n\nExploration:\nThe first thing everyone thinks of when thinking Metroidvania. This game does a great job of giving places to find and come back to when you've gotten new abilities. But it does what the best of Metroid did by not just giving you a key to open the path, but a challenge to be overcome by utilizing the abilities you've earned. If you want to see what I'm talking about go to youtube for \"Guacamelee Tree Tops.\"\n\nCombat:\nWhat really surprised me is how deep the combat system is. With only a handful of enemy types the game presents new and dynamic challenges by combining and recombining the enemy types, giving some of them shields which need to be taken down with specific moves, and putting some in a different plane where they can damage you but you can't damage them until you shift to their plane. The challenges in El Infierno really highlight just how deep the combat system is and are a fantastic challenge. A special mention must go out to the fantasic boss fights.

Boss-battles, mini-bosses, loads of different enemies, platforming, jump-puzzles with various difficulties, and a great storyline. A Masterpeice! If you like a challanging platformer/combat-sidescroller; this is it for you. \n\nOriginally got this game through a HumbleBundle and wasen't expecting much from it. Boy was I in for a surprise!\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons:[/h1]\n[b]++ Pros:[/b]\n+ Local coop\n+ Responsive controls\n+ Full controller support\n+ Combat with a lot of variations\n+ Customizations\n+ Fun and fine story\n+ Side-material (and loads of it)\n+ Immersive world\n+ Artstyle\n\n[b]- - Cons:[/b]\n- Fairly short actual story\n- Coop restricted to local\n\n[h1]Details:[/h1]\nThe games features a coop mode, but this is however only on a local pc. The coop mode is essentialy adding another character to the game with next to none extra interactions. This is however a neat feature for the game, and is very fun. doubles the people, double the fun, right!? right indeed.\n\nThe combat and movement system is extremely good, you control every action, and your charactor is a super responsive slave to your controller of choice. It features full controller support, which I personally find great for this kind of game. Great use of combo variation and at some points it is even a necesity to win a duel or complete a challange.\n\nWether you jump your way thorugh spikes, traps and platforms, or (Guaca)melee your way through hazzards of enemies, It's allways a very good mixtures of the two main gameplay mechanics. The game has a lot of mechnics, which are all very well explained, and it forces you to utilizes almost everyone of them. You can't just stomp thorugh the game using one move, or one combat technique. Variation is key to defeat certain enemies.\n\nOne word *Sidematerial*!!! Side-quests (so to speak), challange modes, collectiables, unlockables. Guacamelee has pretty much all of it. It also featues a some custimization to suit your playstyle as well. Some of the challanges may be difficult and frustratin! I must admit I at one point spent 1\u00bd hours completing a single jump-puzzle... I suck... damn my stubborness. And yet other parts may be a peice of cake.\n\nThe overall game is an eye-pleaser. The artline is amazing, especially considering it being a \"just\" a 2D sidescroller. You can really feel the mood of the game, being pumped up with references to other games, memes and various sidestories. It's all in the detail of the tiny thing. And there is a lot of tiny things in this game. Makes for an overall better experience. It is very rewarding to go around exploring the world of guacamelee, trust me on this one!\n\nThe story is pretty straight-forward, humorous, filled with some unique characters. This is however not the bearing factor, as it falls a bit short compared to the standard of the other parts of the game. Only problem is that you can rush through the main storyline in a matter of a few hours, which leaves you storywise a bit dissatisfied. The loads of extra content largely outweights this problem though.\n\n[h1]Final verdict:[/h1]\nOne of the best sidescrolles i've ever played. Rewarding to play.\n\"Me Gusta\".

En resumen: un machaca-botones muy divertido y lleno de retos a superar con el que acabaras con los dedos destrozados y una sonrisa de oreja a oreja.", "timestamp_created": 1445453476, "timestamp_updated": 1445453644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18565664": {"recommendationid": "18565664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079942106", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1089, "last_played": 1667091156}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool! too many button combination to press hahaha makes me wanna pull my hair just by jumping around ahaha very chalenging!\nneeds alot of hand and Eye coordination and extreme finger reflexes lol!", "timestamp_created": 1445253587, "timestamp_updated": 1445253587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18498797": {"recommendationid": "18498797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012934956", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1405471753}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good Metroidvania Brawler Platform Game that's also pretty challenging.\n\nPROS\n-Open World to Explore\n-2 Playable Characters\n-Local Co-Op\n-Challenging Platform Puzzles\n-Fun Brawling Combat\n-Great Soundtrack\n\nCONS\n-Backtracking\n-Some High Difficulty Segments \n-No Online Co-Op\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe game plays like a usual platform game with brawling style combat that works very well.

Originally pinned as a Sony exclusive on the PS3 and Vita, it was however later ported to PC before eventually getting the \"Gold Edition\" releasing on all of the platform in mid 2014. Guacamelee is heavily based on Mexican culture and lore. \n\nYou play the role of Juan, a powerful luchador fighter. You will be fighting various different enemies in this platforming metroidvania style game. You start off with a very basic arsenal of attacks which you can pull off such as a basic three attack combo, but eventually you can work you way up to combos which can consist of eight plus button presses! (I never managed to pull off one of these more than once). Juan will also learn a various number of \"out of combat\" skills, such as wall jumping and the ability to turn into a chicken. The platforming element of Guacamelee was probably the most annoying for me, mainly because I am just terrible at the genre, but I found the jumping puzzles to be just tedious and grew very thin on my patience at times.  The fighting side of the game is done very well; the combo system and special moves you can pull off are all really well done - some fights you will end up getting swamped by enemies, but it won't matter since you can throw together a number of punches which will just knock them out with ease. \n\nGraphically, there isn't too much to shout about, it's a 2d side scroller so generally nothing spectacular is going to be seen, however the art style on show is gorgeous. This really portrays the Mexican style of game extremely well, and is probably the game's best feature. It looks very similar to the recent release of \"The Book of Life\" from 2014. Whilst it has a cartoon look to it, there is still an element of maturity and darkness in some of the scenes. \n\nThe plot in Guacamelee! was nice. It is your typical adventure style story, the humble farmer who is in love with the El Presidente's daughter, the daughter then gets kidnapped, and it is your task to rescue her so you can live happily ever after.  The plot is very well thought out, offers a couple of cliffhangers and interesting twists and turn a long the way. Guacamelee also has a couple of comical moments in too to lighten the mood. \n\nGuacamelee is another game which doesn't have voice acting in; I would really of liked to have seen (or heard) it included, because there is quite a bit of text to read through and I would of thought that having voice acting would make people get more immersed into this wonderful world on show. Having said that, the sound track is amazing. It is playing pretty much constantly throughout the game, and it never wears thin. \n\nAs I said above, the I found the platforming side of the game to be the most annoying, mainly because it is super difficult to progress in the game due to a number of jumping puzzles which had me close to rage quiting a number of times. Eventually you will get past them, it just takes perseverance and a lot of patience (something I am slowly finding out that I don't have very much of).  Most of the fight scenes are easily mastered and you probably won't find your self dying an awful lot in this game. The opportunity to raise the difficulty level may change this though, which is something more confident veteran combo fighters will want to check out. \n\nThe world in which Guacamelee is set in, is very well fleshed out. There are plenty of NPCs to interact with, loads of side quests to find and complete, most of which are of no relevance to the main story, and is just an extra way to generate funds. Touching again on the topic of special abilities, you will also find your self backtracking to a degree in the game so you can use the new abilities you have just unlocked to reach places which you couldn't before, to unlock chests, health bonuses etc. You will also find a number of shops scattered around the world where you can purchase health and stamina upgrades along with a number of other power ups. \n\nA full playthrough of Guacamelee took me almost eleven hours to complete; this was with the inclusion of the majority of the side quests too. I would say that eleven hours is just the right amount for me. The game also has a local co-op mode which you will find adds a whole new element to the game as well and is certainly worth a second playthrough on this mode, easily touching this game up to the twenty hour mark - and then of course there are the higher difficulty modes you can play on should you desire so. There is plenty of content on offer in Guacamelee to sink your teeth into.\n\nNo technical issues here; played on 4k resolution, at a steady 60 FPS as should be expected from a 2d side scroller. You will need a controller to play this game to any degree of competency though, simple because the jumping puzzles and combos would just be ridiculously hard to counter on a keyboard. The options menu also includes a wide variety of options when it comes to selecting resolutions and frame rates too, which is always nice to see. \n\nIn conclusion, Guacamelee! is a really rounded out game, which is certainly one of the best indie titles to come out in recent years.

The music is great. The story is great.

I think its too complicate rather than challenging and fun.\n\nI also think some achievements are too hard to be done under the game design. For example, Heroine-ism: require Juanita (standard female character) to win final boss fight. This is almost impossible since she can not throw object too far (main attack), and object that she can throw just appear randomly everywhere on the screen, not optimise to appear near the boss. (I know it meant to be hard, but why too hard?) After all, the most importance point is, this achievement state that we need to use a female character to win the game, there are plenty of female characters, but why limited it to be completed with only this standard-lowest-tier female character!?\n\nMy conclusion is:\n- For perfectionism who want to complete all achievements, just skip this game, it will made you screaming in F*** word A LOT.\n- For non-expert platform gamer, just skip, its too hard to completed.", "timestamp_created": 1441907372, "timestamp_updated": 1441907969, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454357832670211792", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17961571": {"recommendationid": "17961571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000243226", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 253, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 459, "last_played": 1547324556}, "language": "english", "review": "Great 2D Metroidvania!\n\nViva Guacamelee!", "timestamp_created": 1441833076, "timestamp_updated": 1441833076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17852584": {"recommendationid": "17852584", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961177316", "num_games_owned": 1920, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1017, "last_played": 1441225173}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely nice game with beautiful drawings, music, game play and it is FUN!

Guacamelee! is borderline godly, and perhaps the best platformer I have ever played. The game is, as described by the store page, a Metroidvania style beat 'em up. And don't be surprised when you find that there are more things in this game related to Metroid and Castlevania than just the gameplay: the game is OVERFLOWING with references to classic games, indie games and even D_A_N_K_M_E_M_E_S for those of you who like to pay reddit or 4chan or Imgur or 9gag or whatever a visit. To be honest, I don't know what websites aren't dealing with some kind of meme infection these days, not that I'm complaining. Anyways, these references are really just a huge load of fan service, and hopefully you will find them just as enjoyable as I did. But the best thing about this game is of course not the references, but the gameplay. The platforming is tighter than jeans in a vacuum, and all the punches and kicks always hit spot-on. You can also perform special attacks that also help you progress in the game, not to mention throw your enemies when they've accumulated a certain level of damage. This is really useful as you can throw the enemies at each other to knock them over, and it's just damn fun to do. The visuals are cartoon-like and really sweet to look at. The music is actually very good and always fits the mood perfectly, and even changes into something darker, more ambient and even dubstep-influenced at times when you switch from the World of the Living to the World of the Dead. You can do that btw. Unfortunately though, it's not very memorable. The story, I guess I should have brought it up earlier: you are a man by the name of Juan, who becomes a luchador so that he can save the world from a dead man named Carlos Calaca who have overthrown el diablo himself and now plans to take over both the World of the Living and the World of the Dead by sacrificing el presidente's daughter. Bad stuff, and nobody wants it to happen, so thank goodness for Juan! The characters and dialogue are sometimes funny, other times more forgettable, but very sufficient all in all. This isn't one of those games where the story is the main aspect. The ending, which I'm not going to spoil, was, however, surprisingly sad and emotional. All in all, Guacamelee! is a great experience that everybody that likes Metroidvania-style games and platformers in general owe themselves to play. One might say that the game is a little short, but if you try to find secrets and collect all the treasure, like I kind of attempted, you will definitely get your money's worth. You will also find a lot of challenge if you decide to hunt some orbs or complete the challenges in El Infierno, which, of course, is included in this edition ;) I've also heard that playing co-op is fun, not that I ever got to try it... Bottomline, this game is a masterpiece, get a firm grip on el controlador and get ready to Guacamelee!\n10/10\nEdit: Nominee for the \"Divine Mexican Bliss\" Award.", "timestamp_created": 1439241499, "timestamp_updated": 1480115815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17465809": {"recommendationid": "17465809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076435803", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1388885922}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Te gustan los metroidvania? compralo.

Why, acquire a magic lucha mask and go on a non-linear platforming adventure, get powerups from \"choozo\" statues, power-slam bad guys, find secrets and navigate rather tricky jumping puzzles, of course. Guacamelee oozes style from beginning to end, with a colorful palette, excellent music and a well-used light/dark world mechanic, requiring the player to frequently switch Juan between the living world and the Mexican land of the dead via portals, often in  mid-jump.  But the game is inconsistent in difficulty. The combat is generally managable and the boss fights are quite simply awesome, but some of the jumping puzzles are incredibly frustrating. In addition, to reach the game's golden ending, it is neccessary to obtain a number of secret items, some of which are located at the end of some fiendishly difficult challenge rooms, many of which, like the trick jump room with its accursed disappearing platforms, I was unable to complete, and this left a bad taste in my mouth. The final boss is also quite difficult, requiring you to demonstrate a mastery over all the abilities you have learned over the course of the game, but when I had finished, I was very satisfied dispite not getting the best ending.

There is a light world/ dark world mechanic and depending which world you are in some of the platforms will not be solid. What the game does is alternate between light world and dark world platforms, meaning taht you have to jump, then switch worlds in time in order to land on the next platform. If you fail it usually brings you back to the beggining. So the game pushes you out of your comfort zone in order to advance and starts you back at the beginning if you fail. However this game never rushes you and encourages you to take your time to master each area. \nAlso this game is by no means short. There are plenty of secrets and the game encourages back tracking as you unlock special abilities that let you access previously innaccessible areas.

It has a very simple and to-the-point combo list. It rarely reuses puzzles and situations. Most puzzles and bosses and challenging but not too much. And most importantly, it doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nBut, in a way, it also does take itself seriously. Its challenges are designed to be just manageable, to push you to the limits of your skill. That would have been great if you actually had that level of control. But you don't. The controls are sticky. So, for example, your \"D\" command becomes \"arrow+D\", because you were using arrows moments ago, and that changes everything. The developers recommend using a gamepad, but there's no real reason why the keyboard shouldn't work. They simply decided to neglect it.\n\nAt the same time, combat is based on dissing and receiving stuns. It is entirely possible that the enemies will chain-stun you until you die, and there's nothing you can do to recover.\n\nI ragequit this game many times. When it works, it's awesome. But very often it doesn't work, and it often feels like losing wasn't your fault. And that is the biggest fault in a game. A player should never feel like he's being punished for things beyond his control.\n\nI know that, technically, it's my fault for not executing the jumps perfectly. However, between the inconsistent difficulty and the imperfect controls, I don't see why I should keep replaying the same section to perfect my jumps to such a degree.

However, it adds nice puzzle elements and blends everything with such finesse and precision that elevates this game way beyond the \"old school tribute\" that many Indy games seem to be around these days, as it's safe to say, the boys from Drinkbox Studios went the extra mile and dwelled way pass their confort zone.\n\nThe graphics are amazing, the art has that Comic book feel to it and the colors are warm and well put together. Every character has their own feel and, despite their all sharing that Mexican Luchadore vybe with the masks, skulls and marching mariachis, they have their own sense of indivuality so the game wont bore you with that. Soundtrack is nice as well and the sound effects are really retro, part what I like most about this. \n\nApart from the challenging puzzles, the part that I liked most was certainly the bosses, specially the Leopard fight, it was one of the hardest and most fun I've ever faced. \n\nOverall, great game with a nice amount of replay-value.", "timestamp_created": 1434309406, "timestamp_updated": 1434309406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.813506722450256348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16392966": {"recommendationid": "16392966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040218272", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1406912216}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Metroid and want some great combat and old game references, GET IT ORHMEHGEWD ITS SEW GOOD! \nIf you want more than what's here go straight for the Super Turbo Championship Edition because I dont think there's yet a way to buy the extra content on its own\n", "timestamp_created": 1434300217, "timestamp_updated": 1434300217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16369936": {"recommendationid": "16369936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025262957", "num_games_owned": 807, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1256, "last_played": 1630120739}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good metroid-like game", "timestamp_created": 1434232913, "timestamp_updated": 1434232913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16349345": {"recommendationid": "16349345", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972731852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 728, "last_played": 1434177180}, "language": "english", "review": "Fought alongside giant chickens as a Luchador.\n\n9/10 would combo again.", "timestamp_created": 1434179668, "timestamp_updated": 1434179668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16321944": {"recommendationid": "16321944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172605958", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1434088249}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun combat, that\u2019s about it.

En este caso, M\u00e9xico un enorme espect\u00e1culo que ha sobrepasado las fronteras del mismo pa\u00eds, emigrando hacia otros lugares del mundo: La Lucha Libre Mexicana. Un deporte/espect\u00e1culo que despierta pasiones (de las cuales no las entiendo, pero las respeto) y que, mal por bien, ha influido en muchos otros medios mundialmente como el cine, series de TV, incluso videojuegos.\n\nGuacamelee es un claro ejemplo de tomar como escenario el rico folclore mexicano, darle un toque de exploraci\u00f3n razonable estilo \u201cmetroidvania\u201d y un sistema de combate que te va a entretener un rato largo. Sorprendentemente, este titulo comprende bien c\u00f3mo debe sentirse acorde al genero dicho anteriormente. Sabe muy bien los aspectos que uno debe considerar para aventurarse a un mundo semi abierto donde podremos encontrar tesoros, habilidades extras, mejores y dem\u00e1s, cosa que no muchos llegan a hacerlo de manera correcta, es m\u00e1s, Guacamelee podria ser uno de los pocos que ha imitado medianamente bien la saga Metroid y post Castlevania: SOTN.\n\nLa historia trata de nuestro h\u00e9roe Juan, un tipo fan\u00e1tico de la lucha libre habitante de Pueblucho, un pueblo (valga la redundancia) muy gentil y en preparativos por la boda de la Hija del presidente, quien al parecer tiene una relaci\u00f3n anterior con Juan. En uno de esos andares de la vida, Pueblucho es atacado por el malvado Calaca y sus esbirros con el fin de raptar a la Hija del presidente y comenzar una ceremonia para fusionar el mundo de los vivos con los muertos. Juan en su intento de salvarla, muere a manos del antagonista quien tiempo mas tarde es elegido para llevar la Mascara del Luchador y evitar que la fusi\u00f3n suceda. \n\nEn realidad la narrativa no es muy profunda o emocionante en cuanto a la exposici\u00f3n que refiere mostrar en los primeros minutos, pero es la excusa necesaria para llevarte a una aventura que vas a querer completar al 100%. En si, encontraremos otros personajes divertidos y escenas que te van a hacer sacar una sonrisa ya que, sumado al apartado art\u00edstico, la excelente m\u00fasica y la jugabilidad, se suma peque\u00f1os gui\u00f1os a la cultura de internet contempor\u00e1nea y alguna que otra seudo-broma al genero y sus clich\u00e9s, por sobre todo de Metroid (quien se deja influenciar bastante).\n\nDefinitivamente Guacamelee es m\u00e1s un \u201cMetroid\u201d que un \u201cCastlevania moderno\u201d, puesto que no hay elementos de RPG y las habilidades que hallamos deliberadamente necesarias para progresar a otras \u00e1reas o retroceder por pura curiosidad luego de adquirir una t\u00e9cnica que nos permita romper bloques azules del juego, por ejemplo. A lo que va todo esto es que el juego esta dise\u00f1ado muy bien con respecto a c\u00f3mo deber\u00eda sentirse un juego de exploraci\u00f3n, con un camino predeterminado que nos lleve del punto A hacia el B, pero que se ramifica hacia otros lugares donde la meta es una habilidad extra (cosa que no hay, lamentablemente), tesoros que contienen dinero para luego invertirlo en trajes, t\u00e9cnicas de lucha libre y aumentar vida o capacidad para ejecutar ataques especiales. En si, no es enorme como Super Metroid, pero hace muy bien en la sensaci\u00f3n en general, cosa que, reiterando, pocos llegan a hacerlo.\n\nOtra cosa que se destaca Guacamelee, y puede que sea una de las caracter\u00edsticas que lo definen, es que su dificultad radica en muchas ocasiones en el plataformeo, en zonas donde deberemos usar nuestras habilidades correctamente para superar el obst\u00e1culo, aspecto que puede llevarte un tiempo en adaptarte. Aunque si vamos a profundidad jugable, el titulo incorpora otras dos habilidades que las tendremos que dominar: La transformaci\u00f3n del Pollo, si bien no tiene un uso en combate ser\u00e1 de ayuda para encontrar pasadizos que son inaccesibles siendo Juan, y la segunda es la capacidad para cambiar entre el mundo de los vivos y los muertos. Esta es una peculiaridad que ya se ha visto en Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (que es el primer ejemplo que se me viene a la cabeza con esta mec\u00e1nica), que al estar en un reino ciertas plataformas o accesos se materializan que al cambiar, estas desaparecen materializando otras. En si no suceden cambios dr\u00e1sticos en la estructura del juego, pero es algo que tendremos que dominar bastante bien.\n\nEl combate es otra cosa interesante que dentro de \u00e9l, Juan podr\u00e1 hacer maniobras vistas en la Lucha Libre Mexicana para deshacerse de los m\u00faltiples y peligrosos enemigos que se toparan en su camino. Obviamente podremos usar las habilidades extras de combate para hacernos el trabajo un poco m\u00e1s sencillo el asunto y que tiene algo muy propio de los beat 'em up estilo Devil May Cry (Uff..) donde podremos hacer combos en el aire o combinar \u201ccon estilo\u201d algunos golpes con otros y hacer tu propia cadena de ataques. Claro que el combate escala a la par con las cucherias que encontramos puesto que mas tarde tendr\u00e1n escudos en los que necesitaremos usar cierta maniobra para destruirlo o cambiar de mundo para poder atacarlo. Aunque no se lo crea, el combate puede ser muy intenso en algunos momentos donde todo lo dicho anteriormente se mezcla en un solo cuarto, teniendo que debatir quien es nuestra prioridad o c\u00f3mo intentar disminuir la presi\u00f3n del momento. En si este aspecto no es terriblemente frustrante, pero es parte de la aventura.\n\nEn lineas generales, Guacamelee es un excelente juego en todos sus aspectos: gr\u00e1ficos apetecibles y llamativos, gran jugabilidad y mec\u00e1nicas interesantes de plataformeo, combate trepidante y un apartado sonoro que es de admirar. En cuanto a las versiones que circulan de este titulo, \u201cGuacamelee: Gold Edition\u201d a\u00f1ade algunos DLC como los desaf\u00edos del Infierno y trajes extras, en cambio \u201cGuacamelee: Super Turbo Championship Edition\u201d suma lo de la Gold Edition, pero tambi\u00e9n algunas \u00e1reas extras y jefes. Si me preguntan, seria mejor la ultima edici\u00f3n que es la totalidad del paquete, pero si tienes la anterior no es nada de envidiar puesto que es (casi) la misma experiencia agradable de juego.\n\n[b]8/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1433687724, "timestamp_updated": 1433687724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769377470016479492", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16234029": {"recommendationid": "16234029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130339230", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 431, "last_played": 1434564242}, "language": "english", "review": "If the gameplay of the Classic Metroid and the plot of Mario Had a love child in Mexico it would create this game", "timestamp_created": 1433642179, "timestamp_updated": 1433642179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16209021": {"recommendationid": "16209021", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994484459", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 555, "last_played": 1434739745}, "language": "english", "review": "The art and music for Guacamelee is fantastic.

Gold Edition which was originally put out on the PS3 Digital store and PlayStation Vita has now been made available on the Steam store with more levels and Steam Workshop functionality. What you get overall though is a great 2D Beat Em Up though with very few flaws.\n\nThe story follows Juan, a simple farmer, who while trying to rescue El Presidente\u2019s daughter from Carlos Calaca who is the ruler of the dead world is killed. That\u2019s right , the main character and protagonist is killed in the opening of the game. However Juan is brought back from the dead by the magic of a mask and turned into a all so powerful luchador. Juan then sets out on a adventure to find El Presidente\u2019s daughter. That is a simple form of the story without spoiling some of the excitement. During the story however it displays it\u2019s fantastic sense of humor. Throwing references to everything from Mario to Wreck It Ralph. You get to know a handful of fun character with the most memorable one being the old man who owns the Choozo statues that Juan finds.\n\n \nGuacamelee! Gold Edition\n\nGuacamelee! Gold Edition\n\n \n\nAs you can see the game is beautiful looking. The environments are very brightly colored and lush looking. It boats a very well done art style that looks good in zoomed out scenes as well as close up. The character and enemy types are extremely detailed as well. The music is impressive as well with the mariachi music not only fitting in well but also being quite catchy.\n\nOff to game play we have a very well rounded beat em up / platformer at times. As you progress through the game you will get new masks which will unlock new moves and powers for you. Those moves will help destroy blocks you will come across that can only be destroyed by that move. That color scheme also later applies to enemies with shields. You will also be introduced to a light and dark world with puzzles and platformer sections playing heavily on switching between the two. It can get very difficult however thankfully the game balances it all fairly well. While it is hard the game never manages to get to the point where it is too hard to pass.\n\nThankfully the controls once learned are pretty tight. The game as well supports control functionality. With good controls the platforming thankfully does well. With leveled up powers you will find yourself doing moves along the lines of a double jump into a wall grab into a uppercut just to reach a platform you need. If you do mess up however and fall to your death the game graciously just warps you back up to the ledge never making you have to redo sections just to fail again.\n\nBy defeating enemies and passing areas into the game you gain coins which can be used to level up your character and buy new moves. The stations to upgrade yourself come rather often since they also serve as save points as well.\n\nBoasting very few flaws one of my main gripes with the game is it\u2019s length. The game is rather short lasting only a few hours. Coming in with a $15 price tag the game though is a good deal and provides a lot of fun for it\u2019s cost. I also found at first the combat to be somewhat repetitive though once gaining new powers it freshened up.\n\nOverall Guacamelee! is a great game. Featuring a entertaining story, fantastic graphics, and some great yet hard action and platforming you will have fun through the short journey.

What I think is hilarious is that it's a Canadian dev team that made this game.\n\nStarts off very easy, then gets somewhat difficult *solely* because sometimes it's hard to pull off the timing in the moves. There's a game mechanic in which you have to alternate between two different \"dimensions\" which is difficult to explain without giving away too much of the story. Speaking of which, is pretty much on par with the Super Mario's story. Serviceable but not a lot of depth. BTW, you can morph into a chicken... Which is actually way more awesome than it sounds.\n\nGame is a little too try-hard in terms of humor, but that's all subjective I suppose.\n\nI can't stress enough, gameplay requires you to have lighting-fast reflexes or you will be forced to play through a lot of areas twice or more until you get it.\n\nThe level design is very good. It's challenging but not over the top. The game is pretty short if you're good at it. Which is good because it gets repetitive fairly soonish.\n\nEverything is ULTRA colorful to the point where it kinda is an eyesore (people who get a new ability or challenger know what I'm talking about).\n\nMusic is amazing.

I don't know why people keep putting this in games.\n- When you die in a platformer, it should be because you misplayed and did something wrong because you aren't used to the game mechanics, not because you can't jump between walls in different dimension or that you don't have lightning reactions.\n- Not having fall damage is understandable and can be good, but if you accidentally fall down to the start of the level, you shouldn't have to do it all over again.\n- It's okay to have a final boss fight that is nearly  impossible to win, that will have you tearing out your hair in rage and will take you up towards 50 deaths before you even figure out how you are supposed to beat it, but then at least make the save after the cutscene so you don't have to sit through it every f***ing time.\n\nAll in all, it's not a great game.

the maps are very complex yet easy to navigate once you uncover the whole map, and the game perfectly balances its difficulty, starting very easy and getting harder closer to the end (yet not impossible).\n\nSpeaking of platforming, i have rarely seen such well made platforming sections in a very long time.\nThe developers really went crazy (in a good way) offering double jumps, moving plaftorms, flying powerups, portals, walljumps, wallslides, levers ecc..., and some puzzles are very challenging, yet very rewarding and well designed (note that most of these can be avoided if preferred).\n\nThe combat is an other thing that differenciates this game from the others; unlike other \"Metroid-Vania\" games here you have a very intuitive yet complex combo system, with the ability to throw enemies away and do some devastating chain attacks.\nEnemies are well differenciated and you need personalised attacks to beat them.\n\nThe design of the game is great, featuring a charming 2D vector style; the characters are gorgeously animated and drawn, as well as the levels, each one colorful and very well drawn.\nAn other thing that makes this game original is its unique humor, the game is filled with an incredible amount of funny easter eggs regarding the whole \"Internet/Memes\" and \"Videogames\" worlds and the game offers the chance to use custom skins built by the community (available through Steam Workshop).\n\nGuacamelee is a must-buy for everyone who likes 2D side scrolling games with a personal touch.\nOne of the best of its genre.\n\nPros:\n- Charming Humor\n- Fresh Design\n- Complex Maps\n- Amazing Platforming Action\n- Deep and fun combat/combo System\n- A ton of amazing easter eggs\n- Varied puzzles\n- Balanced Difficulty\n- Balanced Lenght (Not too long, not too short)\n- A lot of \"developer made\" and \"Community made\" custom skins\n\nCons:\n- A couple of stages could have \"dared\" more in therms of visual design\n\nTo Keep In Mind:\n- Some Orbs very very hard to get (Not necessary for the game completion)\n- Inferno Challenges (endgame content) sometimes incredibly hard /frustrating\n- Some achievements very hard to obtain (Not necessary for the game completion)\n- Need a bit of grinding, if willing to collect all the treasure chests (Not necessary for the game completion)", "timestamp_created": 1425234079, "timestamp_updated": 1488705384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538606405258178711", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14681271": {"recommendationid": "14681271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066417861", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1428113932}, "language": "english", "review": "I laughed from start to finish on this amazing game!

Quiz\u00e1 la est\u00e9tica es demasiado \"cartoon\", habr\u00e1 quien no le guste pero le va muy bien al juego. \nLo mejor: La fluidez de los movimientos y quiz\u00e1 los fondos de algunos mapeados, realmente hermosos.\nLo peor: Poca variedad de modelados y gran similitud entre los que hay.

Nada del otro mundo pero le va muy bien al juego.\nLo mejor: Las melod\u00edas, sin dudarlo.\nLo peor: Algunos efectos repetitivos, como los golpes... nada reprochable.\nNOTA: 7.7\n\nJUGABILIDAD: El kit de la cuesti\u00f3n. Estamos aqu\u00ed para hablar de esto. Avance lineal aunque con muchos secretillos para completarlo al 100%. La variedad de poderes y situaciones hacen que el desarrollo sea variado y fresco, aunque algunas peleas se hacen algo pesadas. Los jefes finales destacan por su diversidad y creatividad, de lo mejor del t\u00edtulo. El personaje se mueve excelentemente y es f\u00e1cil jugarlo aunque cuesta dominarlo, eso si, una vez lo dominas es un placer. \nLo mejor: Los movimientos del personaje, que no son solo ataques, sino que adem\u00e1s es una manera de avanzar. Los bosses son un placer jugarlos.\nLo peor: Algunas peleas se hacen pesadas y repetitivas, aunque tienen que estar. Algo corto.\nNOTA: 9.0\n\nMultijugador: El juego se puede completar jugando en cooperativo local, as\u00ed que eso le a\u00f1ade algo de frescura, aunque le quita dificultad.

In order to do so, Juan chases Carlos and defeats his lackies along the way.\n\nSoundtrack is fantastic, giving off a mexican feel and draws you into the unique world. There is no voice acting with character dialogue through text. The sound effects for attacks are also good.\n\nThe graphics suit the game well. the colours are  vibrant and  not distracting, and do a good  job at instilling the mexican atmosphere in the game. Furthermore,  the characters and stages all have a mexican styled design to them which helps invoke the mexican atmosphere in the game.\n\nGameplay revolves around platforming and combat. The platforming in in this game varies between simple to challenging. Some platforms only require a few moves to get to such as simply jumping on them, while more challenging ones require precisely timed executions in order to reach. For the challenging platforming areas, it is difficult to get the precise key inputs through the keyboard as it can only detect a limited number of inputs at a time. I was forced to play with a 360 controller which made the experience more fluid and less frustrating. In combat you face a wide variety of foes including skeletons, dragons and  giants which either have melee or ranged attacks. The aim is mainly to unleash as many combos on them as possible to prevent them from attacking you. You have a varity of attacks which you can used to defeat your foes or to help reach platforms from side smash, uppercut and throws. You unlock more moves as you progress through the story. Furthermore, you can upgrade you character in variety of ways including increasing health, damage and spawn delay (by spending money). Furthermore, you can play the game via local co-op with a friend.\n\n\nThere are alot of references to other videogames such as nintendo characters Mario and Link (with mexican vibes to them).

First and foremost, I love the different elements of the game. The story I wouldn't call the best, but it also isn't a bad story. I'm indifferent about the story, but the characters and how some of them are presented are pretty hilarious at times. I love how the game is presented with the game's artistic appearance and how each area can be swapped in and out going from the \"Land of the Dead\" to the \"Land of the Living\". The Land of the Dead has a dark gloomy look. While the Land of the Living has this vibrant and cheerful look. Both of these have to be used through the game to get through certain areas. What may have been broken or destroyed in the living world, could still exist in the Land of the Dead. Which you can imagine how many different complexities this could add, and also how useful it could be. The music in this game is also a great addition. This game is very challenging at times, but you get a feeling of accomplishment after completing these areas. This game is a true platformer, one of the most difficult and challenging ones I've played in a while. It blends the elements of platforming and fighting into one game. The fighting actually has true fighting elements, such as combos. Some of these fighting moves can also be used as a platforming tool to reach different platforms. Which will be very useful during the game. The fighting for me is a big plus to this game. In many platformers, they lack good fighting mechanics. This game is a joy to play.

You absolutely must enjoy both of those things or this game WILL increasingly piss you off as it goes on.\n\nFor me, I enjoy side-scrolling beat 'em ups and also enjoy platformers, but I am not the type of person who particularly enjoys intensely punishing difficulty in either one (maybe in a challenge mode, but not in the campaign). I picked up this game mainly because I had heard it had strong metroidvania elements, and I was very interested in exploring a mexi-metroid. The game started off super enjoyable and very much mexi-metroid, which I loved. But I started getting super frustrated at the game once I got to the Tule Tree, where the game first revealed its unwavering fetish for spamming dimension shift challenges in prolongued wall jumping segments. (If you think it will be over after the Tule Tree, you're wrong.) \n\nI stuck with it, though. It was infuriating, and I cursed a lot, but I stuck with it for a long time. I was disappointed that the metroidvania elements increasingly dwindle away and the game becomes more and more intensely focused on infuriating cage match challenges and infuriating platforming challenges where you have to execute a specific sequence of jump extenders (while dimension shifting ever other step, naturally), and the game just turns these up more, and more, and more as you advance. I kept feeling the frustration rise higher and higher as I progressed, but I kept on going.\n\nI made it all the way to Javier Jaguar. I'm now quitting forever, because seriously: F**K THAT. Talk about a sudden and maddeningly huge difficulty spike. (Especially considering that the previous boss battle, Flame Face, is incredibly easy.) There comes a point where one experiences furious anger more than joy with a game. Javier Jaguar is the deal breaker for me and Gaucamelee. But I won't say that makes it a bad game. It is a beautiful game that I think was just not made for me.

Your game starst out in the house of Juan, a peaceful farmer, and get called into your village by the priest, who informs you your childhood friend/love interest has arrived for a festival. You go to help her pick up chairs or something, but find out Carlos Calaca and his henchmen have taken her for whatever they need her for. You try to put up a fight but he kills you. Finding yourself in the land of the dead, you discover a lochador mask and put it on, returning to the normal world with the newfound power of the luchador, ready to save your girlfriend by fighting skeletons, swapping dimensions, and learning new tricks from a... goat... thing. \nThe gameplay is very fun, and although it is a platformer with lots of puzzles, it also smoothly incorporates combat within that. Dimension swapping is the main puzzle of the game, and since both worlds have different walls, blocks, and enemies, you will swap between the two frequently. I do have to say that I consider myself a veteran platformer gamer and I found some optional portions of the game incredibly aggravating, to the point where I had to quit playing and take a break. It's very rhythmic because of the dimension swap, and often takes several times to do it correctly. \nThe art is fantastic. The cartoon-y simple characters look very good, and the enemies are excellent as well. I also liked the art within the game. Several billlboards are in the larger towns and are full of video game references, which I thought was cool. \nThe music can get repetitive, especially if you are stuck on one part. It does have two different versions of the same song for different dimensions however, which I liked. \nThe story itself is somewhat lacking, but what they do have is pretty good. It's not really about the story, and I wasn't following the events, but they had a bit of dialogue and I understood what was going on. \n\nOverall, I'd give the game a 9/10.

It's over 100. Yes I'm fully aware that this is actually quite small in comparison to other libraries, but I have enough that I don't want to buy any more right now. So what I've decided to do is complete every single game to the extent that I see fit, then uninstall it and shunt it into a deep, dark category in my library. This game is in said category. So far, it's the only one for which I've thought \"I want to play this again.\"\n\nThis game is awesome. You're a luchador whose movement is heavily influenced by his special moves. The game has such a great, unique style that is very refreshing. I guarantee you that, after you devour the game, you will want to play again. It's just that good!\n\nThe atmosphere is excellent. Each area, in both spiritual planes, is portrayed so excellently. The music is intense, fits perfectly, and is composed very well. The game has an interesting take on the Mexican view of the world of the dead, and does it in a very respectful way. Like, holy crap. This game does an excellent job at making you feel like you're in the game.\n\nThe characters are good, even though there aren't that many. Each of the four bosses you fight are drawn out very well, and that one goat is quite funny. Indeed, this game is so incredibly light-hearted, with lots of references in Santa Luchita, and many instances where you will end up laughing out loud.\n\nThere's very little story to speak of, but that's not the main focus of this game.\n\nFinally, the combat system is absolutely perfect. It is well executed, and the progression of your abilities is just right. Your fighting moves augment your movement (and hence your combat), and the developers have taken direct advantage of this fact to expand this game as far as they can. You wouldn't expect much platforming in a game primarily about fighting, but it's in here, and it's good.\n\nBuy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1418795997, "timestamp_updated": 1479956608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13398695": {"recommendationid": "13398695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085424314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1577, "last_played": 1427444842}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, after some thought, this game was pretty good, all things considered. What with the lack of Mexican characters that aren't a joke/generally pointless in most of the things I've seen, I was expecting the game to be dumb as all hell. It's nice to be proven wrong over these kinds of things; any of the stereotypes attributed to Mexicans present in the game are harmless and I'd be a hard sell for anyone to tell me almost anything in the game is racist or just plain stupid. (Before anyone brings it to my attention, if you're the kind of person who gets bent out of shape by dumb internet jokes instead of just ignoring them or, god forbid, laughing at them, then damn son, that's real sad.) The general feel of the first town, Pueblucho, reminds me of my mother's hometown, Zinap\u00e9cuaro, while the bigger town, Santa Luchita, reminds me of the current home of a lot of my cousins, Morelia. It's all colorful and shit, which is excellent because that's what a lot of buildings are like when you hit the right towns.\n\nThe actual gameplay is tight and flows decently. You've got your standard 3-hit combo, your tosses (and special throws), and moves meant to keep the combo going or catch up to a distant enemy. The fact that you can dodge-cancel in this game to quickly recover and continue your attacks is good and I wish a couple more games would do this. The special moves are also good because the game's layout makes you think about how to get across the many obstacles you'll run into. You eventually learn things such as a double jump to make both combat and platforming easier, as well as possible in certain situations. The color-coded armor-breaking system was alright, but the any-hit, layered shields were a bit annoying to work against due to how fast they regenerated. I would never call the system impossible to work with as long as you actually paid some damn attention to the tutorial and practiced for more than five minutes.\n\nThe chests are all spaced out and placed in locations that will test your skills. I did enjoy that collecting enough chests filled with money would allow you to buy all the upgrades you needed, in case combos in this game were not your strong point (for whatever reason). Some of the energy and health pick-ups were the most fun I've had in a 2D platformer in a long time. The pieces of the mask (which were given to you by orbs) are the most challenging items to shoot for in this game, or at least the ones that required you to master the platforming sections. Basically, the secrets in this game are great and were placed where they needed to be without being such a pain in the ass to hunt for.\n\nThe music is amazing and makes me pretty damn happy while playing. The differences between the Living World tracks and the Dead World tracks match the appropriate World. The Living World tracks are, well, lively and active, they make you feel festive and want to do things. The Dead World tracks are a bit moody, but you can feel the spirit of excitement that was once there (or still is there, I guess, since you ARE there). The celebratory yells that occur during some tracks are good additions and make them feel more fitting.\n\nThe art is damn beautiful and colorful, even the Dead World sections. While I don't really care much for the flashing sections of art (I'm not at risk, they're just kind of whatever), everything else is good. Every enemy has a clear silhouette and is hard to lose track of, even when they're in the opposite world. Every attack you do gives off this energy and power that such moves would generate, like you're a super-hero (though some could argue you pretty much are). The only complaint I would give is there was one attack by a flying enemy (the name escapes me atm) that would spit fire-like projectiles at you, but you could dodge through them just fine, while another enemy with a large hammer can strike you and it's not immediately obvious that the red flow of energy around the hammer when it falls is actually fire. Other than that, it all makes sense.\n\nIn short, this game is good and if I had the cash on hand to go for the upgraded re-release, I would do so, even at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1418713197, "timestamp_updated": 1418713197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498311549425125122", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13384980": {"recommendationid": "13384980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029534286", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1409468582}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing it kind of gives me a little Paper Mario-ish nostalgia, but with slightly more mature humor, its great.", "timestamp_created": 1418686465, "timestamp_updated": 1418686465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13380438": {"recommendationid": "13380438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100894552", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1424113816}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate that you need a controller to play for a good experiance!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1418665874, "timestamp_updated": 1422711602, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13362611": {"recommendationid": "13362611", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984013402", "num_games_owned": 704, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1415360851}, "language": "english", "review": "guacamelee was pretty fun, but not fun enough to make up for enemies yelling \"trolololol\" while standing in front of a picture of grumpy cat", "timestamp_created": 1418563616, "timestamp_updated": 1418563616, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45588386058807373", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13355882": {"recommendationid": "13355882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024960817", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 546, "last_played": 1527436256}, "language": "english", "review": "Both the art directoin and the gameplay in this impressed me, a lot.

And the most fun as well which should count for something.\n\nThe cool thing is that Guacamelee! pays homage to the Metroid series and doesn't shy away from the fact that it's a Metroidvania game.

However, the game shines in everything that it does right. You unlock moves and abilities during the adventure, each neatly fitting in with what you already know. The map makes it clear where you need to go (so it's a bit less exploration), but leaves you enough to encounter. Combat is tight and interesting: you gradually learn how to play without it ever feeling a chore to do.\n\nThe Mexican theme is nice and (strangely enough) mix well with winks to various games like Zelda (I AM ERROR), Mario (the first boss) and of course metroid (the statues).

Enemies can be tough but never frustrating and the design makes use of all the powers you have.\n\nAny minusses? Hard to say. I hear keyboard/mice controls aren't that good, but I used a controller, so can't say. And perhaps there was a bit too much storyline at the start, but that's certainly not an issue.\n\nAll in all: a great recommendation.\n\n:-)", "timestamp_created": 1415475980, "timestamp_updated": 1415475980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472636818885803223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12816836": {"recommendationid": "12816836", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994471459", "num_games_owned": 953, "num_reviews": 446, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 419, "last_played": 1414803513}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfection.

The music is great, the gameplay is solid, and it is intentionally silly. Not only that, but it's also got a really fun combat system and it actually forces you to learn how to play the game so that, by the end, you know what you're doing; it's not like other games where you can more or less wing what you're doing and just follow the objective marker to get to the end. I'd give this game something like an 8.5/10 or so. Not quite as high as a 9 or 10, but also slightly ahead of most 8s.\n\nGuacamelee is a game where you play as some Mexican guy to avenge the girl he closet loves after being smashed by the guy who stole her away from the village. You do this by dawning the a mask that has the soul of a former luchador or something. Look, listen, I don't care for story, I like gameplay, visuals, and sounds.\n\nGuacamelee is a beat-em-up influenced by Mexican culture. Simple premise. You, as a luchador, can learn grabs, throws, combos, and other things to help you get though the legions of baddies sent to delay you from getting to the final boss. Not all baddies can be dispatched the same way, though. Some require you to break their shield by performing a special super move (using your meter), some require throws, and some just need some knuckles to the dome. Perfect. Exactly what you'd expect from a beat-em-up.\n\nBut wait, that's not all of the gameplay. There's also some platforming. What? Platforming? Yeah, I know, listen: each of the special moves that you learn influence your character's movement. The TOTALLY NOT SHORYUKEN moves your character up so you can get some vertical movement, there's a belly flop that moves you down to the lowest platform (or breaks blocks that can be broken), and there's a dash that moves you sideways...  Look, listen, basically you're forced to use the moves you learn not only in combat, but also to get around. It's pretty neat. \n\nThere's also this concept of the netherworld or whatever that is merging with the human world, so, sometimes, things change to reflect how they are in the other dimension. This becomes something that you can control and offers some interesting puzzle-platforming like things where you have to pusha da button real fast and stuff to get to another area. The game also rewards you for going back to revisit places and stuff, so that's cool. Always gotta give shout outs to games that reward players for going back and experimenting with newfound powers.\n\nThat's really all there is to the gameplay. It's not terribly difficult to learn, and getting the combos off from the chicken's gym will be pretty satisfying because some of them are lengthy for a beat-em-up. Everyone that plays fighting games knows the satisfaction from getting off a lengthy combo. \n\nWhat else is there to talk about after the gameplay? Oh yeah, visuals. This game is 2d and feels like how Samurai Jack would be if it were a video game. 2d with not too many circles. A lot of things are obviously overdone. It's not a bad thing by any means. That said, I wasn't too impressed with it. Beyond the simple graphics, though, the game has a ton of references to internet stuff in the background. One thing that makes me love games is being silly and this game is totally silly. It doesn't detract from gameplay and isn't in-your-face narration from a character you don't care about, but it's mostly harmless jokes or references to things. \n\nThen there's the music. Ok, look, listen, I'm Mexican and I grew up listening to some pretty ethnic music. Most of it I didn't really care for, but this game took all the good parts of the music I didn't like and smashed it together to form a REALLY REALLY solid soundtrack. Like, holy crap, I actually listen to some of the songs from this game regularly because they sound so nice. You'll get some pretty stereotypical accordion and brass instruments playing, but you'll also, for example, in the jungle area, get some fast drums because fast drums are associated with jungles because reasons. \n\nYeah, but what's not to like about this game? It offers solid beat-em-up gameplay, neat platforming, and even some puzzles. The graphics aren't anything highest-end, but they get the job done and look just dandy anyway. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and this game is just genuinely fun to play. It also has a fantastic soundtrack. I'd highly adivse anyone to pick up this game. Also, this game tends to be on sale pretty often, so there's almost no reason to pick it up if you don't already own it and it's on sale. I personally got mine off a humble bundle and it was great. One thing I would have really liked was if this game had online multiplayer or something, but it doesn't, and that's I guess permissable. It offers local co-op, so I guess that'll have to suffice.", "timestamp_created": 1415165923, "timestamp_updated": 1415165923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493103444576263428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12798018": {"recommendationid": "12798018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056658389", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1758, "last_played": 1414642338}, "language": "english", "review": "BOOM POW PUNCH!!!", "timestamp_created": 1415164210, "timestamp_updated": 1415164210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499930083751678467", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12795768": {"recommendationid": "12795768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041449668", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 403, "last_played": 1415201271}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome soundtrack and atmosphere.

They make strong use of an ability to switch between worlds and have different platforms appear. Also most of the special moves are used effectively as transportation.

More of a nitpick really.\n-For 80% of the game, hard mode is basically just enemies doing more damage. The bosses really step it up, which is welcome but can also make the difficulty feel uneven.\n-The Chupacabra's sword-stab does a crazy amount of damage. It's like...I don't know..It just really stands out. Oh and yeah this also counts as nitpicking.\n\n-Controller issue. This is an odd one. Basically whenever I hit RT to switch between worlds, there are times when the button gets stuck or doesn't respond. I've read some posts where other posters mention this issue.

Oh man, the music! The art to this game, the humor... it's an all around very well developed game and I love it. \n\nI recommend you play this game with a controller. I haven't tried with a keyboard much, but its very comfortable once you get used to the controls of the game. The game can also prove itself to be quite challenging at times... but as you get used to the controls and the mechanics of the game, it becomes easier and very fun. \n\nPlease give this game a go.

Unfortunately, the co-op platforming is a mess. The sections that use the environment-shifting mechanic are great fun in single player, but in co-op it's impossible not to get in each others' way.

It has a fun story and style to spare. The art and animation in the game are incredible, it has a great sense of humor (plenty of tongue-in-cheek references to be had throughout) and the fighting/combo system is surprisingly deep. I absolutely love this game, and I say that upfront because I have to be harsh about a handful of things that hold the game back from perfection.\n\nAs good as the fighting system is in Guacamelee, it could have used some more love- specifically recovery time and cancels. If it sounds incredibly petty that I'm asking for such a 'deep' feature in what is essentially a beat'em up game, it really starts to make sense toward the end of the game when enemies start doing shields that you need to break with specific attacks. \n\nOften times, you'll break a shield and get knocked down by another enemy and before you can get back up the shield you took out has regenerated. It ends up making for a handful of really frustrating encounters, and one boss fight that is absolutely infuriating (javier jaguar). Your special moves take so much time to wind up that the situation can change while you're in mid-animation with no way to cancel it, so you have to watch in what feels like slow-mo while you get smashed in the face. This leads to a lot of situations where you die and feel completely cheated because you weren't in control of the character and could have avoided the attack if you could cancel.\n\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that pretty much every enemy attack in the game interrupts your special attacks. As I mentioned, you have to use these special moves to break shields, but in a room with multiple shield types, you can wind up your super long uncancellable special move to break a shield, only to get smacked in the back by another enemy (with a different shield). While your recovery animation is playing, the enemy's shield is regenerating. On the flip side of that, bosses are pretty much immune to special attack stuns and knockbacks, so the combos you've been practicing for so long are basically worthless in a boss fight. Specifically in the Javier Jaguar fight, you'll have to break his shield with a special, but he'll attack simultaneously- guess whose attack knocks back and whose doesn't? You will find yourself wanting to throw your controller through the wall during this fight because so much of it is beyond your control. It just seems intentionally punishing and doesn't reward the player for the skill they've developed over the course of the game.\n\nTo add to that, lots of end-game encounters have you fighting not only enemies that are shielded in a multitude of colors (which require completely different moves to break), but also enemies that are phased into the living/dead worlds. Here's another situation where it feels like the balancing is slightly broken or in need of adjustment. Enemies can hit you regardless of which dimension they're phased into, but you can't hit them. I would have preferred a system where opposite dimensions would give/take more or less damage than the dimension you're currently in, which would have made it more interesting and less frustrating.\n\nOverall, like I said- this is a fantastic game and totally worth the full asking price, but it does have some frustrating moments later in the game due to some issues with the finer fighting mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1413770262, "timestamp_updated": 1413778218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530973434448242188", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12570301": {"recommendationid": "12570301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069571893", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 480, "last_played": 1409070285}, "language": "english", "review": "I suggest playing this game with a controller or else   you might learn to play the piano using the keybord", "timestamp_created": 1413735227, "timestamp_updated": 1413735227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502782523632049561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12568115": {"recommendationid": "12568115", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969591382", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 354, "last_played": 1467592777}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!

I swear there are still too many punishing mechanics masked as challenge curves  such as forcing the player to wait or rushing to reclaim everything that you've earned in a previous playthrough. \"Difficult\" makes the player think and plan. \"Difficult\" should challenge the game developer as much as it challenges the player.\n\n[b]Guacamelee[/b] is difficult, especially if you want the true ending, but it's not punishing. I miss a jump, I go back to the last platform, I try again. THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE. THIS IS WHAT EARNS THIS GAME THE THUMBS UP FROM THIS REVIEWER. I never felt like I was wasting any time playing Guacamelee. There's variety in the platforming challenges, introduced by incorporating the special moves that you discover as tools to broaden movement. The Rooster Uppercut introduces double, then triple jumps. The Dashing Derpderp (bad name, I know), brings a horizontal dash and so forth... There's no resource management to worry about (and that's including health management), you just have the platform challenge in its purest form.\n\nI'm old. Thirty-five years old.

I'm gushing because I remember goddamn Castlevania, goddamn Ninja Turtles and goddamn Megaman and [b]Guacamalee[/b] ISN'T LIKE THAT. Thank goodness. By the way, that's why every review of Shovel Knight has made me wary of it. Briefly considered it, considered the hype, remembered the old days and went NUH-UH.\n\nIronically, the hard mode of this game is a complete wash. Just more damage from the monsters and more hits required to kill 'em. Kinda breaks the whole point of my review but I really wanted to laud everything else about this game.\n\nIt really does seem like a fun challenging platformer with monsters thrown in because of course you need monsters to smash. A whole combo tutorial camp and none of its lessons are ever necessary. A game built around luchadors and then you have this weak ass combat system. It's kind of a bait-and-switch in that regard: the moves you unlock seem to have a platforming purpose first and an enemy bashing purpose second... Artificial purpose at that, what with the introduction of colored shields to force you to use the appropriately colored attack. That's a juvenile way to handle combat. Boss fights centered on pattern recognition? Yes, that is a hallmark from the platformers of old but that doesn't mean you couldn't add some innovation on it.\n\nI ain't mad, and this is coming from a huge wrestling fan who bought the game because he wanted to play a luchador protagonist.

It makes the world feel less variegated than it really could.\n- Most places are just \"rooms\". There are very few places that don't feel completely manifactured and a bit sterile after a while.\n- The fourth wall breaking is pushed way too far all the time. Countless posters of famous videogames and memes all over every town, statues of videogame characters outside of them, shilouhettes of Mario and Space Invaders on random walls, Chozo statues that give you power-ups... it feels like the references outweight the original ideas, which is a pity.\n- The color-coded blocks feel a bit out of place. It's as if instead of thinking of an actual clever way to convey that each block could be destroyed in a specific way they just resorted to slap the color of the respective power-up onto them.\n\nPros:\n+ The level design is really creative\n+ The combat system is satisfying without being inaccessible or frustrating\n+ The animations are generally great, and the art style is pleasant\n+ Lots of hidden stuff to find\n\nVerdict:\nGuacamelee is a satisfying and thoroughly enjoyable Metroidvania with some interesting Character Action elements.

The combat is solid with very tight and intuitive controls, enemies are challenging and boss fights are a blast. The only exception to this rule is the final boss fight, which is a obnoxious borderline cheap fight. Combat is relatively simplistic. You have basic attacks, grapple moves, and a dodge. You are also equipped with three special moves doled out at various parts of the story. Chaining melee moves, throws, and specials are seamless and fluid. Getting into a rhythm against a horde of monsters is easy and exhilarating, but missing a hit or being knocked out of a combo can be devastating. \n\nMastering the move set isn\u2019t the only thing you need to do, you need to know how to take care of a group of enemies by identifying the ones that must go down first. The game has a relatively small enemy list, making it easy to remember enemy patterns and strengths. It\u2019s this knowledge that you have to gather and remember as you make your way through the story. Do you take out the enemies lobbing projectiles at you, or do you take care of the quicker enemies first? That depends on a lot of factors you have to compute immediately when a fight starts. Not doing this may result in a very high death rate. \n\nThe one complaint I have of the combat system is that enemy attacks that have a wider area of effect tend to have hella spotty hitboxes. The animation of an arcing attack may hit your character and deal appropriate damage, while the same animation of the same arcing attack another time may hit your character in the same frames of animation and never register a hit. Or an attack that your character was well out of the animation may still be hit for no reason. It isn\u2019t all the time, but it is enough to become noticeable. \n\nSee more of the review here: http://www.skepticalminotaurgames.com/guacamelee", "timestamp_created": 1412718083, "timestamp_updated": 1412718083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12398194": {"recommendationid": "12398194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025839050", "num_games_owned": 689, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1412965407}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ANDALE WEY, LA CHUCHA, SANTA LUPITA....LUCHITA*, ANDELE, ORALE, CALACA, MUCHA LUCHA, BUYACA BUYACA, REY MISTERIO, SALSA TEQUILA CORASON SERVESA MUY BUENO, VIVA PI\u00d1ATA.", "timestamp_created": 1412678907, "timestamp_updated": 1412678907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925341129302979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12393767": {"recommendationid": "12393767", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987097961", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1394388829}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice Metroidvania style game with a fun cast and setting.

Wonderfull game, you most play it!", "timestamp_created": 1412473168, "timestamp_updated": 1412473266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12366432": {"recommendationid": "12366432", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996563245", "num_games_owned": 486, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1543682070}, "language": "english", "review": "This one is a little hard for me to review I like and had a lot of fun playing it but, there was also a small part of me that did not like some of the dialogue in the game. It just seemed rather random and made no sense. The game itself is fun to play. I like the combat system and the puzzle solving that comes along with the two dimensions is also fun. Although some of the platform moves can get rather hard and complex when you have to combine jumping from wall to wall with dimensions switching while in midair. Also some things are not really well explained. I was stuck for a good while in a section of the game because I did not realize you could combine the special moves together while in mid-air to make your jumps longer. \nAgain this is a fun platform game that uses a lot of jumping moves to get around. Overall I really enjoyed most of the game so far (I haven\u2019t beat the entire game), but I also understand this is probably not something everybody would enjoy. If you could give the game an overall score it would be 8/10 or maybe even a 7.5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1412454641, "timestamp_updated": 1412454641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12363797": {"recommendationid": "12363797", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990570094", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1710, "last_played": 1412291150}, "language": "english", "review": "Excelent metroidvania title with a fairly good humor and great animations", "timestamp_created": 1412442587, "timestamp_updated": 1412442587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12362572": {"recommendationid": "12362572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113451109", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1392859757}, "language": "english", "review": "Guacamelee is a fun and adicting game, the story is quite good, the game art is exellent and the gameplay is really fun; with plenty of collectibles and 2 different endings this game deserves more than one play.", "timestamp_created": 1412436614, "timestamp_updated": 1412436614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12340200": {"recommendationid": "12340200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008425549", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1392811208}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1412357344, "timestamp_updated": 1412357344, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.330897033214569092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12339489": {"recommendationid": "12339489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153826426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 884, "last_played": 1412353414}, "language": "english", "review": "This game reminded me of the side scrollers of old including how hard it was.

This game is now one of my favourite skill based platformers. The difficulty increases at a perfect pace in my opinion. It's also nice that you visit old areas/levels after getting new skills, so you can reach secrets. At some points it's really hard to advance and you need to combine all skills you have curretnly available. I advice you to use a gamepad for this game, with a keyboard it might be very tricky and cause frustration. At least there is a great soundtrack with lots of different songs and they are not annoying when you are trying this one hard jump for the 50th time. \n\nSome things that could imrpove the gaming experience would be more spoken dialogue, it's really alot ot read. Also some cut scenes and splash screens have a really annoying colour flashing, so I needed to close my eyes whenever they appeared before I got an epileptic seizure. :D\n\nAs I said earlier, I'm now 5 hours into the game and it feels like I achieveved alot, I would guess I'm at around 80% completion and I can't wait for tomorrow to finish the rest and get all the remaining achievements aswell. The game even has a Cooperation Mode that I will probably never try, but maybe it's interesting for some people. \n\nThe 'Super Turbo Championship Edition' (a polished version with some more content) is actually on sale now, so I would go ahead and buy it.

When you have to bash 5 buttons at once, but then switch to 5 new ones in less than second if you don't want to redo 3 minutes of platforming, it goes far beyond rage-quit material. When you do get to fight, it's a great time on of the best fighting systems in 2D game I've ever experienced.

First, I'll just say I was surprised by it, and I mean that with the utmost flattery.  It was a game that was completely off my radar.  I saw it pop up on my Steam homepage, but it wasn't until a friend bought it as a gift for me did I really know what it was.  As described, it is a \"Metroid-vania\" style game.  There are a ton of video game references (and some non-video game) with in the game, if you have the patience to stop and look around you.  The game is fun, but I think the best part about it is that it is able to pay homage to classic video games without being a classic video game.  What do I mean by that?  Well, first it has it's own art style, which I really enjoy.  It's also not pixelated and not trying to be 8/16-bit retro game.  Along with it's own art style, it also has it's own unique story.  A lot of these indie games today are trying to revive the old story tropes (Knights, ninjas, etc.).  But...how many old games do you remember where the protagonist owns a tequila distillery and becomes a magical luchador?  Not many.  I mean...yes it does have classic, \"save the princess\" but with a different sort of mask to it.  I guess what I'm trying to get at here, and this could be argued, is that this game pays homage to classic gaming without having to look, feel, and act like a classic game, if that makes sense.  It has it's own unique voice and style.  Not saying that games like Shovel Knight, Anodyne, Oniken, and Hammerwatch are not great games and unique on their own, but they do imitate, very closely, to the old NES classics (Oniken being very much in the vein of Ninja Gaiden; Hammerwatch to Gauntlet).  \n\nWhat does all this amount to? It's fun.  It's unique.  It's challenging and makes me mad.  So yes, totally get this game.

The only game in my steam library I regret buying.\n\nThe Good: This game is unique in that it is to my knowledge the only 2D Mexican-themed metroidvania beat-em-up in existence. For the first 1/3 of the game, you'll be thinking \"wow, I've never played anything quite like this\". Almost everything meshes really tightly (more on that \"almost\" later).\n\nSuperficially, the game is great. I am usually critical of vector/Flash art in indie games (Ed McMillan's style is ugly and unappealing to me) but this game's style is beyond well done and beautifully drawn. It really captures the luchador aesthetic, and it's refreshing to see an indie game with an art style that isn't pixel art (or Ed McMillan's John K-esque gross-out shock-art style). One aspect of this game's art that really impressed me was that it uses its bold and flamboyant colour palette to its advantage: not only do the colours highlight the setting and theme, but bright and vivid contrasts make it very easy to not lose track of your character in the brawls, even in multiplayer. A++ to the art department. Colour me impressed.\n\nThe Bad: This game's music is repetitive and unmemorable. While what there is sounds very authentic and fitting, this is a game whose music will become muted very, very quickly. It feels there should be more, but there just\u2026 isn\u2019t.\n\nUnfortunately, beneath its shiny exterior Guacamelee! sports some very flawed game mechanics. Fighting becomes bland quickly, and about 1/3 of the way through things start to get baaad. The game tries to stave off the samey-samey-ness of the combat in ways that ultimately fall flat. Instead of increasing the (very limited) variety of enemies, the game introduces gimmicky limitations to combat that feel broken, frustratingly arbitrary, and poorly thought-out with respect to the way the characters control. They also artificially increase the difficulty to levels that border the \u201ccompletely unfair / broken game design\u201d line.\n\nA fair challenge tests mastery of game mechanics and rewards player skill. Fair challenges are not a part of the latter 2/3 of this game. In fact, some parts of this game are so stupidly difficult (the insta-death fast-spawning exploding bomb enemies for example) that I almost stopped playing. These parts of the game do not test skill; they test patience (in the worst way) and temper. Failure during these parts is almost entirely out of player control. And I do mean literally out of player control because there is virtually no damage-invincibility or ability to recover from a mistake before your character becomes a pingpong ball. And this will happen, again and again and again\u2026\n\nThe Ugly: Good writing can be to bad game design as is brown sugar to porridge. It can make something bland into something modestly enjoyable. Unfortunately, Guacamelee!\u2019s writing is more like finding a hair in that bowl of porridge. Sure, it might be your own hair, so there's nothing wrong with it per se, but now you really don\u2019t want to eat any more of that porridge because ewww.\n\nOutside of combat, this game\u2019s story is overrun by a certain style of humour. Take a long sigh out of your nose. That's really the best summary. There are a few actual jokes (setup/payoff) that did make me laugh. Unfortunately they are buried in a sea of dated and cringe-worthy internet memes (???), \"references\" to movies, and \"call-outs\" to popular videogames. Yes, that last sentence did indeed say \u201cmemes\", as in \"injokes\" with no purpose or amusing qualities beyond \"hey I know what that is lololol\".  \n\nFinally, the ending is an absolute joke.\n\nAnd when I say the ending is an absolute joke, I mean both that it is an out-of-nowhere, context-blind, poorly-integrated reference, and also that it is abrupt, stupid, and ultimately unsatisfying.\n\nConclusion: I really wanted to recommend this game. After playing, I felt let-down and disappointed.

You play a Mexican Luchadore, fighting the forces of evil to save your love and the world. Along the way you will explore varied areas, learn new abilities, and fight a multitude of enemies.\n\nGuacamelee is a game that is just oozing style. Everything from the artwork, to the sound, the writing, the characters and the world at large mesh so well together. You will want to spend time exploring the world and talking to its inhabitants. The towns are packed with humor and things to find.\n\nThe controls are as tight as they need to be for an action platformer. I played using a 360 pad, and would recommend using a gamepad. After learning new abilities, you will have to combine all your powers to advance in the later stages. I was really amazed at the combinations I could pull off toward the endgame.\n\nI do have one complaint, which falls under performance and controls. Originally it felt like the game moved super fast, and I was having trouble pulling off basic combos and fighting some of the early enemies. One sequence in particular, where you must run in sidescroller fashion from a destructing environment, felt like it was moving way too fast. I was only able to pass it after about 20 attempts. Later I learned that there can be a bug with the vsync that basically doubles the speed of the game. Turning off vsynce solves the problem, however it will lead to some graphical glitches along the way. I found it a small price to pay for a playable game. After playing about the first quarter of the game at double speed, later platforming sections felt pretty easy in comparison.\n\nBeyond my one small complaint above, I was enamored by everything else in Guacamelee. It was fun to explore, fun to see what was next, fun to fight the enemies, and just plain fun overall. I would welcome a sequel, since it feels like there are so many places for this series to go. I see that a rerelease just came out with some new levels, and while I would prefer an entirely new game, eventually I may give that a shot as well.\n\nI completely recommend Guacamelee. While it has received heavy praise so it wasn't a complete surprise, it really exceeded my expectations. At this point you may want to purchase the newer version if you haven't played it yet, but if this game is already sitting in your backlog, move it to the front of the list.\n\nGrade: A", "timestamp_created": 1410234049, "timestamp_updated": 1410234049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12028013": {"recommendationid": "12028013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035185337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 937, "last_played": 1403666426}, "language": "english", "review": "A- Metroidvania game.

What makes the plattforming really interesting is that you can use your wrestling moves you'll learn over the course of the game, to reach your destination. In combat you use as already mentioned wrestling moves to defeat your enemies, apart from that you can throw a damaged enemy, who can be thrown onto other enemies, which is not only efficient, but is very satisfying to do.\n\nEven though you are very limited with the throwing when using a keyboard. Because I still don't have a controller I used a keyboard for this game and personally I found that the keyboard controls difficult to get used to, but didn't feel at a disadvantage because of the limited throwing. Apart from that the PC-Port seems fine.\n\nOverall I didn't see any major flaws with the game, it was just challenging enough, it doesn't have a perfect pacing, but cool Easter eggs, I'll recommend to people, who are looking for a challenging platformer and like to find references/Easter eggs.", "timestamp_created": 1410047642, "timestamp_updated": 1478389042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524355292320251465", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12005228": {"recommendationid": "12005228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121672382", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 702, "last_played": 1403907071}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Que decir de esta joya? el genero metroid-vania en su mas puro estado, ademas de una enchilada de risas .\n\nLastima BSO un poco repetitiva y algunos saltos de fe....", "timestamp_created": 1410041258, "timestamp_updated": 1410041258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12004105": {"recommendationid": "12004105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119233811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1388865792}, "language": "english", "review": "Mucho Gusto!", "timestamp_created": 1410034469, "timestamp_updated": 1410034469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12002616": {"recommendationid": "12002616", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961362219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1399149281}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing.

The boss levels are super difficult and require amazingly accurate timing. It also doesnt help that one hit from the final boss takes off a quarter of your health.

The influence of Super Nintendo all-time classics such as Zelda: A Link to the Past and Super Metroid are very obvious in Guacamelee. \n\nThe GOOD:\n\n- The graphics are exquisitely beautiful. The bright colors and fun-to-look-at landscapes create a very rich and visually appealing world.\n- The action is fast and smooth. You can create some crazy insane combos if you learn how to chain them correctly. It reminded me a lot of Street Fighter where, if you can execute, then you can pull off some very satisfying hurt-filled awesomeness.\n- The music is pretty sweet. It is Mexican themed and a lot of fun to listen to. I would find myself humming these tunes randomly without thinking about it. That's when you know it's done well.\n\nThe BAD:\n- Some of the platforming areas can get really difficult and will require you to have patience and good reaction times. Some people may not enjoy this part as it can get a bit frustrating.\n- It is not required, but a controller is recommended for this game. I personally completed the entire thing with a keyboard, so it's definitely not necessary to have a controller if you are comfortabe with a keyboard. Whatever you prefer.\n- I can't really think of anything bad about Guacamelee, maybe just a few things to add/improve on. Like maybe making the dojo always open so you can practice combos, little things like that.\n\nAs a side note, the boss fights can get pretty difficult. They are are all 100% patterns though and you just need to learn their visual/audio cues and how to react to them. You cannot just try to zerg the bosses, you will die. Have some patience and learn their patterns, react accordingly, and you will take them down in no time!\n\nOverall, Guacamelee is a lot of fun, very pretty, and is definitely a current era title with some influences from classic Nintento.

[/h1]\n\n[u]Positives[/u]\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - The (controller) controls are perfect, not just with its bindings, but they're responsiveness. They play a massive part in making every brawl not just enjoyable, but satisfying. \n\nThe game, although challenging in some parts, never feels unfair, even when you're choking on spinning death blades of doom for the 40th time.  To put it concisely, the game is really bloody fun. If this is all that matters to you stop right here, click buy, and fall into the Mexican wrestling dreamland that is Guacamelee. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b] - The graphics are not only undoubtedly pretty, but have a truly unique feel about them. The Mexican/Pi\u00f1ata aesthetic really helps the game feel like more than just another indie brawler. Dimension swapping in particular is fantastic. Changes in not just surroundings, but colour palette when swapping really makes the game feel special.\n \n[b]Audio[/b] - Just perfect. The way that the same musical themes are used to convey completely different tones in different areas is just superb. The slight musical sharp/flat change between dimensions is an especially nice touch. \n\n[u]Negatives[/u]\n\n[b]Writing[/b] - It's fair to say that the majority of brawlers don't rely on writing and plot to get their player through the game. Guacamelee is no exception. The plot itself is forgettable archetypical nonsense and the characters aren't all that memorable. Ordinarily, in a game that concentrates its efforts on game play above everything else, this can be forgiven. What is less forgiveable is the completely unmissable LE MEME HUMOUR plastered all over the world. \n\nThere's nothing really wrong with subtle meme humour accompanied with a wink and a nod to understanding players. Guacamelee however had less winking, more hitting you in the head with a meme frying pan whilst screaming TROLOLOLOLOLOLOL. The 'humour' went from quite funny, to groan worthy to honestly, downright embarrassing. \n\nBetween the many MANY meme posters, unimaginative move names ('Derp Derp', I mean really) and self referential, pandering 'humour', the game suffered in an area where it's genre would usually have had an easy pass. \n\n[u]Quick TL;DR conclusion[/u] \n\nHeaps of fun, solid controls, great graphics and soundtrack. The worst thing you'll have to do is suffer through unfunny memes, but really, who doesn't do that on a daily basis already?", "timestamp_created": 1407538970, "timestamp_updated": 1407539119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11607316": {"recommendationid": "11607316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002902769", "num_games_owned": 1027, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1412755108}, "language": "english", "review": "I was expecting a fun beat\u2019em all, and that\u2019s exactly what I got.\n\nThe gameplay is top notch. As you keep unlocking new powers your possibilities grow and beating enemies comes more naturally.\n\nCombat sequences are fun, even though I found the fights a bit too easy at first. But they get tougher as you approach the end of the game. Then, you unlock the Hard mode. It does get way more tougher.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting the platform sequences (bought this on a hunch), but they were pretty fun too. These get more complex and original as you gather new powers, mostly putting your timing to the test.\n\nThe power-up system is maybe the down-low of this game. It is not bad per say, just very basic. You unlock new powers when progressing through levels. These give you new movements for combat and platform sequences. You can also buy health and stamina enhancements, but there are no major powers to get there, except maybe one that makes ennemies weaker more quickly. That is it.\n\nThere are also a bunch of collectables to gather so can get more health / stamina / cash (that buys health / stamina). This may extend the durability of the game somewhat.\n\nThe nice touches are the humour, references, lightheartedness of it all, and what\u2019s best is that you can play with a friend just by plugging in a second controller (only locally though).\n\nIf you like platformy beat\u2019em alls, or beat'em-all-y platformers, I definitely recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1407538172, "timestamp_updated": 1407823567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11591202": {"recommendationid": "11591202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047473756", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 159, "last_played": 1414625048}, "language": "english", "review": "I really want to reccomend this game, it has an authentic sounding soundtrack, charming graphics, references to other video games (Castle Crashers, Team Fortress 2, Super Mario Bros. etc) and casual fun little story. BUT the controls are way too glitchy. The first combo move you learn in the game is Rooster Uppercut which is performed by pressing up and D at the same time. The problem is, the vast majority of the time you press up and D (and I'm not exageratting when I say VAST MAJORITY. It means at least 95% of the time), your character will either jump (up) or do a normal attack (d)\n\nThis wasn't much of a problem (yes it was) until I learned another combo move, this one is activated with just D\n\nNow, whenever I try to Rooster Uppercut, I'll end up doing the new move instead, which takes away a stamina block. Meaning every second time I try to Uppercut, I have to spend a couple seconds standing around doing nothing waiting for my stamina to refill itself. A couple seconds might not sound like much, but it adds up overtime.\n\n\nIncluded is a YouTube clip I recorded of this. A note: I was trying to get past this part where you need to jump into an Uppercut into a portal and then walljump a couple more times for almost 15 minutes before I begun recording. And after I ended the recording, I tried for another 45 minutes without ever getting to the other side.\n\nYes. That's an entire hour of me jumping up and down trying to perform a combo move that was as simple as pushing two buttons.\n\nAnd before all the potential angry comments come flooding in, I KNOW ABOUT MICROSOFT GHOSTING.

Junta todo lo bueno de Metroid y Castlevania, y le a\u00f1ade su humor, estilo unico y grandes dosis de jugabilidad. Un plataformas 2D para no perderselo.\n\nTu eres Juan, un campesino que sue\u00f1a con ser Luchador. Cuando te reencuentras con la hermosa hija de El Presidente, todo parece que acabar\u00e1 en una bonita cita en la celebraci\u00f3n del el d\u00eda de los muertos. Pero cuando Carlos Calaca, el guardian del inframundo aparece con sus huestes de muertos todo se va al traste. Tras raptar a la chica y matar a Juan, huye para realizar un horrible ritual y unir as\u00ed los mundos de vivos y muertos, para dominarlos a todos. Con lo que no cuenta es que Juan, vuelve de la muerte convertido en El Luchador, con el unico fin de vencer a Calaca y truncar sus planes.\n\nCon este argumento, comienza un fren\u00e9tico juego de plataformas donde la pelea, la exploraci\u00f3n y la habilidad con el mando se unen para dar un autentico juegazo de principio a fin. Conforme se va avanzando, las habilidades de Juan van incrementandose, asi como su tecnica de lucha, pudiendo acceder a nuevas zonas a las que antes no se llegaba.\n\nEl juego cuenta con un apartado grafico muy colorista, divertido y \u00fanico, muy bien ambientado. La musica es muy buena, con animados temas que dan a cada zona una gran vida. Ademas, es muy divertido ver las decenas de referencias que los escenarios esconden acerca de otros juegos, memes de Internet y mucho mas.\n\nGuacamelee recoge cosas de juegos plataformeros como Metroid, Castlevania, Soul reaver y un sistema de lucha y combos como los buenos beat\u00b4em ups de anta\u00f1o. Tiene zonas realmente desafiantes, jefes que son todo un reto y una progresi\u00f3n de dificultad perfecta, aunque en algunos momentos (sobre todo en areas secretas y desafi\u00f3s) puede llegar a ser frustrante de verdad. A eso le a\u00f1adimos decenas de secretos por encontrar y puedo asegurar que tendreis juego para rato.

This is not a beat em up or brawler or a decent platformer, this is the 2D version of the old Tomb Raider games just repacked with a different story.\n\nHere are my problems with this game:\n[list]\n[*]The combat system could have been tons better, having one key plus a direction for the specials is a bad idea (especially when one special is the key alone).\n[*] The dimensions concept while nice should not have been part of the combat. There are 2 dimensions in the game enemies from both dimensions can hit you but you can only attack those in your dimension.\n[*] There are some enemies who if you don't kill fast enough can either kill or severely damage you.\n[*] Adding to the above 3 complaints is that some enemies have a fire attack that cannot be dodged so the combat is so over the top painful and confusing.\n[*] The jumping puzzles are infuriating especially when you have to use specials to make it across (the specials don't always read right).\n[*] If you miss one of the target destinations in the jumping puzzle you start again.\n[*] There are sections where you have to climb large areas. Since you need the specials here too it's difficult to reach target platforms. If you miss and land on a lower one you have to climb from there back up. If you miss all you get transported back to the last you stood on.\n[*] In some climbing sections you have to swap dimensions as not all pieces that you can use are in the same dimension. Get hit by spikes or something and it is back to the bottom. These dimensions are there in the jumping puzzles too.\n[*] In the climbing section you can grab walls and stay in place using the grab key. The problem here is that when on a wall the grab key is to stay in place, the key + up is a wall run and the key + right is flying. So lets say there is a spot to hit and you need to stay there press grab too early and your character will try to grab in mid air instead of grabbing the wall and fall.\n[*] There is a special mask that you have to find pieces for, instead of using what few advantages the combat system has to obtain these your stuck in more jumping puzzles.\n[/list]\n\nNow that I have beaten the game and I was hoping this would give me some resemblance to the old Megaman and Megaman X games I can say I'm uninstalling this immediately. It has no replay values and I do not suggest it unless you want to remember the old Tomb Raider games that reacted late.\n\nIf you want a great platformer and brawler go play Dust: An Elysian Tail", "timestamp_created": 1405634210, "timestamp_updated": 1405634300, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11291978": {"recommendationid": "11291978", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960518163", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 467, "last_played": 1406248498}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable.

Thus he begins his quest to save his love, smash Chozo statues and kick as many skeletons, cacti and bosses to faces Cacala, a mysterious soul who has the form of a skeleton. Along the way Juan unlocks powers from the Chozo statues and some bosses. What is very cool about this game is that many of the powers translate to combat (which, as mentioned, is in a beat'em-up style), such as the [Rooster] Uppercut not only sending the enemies into the air but also giving up a lift mid-jump. Or the Dashing [Derp Derp] helping you kick multiple enemies whilst going a little bit further horizontally.\n\nYou can also change dimensions to reveal platforms or passages, or turn into a chicken to go into smaller passages. These are used for some challenging, but fun, platforming and puzzle sections.\n\nThe soundtrack is also great, mixing Latin music with some techno. And almost all songs have alternate versions, for the Light and Dark dimensions. These transition well, and the soundtrack feels relative the the setting and tone of the game, Mexican, Upbeat and overall fun.\n\nI finished the game at around 65%-70% completion, so I still had a lot to collect, and I played the game for a good 6 hours (it says 12 as my file deleted... grumble grumble...).

Another suit makes your slams really strong. And so on.

In fact once you get about halfway through the game some of the jumps and platforming tricks you have to do are a little frustratingly difficult.  With a little practice and patience (you get as many fall-off-the-screen deaths as you want), you can make it through.

Take your time and enjoy the game.  The boss fights each have their own flavor and they each seem fairly impossible at first, but then you clue in on the boss's strategy after a couple tries... almost reminds me (not really) of the old NES game Punch-Out... the bosses are HARD at first but they telegraph most of their moves and once you learn to read the tells and react... presto.  \n\nAnd oh. Make sure you have a controller for this one.  You *can* play with the keyboard... but don't do it.\n\nThe only con I can think of, is that if you're a completionist, you might throw your laptop across the room (then kick it a few times for good measure) at the Tula Tree...  that and you can't decide to marry X'tabay.
