It's just so satisfying and enjoyable to whip yourself around pull of some last minute sweet saves. \n\nThat said I think this game struggles in the level design. I LOVE the open world concept, but many times I felt that the level design of each area never really satisfied to the full potential the possibilities of this movement system. That and there are some mechanics that the game never explicitly teaches you, after solving some puzzles I would say \"how was I supposed to figure that out\" assuming I had just skipped a tutorial somewhere else in the game, even though that was the tutorial. \n\nGenerally this game surprisingly throws you out into the world and expects [I] you [/i] to be creative and figure out how the game works, while I'm generally a fan of this, I think Webbed would benefit from some of the disguised tutorials technique that Nintendo builds so well their games. This aspect never frustrated me however because of how fun the movement system was, I never was too upset to spend a little extra time swinging about, but I suspect that had it not been for that this would have been a frustrating experience, and I think that someone who doesn't groove on the move the same way I do may find this game a bit difficult and and tedious.\n\nOverall I would love to see the mechanics of Webbed pushed and explored further, maybe a \"manual\" mode that makes the swinging more difficult but with a higher skill ceiling, or a master mode that changes the gravity to be less floaty and slow. How about more time trial challenges that put your swinging precision to the test?

It's really cute, very well made, is a unique platformer game, and is a perfect casual game for people to play. There's no time limits, there's no unrealistic level completion mechanics, and you can pretty much complete the game in whichever order that you want.\n\n!!Spoilers below!!\n[spoiler]Pros:\n- Awesome love story between two jumping spiders.\n- Very cute insect characters throughout the game.\n- Unique antagonist.\n- Game physics are really great (it's more amazing that this is a Game Maker game!).\n- Amazing hidden features, which I would never have found unless my brother pointed out the locations to me.\n\nCons:\n- The webs can be a bit odd. Webs that become disconnected can show really odd kinks in the web. This applies to even connecting to a bridged web.\n- Some game features aren't really explained to you. I think I accidentally skipped a couple of mission points just because I couldn't find what they meant (Find an Ant Guide).\n- I guess the game really relies on intuitive thinking to get through a lot of sections (canopy level with all the spikes and the air channels).\n- The hidden flies are annoying. Like, you don't indicate where the flies even might be located, so there's really no indication as to where to go. If you're making Easter Eggs, then you shouldn't place required collectables in these locations without some hint as to where they are.[/spoiler]\n\nI'm happy to share my own personal pros and cons, but don't want to spoil anything else about the game. Regardless of my nit picking, I think this is a really great game.

Swinging around like a spider, crafting nets effortlessly, and the impressive physics make even basic movement an absolute blast. I often found myself spending prolonged moments simply weaving nets and swinging to and fro, an unexpectedly satisfying aspect of the gameplay.\n\nThe game's levels are a delight, with a special nod to the sections involving the ants. These segments added a unique flavor to the gameplay that I truly appreciated.\n\nUncovering secrets tucked away in various corners was an added thrill, adding an extra layer of exploration to the experience.\n\nThe open-world style of the game is a masterstroke. It fosters a sense of freedom that melds perfectly with the game's relaxing vibe.\n\nOne brilliant touch that stood out was the game's preservation of all crafted nets across the entire map. This small but thoughtful detail contributed to the overall gameplay experience.\n\nWhile the game maintained its relaxed atmosphere for the most part, the final bird levels did shift the tempo. While they were more intense, they provided an interesting contrast to the overall flow.\n\nIn the post-game phase, the ability to spend time with your spider boyfriend or even take them along on adventures is a charming addition that left a smile on my face.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Webbed\" weaves an enchanting web of relaxation, fun, and surprises.

They layer 2d pixel sprite to give them a 3d feel and it works 100%\n\nSound - This is my least favorite part of the game. Music and sound effects are good, but there are quite a few moments where you have the awkward silence from no music at that moment.\n\nStory - Very simple but works very nicely! It's a simple \"recuse the princess\" story but this game is an example why that is a timeless trope. Befriend your neighbors and take of the evil bird!\n\nGameplay - I LOVE IT! I love the web swinging gameplay. Puzzles are simple enough you don't need a walkthrough, but will make you think, especially with the physics.

Why are there physics puzzles that have nothing to do with movement in the game?\n\nI'm not a fan of the laser; I don't think it should exist, actually. I found it very frustrating to grind my progress to a halt to finagle the physics engine with very limited manipulation ability. I had to resort to moving most of the physics objects with my laser, which felt imprecise and gimmicky compared to swinging effortlessly in other parts of the map.\n\nAlso, the escort mission introducing the finale of the game really slowed my playthrough to a crawl. I'm escorting a spider? They are also a spider; why can't they swing after me? Why can't they jump? What could have been a tense moment of the game just ended up being a chore for me.\n\nDon't let this frustration keep you from trying this game out, though.

Beyond that, it's very free form and you can go at your own pace and not have to worry about inventory or having to restart too often.

There's really no other game like this and it quite a unique and fun experience. \n\nThere was a developer's note or something along those lines that I read somewhere that part of the goal is to make spiders seem friendly and more approachable. Unfortunately design-wise that only applied to the peacock spider main duo and every other spider (besides the wolf spider babies, those are so cute and I wish there was a sticker toggle to have them on you like they do with their mom) still freaks me out a bit despite not being scared of spiders.

story with nothing interesting to it, since they're spiders, I expected the ending to have the spider you play as eat her boyfriend alive, but that just didn't happen which was really really

[/h1]\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b]\nWebbed is a cute, fun, and innovative platformer that is able to accurately translate the movement of a spider into a playable game, creating one of the most unique movement systems I\u2019ve experienced in a 2D platformer, but sadly this unique system is held back by many mundane and avoidable design flaws. \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Review:[/b]\n\nAs an (almost) official zoologist, and self-professed invertebrate lover, webbed had a lot to offer me. Although 2D platformers have always and will always be my least favourite gameplay genre, I couldn\u2019t pass up on the ability to play as a spider and interact with other bugs. In this regard, webbed is an overwhelming success: Webbed\u2019s movement is an ingenious combination of blistering swinging and grappling, meticulous bridge placement and the overwhelming feeling that \u2013 for the most part \u2013 touching the ground is optional. A little rule of thumb I have for judging 2D platformer movement is to watch how speedruns play out, and sure enough the webbed any% is as dizzying as it is impressive. Discovering the wonderful depth of Webbed\u2019s gameplay systems is like tripping into a roadside puddle and discovering an ocean. \n\nSadly, the way the rest of Webbed is set up really doesn\u2019t always allow for this gameplay to shine, and in fact, sometimes it feels like the game wasn\u2019t designed around incarnating a spider at all: An inordinate amount of this game expects you to move around heavy objects (notably the infuriatingly bad [spoiler]ant nest[/spoiler] level), sometimes requiring you to meticulously position the object in a location out of your reach. This is a baffling design choice in a game where the main character doesn\u2019t even have fingers, let alone opposable thumbs, and whose closest ability to a \u201cpick up\u201d button is the ability to violently drag an object across level ground. Outside of the frustrating object manipulation sections, webbed has other baffling design decisions: the game\u2019s default cursor, which is more often than not flicked around the screen at high speeds, is a tiny white thing, smaller than a baby spider, that sometimes takes seconds of scrutiny to find, killing the pace of the game. The camera is also awfully stubborn, and a lot of my initial attempts at fast movement were hindered as I was forced to guess where the \u201cwebbable\u201d surfaces were. With all of these issues, Webbed stands as a bizarre dichotomy where the engine and mechanics feel completely set up for intense speed, yet the levels feel often designed around precision and scrutiny. Keep in mind with this criticism that this is less a case of a ruined game, and more a case of an incredible amount of wasted potential. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad, though. Some of Webbed\u2019s mechanics sucked, but just as many were smash hits. The section near the end of the game, for example, presented some really unique ideas and made use of parts of webbed I\u2019d always just assumed were gimmicks. Finally, as an environmental science guy, I have to hand it to the developers for putting so much effort in to making an all-too hated group of animals seem so chill. I was impressed with the commitment to make anatomically correct insect designs somehow look cute, and how the game manages to constantly remain wholesome while filled with the sort of creatures we normally impulsively kill running around onscreen. The game made the ingenious choice of copying hollow knight, and using people to voice the insects speaking, which successfully manages to trick us into relating more with the otherwise alien cast of characters. If anything, webbed has hopefully saved the lives of a few hundred spiders, moths, ants and bees, and for that, it has earned my respect. \n \n[h1]4/6[/h1]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/GentleHoovy/recommended/][b]More of my reviews here![/b][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1683657583, "timestamp_updated": 1683715267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138024259": {"recommendationid": "138024259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174772278", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 554, "last_played": 1684085008}, "language": "english", "review": "spder", "timestamp_created": 1683591279, "timestamp_updated": 1683591279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138023770": {"recommendationid": "138023770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105902653", "num_games_owned": 488, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1683505635}, "language": "english", "review": "I now want to dance with every spider I see.\n\nThis game is beyond adorable, and the web swinging feels great.

You\u2019ll need the help of different insects inhabiting the surrounding forest, leading you to visit three different areas in order to convince them of your cause. Each of these areas is made up mostly of platforming challenges, sprinkling in some minor puzzles you\u2019ll have to solve using your abilities. Overall, all areas felt fair, with each one focussing on a different aspect of the game, making them quite distinct along with their different designs.\n\nThe game sometimes feels a bit unfair, when death pits or surfaces you\u2019re meant to grapple lie outside the screen. However, given the quick respawns at well distributed checkpoints, this wasn\u2019t a big issue. Some mechanics the game introduces later on also weren\u2019t immediately obvious to me, but worked fine once I noticed their existence.\n\nBeing that you are a spider, said abilities include placing webs in order to connect two points for you to walk between. You can also shoot a thread and use it like a grappling hook, allowing you to swing around. No matter the method, movement feels wonderful, being responsive and fluid while looking physically accurate. Surfaces you can place webs on are often limited, forcing you to get creative with your abilities in order to progress. Your spider can of course also shoot lasers from her eyes, in order to remove webs or different obstacles.\n\nThe light narrative is there mostly to guide you through the game, but features rather enjoyable dialogue for the characters you encounter. There are also some side quests, mostly tasking you with finding different collectibles. These, along with some secrets strewn around the map, give some nice incentive for exploring and revisiting areas. Fulfilling most tasks also rewards different spider designs as well as hats for you to equip.\n\nWebbed uses a great looking pixel-perfect art style and features decent music, which even adjusts somewhat, depending on what you\u2019re doing. The game also offers many accessibility options, including settings to replace the spider graphics, remove decorations and adjust the depth of field effect. I also noticed that depending on the game language selected, the title displayed in the menu changes to a (as far as I can tell) creatively localized one, which I found to be a neat little detail.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nAll in all, Webbed was a lot of fun for me, mostly because of the great feeling movement system and the wholesome vibe the game gives off.

This game keeps the realism of the bugs while also somehow making them really cute, even all the spiders are adorable.\nThe grapple webbing is definitely the most fun part of this game. Flinging around like spiderman felt so cool and satisfying, especially when you're going really fast and get a lot of air time.\nThe music is also great. I liked all the tracks and I would totally listen to the soundtrack on my own time. Although I feel some tracks felt too short or didn't change much so they got really grating to listen to (But this was probably more of a problem towards how unintentionally long some sections took and not really a fault of the music itself.)\n\nNow... on to the bad stuff...\nMoving around heavy items was not fun at all and it made it really hard to tell what the heck you're even supposed to do. What didn't help was placing the webs felt very inconsistent as they kept sticking to spots that I wasn't aiming for. This would be that big of a problem for me if it wasn't for all of the [b]gosh dang physics puzzles![/b] I was expecting the game to be more about the grappling gameplay, but most of the time it's just janky physic puzzles! The ant's area is the most prominent example of this, as there are so many different objects to put in the right place, and you need to do this over and over again though the whole ant's nest! It was so, so tiring...\nAnother problem I have with the game is it's length. I feel it's too short, as the main story can be quickly completed in under 2-3 hours, and 100% it will only take one extra hour with a guide. The parts that took me the longest was just struggling to move objects to the places they needed to go.\n\nI really wish I could recommend it, as it looks great and playing as a spider was really fun, but its just not worth it with what it offers. I came in with quite high expectations,most because of the overwhelmingly positive score, but it disappointed me greatly. But perhaps that was my fault.\nIf you still want to play it, go for it I guess, as I would still say there are many things that are fun about this game. But in the end, I personally don't think its really worth it.\n\np.s.

However, while Unmechanical was artsy and depressing, Webbed has a far higher degree of levity and beauty in it.\nIn addition to the now standard features of modern side scrolling platform games of simulating weight of objects, the main new mechanic of Webbed is simulating tension of strings of web. Each web connecting two objects has a degree of tension on it, and joining one web to another or changing the position of the object makes the tension change. It leads to some interesting puzzles, like how best to life a heavy object, and deciding where best to connect the points too.\nThe game feels extremely polished, like many hours of play testing was done to get it working just right. I've found that puzzle games are especially difficult to get right because there's not really a way to scale difficulty like in other games, so the puzzles must meet the fine line between frustrating and boring for the average person. Portal 1 and 2 did that, which is one of the main draws of those games, and I'm happy to say that in my experience, Webbed got the mix perfect. There were many parts of the game that were hard, and once or twice bordered on frustration. However, the physics engine meant that there were often multiple ways to solve any task in the game, so getting past any point meant thinking logically and figuring out what might work well in each particular situation. I'm also happy to say that not once was I forced to give up and check a walkthrough, and even the hardest puzzles in the game give subtle environmental clues as to how to solve them, so I was able to work through them all and pat myself on the back when I finally found a solution that worked.\nAlso of note for this game was the interesting setting. The game has creatures with a level of anthropomorphism I can closest relate to The Wind in the Willows. The creatures are physically very similar to their real life counterparts, just with human thoughts and feelings, and a universal animal language. The dung beetles acted mostly like dung beetles, and the bees mostly like bees. The ants, however, have created a dieselpunk level of societal complexity, and their underground colony has electricity, plumbing, and a working forge, meaning they have a full grasp of metallurgy. Your character meets them right after they have repelled a fire ant attack and suffered damage to the colony, and their colony feels suitably broken, dangerous, and claustrophobic. Also of note is the Sky Bower, which isn't just a simple bird's nest, but is a huge imposing fortress studded with magical blue gems that are neutrally buoyant in the air and can make stick doors open and close. These two examples particularly show how the setting uses real animals as the starting point, but this is most certainly a fantasy game, and real life concerns take a back seat to an interesting setting and fun gameplay elements. In particular, in addition to relatively grounded abilities like the ability to shoot unlimited webs and to direct shot webs to connect two distant points, the game gives your spider the ability to shoot energy bolt \"lasers\" out of her eyes. This is 100% fantasy, but it works from a gameplay perspective, because the energy bolts allows you as a player to precisely sever web strands when they no longer are useful, as well as break through obstacles, and to push things with the blast. It's a stroke of genius that they were included, because the game might have worked without them, but it would have been a slower more frustrating experience if the eye blasts were changed to something more realistic, like requiring to be near a web to sever it. \nAll told, this is an excellent game, and I finished it in about 8 hours or so. It has very smooth, polished gameplay, good music, interesting setting, and top-notch, beautiful pixel art.\n", "timestamp_created": 1681044136, "timestamp_updated": 1681044136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136390600": {"recommendationid": "136390600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109902202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1681017212}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game", "timestamp_created": 1681017177, "timestamp_updated": 1681017177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136359869": {"recommendationid": "136359869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161324733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1681547621}, "language": "english", "review": "gg", "timestamp_created": 1680975760, "timestamp_updated": 1680975760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136305510": {"recommendationid": "136305510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868438624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1683412636}, "language": "spanish", "review": "graficos 10/10 lore 10/10 desarrolo de personaje 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1680911544, "timestamp_updated": 1680911544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136238548": {"recommendationid": "136238548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025151529", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 455, "last_played": 1681955768}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely delightful! \n\n+ The way you move by zipping along by shooting out webs is extremely fun, on its own.\n+ There are really good platforming challenges. \n+ Bugs are cute, apparently?!\n+ Collectible hunting is fun.

Charming, cute, stylized to hell, and very easy and fun to look at. I've probably spent a solid 2% of my playtime just messing around with the [strike] hat machine (and yes, you get to wear cute little hats) [/strike]. The environments are clearly distinct through a combination of foreground and background textures that easily distinguish areas from one another. This is especially nice considering how it easy it would've been to make all forested areas look the exact same, so kudos to the devs for creating a fun and dynamic environment with continuity, originality, and plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe writing. Not something you'd fully expect for a game like this, but Webbed has its fair share of characters, big and small. Dialogue is anything but filler, and whether it's solving problems for them or just meeting up with them to see if they have something new to say in each scenario, I look forward to speaking with them. The dialogue is very genuine, characters have a distinct personality in how they speak, and I actually found myself getting attached to all of them and think fondly of them.\n\nAh yes, the gameplay. Probably the defining characteristic for most games, and Webbed does not disappoint. Where some games with interesting control schemes are designed to be frustrating and unforgiving, Webbed is incredibly accessible, and yet the skill ceiling is higher than you'd think. It feels fantastic to shoot webs, attach them to other objects, and string up a slew of connections to accomplish whatever your heart desires. Movement is absolutely fantastic, and through mastering the swinging mechanic exploration and completion become leagues easier as you fly from screen to screen. The \"gimick\" sections where movement is changed are a breath of fresh air, often challenging, and greatly contribute to the environment. The best example being the section where it changes up the movement by having you navigate through a bunch of un-webbable surfaces with a tiny leaf that you hold onto and use like a paraglider through winds and thorns. [/strike] Moments like these contribute to the atmosphere of being a little spider having to navigate through often whimsically dangerous circumstances, and overcoming these obstacles is done beautifully, with progress mattering as you get to that next checkpoint.\n\nOverall, it's a great game. My only real criticism is I wish there was more to explore in the form of DLC, but when all you want is more of a game that you've 100%'ed, that speaks volumes to its quality. But yeah, for $10?

And it was easy enough to get all achievements in one sitting, so my completionist self can be happy for a week. It's a very short game with a very childish story to accompany it- not that it's bad, just that I would probably enjoy it more if I were still 8 years old. That doesn't really matter much at all, actually, since its got plenty of visual charm to make up for it. Jumping spiders are very cute and pixelated jumping spiders are somewhat cuter... maybe because I'm scared of the real deal?\n\nThe only thing that I really got to complain about is the mouse pointer, that made shooting webs and swinging about less fun that it could've been, and can get frustrating at parts. Instead of letting me simply click where I wanted to shoot a web and showing me where I could or could not, the game take the position of the mouse relative to the spider and points as far as it can in that direction, even if it's way outside of the web's range. This scheme seems much more fitting to a console controller and not to a mouse. This issue is somewhat mitigated by the game checking if there are multiple surfaces in the same vector, and deciding where to shoot depending on the distance of the pointer. This works suboptimally.\n\nWith all thiat said, I recommend Webbed to anyone wanting to enjoy a nice, fun and cutesy family friendly game.\nAlso I think the ants are communists?", "timestamp_created": 1673068246, "timestamp_updated": 1673068246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530572950839996338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130302371": {"recommendationid": "130302371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044764835", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1672942299}, "language": "english", "review": "A great and charming fun little metroidvania game with a small, simple yet fun set of mechanics to toy with.

Hard to put down.\n\nGraphics: 10/10. No words needed. Just stunning honestly.\nPhysics: 9/10. It is amazing to swing around and build webs. The main complaint is how difficult it is to pull things and put them in place\nStoryline: 8/10. The storyline itself is amazing. I have no complaints there honestly. The main issue is how short it is.\nSide storylines: 9/10. I only wish there were more.\nAccessible UI: 10/10. No complaints there. Very smooth and easy to use.\nTutorial: 10/10. Once again, no complaints. Easy to understand.\nControls: 10/10. The settings allow near perfect control over the keybinds so you really don't have to worry about that too much. Very smooth.\nAccessible Map: 9/10. The only issue is the Sky Bower. Once you've been there you can't go back. Sad.\nFinal score: 9.38.\n\nThis is definitely one of my favorite games yet. The physics are amazing and so smooth. The graphics are just *mwa* chef's kiss, and the storytelling is also just immaculate. The collectible stickers are also very fun. Not going to spoil anything for new players, but some of them are kind of hilariously gamebreaking (iykyk). The colored spiderwebs from the collectible spider stickers are also really cool. There aren't many complaints I have about this game at all. The main thing that I dislike is the fairly short storyline. The only real other things I have a problem with are the lack of post-storyline features. Sure there are side quests etc., but I completed those before I even finished the game, and there is a notable lack of things to do UNLESS you are like me and love making spiderweb art lol.

Absolutely brimming with charm and just a delight to play.\n\nThe web mechanics are fun, unique, and intuitive, although fine aiming can sometimes be a bit of a struggle and I'm not quite sure why. The cross-hair just seems to go wherever it wants when it should be fairly easy to just fire the web where I'm aiming.\n\nI wasn't expecting the movement to be so heavily momentum based and it was a nice surprise, you can build up an incredible amount of speed swinging around, it's loads of fun, and the environment is well suited to it. I had so much fun with the swinging I forgot you could just bridge around with webs for most of the game. And it's kindof cool that you can just choose which one you prefer to use. My one complaint with the movement is that you can't crawl on walls, and much like the wierdness with the cross-hair I'm not quite sure why. It wouldn't significantly effect the difficulty of the game, you can crawl vertically on webs so the animation is there, and the boyfriend spider as well as the ants seem perfectly capable of doing it. I would understand ceilings might be a bit of a limitation but I don't see why we just can't stick to walls.\n\nMoving objects with webs feels a bit weak. Moving things where you want them often takes 10-20 webs and it can get pretty tedious dragging your mouse back and forth over and over again to preform a simple task. Although it does pad out the play time and for this game that's not necessarily a negative. It certainly looks more web like that way which I suppose is the point. One thing I wish you could do is anchor a web to yourself so you can drag objects around with you while being able to shoot webs at the same time, but it's also fun to work around that limitation.\n\nThe way the game is animated kinda makes it feel like a very low stakes rain world and I'm all for it.\n\nOverall, my few nit picks aside, the game is an absolute joy to play and I'd highly recommend it to anyone.", "timestamp_created": 1666309370, "timestamp_updated": 1666309485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124135354": {"recommendationid": "124135354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972559216", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2443, "last_played": 1698879882}, "language": "english", "review": "The end is so hard to help people go fast and use your webs to help.", "timestamp_created": 1666308731, "timestamp_updated": 1666311039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124133159": {"recommendationid": "124133159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081314481", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 369, "last_played": 1664837745}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute little game", "timestamp_created": 1666304119, "timestamp_updated": 1666304119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124108979": {"recommendationid": "124108979", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122727192", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 652, "last_played": 1690793337}, "language": "english", "review": "fun\n", "timestamp_created": 1666264813, "timestamp_updated": 1666264813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124098634": {"recommendationid": "124098634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298844863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1645674040}, "language": "english", "review": "A cute little Spider has to save their Boyfriend from the wrath of Bird.

The visuals are gorgeous, and the animations all interact with the world excellently (very important when you're crawling over objects). The soundtrack isn't expansive but it is a great vibe, gives each region a special feel, and it varies the instruments in the tune as you explore different areas within a region so it doesn't get too samey.\n\nThe gameplay is super fun. Figuring out how to solve puzzles efficiently is satisfying. Getting big fast web swings just right and whizzing around the scenery feels incredible. The controls (playing on controller) are executed well, and I especially appreciate the \"precision mode\" aiming (toggles the right stick from aiming a direction to moving a cursor to aim at - great for the puzzles). The challenge level feels just right - the levels can be quite deadly, but are mostly very forgiving with checkpoints, and while high-skill players can speed through things, casual players can slowly build webs to bridge their way through (which persist forever - saves on tedium re-traversing areas you've been through already).\n\nThe story is simple but sweet and enough to drive the game. It's not a large game, but the pacing of the story and the puzzles all feels about right. I don't think the game would be better if it was just bigger and longer. I do appreciate that they made exactly this game perfectly, rather than compromising on some things to add \"more features\" as is the trend these days. \n\nBut also I would 100% buy an expansion or level pack that brought some new mechanics. A level editor and Steam Workshop support would be killer and give this game some replay value. I would love to play more Webbed, but as it is, re-solving the same puzzles isn't all that exciting.", "timestamp_created": 1664286832, "timestamp_updated": 1664287475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

I'm really on the fence about whether or not to recommend it. It's clear that a lot of love has been put into this game, especially in its gorgeous artwork and animations. But that lovingly crafted artwork is let down by the game design, which is mixed at best.\n\nThere are some enjoyable parts--the web-slinging feels really good, like a 2D version of the Spider-Man games, except you're playing as an actual spider. I like the mechanic of attaching to a leaf and using it as a glider. I think the movement abilities in this game could have made for a really fun and challenging platformer a l\u00e0 [i]Celeste[/i] or [i]Super Meat Boy[/i], but that potential is mostly unrealized. I'm not sure if this was a deliberate decision to appeal to a more casual audience, or a lack of confidence in level design skills, but it's an unfortunate choice because what we get instead are a lot of tedious, finicky physics puzzles. Actually, calling them puzzles is a bit too generous, because it's always obvious what you need to do; the only challenge is in finding the right way to web things together to get them into the position you need (usually by spamming webs over and over until the objects are pulled together.) The ant quests in particular were extremely unfun and almost caused me to quit the game entirely before I got to the better parts.\n\nIf you can slog your way through the annoying physics puzzles, then [i]Webbed[/i] might be worth playing for the fun movement abilities, beautiful visuals, and cute insects. (Personally, I love jumping spiders, but it seems that even people who don't like spiders can enjoy this game. A few reviewers even claim that it cured their aracnophobia, which is great!) But I certainly wouldn't recommend it at full price, and even on sale, I struggle to decide whether the fun parts were worth the tedium and frustration of the ant quests.\n\nI'd love to see the developers make a sequel to [i]Webbed[/i] that focuses more on movement and platforming and much less on physics puzzles. If that ever happens, I'll play it for sure. But I can't recommend the game as it exists today.\n\nPS: [spoiler]I knew Australia had some crazy animals, but it's news to me that their jumping spiders can shoot lasers![/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1662969791, "timestamp_updated": 1662969791, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578548014163970947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122129140": {"recommendationid": "122129140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004579592", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1662966300}, "language": "english", "review": "You ever wonder what it's like to be a spider and save your boyfriend?

You go out on an adventure to save your \"boyfriend\" from a mean bird who stole him away from you.\n\nPuzzles and movement, or controls in general, are a little bit underwhelming and occasionally frustrating due to how webbing in this game works. Which is ironic.\n\nThe general gameplay is iffy, and the fact your spider can't even climb on vertical surfaces feels more like a nuisance than a conscious decision to make some puzzles feel more \"challenging\". Speaking of, the only reason some of the puzzles in this game are difficult is because the game lacks some pretty darn essential controls that would otherwise make this a cake walk. Instead you're trying to figure out a theoratical physics degree in webbing in order to get a god damn cog into a slot.\n\nWebbing, as a form of traversal and momentum, feels downright satisfying to use and I'd go so far as comparing it to the Spider-Man game that just came out on PC; there's enough weight to it that it really makes you feel like you're gaining momentum, but this game rarely ever capitalizes on it and you're mostly restricted to short hops and confusing and aggravating puzzle solving.\n\nInteracting with other insects feels a little odd and breaks the pacing for me. Changing from a cute spider game where you solve puzzles in order to get your lover back (which sounds an awful lot like reverse Meatboy if you ask me), to a cute spider game where literally everybody needs your help is on par with Stray's idea of a story; a creature that has no business doing all the things it does but does it anyway for plot consistencies.\n\nAll this is not accounting for the otherwise incredible art direction this game has. It's very pretty and adorable and every area feels unique in its own way, and I have to give credit to the creators for that, but a game that looks good doesn't necessarily mean the game plays good.\n\nI'd like to recommend this game because it's cute and all, but I can't excuse mediocre controls in favor of confusing game design.", "timestamp_created": 1662923788, "timestamp_updated": 1662923788, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532733261585235596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122087036": {"recommendationid": "122087036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350739272", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1668593238}, "language": "english", "review": "hehe web swing so fun", "timestamp_created": 1662899775, "timestamp_updated": 1662899775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122075541": {"recommendationid": "122075541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820328650", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 369, "last_played": 1662882315}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost a year after release I finally decided to play Webbed and holy crap I cannot recommend this game enough!!

Too many tedious and long chores.\n\nI have some sort of implicit rule when I play games, which is \"don't continue playing it if you're not ENJOYING it\" and I found myself not enjoying the game 20 minutes in. Mobility and platforming is quite good, visually the game is stunning also. The only problem that every task you encounter is unnecesarily long and tedious.\n\nI won't refund the game just because I can understand the effort that was put in to making it, however it completely

The gameplay feels smooth, the music is enjoyable, the characters are cute, and the game makes the characters' lives feel important.  It is fun.  How many games today can you say that about?\nHowever, some of the challenges and achievements are needlessly difficult.  If I want to 100% this game, it is going to require a lot more than 7 hours.  A LOT more, in fact.  Currently, I am trying to grind two of them in just one region.  There are three regions to grind in, and I mean GRIND!  That being said, the grind is pleasant for now...\nThe community is friendly enough, though they and I noticed some unfortunate bugs.  Note: pay attention to which side you fasten the mandibles to.  Failing to fasten them correctly can break your save file.  Developers have not fixed, despite easy solution of preventing the mandibles from fitting on to the one side at all.\nAnother note: I made my airship with serious sustain.  It was ingenious.  I found a way to carry all the fuel.  Turns out you're only allowed to hold one of them, and they make a totally new airship when you pick it up.  I cannot pimp my ride.  If there is a next time (and there likely will be for that relatively (possibly) easy achievement) I am NOT pimping my ride.  Not worth the effort.\nOtherwise, it is a fun game.", "timestamp_created": 1661978113, "timestamp_updated": 1661978113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121528167": {"recommendationid": "121528167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330252267", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1670619947}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo", "timestamp_created": 1661958692, "timestamp_updated": 1661958692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121521257": {"recommendationid": "121521257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043464328", "num_games_owned": 644, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1632720979}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\nIf you don't like this game you are objectively a bad person\nratio +mald +cope", "timestamp_created": 1661948960, "timestamp_updated": 1661948960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121517147": {"recommendationid": "121517147", "author": {"steamid": "76561199233998746", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 767, "last_played": 1684427609}, "language": "english", "review": "I replayed this game as soon as I finished it, it's simply adorable and fun to experience.

The web shooting mechanic is nice but if you've played Pixel Junk Eden, you've seen this type of thing before. The spider animation is first rate as are many other creatures. At about 2 hours and 5 minutes into the game I got to the point where you have multiple paths to choose from and it soon becomes clear that they don't really care if you ever get out of this area. That's a problem for me with this type of game. I'm talking about games that aren't linear, games that require you to go to one area then another and then back to the original because now something has opened up. Somehow you're just supposed to know that things that weren't there now are there. This is fine if its done skillfully but usually it isn't. You can just wander back and forth for a long time eating fiddle heads and drinking out of muddy puddles. It isn't enjoyable. You're lost. The devs think this is gameplay. https://paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/12/04/a-lost-palo-alto-couple-a-miraculous-rescue-heres-what-happened-to-ian-irwin-and-carol-kiparsky\n\n Now I have to watch youtube videos. Usually its some stupid thing I've missed. I can proceed, but soon I'll come up on the problem again. They'll want you to go back somewhere but they won't tell you where. They also want you to feel stupid if you complain because everybody else is happy. Millenials won't admit they're lost because then all their friends on social media will harass them til the end of time for being stupid. I almost forgot, when you watch the youtube videos you won't be able to turn off the insipid music that lets you never forget that this is a happy, pretty world. \n\nI'll tell you how smart they are. I'm typing this into a space that's about 11 inches long, but it's in a box that's only 8 inches wide for no reason at all. This is a 27 inch monitor. They could have made the box in the box bigger, but they don't know how to do that. And they think I'm an idiot. \n\nThe moral of the game is that spiders are wonderful so long as they're cute. This spider is super helpful, helping ants and whatever for no reason and the ants think she's an ant. Like ants are that idiotic. Girl spiders are wonderful. They can never be horrible predators like all males are. We won't call them men because they are such XXXX that we won't even use that word men. Its not like in real life the females eat the men sometimes. We won't cover that. All this subtle anti men, anti ugly, ordinary spider stuff is being taught in this cutesy masterpiece. \n\nWhat I'd rather have is something I can progress through. I'd rather have maps that show me things, that help me navigate.  This is something that goes way back to Thief which had awful maps. The original Doom had maps that were helpful. I think operation flashpoint also had some maps that I enjoyed, but most maps in games make you think, \"Why did they even bother?\". \n\nOf course the reason why they give you a crummy map and have you revisit areas you've already done is that it hides the fact that it isn't a very big world. They're lazy and cheap and the game doesn't cost much. Can't spend much on creating a huge world if you're going to take that money home. \"Yea, but I deserve that money. I'm the guy that came up with the idea of dots on the map that you have to mouse over to get info.\"\n\nIt was awful writing this on this box that doesn't fit the tiny box on the screen.", "timestamp_created": 1660829288, "timestamp_updated": 1660830835, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.382861942052841187", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120809525": {"recommendationid": "120809525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272141583", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1660781942}, "language": "english", "review": "a cute, fun game that feels responsive and has fun mechanics\n\ni personally couldn't finish it (or get very far, actually) as i'm severely arachnophobic, and while the main character isn't a problem, the collectible baby spiders are. i really really wish there was a way to disable them without turning on arachnophobic mode, which just makes the game feel... incomplete?", "timestamp_created": 1660782037, "timestamp_updated": 1660782037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129016876220703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120752752": {"recommendationid": "120752752", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199806347", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 541, "last_played": 1665257091}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best game! good for young childs and really fun", "timestamp_created": 1660688475, "timestamp_updated": 1660688475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120716626": {"recommendationid": "120716626", "author": {"steamid": "76561199130055561", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1696141457}, "language": "english", "review": "haha funny spider go zip", "timestamp_created": 1660637086, "timestamp_updated": 1660637086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120708132": {"recommendationid": "120708132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011767666", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 269, "last_played": 1660616579}, "language": "english", "review": "A short and sweet platformer where you play as a spider.

The premise was appealing and the traversal and physics hooked me in the beginning. After completing the game, I don't think this game had enough legs -- spiders excluded -- to carry this game. Specifically, the novelty of its mechanics, like web spinning and swinging, didn't have enough unique scenarios to make them shine like they deserve. I made it through the whole game despite my gripes.\n\nPositives first: [b]character design[/b]. They got a lot of love from the art team. They made bugs that both looked accurate to their real world counterparts and pleasant to look at in their pixel-style. [b] Second [/b], web spinning. You can definitely just goof off making webs because it's easy to do. This seems to be where the majority of work was spent to make these systems work. Even if it's a little quirky, it works as advertised and I'd like to see more of this physics-based gameplay in other titles. I only wish there were more camera options to see swing-able objects in the environment, especially above and below you. And last, [b] the dancing [/b]. Broadly though, the game is easy-going. You can get in a groove while swinging and spinning. Checkpoints are abound, though disorienting at times. You'll always be quickly back in action when a death occurs. \n\n[b] The less than positives [/b]: No combat is fine, good even for a game like this. More atmospheric, and less intense. I get it. Some parts of the game, though, just felt empty is all. In its place, the puzzles/physics/world were the focus instead. The three main zones of the world, to me, were far too long and similar to one another. Long corridors with no discernible landmarks and out of view branches/walls to grapple onto were the norm. Cut the long bouts of climbing in half, and nothing is really lost. A shortened game, but tighter overall. [b] Then we get to the puzzles [/b]: lots of awkward object manipulation mixed with climbing + shooting webs in the air. The physics, again, work but they almost work against you as you try to navigate world objects. Some puzzles even have soft-locking potential which is no bueno. No in-game reset button means this is capable of ending people's run before they even get started. \n\nWebbed made for an above average experience that, without any major incidents, I'd recommend.

It has all sorts of fun moving parts that make it a sweet game that I do recommend.\nThe game, running at $10, isn't exactly steep or overpriced, but it took me about 4 hours to beat the full game.
