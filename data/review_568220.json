I did regain my courage and try again at some point, though, and I'm very glad I did!\n\nThis game is stressful, but in an enticing way. The missions and dealing with abnormalities as a whole can be extremely tough, but for the most part, feel quite rewarding. It can sometimes punish you for getting too attached to your employees, which is not something I am usually fond of, but I think in a game like this, it only adds to the experience instead of taking anything away.\n\nThe overarching story of the game is interesting, but I feel like it shines most in the lore of every individual abnormality. Each of their stories are uniquely thrilling and horrifying, and it honestly does make trying to complete the codex very enjoyable. The art style and character designs are quite nice, but once again, I feel like the abnormalities (mostly) take the cake with their unique and terrifying designs.\n\nOverall, I think the game is pretty neat :)", "timestamp_created": 1700738511, "timestamp_updated": 1700738511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

(MAGICAL GIRL FUCK OFF)\nDespite only getting to day 19, the story is really good,\nThat's all I have to say about the story.\nThe gameplay can sometimes be like \"take all employee and supress abnormality.\", but sometimes you have to put strategy into what E.G.O gifts some should have, the weapons, the suits, and the strength ening and promoting of employees.\nDifficulty can vary to easy to restarting back to day 1, so overall it has a nice range of difficulty.\nMy final score: 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1699112800, "timestamp_updated": 1699239232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149497417": {"recommendationid": "149497417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010827889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 3097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1055, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1699793328}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Dwarf Fortress but you're running the SCP Foundation.

I should have reset to day one the moment I got D-01-106 at day 12, as noon or dusk events would inevitably kill clerks which would inevitably release the bitch who would then kill everyone. We were too weak then to fight back.\n\nAnd, and yet, somehow, I persisted. I ascended. I rushed execution bullets. Starting waiting for clerks to overlap so I could take out 3 or so at once. Would spend the first few qliphoth levels spamming bullets just so I could clear out all the clerks. Once they were gone, then the true day could begin. By day 35 I had trauma-bonded with my nuggets and refused to let any of them die, and we were past fearing what a mere army could do. Memory reposited more times I could count in order to 100% the abno records without having to do a full reset, and to do the \"boss\" missions without losing an employee. It was madness. It was unhealthy. I should have just let them all die.\n\nWhat did I do it for? What hollow satisfaction? When I spent two hours in the winning attempt battling T-03-46 with a single surviving employee I knew in my heart that once this challenge was conquered there was nothing left but to reposit one last time and then finally take on the end game. By god, I did it. But I was empty. What left did I have to live for?  My friend told me there was a sequel. With tears in my eyes, I realised maybe it didn't have to be the end.\n\nBut then, as I examined the steam store page, horror filled me, greater than hearing the popping buzz of a bee or the drop of second trumpet ever could, greater than hearing \"I love you\" repeating in an eerie childish timbre. \n\nThe sequel is a card game.  :(\n\nOtherwise game is amazing, 12/10, do give it a try!!!

The energy, denoted 'Enkephalin/PE boxes', results from the interaction between your agents and eldritch creatures called abnormalities.

Your main progression comes from the gear you acquire from the abnormalities you work with and the missions you complete that are given to you from your subordinates. Another part of the game comes from training your agents, your agents gains stats depending on the danger level of the abnormality, the damage they receive and how successful their work is(how many PE boxed they produce). You are going to be resetting a lot, which also resets the stats of your agents, so it takes less priority until you collect enough gear and complete the missions.\n\nLobotomy Corporation is a long-winded journey that rewards you with great lore that piques your interest, including very memorable characters that are sure to leave a mark on you.

The game isn't mechanically diverse or complex enough to really differentiate days from each other in the same way that other roguelikes like Binding of Isaac do, and the management aspect of the game becomes very simple once you've trial and error'ed your way through the different monsters' traits.  \n\nIt ends up being very repetitive, especially given how long days end up getting near the end. There are various boss fights and random combat events to spice up each day, but the combat feels too clunky for those to be enjoyable, at least for me.\n\nA lot of this is personal preference however, and ultimately I don't hate the game.

I don't think it's fun that the fanbase wants everyone to look up the wikipedia. That takes me out of the game. I like to [i]discover[/i] how things work, but everything here just feels cheap, unfinished, and full of padding.\nAdditionally, I feel like this game is wasting my time. You are encouraged to play perfectly, or reset days, and there are plenty of possibilities that you can get stuck rerolling the dice on whether something dangerous is going to break out and kill everyone, the further you go. If you don't play to an A or S rating, you WILL get stuck, eventually. Plus, the vague epitaphs of the SCPs you unlock are rarely clear on what danger grade they are. You can't even see it until you unlock enough information on them, which is only available after working with them, which is only available after many resets of trial and error. This is [i]why[/i] fans direct newcomers to the wiki, but it's just bad design.\nI've seen a post in the forum complaining how the game is too easy, and they're on Day 19. \nFirst off, the more SCPs you get, the more likely you'll get harder ones.\nSecondly, I got to Day 17, and have at least two world ending difficulty SCPs in my facility that make it nearly impossible to manage. At this point, I'd have an easier time if I restarted to Day 1, but again, that's just not fun. The story wouldn't change, considering that it's a visual novel narrative, unlocked by progressing missions for each department.\nYeah, definite thumbs down. As cool as the concept is, and as much as it hurts to say this, Lobotomy Corporation is just a bad game.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI'd give this a mixed button if it existed.\nI want to give this game a thumbs up, but its \"Gotcha!\" mechanics piss me off. There'll be a lot of stuff you can only do through trial and error, and while some of that is fine, there's so much of the game that is pure trial and error. The problem is, when all is going well, the end of the day goes to hell, where you had no warning on what was about to happen. This forces you to restart entire game days, or lose your items and advantage for future runs. If employee deaths were less punishing, this wouldn't be so bad, and further encourage exploration without resetting the day. However, Lobotomy Corporation encourages resets. Lame.\nSome elements of the UI are cumbersome. There's unnecessary headache.\nAll this said, the story is great so far. The concept is interesting. I just think the execution of gameplay is sub-par.\n[strike]Additionally, this game does not save after every day, so you can't just play it in short sessions. You have to put an hour or two of your time in every game, or leave the game open.[/strike]\nIMPORTANT: Sometimes the save system works, and sometimes it doesn't. It might be more consistent by going back to the menu at the beginning of a day.

"playtime_at_review": 1007, "last_played": 1698421188}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]All of Project Moon's games have excellent ideas, but poor execution.[/h1]\n\nLobotomy Corp. and LoR both suffer from extreme mechanic bloat, poor pacing, frustrating mechanics, pointless grinding, and a complete lack of elegance. It really is a shame, because they're also some of the most interesting and creative games that I've ever played.\n\n[h2]Bloated Mechanics[/h2]\nThere are so many different ideas, it feels like the game is going all over the place. Both games feel absolutely overwhelming when starting out, unless you spend the time to read everything. Usually, this isn't a problem, but both games introduce many mechanics, often without a proper tutorial. There are many mechanics that are one-offs, or entirely redundant. LoR is especially guilty of this, introducing a new Keyword almost every new invitation in the mid-game, and not adding any useful support pages for existing Keywords. Lobotomy Corp isn't free from this either, as the novelty of adding a new anomaly to your facility wears off after you collect enough boxes to fully understand how to manage them (usually before the day even ends).\n\n[h1]Poor Pacing & Pointless Grinding[/h2]\nIt's no secret that Project Moon games have poor pacing, with sharp difficulty spikes. Again, this usually isn't an issue with most games. I spent 4 hours learning all of Margit's attack patterns in Elden Ring, because I decided to rush through the game as a low level wretch. Even if it was difficult, beating him was immensely rewarding because I could feel myself getting better as time passed. In both Lobotomy Corp. and LoR, most problems can be solved if you spend enough time on it. If you want to play efficiently, both games get boring very quickly. In Lobotomy Corp, there are multiple situations in which you can hard lock yourself into losing the game and you lose about 2 hours of progress because of it. Not only that, but you really have the option to grind for E.G.O gifts and boxes if you want to unlock everything by the next day. I want to be managing my anomalies, not waiting for drops when I know there's no risk involved. Still, this pales in comparison to LoR's book system. Even after multiple revisions, it's still incredibly grindy. The decision to not have all of the pages unlock once you beat an invitation is absolutely awful from a design perspective. The game is already quite long for an indie title, and adding in grinding heavily takes away from the experience. It only serves to slow the gameplay down, so you're not absolutely overwhelmed by the next new crazy mechanic that's just right around the corner. It gets even worse when we get to the bosses. Boss fights can take up to an hour, and you're rewarded with nowhere near the number of books that you need to actually get all of the useful cards that you want. It's a massive grindy time sink for literally no reason. The [spoiler]Purple Tear[/spoiler] pretty much made me quit LoR because of the amount of time I would need to spend grinding in order to beat the next invitations.\n\n[h1]Frustrating Mechanics & Lack of Elegance[/h1]\nThis is probably my biggest issue with Project Moon's games. The amount of time you spend not playing the game usually exceeds the amount of time you're actually doing stuff. This is a shame, because the stuff that you would be doing if you were just playing the game is usually quite interesting. Having individual decks for all of the Librarians is interesting, until you realise how much time you just spent creating 15 decks so you can beat the next invitation in LoR (of which I can usually beat first try). To a lesser extent, this is also visible in Lobotomy Corp., as every single agent has their own resistances and you need to pay attention what goes where, depending on the abnormalities they're going to be working. If you want to win, it's a whole bunch of reading, and not a lot of playing.\n\nI just want to say that I really love both games. I love the world, I love the music, I love the ideas in both games, but they have so many issues which make it impossible to recommend them. There are so many roadblocks put in place for you to just not enjoy the game, which wouldn't have a harmful effect on the game if they were removed. You're punished by playing optimally, because it just ends up in optimising all of the fun out of the game. It's a known meme that LoR players don't know how to read, but perhaps they're better off that way - they have less to think about, and would rather think it's all decided by dice rolls.\n",

concept that is horribly horribly botched in execution. \n\nThere are so many tiny things that pile up to make the experience worse. \nThe performance is TERRIBLE\nTons of information is needlessly hidden, forcing you to either repeat the same operations over and over through trial and error or endlessly consult the wiki (I did the latter and am very glad I did)\nThe balance is all over the place, and is generally very unfair and hits you with a bevy of cheap tricks that aren't communicated to the player well\n\nThe good is there though. The story is excellent, the setting is fascinating, the characters are super interesting and get a ton of depth. The soundtrack while limited and repetitive over 100+ hours, is REALLY good, and the setup for the sequel is amazing. \n\nI can't in good faith recommend playing this game to anyone, but I am very glad that I played it if only because it'll make me enjoy playing Library of Ruina (a good game) a hundred times more\n\nNever pick the train", "timestamp_created": 1695242632, "timestamp_updated": 1695242632, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48539656400680542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146625336": {"recommendationid": "146625336", "author": {"steamid": "76561199277960506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 969, "last_played": 1698204308}, "language": "english", "review": "fun but difficult only play if you wont rage.", "timestamp_created": 1695178615, "timestamp_updated": 1695178615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523615658283233643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146621150": {"recommendationid": "146621150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107976838", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4277, "last_played": 1697338507}, "language": "english", "review": "This MAY be the most stressful game I have ever played \ud83d\ude30", "timestamp_created": 1695171651, "timestamp_updated": 1695171651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523615658283233643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146591013": {"recommendationid": "146591013", "author": {"steamid": "76561199528781655", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4718, "last_played": 1699447041}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want a difficult game, go for this.

The game will get easier and you'll get further into the story, because when you're provided with a list of abnormalities to add to your facility each day, you will know how to handle them and the lethal combinations the game will try to bait you into. \n\nVery good game and story, but will drive you crazy.

And that's like, 50 at a time.\n\nIts incredibly hard. But its also really rewarding once you know what you're doing.\n\nThe translation especially for the abnormality texts is really off. Its charming, but kind of hard to understand whats going on for quite a few of them, or maybe I'm just illiterate.\n\nAnd once the energy cap required for day end increases into the hundreds it can get pretty boring, especially on repeat playthroughs which is needed for completion as its a soft-roguelike.\n\nThe art style is cute and simple but I kind of wish it was a bit more disturbing or less restrictive for the abnormalities in particular, cause the horror isn't really there for most of them, at least in my opinion.\n\nThe story is really interesting and engaging, but it being locked behind tons of incredibly hard challenges is a bit annoying, I can imagine its worse for people who aren't too used to management games or extreme difficulty in general.\n\nIts good, especially for a studios first game.

Despite putting over 70 hours into this game and making careful preparations for every day, my dumb small brain cant seem to fucking remember fairy festival's \"fun\" little quirk. those green bastards have a higher kill count than every abnormality I have combined. 10/10 would forget again. \n\nOn a serious note, I love this game through hell and back, this game has taught me how expendable your little nuggets are and not to be attached even if they were your first nuggets. I myself would reset if even a single agent died, but as days passed and time went on, I ignored their deaths, I did get very frustrated at myself, but in the end I simply moved on with the day and replaced them quite instantly. The more departments you open, you will inevitably gain more abnormalities and even more employees, that means more things to keep track of and even more of your nuggets will die eventually from either a higher class abnormality breaking out or even from your own fuck ups. In the end, everyone you see in the facility is expendable, able to be replaced easily, you may even find yourself in more frustration from losing the aleph gear the agent had.

It is both frustrating and rewarding to play blind. It will literally destroy your mental and physical health. I've left a positive review, however I really would not recommend playing this game unless you're an experienced gamer without AHDH who is good at optimization and willing to whip out the wiki after a couple days in.\n\nIf you're trying to play this game to prepare for Library of Ruina but you're a casual gamer, give it a whirl on sale for 10-20 in-game days but, for your sake, watch a story video on youtube for the rest, or just read a synopsis. The true ending/epilogue is Not possible to do for most gamers for these reasons:\n[spoiler]\n- There will be Bosses that hard punish you for Pausing the game, which is a fundamental mechanic for not losing your mind keeping track of all the abnormalities you need to keep in check\n- You will randomly forget one of the 50 \"If you break this rule your Agent simply dies\" abnormalities in your massive base\n- Each day will get exponentially longer as you have more Agents, more facility levels, more abnormalities, and higher quotas to fulfill, AND there is no save state/quick save for the game so you could for example lose 2+ hours of work for a single day (multiple times) because of one random screw up you forgot about and have to start it all over, with different RNG\n- And all this aside, the game is simply just hard. You HAVE to optimize or else you will fall behind. You can start a new run with some things that you've earned but idk, who has that kind of time (a complete run will take you 70-100 hours allegedly)\n[/spoiler]\n\ntldr: Wait for sale, go in blind (but open up guides and wiki once you feel mentally stressed), and stop and watch youtube / read a synopsis after you hit a wall.

It's fun to see the monster designs, they make you wonder what they're capable of.\n\nSadly the gameplay loop is barebones and punishes the player for playing the game without providing any significant decisions to make.\n\nLosing high level characters is basically the fail state of the game, it slows down the progression to a halt and you have to start the day, or the last 5 days over again. \n\nThis game has no such thing as \"playing well\". Doing everything right means that you don't die and there's no way to gain a sense of momentum. The rewards are passive equipment and stat upgrades. \nYou gain nothing special, and when you lose what you have you won't even feel an ounce of regret or sadness, but the stifling obligation to start over.\n\nThe arbitrary stat types (Instinct, Sanity, Temperance, Justice) are obscure and have no effect on gameplay or your playing style other than dealing different colors of damage and taking care of different colors of monsters in a rock-paper-scissors way. Being better at something barely changes the way a character plays. The way you approach a creature is nearly always the same. This is a game of 4 categories and lacks any meaningful mechanics.\n\nThis is like a base management game without any base building. No planning involved at all.\nThe combat is as shallow as an idle game minus the fun skills and unique equipment.\n\nThe events that happen randomly have no relevance to the creatures you contain in your facility. The monsters that spawn during an event, unlike your monsters, won't give you any information about how you deal with them. So it is not even trial and error but pure luck and confusion at that point.\n\nThere isn't any real reason to have multiple monsters other than the fact that the game forces you to do so. Otherwise you can just generate energy from a single one, they're basically cows that you have to milk and all they give you is the same milk. Although each monster visually has very distinctive features, this doesn't reflect into the gameplay. Your characters don't recieve their powers, don't gain experience from taking care of a type of entity. They don't specialize, they mean nothing to the player.\n\nThere is really not much point exploring this game. I can't see why you wouldn't just open a wiki page and play it that way.

Pirate this game, don't buy it.\n\nBad game, painful to pay. I'm a masochist.\n\nNo but real talk. This game scratches that SCP urge that the lack of SCP based games leave inside you. If I were to talk about the positives I'd be here for days so I'll just list a few negatives:\n\n* One of the most prominent negatives you will read about the game is the way music is handled. TL;DR, there are states called trumpet states, which essentially let's you know how fucked your facility is currently. Here comes the issue. Ideally, you want to keep the trumpet level low, but that means you will listen to the exact same 1:30 loop of \"neutral\" music. Even if you reach first trumpet, the music takes ages to build up and by the time it does, you already dealt with the issue or you are off to second trumpet.\n\n* Handling employees. While initially (first 20 or so days) it's, fine, the game quickly starts throwing stuff at you that requires the utmost perfect micro to not lose half your facility. Issue is, if you have two employees overlapping with eachother or an enemy, you will not be able to individually select those employees, only the top one. This is an issue when most ordeals do aoe damage and require half an army to take down. Multiple times I lost employees unnecessarily because I couldn't micro them (or even see their healths) in the middle of combat, which is a bit frustrating. (I also lost an entire save file to this issue while dealing with my first Dusk ordeal)\n\n* Upgrades. The first 12 or so upgrades are very questionable. You are literally unlocking basic Quality of Life features like seeing your employees' current health or what type of damage is being dealt to who under the name of \"upgrades\". It's only after fully decking out the Information Department that you kinda start unlocking actual upgrades and after day 20 that you start unlocking the good stuff. It took me 30 hours to get to the good upgrades by the way (heavy skill issue I guess).\n\n* Researching new abnormalities. While this issue is very early game, it's still kinda frustrating. You are supposed to not know anything about a new abnormality, essentially forcing you to gamble with your employees. Oh what's this, my employee died and also made the abnormality breach with a single work because you have zero idea if that work is the ideal one or not? Skill issue, time to restart the day. If you want to play the game optimally, you either suffer or play wikipedia simulator, which is lame. Later when you have high level employees, this issue goes away partially, but it's still not fun to realise that an abnormality instantly kills your employee and breaks out if you do one specific work that you didn't know.\n\n* Bugs. Some abnormalities just straight up don't work. Specific example: SO CUTE!!! Everytime she breaches, she ends up running in place making it trivial to supress.\n\nFrom reading this it must look like I hate this game but consider that I have these few negatives in a sea of positives and I still love the game and I can see myself reaching the 100 hours mark in no time.", "timestamp_created": 1690110551, "timestamp_updated": 1690396334, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496781975030899048", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142633145": {"recommendationid": "142633145", "author": {"steamid": "76561199426081707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 5487, "last_played": 1699914978}, "language": "spanish", "review": "el sufrimiento hecho juego, lo amo.", "timestamp_created": 1690104647, "timestamp_updated": 1690104647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142613840": {"recommendationid": "142613840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865125014", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 4894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3878, "last_played": 1696907726}, "language": "english", "review": "torture", "timestamp_created": 1690071462, "timestamp_updated": 1690071462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142599600": {"recommendationid": "142599600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360939764", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1022, "playtime_at_review": 1225, "last_played": 1700525162}, "language": "english", "review": "netzach", "timestamp_created": 1690051903, "timestamp_updated": 1690051903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142596161": {"recommendationid": "142596161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165160012", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 15767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5781, "last_played": 1699307901}, "language": "english", "review": "Kafka warned us about this, didn't he?

You will even come to find that certain basic game mechanics that you absolutely took for granted have turned out not to be a right, but a [i]privilege[/i] (here's looking at you, Atziluth residents).\n\nThe experience can seem punishing and unforgiving. The roguelite mechanic is integral to progressing past seemingly impossible roadblocks. Whether you activate the \"memory repository\" and rewind to the beginning of a week, or restart completely from Day 1, your facility and employees will be reverted/wiped, but the gear you have bought and information you have learned will remain intact. Sometimes, the only way to overcome the game's challenges is to reset and return with more experience in mind and better armaments in hand.\n\nPersonally, what pushed me to power through all of the trials and tribulations the game has to offer was its intriguing story. With every cutscene, you are left to piece together the past and ruminate on the future lying ahead for everyone involved with the corporation. There is a glimmer of hope hidden underneath all of the chilling, depressing, and forlorn moments in the plot. The way it ties into the gameplay at times does make you feel that you are \"facing the fear\" to \"build the future\" (ha ha). Your own experiences managing the facility can also end up as entertaining anecdotes; you will certainly find several in other reviews.\n\nLobotomy Corporation is certainly not for everyone. It is a game of trial and error, of accepting your failure, and of persevering in search of the light at the end of the tunnel. Those who are not fans of management games may find the basic gameplay loop to be boring. Those who hate trial and error may find the virtually-necessary resetting to be tedious and overly grindy. Those who dislike stories that are vague and metaphorical may find the plot to be overly convoluted, drawn-out, or outright confusing. And anyone can be a victim of the game's programming, which can be... jank at times (memory leaks are a commonly reported issue). For what it's worth, I was able to complete the game with almost no issues, but your mileage may vary.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys glory through struggle as well as management games, then give Lobotomy Corporation a whirl (I recommend going in blind). You will likely quickly come to learn whether you love it or hate it.", "timestamp_created": 1689310351, "timestamp_updated": 1689310401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142031277": {"recommendationid": "142031277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800030773", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 8886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 437, "playtime_at_review": 7141, "last_played": 1700696969}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Yo bro I thought you said you'd be online last night what happened?\"\n\nMe at 4:28 AM tweaking off the 37 benadryl:", "timestamp_created": 1689302219, "timestamp_updated": 1689302219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142000774": {"recommendationid": "142000774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200683111", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 7570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1698312278}, "language": "english", "review": "my loyal employee archer was killed by a stupid fucking bracelet my mind has never shifted once from revenge", "timestamp_created": 1689268698, "timestamp_updated": 1689268698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141972824": {"recommendationid": "141972824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250777144", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1206, "last_played": 1690996171}, "language": "english", "review": "Gacha The Game", "timestamp_created": 1689239333, "timestamp_updated": 1689239333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141956760": {"recommendationid": "141956760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153164774", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 6308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6308, "last_played": 1682992194}, "language": "english", "review": "\u3000GOD\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\uff0f\uff1e\u3000\u3000\u30d5\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000| \u3000_\u3000 _ l\n\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\uff0f` \u30df\uff3fx\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 /\u3000 \u30fd\u3000\u3000 \uff89\n\u3000 \u3000 \u2502\u3000\u3000|\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000\uff0f\uffe3|\u3000\u3000 |\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000| (\uffe3\u30fd\uff3f_\u30fd_)__)\n\u3000\uff3c\u4e8c\u3064\n", "timestamp_created": 1689216162, "timestamp_updated": 1689216184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496917188167572021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141954839": {"recommendationid": "141954839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216438953", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1697858257}, "language": "english", "review": "Difficulty spike is vertical they said", "timestamp_created": 1689213704, "timestamp_updated": 1689213704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141947074": {"recommendationid": "141947074", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122327276", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9737, "last_played": 1693894124}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful.

He was right, I did like IP a lot better after this game, but I will say full stop that if someone got you into this game cause the PM lore is amazing and you should get into it, get off this steam page and go watch a story recap. This game is not worth only the story if you can't get through the gameplay.\n\nThe game is a management sim, and some give it the title of roguelike because of the mechanic to restart to checkpoints or the whole game with your acquired information. You manage monsters with 4 types of work and occasionally they break out. This work is required because the game is divided into days that need an energy quota from that same work each day. Progressively, the quota and the risk of the monsters you handle increases. There's a small equipment system, and that's it. That's the whole game.\n\nThis game at face value is all about information. If you look things up, the experience will be spoiled drastically, as the mystery of figuring out what you have to deal with be it monster or otherwise is an exhilarating feeling. However, playing blind is also grueling because you end up throwing bodies to figure out exactly what you have to deal with, or you get blindsided midday and have to reset 30 minutes of progress. People that moan about the difficulty of Project Moon games are exaggerating, but this game isn't easy. The last few hurdles the game puts you through are challenging, and many people get stumped at the last stretch. If you know everything that is contained in your facility, by all means you have every right to handle anything that the game throws at you.\n\nIf you don't enjoy RTS games or at least the kind of gameplay that comes with them, don't play this game.\nIf you don't want to spend hours upon hours retreading days of progress, don't play this game.\nIf you don't like problem solving or strategizing with the bullshit this game sends your way, don't play this game.\nThis game is only worth it if you want to personally earn and learn the lore of Lobotomy Corporation.\n\nFor that specific reason, this game is definitely worth it, or maybe consider it on sale.\nThe few gripes I do have:\nReplaying days is boring and a waste of time once you get far enough and reset, it's just speedrunning to the end of each day without the action to action planning you might have done the first time around.\nThe game isn't designed to be beaten in one go, and you should know that before you play.\nThings like [spoiler] WhiteNight and Apocalypse Bird [/spoiler] are completely optional and can be missed if a player is ignorant or simply skilled/lucky enough. No clue if there should have been things hinting at them or their consequences.\n[spoiler] The fucking idiots that designed the last two departments need to be fired.

Yes. It is a game about trying, essentially, to trip up the player. It's a rube-goldberg machine of carefully calculated dick moves. There's an evergrowing list of rules with each abnormality you get: some very simple, others frustratingly complicated, but there is a list for each. For any rule, there is an abnormality with the exact opposite rule: some will punish you on Bad results, others on Bad or Neutral. Some will punish you on [i]only[/i] Neutral, some on Good or Bad results. The game will generously keep track of these rules as you discover them, but you are drawn endlessly into the web. You will get comfortable with these rules in time, but just as you get comfortable the game will begin to alter the deal, and your prayers that it not be altered further will fall on deaf ears. \"Is it hard?\" You know in being a Korean game it reminds me a lot of Starcraft and the Korean fascination with that: Starcraft is desperately hard, but if you know what to do, and can perfectly execute it, it's easy. If you can't, well, you'll endure. Restarting and Resetting are major game mechanics without which the game cannot actually be completed (literally it is not possible to complete the game in one run without at least one memory reset).\n\nIs it interesting? [i]Desperately.[/i] The story told by Lobotomy Corporation is one I very much enjoy and one that draws you, the player, in as the participate. There aren't choices to make though; rather, the only choices are the ones you come up with to meet the challenges. For the game weaves the story and the difficulty together, as you, the Manager of this strange facility, desperately try to comprehend what it is that you are doing here and why.\n\nYou will come to love your agents, you will suit them up in a variety of colorful equipment, and you will send them to their horrible deaths over and over and over. Decapitated, eaten alive, flattened like a pancake, ripping off their own head, dragged to hell, digested by spiders, turned *into* an interdimensional spider, turning into a giant mushroom, turned into a small slime, turned into a large slime, vaporized, pulverized, incinerated, frozen, ground into meat chunks, killed by their fellow agents after they lost their minds and had to be put down, executed with impunity by the manager... and this is not even nearly close to the many deaths you will see them suffer. You will reset and do it again. The charmingly horrible deaths are a balm of sorts: I remember a desperately frustrating death, but watching the individual in question lower themselves into a bath full of blood and grimly deciding I needed to keep going with the day is part of the experience.\n\nThis game can be clunky, it's not exceptionally polished, there are infrequent graphical glitches and a few bugs that I had to go and install mods for (it's not necessary to do so, but I wanted to). This game will not be an easy experience, but if you are willing to Face the Fear, and Build the Future, you will enjoy it. I think that this game is [u]unrelenting[/u], and absolutely uncompromising, but slowly bending it to your will until you stand at the end over a pile of corpses and regrets in bloody triumph is one hell of an experience and one I am so glad I decided to play.\n\n[i]Dedicated to Hana, Architecture Team Captain, alongside the other 11 agents killed on Day 49.

If you like SCP related games you'll love this game. Lobotomy Corp. also builds the foundation and atmosphere for ProjectMoon's other titles, Library of Ruina and Limbus Company. ProjectMoon goes HAM on the lore aspects and soundtrack of the game.\n\nContent advisory. This game touches on many dark themes and topics such as suicide/murder/drug use.\n\nPros : \n\nThe world ProjectMoon has created with it's 3 games is nothing short of incredible. Multiple story arcs and endings give Lobotomy Corporation good replay value. Well worth the $8.50 USD sale price.\n\nThe OST for this game is an absolute banger. Whether or not your little homies are getting eviscerated or you're watching a dialogue intermission about how one of your empathetic decisions caused the massacre of everyone in an entire sector, the music does an amazing job at setting the tone.\n\nCreate your little guys and try to keep them alive... I promise you, you wont. But then again, you can always restart the day... Or turn back time... In a world where nothing is seemingly impossible due to monsters(Abnormalities) born from the sins of mankind, you're always within arm's length of a different possible outcome. However, the price is almost always too great.\n\nThe monster management is fun and pretty unique. Every abnormality has it's do's and don't's. One of them likes peeking out from a keyhole and is a little shy. If you watch him, he'll breach and turn your employees into a bloody mist with his sawblades. But if you pan the camera away so he's off-screen he's completely docile. Each new subject is rather fascinating in it's own unique way.\n\nStrategy is key with management and suppression tactics. The E.G.O equipment researched from abnormalities acts as sort-of a rock-paper-scissors mechanic to exploit weaknesses as well as protecting your \"little guys.\" More sectors opens up more perks for employees and containment cells for abnormalities. After later sectors open you'll have access to direct intervention via \"bullets\" you can shoot employees and abnormalities with which can buff, heal, or kill. Then there's the Rabbit Protocol... for when the big F-U is neccesary.\n\nCheck out the Manga, Wonder Lab, which ties into the lore of Lob Corp. Trust me they go hard on the lore and this manga is pretty damn good.\n\nAlso check out the [ Limbus Company ] Official Promotion Video. The OST track from Mili - In Hell we Live, Lament Feat. Kihow from Myth and Roid goes hard.\n\nOh yeah...

I 100% the game myself, had I not had someone who previously finished the game twice be willing to get me back to a certain point after losing over a weeks' worth of progress, I would've put this game down and never looked back.\nThere's plenty of cool things to experience throughout the game, buts its difficulty being as it is, I'd call it ultimately as being just short of a masterpiece. the amount of whats there being designed solely to waste your time and piss you off is genuinely unnecessary.\nI'll say it a million times as a quick side note for the devs going forward, taking away the players ability to pause the game or adjust the game speed is not a challenge. its inconvenient more than anything.\n\nsome frustrating features aren't even based around playing the day to day game. when you mess up or want to try again, you can hit a simple retry button and get all your stuff back you lost at no penalty should you do it.\nHowever theres also an option to go back in time a couple of days in case you really got stuck. for whatever reason, using this option in order to try again will punish you, but the normal retry wont. If you hit retry, then on the prep screen proceed to go back in time a couple days anyways, no punishment occurs. So I ask, why does it matter what screen you hit memory deposit on? one punishes you but the other doesn't I'd like consistency. \n\noccasionally too, glitches occur. there's not many, and most you'll encounter are simply visual hiccups that aren't too distracting such the game text switching to korean for a single, very specific screen. the one's that are a bit a more irritating to get, put you in bad situation.\nexamples of this include:\n-characters being put to sleep but an entity known as void dream have a chance of just not being able to be interacted with. Meaning, because the character is still bearing the \"uncontrollable\" status ailment, proceeding to the next day will count as them being killed.\n-end game bosses messing up when transitioning to their final phases, and just being softlocked. taking no damage, not moving, you're just stuck at the final hurdle.\n-using skill points in increments of 60+ (yes, you will do that in this games economy) occasionally have the tendency to just not give you the buffs after spending them\n \nShould you hit any of these pitfalls yourself and put the game down, I do recommend at least looking up the story online. if theres anything this game absolutely crushes, its the writing. Sound design is a good second.

One, the sound design is poorly balanced and sounds really really bad in a few key areas (looking at you red dawn). Two, the gameplay is very repetitive and also has a very bad case of savescumitis, which only worsens as the game progresses to the point that I really don't recommend to anyone to commit to finishing it. And finally, a lot of aspects of the gameplay, in particular the difficulty are quite CBT and not in the fun \u2018throw yourself against a problem until you figure it out\u2019 way.\n\n\tOn the other hand, the game is incredibly creative, interesting and above all UNIQUE. In my opinion video games are at their best when they do things that other games dont do, and to do that one must take risks and potentially fail. Lobotomy corporation took a risk and for the most part didn\u2019t quite stick the landing. It still made something memorable and hopefully the concept of an esoteric monster facility management sim can be taken and iterated upon by another developer with more technical skill and time.\n\n\tLet me go over the flaws again before I dig into some particularly interesting concepts and design decisions I like. The sound is atrociously balanced. Some sounds are too quiet or nonexistent (there should be audible feedback for employee deaths besides the sounds of their various kills, like how Frostpunk has a church bell that rings once for every death. If you\u2019re not focused directly on an employee when they die, there is no way to tell besides the toast on the left hand side of the screen, and if they\u2019re a clerk you get no notification at all!), and some sounds are way too loud! The sounds for the different fixed events, that being the dawns, noons, dusks, and midnights are much too loud and earrapey. Some idle sounds of monsters are also too loud, namely Nothing There (which like, I understand being that Nothing There is supposed to be very threatening, but they dont need to be that loud to do that!) but also a few others. That said the sounds themselves are usually just\u2026 fine. Some stand out goods, some stand out bads, but mostly everything is just how it should sound and nothing more. \n\tI dont really need to go too far into the game\u2019s bad case of savescumitis, just that its there and it is a lethal case. Thankfully the game does give you quite a few ways to save over and reset from your mistakes, but I feel this is more of a bandage for a wider problem of unforgiving gameplay rather than a positive. \n\tAnd as for that difficulty, oh god. Losing anyone is a HUGE negative due to the time cost involved in getting each employee even up to snuff. This really overlaps with darkest dungeon where employees are supposed to be disposable and you\u2019re not supposed to get attatched, but conversely to that goal, employees are very very expensive to train. Even with all of the bonuses you can unlock to improve employee training speed (one of which requires a quite difficult boss!) it can still take a good 30 or so REAL TIME MINUTES at max speed to fully train ONE employee in ONE in game day. And that entire time you are generating risk of death, and micromanaging to avert the risk of that employee dying, or worse. You can multitask and train more than one employee at once, but there aren't that many abnormalities in the game that are good for training employees, and no gym or equivalent slow training. All employees MUST be live trained at ALL times. You can spend your employee points to strengthen the employee's stats but it's very expensive and really not worth it. So you spend a ton of time on each employee so that you can have a base of workers and warriors that isn't muppets\u2026 and then you get blue midnight or some shit and they all die instantly because you didn't pause the game the instant that you sent Urist McUseless to go train on One Sin. And then you reset the day. Hence the bad case of savescumitis. \n\n\tBut what\u2019s really good about this game? Well, its fucking cool. All of the monsters feel esoteric, weird and interesting and it's super fun to learn how they tick and how you can incorporate what they do into your gameplay loop. I\u2019d go into examples but that kinda takes away from the fun of it all, and plus I\u2019d be restating what you could easily read on the wiki if you actually care.\n\tThe story is also a highlight, being a pretty interesting concept although not the best written. The characters are fun and interesting, there\u2019s an element of mystery and also quite a bit of that sweet sweet ludonarrative harmony (*gags*). Lots of the themes in the game and how frustrating it can feel is mirrored in the gameplay, and vice versa. Elements of the gameplay are integrated well into the story, such as the cognition filter explaining why the game looks the way it does. (Which also is incorporated into a cool abnormality! If you know, you know.)\n\tThe old testament theming of the game is also quite interesting and unexpected for a game like this. The first abnormality you get in the game kicks off this theme, and is iterated upon by the most threatening one. The characters are themed after biblical (angels? I don\u2019t know much about this. Might be more jewish rather than christian as well.) and it's well implemented. The story also goes into this in interesting directions, in particular the themes of suffering and original sin being mirrored in gameplay somewhat. The theming of this game is original, intentional, and tightly woven into the experience. Very well done.\n\n\tSpeaking of, by far my favorite part of the game is the warning level. If you fuck up in some way, either by letting an abnormality loose or having employees die, the warning level increases which plays BANGER MUSIC and also has some minor gameplay effects. For the most part, the warning level is a gameplay way to signal to the player how messed up the facility is and also cause a snowball effect of failure. I don\u2019t like the snowball factor that much, but it is in the end interesting which is the end goal of any game. \n\n\t\n\tSo yeah, kind of a messy review. I really can\u2019t say I recommend picking up this game off of steam. If it was free, I\u2019d say it has interesting ideas that are worth experiencing, but if you want a game from this company of a similar or higher quality level that's actually worth your time and money, I\u2019d more recommend Library of Ruina\u2026 even though I despise it and everything it stands for due to it being a Turn-based RPG card game deck builder. \n\n\tOverall, here are my generalized scores that arent really relevant to anything but my own general thoughts on the game. Don\u2019t compare these to scores from other people or even myself on other games. \n\n\tPersonal scores: (Overall about a 7-8.5 that fluctuates depending on how cool i think nothing there is that day)\n\t\tFun: 6/10 dwarf fortress does CBT better\n\t\tAutism-ility: 8.5/10 was my hyperfixation for a while \n\t\tAesthetics: 7.5/10 accurate corporate hellscape \n\n\tSomewhat objective scores: (Worse than the sum of its parts due to its overall low budget and poor usage of that budget. About a 4 overall)\n\t\tSound design: 4/10 red dawn.\n\t\tGame Feel: 5.5/10 aggressively mediocre but buggy. Commanding an army of goobers is never not satisfying but it toes the line in this game due to how janky combat is.\n\t\tGame performance: 3/10 holy fuck how do you fuck this up that bad\n\t\tWriting: 8/10 story stuff is fine but the stuff that's hidden in flavor text is great\n\t\tHorror score: 8/10 can be actually spooky at times\n\t\tArt: 7/10 has a style and is just\u2026 fine. Game looks bad. \n\t\tThe grind: 2/10 is real. And bad. \n\t\tTheming: 8.5/10 Goes for something particular and nails it even though it's not that fun of an idea.", "timestamp_created": 1687661210, "timestamp_updated": 1687661210, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484652668237686157", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140629899": {"recommendationid": "140629899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399738091", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 15233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14745, "last_played": 1697516672}, "language": "english", "review": "FUCK HOKMA", "timestamp_created": 1687631483, "timestamp_updated": 1687631483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140626386": {"recommendationid": "140626386", "author": {"steamid": "76561199012027851", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1684267670}, "language": "english", "review": "just play fortnite", "timestamp_created": 1687626995, "timestamp_updated": 1687626995, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.360149681568145752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140584532": {"recommendationid": "140584532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135037947", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11021, "last_played": 1692143188}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely difficult, but very enjoyable. \nThe story and OST make up for the intense grind needed to achieve the true ending. \nVery much looking forward to playing the sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1687564894, "timestamp_updated": 1687564894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140581819": {"recommendationid": "140581819", "author": {"steamid": "76561199467968302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1682130607}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego de simulaci\u00f3n del estilo mas caracter\u00edstico al universo scp es muy divertido y \u00fanico, es una experiencia agradable de jugar y sumamente recomendado si te va el tema de criaturas/objetos sumamente peligrosos metidos en una instalaci\u00f3n ;)", "timestamp_created": 1687560391, "timestamp_updated": 1687560391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140572727": {"recommendationid": "140572727", "author": {"steamid": "76561199174367016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1691974929}, "language": "english", "review": "Lobotomy corporation a game where repressing your problems can work. \n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1687549957, "timestamp_updated": 1687549957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140565999": {"recommendationid": "140565999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098115723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2532, "last_played": 1687843052}, "language": "english", "review": "Lets start off by saying that this is a pretty niche game and is definitely not for everyone.

Where they discover monsters, ghosts, and supernatural beings and then they experiment on them? Yeah, this is that. You play as a manager and you manage your employees by placing them in a cell with a supernatural being called \"Anomalies\". You place them in a cell and pray to god that the monster is in a good enough mood so they don't either rip your employees head from their shoulders, make your employee kill themselves, or make your employee kill others. \n\nEvery monster has a \"catch\" or gimmick that you have to discover and then follow in order to keep your employees safe and make it to the next day (level). Every day you get a new monster, so the real trick is to juggle as many gimmicks as you can so you can make it to the next day without any casualties. \n\nThere is definitely a learning curve and it is true that the game gets easier the more runs you do.

Though here instead of escaping a compromised facility we're playing the manager and command agents around to perform work (end result being energy production for which we have meet the quota every day). As you can imagine this kind of operation can go horribly wrong in many ways...and oh boy it sure does. Every single Abnormality is dangerous in some way and it gets ever crazier with each new day as our department expands getting new additions. We can either go through trial end error to get necessary research on each \"subject\" to manage them properly or try to check the wiki online, although that doesn't guarantee escaping dire consequences of sometimes merely having some Abnormalities in the facility. To make things more tense we will be attacked by random Abnormalities just entering the facility on daily basis so we will have to focus on more than our own containment chambers.\nI presume it's part of the appeal that we will face a lot of failure, will have to restart a day or whole 5-day period to perhaps select more manageable Abnormalities. I can tell we can either focus on our agents to keep them high level and well equipped or just keep hiring new lambs to slaughter in containment chamber as, in the end, produced energy is all that matters (or does it?). Even though things roll out very slowly and consistently it will become overwhelming for someone not very into this idea of Management Sim and certainly feel grindy given we are always doing the same thing but more with extra strings and chances of things going apocalyptic attached each time. \n\nI haven't made it that far myself given as it turned it's a bit too much for me but there is some truly deep lore in here. Story is certainly a great focus in here and upon looking it up I have no doubts about it. Between each day we have visual-novel style of dialogue with various AI's helping in the facility, always keeping the creepy and uncertain tone of this entire operation. It sure is to keep the player on their toes at all times.\n\nSadly I can't say more given it's not as for me as I thought but if it seems it might be for you I say go try it. I can totally see what it's going for and it's very much well done - a beautiful, apocalyptic mess for a gameplay and grant mystery to unravel for a story.

As it says on the tin you manage monsters, keep them happy*, and stop them from breaching. With every passing day you learn a little more about the world that Project Moon has beautifully expanded and its denizens, every character and abnormality has a story to tell.

You cannot complete everything in your first run of the game, but worry not, resetting to day one keeps all your mission progress and collected items and research, it took me many a day 1 reset to get what I needed done\n2. Daily resets are your best friend when it comes to learning with how to handle a new dangerous creature, you sacrifice some people, acquire knowledge, scribble it down or commit it to memory, and restart the day. You will lose research progress but you get your little lambs back and you have your actual knowledge to fill in those gaps. There are a LOT of factors that can be taken into account with handling abnormalities so there is no shame in restarting the day\n3.

Good news: you dont have to beat every quest in a row. another good news: even after resetting to day 1, your research doesnt reset. Bad news, the games even more of a slog than i first thought. ive bashed my head for 2 more hours and made barely any progress. whenever an employee starts panicking, i just restart the day, since its virtually impossible to stop them sometimes, since every employee has the same movement speed. bashing my head against every scp to find out how to treat them without loosing half my staff is repetitive and boring. one of the only redeeming qualities is the art and character design in this game, but i dont enjoy the characters themselves, since they act like feelingless bastards that care only about the company(ik \"that they are AI\", but still, wtf).\n\nConclusion: there are a lot of games where the fans say \"this game makes you feel horrible, but we love it\". the difference here is that this game has no redeeming qualities.

It is not good. I enjoyed my time with it, but I would never ever recommend it to anyone I didn't hate.\n\nThe aesthetic the game is going for is SCP. The reason SCP functions as it does, with as little faults as it has, all without breaking the veil, is because the Site Directors are able to delegate tasks. If the site director had to direct each and every researcher to *perform research* on a given SCP they are assigned to, via some kind of PDA, the Foundation would never have gotten more than one Site.\n\nThat is to say, a Chain of Command is NECESSARY for the proper and smooth operation of ANY operation, especially one that deals with anomalies, or \"abnormalities\" as this game calls it.\n\nYou play as a Site Director who has never heard of delegation, or is otherwise not allowed to engage with the concept by your AI boss. In the beginning, when you only have one sector to oversee, it seems fine! its just 3 or 4 abnormalities to look over. It might even be a little fun, researching each abnormality as they get dropped into your sector. Like unboxing some weird, supernatural lootbox. You live and learn, sacrifice a few employees in the name of the greater good, but at the end of the day you're a net positive for humanity. You get the personal satisfaction of laying the anomalies bare, knowing all that they are, and how best to suck them dry so Joe Shit the Ragman can watch TV in the gutter.\n\nThen you get another sector to watch over, with the same nitpicky oversight that one would expect of an overseer of a single sector of XK-class anomalies.\n\"Well,\" you think, \"it's only another sector! It's a single player game! Surely it is balanced around one person playing it!\" \nSo you endure the more difficult, but still manageable workload.\n\nThen there is another sector. With the same amount of abormalities.\n\n\"Okay, this is kinda a lot for one person to handle.\" you think.\n\nSo you endure, mostly crutching on your fully researched clutch of anomalies to meet your energy quota for the day, while still trying to do what you can to research this new and infinitely more volatile class of anomaly. \n\nThen you get another one.\nAnd another one.\n\nAnd another entire floor after that, a clone of what you started with, with twice the amount of anomalies dropped per day, while youre still desperately trying to milk your original MAYBE 6 or 7 that you're confident enough with to milk dry (STILL manually milking btw, 3 clicks per ~20s, PER ANOMALY, (4 per sector, and you have 18 anomalies total at the point that you get a new floor, including the 2 it gives you when the new floor is forced on you) while remembering they exist, while also trying to manage deaths on the newer sectors, and managing escapes from anomalies you haven't had the chance to research yet). \n\nIf this is hard to follow, its because it FUCKING IS HARD TO FOLLOW. It's not hard in a fun \"oooh, okay so I have to do this to get this to do that\" way, its hard in a \"ok so i have to trial and error every anomaly that's dropped into this place, restarting 10-25 times per anomaly, if I want to not replay the story sections 800 times each attempt by playing until you literally dont have the manpower to play anymore then restarting from day 0, doing EVERYTHING again with the same research levels, arms, and armor, I got from losing the war of attrition with the game last run\" way.\n\nFrom what I hear, Library of Ruina is pretty good.

This shit is NOT worth it, I've been trying to play this game on and off since June 22, 2018, because every time I look at it I think \"Surely it wasn't as bad as I remember!\" and every single time, it is, if not worse.\n\ntl;dr: save yourself the trouble, this game is mindless grind in the worst kind of way, watch a youtube playthrough before you play Library of Ruina if you want the lore.", "timestamp_created": 1685240516, "timestamp_updated": 1685240516, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474683523178100586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139110791": {"recommendationid": "139110791", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126721481", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 7637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7637, "last_played": 1674743201}, "language": "english", "review": "mid", "timestamp_created": 1685222329, "timestamp_updated": 1685222329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139110746": {"recommendationid": "139110746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835070472", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1695755738}, "language": "english", "review": "Really difficult, be prepared to restart a lot, but I highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1685222265, "timestamp_updated": 1685222265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139102160": {"recommendationid": "139102160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209989139", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 15551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7091, "last_played": 1697585775}, "language": "english", "review": "Things I hate after playing this game:\n- Babies\n- Trains\n- Magical Girls\n- Religion\n- Trees\n- Slime\n- Birds\n- Red Buttons\n\nThings I love after playing this game:\n- Illegible Research Papers\n- Disembodied Hearts\n- Magical Girls\n- Mercenaries\n- Clocks", "timestamp_created": 1685212093, "timestamp_updated": 1685212093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139100218": {"recommendationid": "139100218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128897074", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 6835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 5049, "last_played": 1700407997}, "language": "english", "review": "dev you fucking stupid stick eyed dumbass, why do so le calle sephirots only tell about breaches and deaths/mental outbreaks of agents?

I think this is important to mention since after finishing LoR as one of my favourite games, I was coming into this one hella biased and you'll get bit of that in this review. I should also mention that in the time of writing this review, I did not finish this game yet, however after 90 hours I feel qualified to share my thoughts. \n\nYou play as a power plant manager. You probably heard about solar powerplants, hydroelectric power plants, nuclear power plants... Well, here you make power from monsters called abnormalities. You also get few very friendly and not weird at all AIs to help you with your task.\nIt's hard to not compare the story to LoR so I'll compae it. I think I have issue here because I played LoR 1st. I find it very sad that you only get a very little about anything that is happening outside the facility. I beleive this is only because I already knew how amazing the outside word is and maybe it wouldn't even cross my mind without that knowledge. While youi dont get much about the world, you get to know all the AIs working in lob corp quite well. All of them are very, VERY lovable (especially my boy Netzach, I love him so much). I was already familiar all of them before playing this game, however seeing ther story here brought them much more depth.\n\nThe gameplay is simple yet complacated. Simple becuase all you do is pick an employee and assign them work. The complicated part comes from managing a large number of abnormalities at the tame time. It's easy to remember that you can't send employee to work with a specific abnormality since they don't have effectiove armor againts it's attacks, however you might just overlook it if at the same time you must,... oh I don't know, pick up tickets every 2 minutes, be carefull to not send this guy to work since he is sparkling a bit, not hold that item for over 30 seconds, find and shoot different abnormality since the work you assigned few minutes ago did not end up well, checking how many of the random-ass NPCs died so you can prepare for a meatball to murder your entire department and do all that while LISTENING TO THAT FUCKING FETUS CRY... ugh, sorry got carried away a bit there. Fortunetly the game does not throw all that at you at the same time, your day norrmally starts with you choosing a new abnormality. This means the game gives you day to learn the quirks of the new abnormality so you are used to it the next day where you are learning about the new abnormality for that day. What I can complain about a bit is the tool days. The days where you find tool abnormality are basically just like the day before except you'll send one person to use do tool, most likely die, reset the day and do the same thing, just without dying. After that, I ended up not using 90% of the tools after getting the max research on them. but there is a thing that is more boring that tool days, those are the days where you... don't get anything. You play the last day again without even the minimum of researching the tool you got. Hoever you can normally do this quite fast and get back to researching new fun abnormalities.\nOnce in a while the game will throw some challenges called core supression at you and man... those are dufficult. I'm writing this after attempting Binah core supression for a while and well, it was so hard I decided to restart from day one. However, even restarting from day 1 won't fully reset your progress since you keep all the ego (weapons and armor) as well as permanent upgrades and abnormality research. This means that even if you get stuck, you don't have to feel bad if you need to reset to try and get to the same point with better gear (and knowledge).\n\nIn the end I don't think I can do anything else but reccomend this game. If you don't enjoy the managing simulatro gameplay you probably won't like it but if you do, this is the peak. \n\nAlso the music goes hard.", "timestamp_created": 1684804964, "timestamp_updated": 1684804964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138787925": {"recommendationid": "138787925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045803858", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 9192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8694, "last_played": 1689434874}, "language": "english", "review": "LobCorp is good actually", "timestamp_created": 1684785413, "timestamp_updated": 1684785413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138768497": {"recommendationid": "138768497", "author": {"steamid": "76561199198633425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1676, "last_played": 1684872493}, "language": "english", "review": "For the love of god someone help me", "timestamp_created": 1684768353, "timestamp_updated": 1684768353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508928596973419189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138749546": {"recommendationid": "138749546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200866543", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1685241990}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game, a very interesting one.\n\nNaturally the players life starts quite odd and rash in the early game, quite annoying and tricky but you eventually learn to manage ordeals and such.\n\nThen when it hits mid game, that's when it all goes to hell.

I take that back.\nDay 29: There's nothing there to worry about.\nDay 36: Legs Undertale?\nDay 44: I am no longer a god.\nDay 49: Am I having a heart attack?\nDay 50: *Flips Table*\n\nI'm going to put this out front, if you don't like grindy/monotonous games, don't get this game. The 'retry day' button will be your best and closest friend right next to 'memory repository.' If you don't grind for the gear, the levels, and to complete missions, you're going to have a rough time. \n\nMost of the tutorial is 'do this and only this' but it's good for people who don't have a clue as to what they're doing. All the extra information can be found in the manual, alongside some sweet sweet lore. Such as the reason the clerks carry a handgun, of which they're told is for self defense, but they'll learn it's use \"when the time comes.\" (;  However, I encourage those who have friends who have played the game before teach them the basics outside of the tutorial levels. I have taught some new players over Discord, it's time efficient, and less confusing.\n\nThe story is, in my opinion, the best part of this game. They have explanations for nearly everything, including why everything looks cute and cartoony. The characters and their development is fantastic and satisfying as they talk about their backstory and you learn about their personalities. The fact that most of the Abnormalities and the story itself is based off of various books and literature.\n\nUnbeknownst to many, this game is for those who enjoy improvement through failure, and the roller coaster of emotions that comes with. And trust me, I mean it when I say that. One day in the game will be peaceful, no Abnormality breaches, no Agent deaths, and man, you got all the easy Ordeals! Then the next day you get a funny looking thing you can have your Agents work with. It hasn't done anything all day, and you decide, \"Well, seems harmless. There's only 86 seconds left to fill out it's log, so let's just get that out of the way while I train my Agents.\" Then your AI's are spamming you with reports, all you can hear is wind and static, and as you sit in your silly little manager's room, everything on fire around you, you check the last bit of the log that was just filled out... \"Past 90 seconds of work the employee dies and all breach counters are reduced to 0.\" It is at this point, you close the window, and sit there as everything burns. An occasional \"Hello?\" is heard in the vast reaches of your facility as you smile and sit in silence. The lights go out, frames drop to 0, and your hot AI Secretary comes in to tell you, once again, that you're a failure of a manager. Yet for some, ungodly reason, you manage the strength to hit ESC and then slap the 'Retry Day' button once again. \n\nIt is at this moment, you will realize you love this game.

In short:\n\nThe good:\nStory, worldbuilding\nGameplay\nBoss fights (in a management game hell yeah)\n\nThe neutral:\nMusic\nGrind\n\nThe bad:\nRNG\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nWithout the story, this game wouldn't be nearly as good as it is. But puzzling together what happened in a lab in the Outskirts, and why that relates to gaining energy from monstrous creatures called abnormalities, while assisted by humanlike AI called Sephirot (all with their own personality and problems) is very enjoyable. The story is given in bits and pieces, out of chronological order and altogether vaguely, which leads to a rather intriguing task of figuring out what went/is going on.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nThe gameplay sounds rather simple. You have employees who you can send to work with abnormalities to obtain energy to fill the daily quota. Depending on the employee, the abnormality, the type of work and RNG you will produce more or less energy and the abnormality will or will not get more unhappy. If an abnormality is fully unhappy, bad things happen ranging from employee deaths due to abnormality breakout to... more deaths usually.\nThe interesting part is that after working with a number of abnormalities, a meltdown occurs. Either, it puts a qliphot meltdown on some random abnormalities which can be removed by working with them, but makes them unhappy if left unattended, or it spawns an ordeal in your facility, forcing combat.\nCombat, due to ordeals or escaped abnormalities, can go from simply sending in a blob of high-level employees to micromanaging to avoid attacks, depending on the threat you're up against. All in all, the gameplay loop is nicely put together.\n\n[b]Boss fights[/b]\n\nThere are no story spoilers here, but I wanted to tag it anyways.\n[spoiler]Boss fights, also known as Sephirot meltdowns, introduce a gimmick for a day and reward you with a buff if you beat them. They are varied and a nice breakup of the regular gameplay loop, and several of them are quite challenging (especially the final boss gauntlet).[/spoiler]\n\n\n[b]Music[/b]\n\nAlthough it's nothing special, the music is fitting and doesn't disturb the other elements of the game.\n\n[b]Grind[/b]\n\nYes, it's one of those. You level up employees by working with abnormalities, and in principle days are infinite. You almost have to level agents further than you would just by reaching the quota, since later boss fights require a bunch of high level employees to deal with everything going on at the same time. Furthermore, to get true ending, you need to have seen every abnormality and filled out their entire bio. This'll take at least two full runs, likely three since RNG isn't in your favour and your first run isn't likely to get all the way to the end if you're unprepared.\n\n[b]RNG[/b]\n\nOh boy, RNG. The energy you get from working, which abnormalities you get, which ordeal you get, where the ordeals spawn, what abnormalities get a qliphot meltdown, this game is jam-packed with RNG and at several occasions good or bad RNG is the difference between succeeding and having to retry the day (I'm looking at you, Queen of Hatred!). Especially bosses can be highly dependant on a role of the dice, with a wrong role almost forfeiting the attempt.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nStory is good, gameplay is good, until you get to the third run and start to prepare/(grind) for the final boss gauntlet. It's rewarding to complete though, and the story makes most of it worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1683472296, "timestamp_updated": 1683478642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137919394": {"recommendationid": "137919394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339393429", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1694028590}, "language": "english", "review": "Waifu good", "timestamp_created": 1683427834, "timestamp_updated": 1683427834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137918190": {"recommendationid": "137918190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358560269", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 760, "last_played": 1691109105}, "language": "english", "review": "gam", "timestamp_created": 1683425709, "timestamp_updated": 1683425709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137915217": {"recommendationid": "137915217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168503471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2423, "last_played": 1699319771}, "language": "english", "review": "good game :D hard game : ( (but still fun)", "timestamp_created": 1683420748, "timestamp_updated": 1683420748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137913471": {"recommendationid": "137913471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965533166", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 631, "last_played": 1692910740}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me hate babies, reindeer, etc. Fully recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1683417784, "timestamp_updated": 1683417784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137908553": {"recommendationid": "137908553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091332983", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2723, "last_played": 1686711495}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game but very frustrating at times xD", "timestamp_created": 1683410295, "timestamp_updated": 1683410295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137905687": {"recommendationid": "137905687", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122588451", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1698755138}, "language": "english", "review": "MY EMPLOYEES KEEP FUCKING DYING", "timestamp_created": 1683406656, "timestamp_updated": 1683406656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137903746": {"recommendationid": "137903746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022063586", "num_games_owned": 905, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5908, "last_played": 1683403849}, "language": "english", "review": "I'M DONE\nI'M DONE\nI'M ******* DONE\nI CAN PLAY RUINA NOW AAAAAAA\n\nSeriously though, a great game.

truly an \"experience\". Before I say anything else, I just want to say this was a wild ride, and I'm impressed with what I got vs. what I expected.\n\nSo this was my first \"micromanagement\" game, and I really didn't know the suffering I was in for. This game really packs a punch with it's difficulty, especially towards the end of the game. That being said, the game simply presents itself as is, and the player is left to adapt to it, and by the time I had played the game a couple dozen hours, I truly felt much more competent at the game.\n\nI also really liked the idea of resetting being integral to gameplay, because it really teaches you to appreciate the overall picture more. I wish that the game urged players to do this more, because this is not a common feature amongst games. One of friends actually quit after getting all the way to day 47 because he had never really known why using the memory repostiroy feature was useful, choosing to instead start from day 1 any time he wasn't satisfied with where he game was going.\n\nThat being saidI have a few qualms about gameplay, with the main one being that 2x speed is the maximum setting for core gameplay. Around 20hrs in I gave in to just getting a 5x speed mod so I could avoid grindy parts, such as using the memory repository feature to discover new abnormalities. There are also some things in the game that irk me someone, like a certain minion of an abnormality that likes to grab you and one-shot your employees when it revives every once in a while (you'll know it when you see it). Or enemies having ridiculous attacks that are near-unavoidable. Or a certain someone limiting your use of the speedup button.. \n\nRegardless, once you tough through it all, you feel that much better about winning, and that's what counts.\n\nOverall: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1683180132, "timestamp_updated": 1683180132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137758906": {"recommendationid": "137758906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122098470", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 7827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 160, "playtime_at_review": 7062, "last_played": 1700476556}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10.

The Big Red Button[/spoiler]\n\nThis specific encounter when activated kills every member of your staff, so okay no big deal you can restart. However for those who are inquisitive \"which is what this kind of game should encourage\" you're met with it crashing your game causing a save state of the game there by deleting all your EGO items \"employee equipment which you can earn from the abnormalities\". The common solution among users and people who do support this \"mechanic\" is don't pick the abnormality, to which I pose the question. \nWhy does it even exist if that is the intended action in a game based around exploration and experimentation?\n\nThe simplest answer I have came to, is it's lazy at best, at worst it's designed purely with malicious intent to punish people who are unfamiliar with this specific scenario in a way that is by no means fair in any context of gaming. At either case it's shoddy work on part of the developer to consider this a feature. Through the beginning of the game your fed the concept of \"memory repositories\" basically save states you can roll back to in case you screw up etc. Then later in the game \"Depending on when you get this specific abnormality, all the pushing of this save state mechanic means nothing as when you first click it, \"as stated earlier will kill all employees followed by releasing all other entities that are capable of escaping from their containment rooms.\" Now this in itself as I said isn't so bad, you can reload, but with the new player having had this idea / design pushed at them will undoubtedly \"as many did\" keep clicking on it to see if they can get any more information from it before reloading, this in turn crashes the client and saves your current EGO gear \"which if you weren't following along to this point is actually ZERO at this specific moment in time since all your employees just died before crashing.\" This could equate to merely a few hours of lost progress, or on a more sever scope, many many days of progress \"double so if you are on one of your *NG+* play throughs as it will delete ALL equipment your employees were using when they died.\"\n\nI discovered this \"feature\" when I was only a couple hours into the game when it first released, and encountered this information on a post elsewhere and in the fact of not losing progress decided to shelve it to wait to see if it might just be a bug\". Fast forward 2 years after launch, still a concept / feature within the game, this of course led me to shelve it practically permanently. Fast forward to now FIVE years after it was launched and they \"the devs project moon\" after even going on to make another title, with talks of yet another one, still think this is an acceptable feature. Suffice it to say, I will not support any future work by them, if they wish to troll a player base perhaps they should go to making mobile games instead or something, cause they have definitely missed the mark with this gamer with such trollish design.\n\n\nNow that my bit is aside, the game itself \"with that caveat aside\" least from my 2 hours, wasn't bad, the main themes / music can get a bit drab and repetitive after a short time however that is easily fixed for anyone on a PC. The toon styled characters and entities are quite sharp and well done, and the basic mechanics weren't to terrible to get through to get started. \n\nUnfortunately I really was looking forward to this game when I first saw teasers and screen shots, for anyone who likes SCP inspired works, a management sim sounded like a great game concept, only to be ruined by poor choice during it's development..\nAbsolutely Do Not Recommend", "timestamp_created": 1683041512, "timestamp_updated": 1683041642, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434782594442367554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137667299": {"recommendationid": "137667299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097886295", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4401, "last_played": 1685761671}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

With those two things said, this game was not very fun.\n\nGameplay:\nPlaying the game blind involves an extremely unpleasant amount of trial and error. Each anomaly has its own quirks and will kill your agents if they are handled properly. The only way to find this information in the game is to guess blindly. If you guess wrong, your agent probably dies and you probably have to start the day over. If you guess right, you can potentially unlock some information about how to properly handle the anomaly after a few more attempts. Sometimes, what seems like a correct guess is in fact an incorrect guess, which you can't know until unlocking more information, and will likely result in the death of several agents.\n\nSome anomalies deal sanity damage in addition to/instead of physical damage. This sounds great, because it means that your agents won't necessarily be dying left and right, but depending on your agent's stats, it can be worse. Particularly, this can cause them to sprint randomly across your facility, making your other agents insane if they stick around too long. With early game equipment, it is technically possible to bring someone back to sanity, but it's impossible if they're moving too quickly to hit, as is the case with any agent running around.\n\nThe game has a research system. Each day you can pick a different upgrade. Notably, the ability to see your agents' HP and sanity on the main UI has been locked behind an upgrade which at the earlist can be gotten at day 8 - meaning, before day 8, the only way you can see your agents stats is to open one of the anomaly work menus. This is fucking annoying, and slows the already boring pace of the game down even further as you obsessively pause and open the menu to make sure one of your agents doesn't get stabbed to death.\n\nEvery time one of your dudes goes into a cell to perform work, they get a stat boost. Grinding these out is a mostly risk free way of leveling up all of your guys, but it just takes way too long and isn't fun or interesting. I get to pick options on menus and wait for 30 seconds. Thrilling. I hope no weird robots show up and stab your newbies.\n\nStory:\nAt the time of the review, I haven't played for too long, so I can't speak much to the story. My impression thus far has been pretty underwhelming. The story exists in two parts: each anomaly has its own little block of lore, and you get to chat with some of your coworkers between work days.\n\nThe lore for each anomaly is entirely self contained, and I think (?) is the main draw of the game. This game was made for people that think SCP is really cool. I think it's kinda cringey; oh, what's that? This is a floating skull that likes it when you confess your sins to it? Cool. Oh, this epic bloody bird doesn't sing and has teeth? Epic. This cringe deviantart OC does something or other? I don't care. Amazing storytelling.\n\nThe actual continuous story between days is equally dry. You get to have a little chat with the main AI lady, she asks you a question and the only answers you can pick from are the wrong ones, and none of them really change how she responds. After that, you get to chat with the department heads, who don't seem particularly bothered about their subordinates dying or going insane. Maybe the story is about spending time with them and turning them into loving caring people (or AIs, I forget), but I find it more likely that actually we were the bad guys the whole time.\n\nThe whole premise of the game is that you're the new manager of some facility that generates energy (???) from working with the anomalies. Why this is necessary or a good idea is entirely unclear. The nature of the gameplay mechanics in an in-universe sense is entirely unexplained. Why does entering a certain number of cells to perform work cause random other cells to maybe have bad things happen to them (e.g. escape) if they're not entered within 60 seconds? Why does it also sometimes cause weird robots to show up and start stabbing people? IDK. Completely unexplained. It's a gameplay feature, I guess.\n\nSummary:\nI don't like the game. The gameplay is slow, it either wants you to just read the wiki, trial and error until you kill your agents, or restart the day until you figure out the particular preferences of each new creature. The story is weak and uncompelling, the music is repetitive, the art is ok, I guess, and customizing your dudes costs more of your bonus points which are the only way to upgrade your agents other than just grinding. Ugh. If you really like management games and you're big into SCP, this game might be for you.

Not simple, convoluted even, I would say, but great if you give it a thought. One of the best universes I dived into. Gameplay, though, is extremely hard, grindy, controls and UI are also pretty bad. The overall expreience is weird, since it's pretty unique and absolutely fantastic if you'll get engaged with the story, but otherwise - is utterly terrible and seems like a torture. But for me, as I've said before - it's one of the best universes I dived into.\n\nNow for the long story:\nAs a person, who likes story-rich games with lots of lore to get into, this is one of the best games (series of games) I ever played. I love the story and characters a lot. You can even dive into philosophy and think about life, society and developing as a person.\n\nGameplay-wise it is pretty bad, honestly. UI is pretty convoluted while game mechanics are very simple, yet they require you to memorize a lot of stuff. Control over the characters is disasterously inconvenient - you quite often need them to stay at an exact place, but you can only tell them to go to the specific room, not place. In some(many) cases this micro-control is very needed, but unavailable. Also, the game is very-very grindy and no matter how much you grind it is still extremely difficult. Like, really over the top difficult. You will save-scam A LOT and it is designed this way by the devs.\n\nSurprisingly though, if you will manage to overcome all those difficulties and will do it all by yourself (I, honestly, didn't have the nerve), you will feel SO much in character with the story and this is one of the coolest feelings I had with any game. This experience is very unique and makes you so engaged with the story. Once you get past that point - you are a most likely a fan of the Project Moon universe.\n\nThe game is not for everyone though. The story is very difficult to understand and leaves you deep in thoughts a lot by the end of the game. If you like this type of experience: when you have to deserve your happy-ending and especially, if you like to think about the story, philosophy and lore a lot - you will like the game, just give it some time to tell you major stuff. Because at the start, you don't really get much important info (You don't know enough to understand it in the beginning). If you just can't stand the gameplay, you can drop the gameplay and just watch story videos on YT. I don't recommend doing it though, because you will lose that specific and unique feeling of deserving you victory and being in-sync with the main protagonist.\nOtherwise, if you expect engaging gameplay with lots of action, well-though strategy, or a simple story - this game is not for you at all, you will get disappointed.\n\nP.S. If you liked this one, you should look for it's sequel - Library of Ruina.

"ballbustingly hard and at times reminiscent of what must be the mental mindscape of a schizophrenic full-dosing LSD after spending a couple minutes staring at the wikipedia entry for the kabbalah,

and limbus company.\n\ndespite the constant complaints of (albeit justified) difficulty and jank levied against it, lobotomy corporation was one of those very few titles that reminded me that video games can be more than derivative formula garbage. ironic, because it runs like ass despite its looks even on the latest hardware, a lot of the core mechanics are only sort of obliquely elaborated upon in the manager's manual, and the spikes in difficulty are extremely sudden and seemingly impossibly vertical.\n\nhowever, if you man up and stick it through the rough spots you'll be rewarded with a genuinely unique and memorable experience. this game is the ultimate manifestation of the expression \"trial and error\", and as such if you're capable of inner monologue it'll lead you into a deep rabbit hole of experimentation laced with equal amounts of frustration balanced out by the inevitable elation you experience when you finally get a bead on keeping an aleph-level abormality content. it's invoked and kindled a sense of wonderment and curiosity that I genuinely haven't felt for a game since I was a child.\n\nif you actually manage to make it through all the way 'til the end, you'll also probably unironically have developed an increased sense of situational awareness, multi-tasking, and a renewed triumphant spirit to replace the despair-ridden husk that once inhabited your soul. the lessons learned from this unhinged and debauched journey will stick with you long after you've closed the game, leaving you with a newfound appreciation for the resilience of the human spirit in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. it's a testament to the power of perseverance and the beauty of breaking through barriers, despite the chaotic cacophony of suffering that

You have to micro manage so much to the point the game will crush yours balls and turn it into a smoothie if you forget about one thing. It's also incredibly repetitive to where it will get slightly harder and slightly more difficult each day out of the several you are forced to endure. I also kinda dropped playing it cause it requires a lot of time and it isn't summer yet.\n\nOkay so like why is this recommended? Cause every other element of this game is amazing. Above is the negative aspects of it. For some of the positive aspects:\n\n+ Story and Lore is Easy Highlight- you will find yourself enjoying reading a lot of it. Along with that, ProjectMoon (people who made the game) have two other games that expand on this.\n+ You will find yourself eager to actually learn more about what everything does. More in the start of the game you will find yourself forced to learn the traits of each anomaly you hold but then you will find yourself wanting to instead of feeling forced\n+ Music is PEAK. Even though you will 90% hear the same two tracks, all the others are amazing such as the warnings. Hell, buy the soundtrack if you don't have a method of listening to them\n+ Art is pretty good and really goes over the top with the crazy shit that happens to your agents. Don't be fooled by the fact the people you see in the screenshots above look like gacha characters. \n+ This game is incredibly unique, taking inspiration (or i think so) from SCP but takes a different approach to how it's world is built and how the mysterious creatures/objects are conjured origin wise\n\nIf you want to know if you should buy this, I would say it's a game that takes a LOT of dedication for it to shines it's best aspects.

However, what I didn't realize was that the first out of THREE tutorials would be filled with at least 7 different gauges and weird-worded things to keep up with.  This isn't a game.  It's an exercise in reading.  And trying to keep up with at least 7 made-up terms that make no sense whatsoever.  I own over 400 games on this platform, and none of them are as convoluted and ridiculous to try to understand as this is.  It is totally absurd.  I didn't want to buy a book on fantasy.  I wanted to buy a fun game that I could play and try to get better at.  This is an exercise in like college-level memorization.  Idk that I've ever had as much information thrown at me hapharzardly as this game.  And that's saying a lot, since I've played a lot of early access titles.  I cannot begin to explain how confusing and absurd this game is right out the gate.  I'm sure if I spent like 5 hours learning it, maybe I could make some kind of sense of it.  But that's not at all what I thought this was, or what was displayed on the store page.  \n\nThis is not fun.  It's not a good game.  It's just an absurd amount of things to try to keep up with for no apparent reason than to make it difficult.  Like there's no story at all.  There's no reasoning behind anything.  It's just \"interact with this anomaly to earn points but also unique anomaly points and qhipholphy points to unlock information about it which gives you fortitude points for your agent but watch out for doomagoodness points because then your anomalies might escape where you need gmod weapons and suits to bring it under control which you get from spending qhilophinous points on the anomaly after you have your agent interact with it in one of the four possible ways that they can interact.  Also there are points on your agent and the anomaly to say what will work and what won't work for this specific anomaly.\"  It's completely ridiculous.  I'd rather read an encyclopedia than \"play\" this \"game.\"  \n\nAnd that's after 12 MINUTES OF GAMEPLAY. THERE ARE TWO MORE TUTORIALS TO GO THROUGH!!!!!  I can't even begin to explain the absurdity of this garbage.  I can't believe it has the positive reviews it does.  The UI is ugly, the gameplay is absurd.  \n\n\"git gud\" I hear people screaming.  I own over 430 titles on this platform and have enjoyed most of them.  I'm not a plebian moron.  This is not for the faint of heart.  And it certainly isn't something to just buy on a whim to have fun with.  This is an investment of time and effort to make any sense of it.  And people should know that.\n\nEdit:  If you notice, even the positive reviews speak negatively of it and the same problems I mentioned here.

I tried my best to avoid any major ones.\n\nThere are few games that properly evoke a variety of emotions of me, and even fewer than can engross me so deeply that I start to obsess over the next session of play I so desperately wish to do. Let me preface this by saying that this game is far from perfect, and it has a lot of things that people will find annoying or downright frustrating. But for me, that was part of the package of experience it offered and it all fit into place so damn well. For me, this is a perfect game suited to my preferences. I was compelled to write this after having spent 142 hours to 100% the game and attain its true ending.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]: It's a management game, but also much more than that. The game punishes tiny mistakes and poor choices of judgement in brutal fashion. The grind in the later parts of the game becomes arduous, making each day feel like a marathon. Those mishaps suddenly feel like soul-crushing events that make you feel either you have to make an immense sacrifice to proceed, or restart the day and accept that you just wasted a bunch of your time. Sometimes, even RNG factors in and decides that your destiny is to fail and there's little you can do but watch on as things spiral out of control. Things like this break the will to play for many people, and I wholly understand this. It's an unforgiving game. In terms of combat, you literally are just a commander that sends units from point A to B. They handle everything else, including any special abilities they may possess. You must simply guide them in the direction they need to go. It's a lot more work than it sounds like, and at some points, the game becomes heavily micro-intensive. RTS players will feel at home.\n\nHowever, what this game does is reward you in dividends for keen observation, patience, and over-preparation. In strategy games, I'm the turtle player. I overcompensate my lack of tactical finesse by developing a powerful base and producing a bunch of high quality units. This is what I did in this game. And this strategy was time-consuming, and at times, it was tedious. But it pays off. Oh boy, does it pay off. I went into this game 95% blind. I learned things through trial and error. This game, while it does have a manual, doesn't have an in-depth guide to every other intricacy it possesses. For some people, the best option is to browse the web for guides and tips. This is perfectly valid, considering the nature of this game. But I think part of what made the experience so memorable and important to me was being constantly beaten down by unknowns in the game, only to rise up and conquer them after observing and learning from my mistakes. Maybe I'm a bit of a masochist, but the feeling of satisfaction you receive when the things you learn help prevail over a trial you struggled to bypass, the euphoria is exquisite.\n\n[b]Narrative[/b]: This game has an interesting story that is provided through visual novel cutscenes between the days of play. You unlock new cutscenes via simple progression of days, and also completing missions assigned to you. For people that dislike reading visual novels or reading in general, the narrative will probably be a miss for you. There's a lot of reading to do. Even for those that do enjoy those genres, the story is a meticulously crafted one where everyone speaks in a certain way that feels like you're always on the verge of philosophising about existence itself. And most of the time, that ends up being the case.\n\nPersonally, as a fan of other series that have similarly overtly complicated storytelling (such as Girls Frontline), this game felt like a natural fit for me. I became so engrossed with the world that they built through the dialogues, and the story of the corporation you worked in. They drip-feed you these details that make you crave for more knowledge, and some characters become unforgettable with the way they poetically speak about their story and how they are now. Lobotomy Corporation is very much a story of facing one's fears to build a future that you can walk into. Yes, the game's slogan is truly relevant at all times. Amazing.\n\nAnd when it all culminated into the ending sequence, and the true ending... I shed tears. It was full of surprises. I was shocked, but I was also relieved. I was given a victory lap. I was given a sheer spectacle that unfolded before my eyes in a way I didn't know the game was capable of presenting, and I was in awe. A truly beautiful way to conclude a game. I pass my thanks onto the CURRENT english translators (I'm aware of the horror stories of the initial translators) for allowing me to experience this wonderful tale. And let's not get into the chills I got from those final lines...\n\n[b]Design[/b]: This game has a simple style that works pretty well, and it even has an in-universe reason for the way it all looks. At first, you will be overwhelmed by the UI and wondering what everything does. You slowly start to learn how everything works, however, and the important things the game will guide you through via the tutorial. You will likely discover new things about the UI as you proceed through the game, and it can only help you. It is very much a game that, once you become adjusted to the interface, everything then becomes second nature to you.\n\nMechanically, the game doesn't have many complex base mechanics. You primarily manipulate time, and you manipulate your agents. You order your agents to do work, fight escaping monsters, move to locations, etc. This is the majority of your gameplay loop. The variables which change how these function are the Abnormalities. Every Abnormality is unique, and has its own set of conditions to take care of it. This changes what work you do, when you do it, who works on it, etc. It's here that the game truly shines in how varied it can become and how many decisions you end up making. The game will tell you most things about the Abnormalities as you work on them, so you can trial and error before figuring out the correct method of caring for them.\n\nAs for the thematic design, the game stands out. It has a unique artstyle that differentiates it from other games, and every single of the Abnormalities are carefully crafted to be exceptionally unique and interesting. Every time I grabbed a new one, I truly wondered what kind of atrocities it was capable of committing. Some designs are unnervingly cute. Some are absolute nightmare fuel. Some are bizarre beyond our wildest dreams. It's a truly colorful roster of entities, and that's not even speaking about the character cast itself. The Sephirah each have their own distinct silhouettes and characters. Many things in the game take heavy influences from cultures and mythologies, such as fairy tales and Kabbalah. Those that enjoy seeing creative ideas and inspirations flourish, eat your heart out.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]: I don't usually write reviews. I don't consider myself much of a critic (even though I'm probably qualified for it in some ways). Everything I wrote here, take it as a different perspective when approaching this game. Keep it in mind and develop your own impressions. This is a game that resonates with a certain type of person heavily. It isn't for everyone, but you can only really determine this by trying it out. And I truly believe the experience everyone else will have will be unique to them, depending on their approach.\n\nI felt compelled to write a review for this because it became one of my all-time favorite games. From start to finish, and even beyond finishing, it has captivated me and captured my heart. To the extent that I know that there will never ever be another Lobotomy Corporation. Never another game that will be perfectly suited to my desires and that would deliver this amazing experience onto me. And that's perfectly fine, because I already have it right here.\n\nNow, time to hope Library of Ruina will also capture me so deeply.", "timestamp_created": 1680356838, "timestamp_updated": 1680356838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539622604846954346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135869620": {"recommendationid": "135869620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339400653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4366, "last_played": 1698572186}, "language": "english", "review": "screw this game", "timestamp_created": 1680346406, "timestamp_updated": 1680421666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.742191791534423828", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135860291": {"recommendationid": "135860291", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122517346", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1678, "last_played": 1683500154}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a game about collecting energy from abnormalities.

I specifically recommend doing the Dusk ordeal mission as soon as you get it if you choose to go without permanent agents. There is an entire other progression system unlocked by that mission that the game just doesn't tell you about.\n\nLobotomy Corporation is a fantastic game until it isn't. Once you discover all the mysteries all that's left it to do the missions and progress days which will look like clicking between a few safe anomalies to grind power for 10-30 minutes. Which is why you should do your best to progress mission objectives as fast as possible alongside your anomalies since not only do they give you story, they give you buffs, and once the anomalies are all studied there's not much fun to be found.\n\nBack to cheat engine, look at my hours, look at my hours. Probably 20-30 hours of that have been without cheat engine. The rest you can multiply by 5-10. Get cheat engine.\n\nEDIT:\n\nFinally some in game help, you can complete missions and anomalies and rewind time before it ever happened maintaining progress. Meaning if for whatever reason you lost a bunch of people studying something or completing a mission you can rewind time to before it happened, keep that progress, and get back all those lost troops. The only cost being any stat increases on your guys along with new people you recruited.\n\n\nThe gameplay is needlessly time wasting as I've pointed out before. Controlling characters is something you can adjust to but there's no denying it's god awful. Likewise combat is terrible.\nStory is great, lore is great. Can't get much further into it because this game could be ruined by spoilers since mystery is a central point (there is one exception).\n\nA related issue is you could get so hard screwed by the game for just not knowing. To various degrees it's layers of BS to it. The lowest layer being that someone dies to anomaly and you get research, this is a central gameplay mechanics you have to send sacrificial pawns. Middle layer is someone dies to an anomaly and you get no research/not enough research. There's a couple I give a pass to because their clever but besides that that's just so uninteractive since a lot of the time these kinds of anomalies just insta wipe you. \n\nTop BS is the purple noon ordeal instantly killing characters in main rooms and you've been warned. How are you supposed to counter an instant kill for any non-endgame armored, max health characters for this one specific event? The answer is you don't, it happens to you once, you restart the day, and you never leave your characters in the main rooms when you see that ordeal coming up ever again.\n\nNow I may have been going on the negatives for awhile but that's because they're pretty bad and also specific.\n\nOtherwise the story is great. I love the writing for \"most\" of the lore in game. I think the progression system is extremely unique and good once you understand how it works. \nThe artwork is great and most the anomalies feel unique. \nA lot of anomalies also have their own unique mechanics which makes the research side of the game really interesting and fun. Every anomaly is its own puzzle. \nThe difficulty of the game mostly comes from the lack of understanding so once you've researched every it's naturally easier to progress even if you day 1 because you know what anomalies serve you best. \nThe biggest down there is how vague the game is with outcomes and RNG which is part of why I recommend More Detailed Info. Knowing the levels of your characters is also vital for stat farming and even some later objectives, not base game, you need More Detailed Info for that.\n\n\nTogether I think Lobotomy Corporation is a very good but incredibly flawed game. For me I think it's worth it but for others maybe not. It's a cautious recommendation.\n\nEDIT EDIT:\nI'm mad, I was mostly positive about this game until day 46. All you need to know is due to in game mechanics I need to replay 45 days to get the true ending because Rewind to the Memory Repository is an awful mechanic, you should just be able to select previous days. I'd like to stress again this isn't a hard game it's a tedious one. So I've given up (again this isn't even taking into account my 5-10x speed multiplier).\n\nIf you want the game for the gameplay I can recommend it, it should last a solid 20-30 hours.\n\nIf you want the game for its story, look up the game's story on YouTube, I'd go as far as to say this game is openly disrespectful of your time spent with it.\nIf you want to read up on the lore of the anomalies look at the wiki.\n\nI mean this wholeheartedly that you should never play this game if you want any of the writing you shouldn't touch this game, just view the writing. The only reason I've not changed to a negative review is because I recognize that the game is super fun before you learn every single anomaly.", "timestamp_created": 1679092457, "timestamp_updated": 1679340747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737748563289642334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134840858": {"recommendationid": "134840858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141564592", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2602, "last_played": 1685075056}, "language": "english", "review": "its fun if you hate yourself", "timestamp_created": 1679088486, "timestamp_updated": 1679088486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541666686534881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134835948": {"recommendationid": "134835948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354178476", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 110, "last_played": 1682017062}, "language": "english", "review": "aaAAAA", "timestamp_created": 1679083072, "timestamp_updated": 1680775157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134834024": {"recommendationid": "134834024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265600742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 10485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10253, "last_played": 1696197108}, "language": "english", "review": "Deeply compelling.

I have beaten it 3 times with my 1st run needing to retry at Day 1 twice and the rest only using memory repository for farming or when needed. At the beginning, the game can be very difficult as you won't know what Abnos gimmicks are, as such you can make a very hellish facility that with one bad result would spiral out of control. However, you do have the ability to rewind back to days ending in 1s or 6s which can allow you to reverse your decision, though any Abno you picked on those specific days are not reversible outside of a day 1 restart. \n\nThe main gameplay loop is learning the Abno's mechanics, getting it's gear, completing any assigned mission and training your employees. Some of the days can be quite calming with the song Neutral becoming engraved into your brain while, others can be a challenge that test's your understand of the mechanics and allowing you to hear it's good OST. There's also combat which essential ends with you sending all of your employees with good gear to beat down any enemy outside of their chamber. Other factors can be considered like the Abno's attack range and their animation which you can use to help make your employees doge attacks. Though this also requires constant micro management but, once you start pilling up with good weapons you can kill things very quickly so this might not become too tedious for some.\n\nI won't talk about the story aside from it being in my opinion, Project's Moon best narrative though there other products have better character writing. The story creates a good mystery for the company Lobotomy Corporation and unravels it quite nicely, and it's writing for the setting is quite good and leaves it open ended enough that you can fill in the blanks with your imagination. \n\nNow before you start playing the game I strongly recommend getting the game's modding tool Basemod and install the following mods, Optimisation Mod and Gift Effects Fix at the very least. The game is very unstable and some days can go for a very long time, as such you don't want the game to crash and have you lose all your progress for factors outside of your control. Also some things don't work properly which both Basemod and Gift Fix help fix to a certain extent.\n\nIn the end, this game is not for everyone and several parts of it can create genuine frustration however, I hold it in a special place and in my opinion is Project Moon best work so far.

WARINING! WARINING!\nManifestation of gameplay spoilers due to this being a retelling of the story, from my experience.\nWARNING! WARNING! WARNING!\n\nLobotomy Corporation is a game that puts up a heavy facade. You take the role of X, the newly appointed manager of the titular company, Lobotomy Corporation. Your role and goal is to extract energy from \"abnormalities,\" which are monsters that range from sweet old ladies, to skin stealers. To help you with this, you're given an android assistant named Angela.\n\nThe game goes along smoothly, you meet department heads known as \"sephirot,\" and by this point they all should seem decently friendly, besides Yesod. That is, until the cognition filter breaks down, giving you a small peek in to the true nature of the facility. Right after that, you get a call from a mysterious man named B, who tells you that the company is not even half of what it seems, sowing seeds of distrust in you, and growing weeds of doubt, weeds that Angela wants to pluck. \n\nNow with your new sense of doubt, you progress more through the game. By this point you should now see \"core suppression requirements\" on a bunch of the sephirot's mission pages. Unless you know what you're doing, you most likely will not see any core suppression until 60-100 hour in. I got lucky and realized dusk ordeals weren't nearly as much as they were made out to be. Core suppressions are the boss fights of this game, adding a new layer of difficulty on an otherwise normal day. And the more you beat, the more you learn. \n\nSoon you learn about the man named A, and the more you learn about him, the more heartless he seems. You also learn of a woman named Carmen, who seemed to be the opposite of A in every way besides intelligence. You learn that Carmen died somehow, how she wanted to change the world for the better, and how she wished to help every person in the city. You learn the sad tale of Elijah, a girl who died out of desperation for attention, Gabriel who was driven mad, Giovanni who was deceived, Michelle who was overwhelmed, Enoch and Lisa who were taken in, only for Enoch to die at the well-meaning hands of Carmen, Kali who died defending in vain, Daniel who betrayed, Garion who was just doing her job, and Benjamin, who left A after Carmen's death.\n\nAfter learning all of this, you begin thinking that A is the villain of the game. But he's the protagonist, as Angela finally reveals who A truly is, and who she truly is. A is you, and Angela is an imperfect copy of Carmen. A has put himself in to a time loop to get the perfect scenario for the \"seed of light,\" a strange object which holds the power to accomplish Carmen's dream, and bring a \"well\" to everybody. \n\nDay 46-47, X meets Abel, another version of him representing a part of his mind that thinks nothing will ever change. Abel tells A to either overcome what he has not, or to stay with Abel and accept defeat. X, of course, does not, and perseveres through the day, all 4 upper layer sephirot going in to meltdowns. \n\nDay 48, X meets his second counterpart, Abram, who represents his guilt and grief for Carmen. Abram tells X that Carmen is dead and gone, to stop carrying on her legacy, and to just let the facility crumble, with his last moments being with Carmen's extracted nervous system. X ignores him, defeating the red mist a second time, and advancing on, almost ready to finish the seed of light.\n\nDay 49, X meets Adam, the version of himself that represents his god complex. Adam is tired, and wants to finish the seed of light project early. This wouldn't accomplish Carmen's goal, and instead would create an imperfect seed of light, turning every single person in to abnormalities, instead of allowing them to manifest their true selves. X goes through his hardest trial yet to deny Adam, but does succeed.\n\nDay 50, X meets Ayin, the true, original A. Ayin has a short conversation with X, and then sends him off to finish the seed of light. After the day has passed, the facility flips over to get the sephirot in their proper positions (Keter being at the top, and Malkuth at the bottom), and a beam of light shoots from the facility after it breaks through the ground. This beam is the tree of light, sprinkling it's seeds across the city, bringing the perfect ending to the game, which honestly made me cry. However, Angela has a different plan. (I won't say any more, as it will spoil certain elements of the sequel, Library of Ruina. I will say what's said in lobotomy corporation, though.) Angela, filled with anger from the torment she's been put through due to the time loop, wants to live a normal human life. She turns off the tree of light, taking the light for herself and using it construct a library, where she may accumulate knowledge of the world, the city, everything. \n\n10/10 game, and I don't give that out lightly. Well, at least I don't when I'm seriously reviewing something. It is a jankfest, there are bugs at every corner, but those are easy fixes with mods made to debug the game. Play this game if you want to cry form happiness, conclusion, closure, anger, disappointment, practically every emotion that can make you cry in this game will make you cry. After you're done, play it's sequel, it's somehow better than this.", "timestamp_created": 1678147232, "timestamp_updated": 1684935352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

It's a setting where energy cannot meet the needs of the world anymore and they needed to find other ways. Unique monsters (abnormalities or if you like SCP, anomalies) create energy based on how well the human you sent in works with them. There are different strength/danger categories just like SCP. All the monsters have their own backstories, and art made by different artist which is insanely respectable. I love seeing all the effort and love that was put into this game. There is a requirement for time travel in this game, and the boss battles are sooooo difficult. It's my favorite management simulator I have ever played and the story between the days you do your work is so intriguing. I wish I could have more and more of this game, so I started at the very beginning again just so I could experience it again. But nothing is like the first playthrough of discovering each abnormalities preferences through the scientific method of trial and error (aka DEATH! :D more often than naught.) Plus it's fun to get attached to your employees and watch them grow and mess up or do silly things or even die.

happily play their other products, but I just had too many problems build up as I went through the game, but incase you do get the game my best advice to give would be this.\n\nDon't be afraid of replaying/restarting, even from Day 1.\nThe games expects you to use memory repository, and the only thing you will lose from going back, even to day 1, are the employees that you hired, and the abnormalities you obtained.\nHowever any items and/or information you obtained from those abnormalities is kept.\nMission progress/completion is also kept, even from Day 1 resets, this makes replaying the game significantly easier, so do not be afraid of this, or losing employees.\n\nWith that said, I actually have a fair amount of nice things to say about the game, so let's start off with the\n\n+++Positives+++\n\nThe thematics of the game are great!\nI thought the general aesthetic worked really well, both for budget reasons and as an intentional style.\nBut beyond graphics, there's a lot of horror vibes, the store description doesn't lie with what it's inspired by, I really liked the SCP vibes throughout.\n\nSpeaking of SCP's, the Abnormalities are numerous and varied, I loved how different a lot of them were, and it was surprisingly satisfying figuring out how to manage them all and in the end, profit off them.\n\nThe story was also pretty neat, though I can't go into depth about it.\nI found my eyes glazing over it a smidge with how it was worded at points, but overall I liked how dark it was throughout and how things played out with all of the characters.\n\nLastly, the music was also pretty cool at points.\nFor the most part it was kinda samey unless things were going wrong, but when things WERE going wrong, it got pretty good.\n\nNow onto the \n\n---Negatives---\n\nThe games performance is terrible, specifically as you progress.\nWhat started out perfectly smooth devolved into low framerates as the facility expanded, to the point where even loading screens came close to crashing the game if I clicked or alt tabbed.\nThis is a problem when you're faced with combat, because when particle effects happen, the game practically freezes momentarily, but everything is combat has particle effects.\nDamage prompts, insanity prompts, blood splatters, everything will cause lag if you use large groups.\nNow while small groups have their benefits, being discouraged from using a large group because the games performance will just die along with all my lower level employees, feels terrible.\nBut even outside of combat, scrolling across the facility is laggy, animations get less smooth and for the late game objectives specifically, it just feels awful.\n\nTo go more in-depth on combat, it's really simple. You select employees and you can tell them to either go to a location, or attack something, and later on in the game you get bullets, which let you manually target people to give them shields, health, sanity or just kill them if they start to become troublesome.\nBut my problem with combat is that it's too simple, I cannot tell an employee where specifically I want them in a room, I can only tell them I want them in that room. So when I'm fighting an enemy and I want to move them to the other side of said enemy, I have to select the employee, tell them to go into a room on the other side of the enemy (assuming there even is one, otherwise their only option is to either get hit or leave the room entirely), wait for the employee to move, select them again and tell them to attack the enemy.\nIt's tedious, it's clunky and it's one of the reasons I disliked when the game decided to delve more into combat specifically.\n\nSpeaking of those objectives from earlier, throughout the entire game you're given missions from different people in the facility, culminating in a final objective from them. These started off perfectly fine, but the last few in particular were just awful.\nI will spoil three of these in particular but these are not major plot spoilers, just gameplay ones.\n[spoiler]Starting with the Disciplinary Team, I don't understand why they had boss fights be the days objective instead of just collecting energy, the game is not built for boss fights as it just devolves into kiting attacks over and over, even with your best units. But for your units which aren't the best, you just kinda have them on the side, lest they die and ruin everyone elses sanity.\nIt's a boring fight which you cheese either via kiting, or through some other method, such as unleashing Abnormalities to the work for you, which sounds like a smart use of mechanics but it's pretty dull [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]Next is the Record Team, this one is just dull. It takes away your ability to pause and manage things (to an extent), but it also removes your ability to speed things up, opting to speed things up gradually as the day goes along. I find this extremely boring, as most abnormalities don't use time as a mechanic, so it just makes the day go extremely slowly, and if you need to restart, you'll feel every second crawl on by. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]Finally we have the Extraction Team, another mission that requires you to finish a boss fight instead of getting enough energy, so what this means is more kiting to avoid attacks. The gimmick with this boss is cool, you cannot hurt the boss until you deal with specific Abnormalities that get put into a meltdown state.\nOnce they're vulnerable, you have a good chunk of time to wail on them. There are several problems here. She can place her meltdown effect on abnormalities which are already on cooldown, meaning you need to wait unnecessarily before you can send someone to deal with it, and when the boss becomes vulnerable, they stop for a long while, even if they're in a doorway transition where you cannot reach their model. If you do not deal with them in this state, there is a good chance they'll throw out more meltdowns again, all because you literally could not reach them because the game didn't allow you to.[/spoiler]\n\nAnd going back to general gameplay, I really wish the game had more automation.\nA lot of days, I was just going through the motions, it would've been nice if there was some way I could just automatically send people to go do the jobs I would like them to do. Replaying days felt boring, because very little changed, and as the facility expanded, the fatigue really set in.\n\nAnd speaking of the facility, I mentioned how I loved the variety of abnormalities earlier, but sometimes the game can give you some abnormalities you're just not able to deal with at points.\nSome will get out because you have too many clerk casualties, one will get out because you don't have enough clerk casualties, some will get out because your employees are too underleveled or undergeared and in the worst case scenario, you're getting them on days where a checkpoint is set and going back to said checkpoint fixes nothing. Going back isn't bad, but the reason for it can definitely feel bad.\n\n>>Conclusion<<\nOverall, there was a lot I like about the game, and it started off real strong, but it just became so tedious and annoying with what I wanted from me later on.\nIt's not devoid of quality, and it definitely appeals to some people, but I find that it was more annoying than anything else in the later game for me to recommend this personally.", "timestamp_created": 1677196806, "timestamp_updated": 1677196806, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 152, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858095049858093262", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133440426": {"recommendationid": "133440426", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992838076", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10079, "last_played": 1698223011}, "language": "english", "review": "In my entire experience with any form of media I have never experience a game, setting, and world that has both horrified me and emotionally moved me in such a way.

not being an enjoyable experience.\n\n1. The game is time consuming. Most of that time is spent watching meters fill up. It's monotonous and dull.\n2. The controls are a bit wonky. You can just tell this was not quality development, because it really doesn't handle well. Nothing feels fluid. You have to clunkily select and hand out orders. So much of the time you'll find yourself frustrated that you can't see various UI elements during combat, or the ability to view your own units' stats in various parts is kinda crappy, or the way you can't select multiple units with shift clicking how you'd want to. No hotkeys for almost anything. It's just very clunky and slow You can't move your agents to specific spots in a room, you have to repeatedly tell them to move back and forth to get them to stand where you want them to. It's annoying and just badly designed.\n3. This game loves wasting your time with random events(doing the wrong thing with a monster/abnormality, a semi-random Ordeal event) that obliterate the majority of your agents and usually force you to start over. You'll know what not to do next time you play the level, but this game has the formula of forcing you to die basically and then just expecting you to avoid it next time. Rarely does it telegraph these things so the player can avoid it with skill. Just trial and error game overs.\n4. UI text is tiny and there's no real option to make it bigger. It's fine during story segments, but it's downright unreadable during status screens or gameplay portions.\n5. Game is just littered with poor design choices. The equipment screen is clunky. UI is clunky. Some abnormalities really feel badly designed. The combat is clunky and more difficult to control than it should be.\n\nPeople insist that the story is incredible, and perhaps it will end up that way. I'm on I think Day 30, and there's nothing all that interesting so far. The writing for the abnormalities themselves are pretty basic and unless you're a really big occult fan or something, they don't really do anything for me.\n\nSo in short, I can't really recommend this game because I don't think the average person would actually like it. It seems to be intended for a weird niche of gamers who want a challenge, but one that isn't particularly rooted in skill-based gameplay with good controls, but rather just trial and error, sucking up a ton of time watching meters fill, and remembering what things not to do and not doing them through a clunky interface. I want to like this game more, but it's really not that good.\n\nEdit: To add onto this, I also have to note that this game has a gamebreaking memory leak. The longer you play, the closer you get to a crash. Part of why I stopped playing this game is that I was mostly through a very difficult Midnight ordeal that I had carefully played through only to have the game just crash on me and completely wipe out an hour long session. Then I went to do it again and...it happened again. Absolutely unacceptable for a game that asks for this much meticulous play and time from you for a level to have a crashing problem like this if a level takes 45m-1h for you to finish.", "timestamp_created": 1676631158, "timestamp_updated": 1678105495, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483829230070114136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132960249": {"recommendationid": "132960249", "author": {"steamid": "76561199139507770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6295, "last_played": 1676622221}, "language": "english", "review": "goodddddd", "timestamp_created": 1676544552, "timestamp_updated": 1676544552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508196711540222168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132942094": {"recommendationid": "132942094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158477444", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 686, "last_played": 1684474762}, "language": "english", "review": "Skipped it for Library Of Ruina after being annihilated, after awhile ill come back to it but\n\nplease for the love of god\n\nIf you get a hard abnormality early like I did just reset don't be stubborn", "timestamp_created": 1676511927, "timestamp_updated": 1684717131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132937599": {"recommendationid": "132937599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337248139", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10046, "last_played": 1676948594}, "language": "english", "review": "I fell into the Project Moon pipeline.", "timestamp_created": 1676505113, "timestamp_updated": 1676505113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132918809": {"recommendationid": "132918809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009089600", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 964, "last_played": 1628942380}, "language": "english", "review": "Go in blind, enjoy the rogue lite nature and be aware that failure is just the first step toward your next fun run.", "timestamp_created": 1676493740, "timestamp_updated": 1676493740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132900594": {"recommendationid": "132900594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070012542", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 14250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3553, "last_played": 1685243154}, "language": "english", "review": "crazy how Elon is using this game as inspiration on how to manage Twitter", "timestamp_created": 1676473155, "timestamp_updated": 1676473155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132872981": {"recommendationid": "132872981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076421632", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3630, "last_played": 1687771765}, "language": "english", "review": "Once you start it'll occupy your head for years please save yourself", "timestamp_created": 1676431294, "timestamp_updated": 1676431294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132838680": {"recommendationid": "132838680", "author": {"steamid": "76561199133730551", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2072, "last_played": 1691353721}, "language": "english", "review": "> Minor mistake\n\n> Entire facility dies \n\nThis game is great if you are a masochist.

Lobotomy corporation will dump huge cut-scenes full of text dialogue in-between days (that are about 5 hours of footage all together! holy shit!) that in the moment you want to skip to immediately get to the game play, and/or may not even unlock all of because the games so damn hard you never get to the text dumps at around day 40ish. Made even worse by the fact that Lobotomy corporation is /essential/ to understanding the plot of the two other games in the series (Library of Runia and Limbus [?] company) so you have to either watch 5 hours of just text dump dialogue in a youtube comp or struggle through lobcorp in order to play runia and limbus.\n\ngreat concept and great game on its own, it just suffers from the fact that its sequel is much more lax; meaning people who play lobotomy corporation because they want to understand runia may walk away frustrated because the grueling rouge-like punishment is nothing like the other two games in the series.", "timestamp_created": 1675771672, "timestamp_updated": 1675771672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56619715690612793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132359260": {"recommendationid": "132359260", "author": {"steamid": "76561199181103922", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1678625721}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b \u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0430 \u042e\u0442\u0443\u0431\u0435. \u041d\u043e \u044f \u0431\u044b \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0435\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f", "timestamp_created": 1675757303, "timestamp_updated": 1675757303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132345402": {"recommendationid": "132345402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201280619", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31989, "last_played": 1686365787}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, very tedious and a bit of a grind without mods but still amazing.\n\nEven if I wasn't sad when I beat it I was sad about my nuggets and how I can never play the game the same way I played it 500 hours ago.", "timestamp_created": 1675729839, "timestamp_updated": 1675729839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537572264671325684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132330439": {"recommendationid": "132330439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113675215", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 10934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10845, "last_played": 1695987184}, "language": "english", "review": "Netzach my balls.", "timestamp_created": 1675706817, "timestamp_updated": 1675706817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132323186": {"recommendationid": "132323186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981255426", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1177, "last_played": 1668452174}, "language": "english", "review": "Netzach", "timestamp_created": 1675696912, "timestamp_updated": 1675696912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132318450": {"recommendationid": "132318450", "author": {"steamid": "76561199468578937", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1699447347}, "language": "english", "review": "Just started and I'm interested in this game because hehe horror stuff.

There is nothing about the game that is at all conducive to a fun experience; if anything, it is explicitly, PAINSTAKINGLY designed to waste your fucking time. Made it through this agonizingly long day after tinkering around with that innocuous new thing you got and learned some of the rules of? Oh wait, after the end of the day, it just fucking kills your mook. Whoopsie! Better restart if you don't wanna make what's yet to come even more painful! Oops, forgot one obscure rule of how a baddie works and now your team that otherwise passes the gear check gets wiped out? Restart!\n\nAnd that's the entire loop. There's no relief to any of it. You play the same days over and over again so as not to trip over the tiny roots that made you fall neck-first last time and all that awaits is more of the same except there's now even more esoteric rules piled on top that you haven't deciphered yet without restarting the cycle of endless save scumming. It's a dreadful, unforgivable lack of respect for the player's time. And being a roguelite (i.e an almost universally terrible genre), you're expected to repeat this fucking torture multiple times.

Lobotomy Corp doesn't have a light at the end of that tunnel, it's just an endless fucking tunnel.

During the \"discovery\" phase of playing the game, each new abnormality, mission, and even new day is able to be approached with an abundance of caution and curiosity. You are, after all, still figuring out How Stuff Works\u2122 and the game is willing to allow you to fumble through messily enough with a bit of sass and a knowing grin - just don't mind the knife being held behind their back, it's probably nothing. Even when ultimately you come into a predicament that necessitates use of a Day 1 reset: the seed of discovery keeps the player engaged and curious as to just what might come next. A good thing, then, that the answers can be more delightfully twisted than expectation may lead one to believe. It's compelling in a way that genuinely kept me playing long hours into the night past when I should've gone to bed.\n\nThe same cannot be said of the second stage: completion. This will come at different points for different folks in their own games - when the veil of mystery has been pulled back enough that all that remains is an intricate puzzle to be placed together over the course of an hours-long grind of known figures and punishing setbacks. Here, where the nervous tension of not knowing if your favorite Agent might be speeding towards an early retirement is replaced with the dull monotony of watching progress bars fill and hoping that (maybe this time around) circumstances won't end up in disaster, is where LobCorp truly becomes a test of will (and navigating sometimes-fiddly controls). Maybe, perhaps, you'll eek out a win and then rewind the ol' Repository so as to not lose quite so much progress as the End of Day screen dutifully reports. By the fourth or fifth time you're doing this: the aforementioned possibility of just looking up the damned story becomes that much more enticing.\n\nI enjoyed LobCorp, but it's definitely not a game I would be surprised to hear someone tell me that they gave up on mid-way through. My own file ended up utilizing a few quality-of-life mods to make the tedious climb back to the final chapter something that I could complete before my interest in the game truly snuffed out from sheer burnout. At time of completion, I was happy to resign the game to fond memories and hope that the sequel has a bit less tedium and just as much unique creativity.\n\nTo end this review, I'll share with you what originally sold me on giving this game a chance: there is boss fights. How the hell do you do that in a management sim game? The answer may surprise you!

And what if some anomalies require (for a relatively reliable result) a specific value range for a stat? What if the guy previously in charge of managing it overleveled the stat naturally... \n\nPLAY IT!", "timestamp_created": 1675362204, "timestamp_updated": 1675362204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132015852": {"recommendationid": "132015852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972718186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2880, "last_played": 1698931110}, "language": "english", "review": "this does to my brain what sugar does to a six year old", "timestamp_created": 1675274387, "timestamp_updated": 1675274387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603115975856781006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131981710": {"recommendationid": "131981710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025192930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1109, "last_played": 1675225580}, "language": "english", "review": "very boring. would ask for a refund but accidentally left the game running overnight.

It gives an 'Access Violation' in memory, which is caused by a programming error that makes the game use up more and more resources until your RAM is all filled up, which crashes the game. To fix this, I installed the 'Optimization Mod' from nexusmods.com. \n\nIn terms of gameplay, I absolutely recommend buying this game.

One thing that does pain me about the game, however, is having to force myself to get desensitized to Agent deaths. Every time a death message pops up, I'm very tempted to press the retry day button, though I force myself to go on. That is, unless the death is one of my Department Captains, my little scrunkly wunklies. The Abnormalities are very interesting, too. I haven't seen a single design I dislike, and, for the most part, any deaths caused by Abnormalities are due to your error. For the most part. There are a few RNG parts and unfair mechanics. I also love Laetitia. And Der Freisch\u00fctz. All in all, I would say that the game is AMAZING. It's story is /very/ intriguing, and I find myself extremely eager to learn more and more about the Lore.

This description is incredibly misleading. When you think of a \"simulation\", one would assume that there would be different aspects you control in the game, but those mechanics are completely shallow. And the \"roguelike\" aspect only comes from the selection of artifacts or monsters you choose from when given the opportunity to do so.\n\nAs far as the whole simulation aspect is concerned, there's very little of it. You can \"hire\" employees, change their equipment and decide what they do, based on the department they work in. That's it. There's really no management of resources, or selections of departments or tools or anything like that.\n\nAs far as the game goes, it's very simple, each successful day completed you choose from a new \"abnormality\" (which is labeled under a serial number). Then you spend the day trying to understand it by studying it while maintaining and containing all of your other abnormalities.\n\nStudying a abnormality is completely a game of guess work and can completely ruin a game until you know what's going on with it. Unless you've watched play throughs and understand what they do and what they need, all you can do is blindly click.\n\nAfter you complete research of a abnormality, it's just a matter of grinding energy and packages from them. That's it. The first couple of day(s) can be fun, but the longer you play, the longer you realize that's there's actually very little gameplay holding this game together. And it gets boring very quickly.\n\nFor almost $25.00 for a \"indie\" game, I would have really expected a lot more based on what they actually advertise. In some instances I would actually argue their STEAM store page may be misleading and possibly false advertising.\n\nIf you can get this game for $5.00 then fine, take a chance.

After reading some of the almost comical requirements to actually 100% the game (e.g. to get the \"true\" ending), I've decided to call it here. If I could give a \"meh\" review I would, but a negative review better conveys my current stance on the game better than a positive one.\n\nMy honest recommendation to people considering LC is to please THOROUGHLY research the game (possibly including a bit of spoiler material!) before deciding to play it till the \"end\". I will try to avoid spoilers below.\n\nPROS:\n- The lore/story (as badly conveyed as it is, in my personal opinion) is fairly interesting. This is a very lively world and everything is not at all as it seems when you first start playing. Also, the reset mechanics are tied into the story itself.\n- The ideas/characters put into this game are very creative. What you do see of the AIs is somewhat endearing\n- The management is initially quite engaging. You have to keep track of a lot, but it is rewarding to clear days with no deaths and well trained agents.\n- The research/upgrades in the game make a big difference and are quite distinct from one another, unlike in some other games where its just a \"+5% damage\" type of system\n- The Boss fights are mostly quite varied and challenging, mostly in a good way though this breaks down a bit at the end.\n- Some of the music tracks are quite good, others get repetitive quickly.\n- The four damage types + weapon/armor variety helps to diversify combat.\n\nNEUTRAL POINTS:\n- Music can get very grating after long sessions. This can be turned off, obviously.\n- This game would massively benefit from the workshop, but no such allowance was made. Fortunately other modding is possible.\n- Sound effects are meh.\n- Graphics/artstyle choices are... meh. They don't endear me or push me away from the game. Up to personal preference whether you like or don't like the cartoony aesthetic.\n- Some players have reported very serious issues with the possesion mechanic not working properly (e.g. some people that should be able to be un-possesed cant be, and so you have to reset). I have not encountered this so far, but be wary.\n\n\n=== NOTE ===\nThankfully, some of the issues that will be outlined in the CONS section can be fixed with mods. In fact, issues that can be fixed, or at least ameliorated with mods will be marked with a \"[Mod full fix]\" or \"[Mod partial fix]\" tag for your convenience in the CONS section below. However, I am judging the game on its own merits, and not on the those of the modders that gave their time & effort to fix its many problems.\n===========\n\nCONS:\n- surprisingly Sub-standard controls. The game has the manager exert very indirect control of agents, and No control of clerks whatsoever. This will often lead to completely unnecessary damage/breaches/deaths that are frustrating setbacks or outright resets. As an example, a major strategy in the game is to put agents into elevators so they can be grouped up and thus fight anomalies in clumps of melees & ranged squads... Instead of just letting the player group them in some custom arrangement.\n\n[Mod partial fix] - You can speed up time in this game, but not nearly enough. Eventually even 2x/2.5x is wildly insufficient for how tedious much of the management phase becomes. \n\n[Mod full fix] - Very poor conveying of (VERY important) statistical information to the player. Part of the game is, obviously, to let the player become a manager of a huge, byzantine facility and make the best of it. LC, however, takes this to excessive lengths. The game plays around with giving the player access to information as part of research/story progression (HP/SP of agents/abnormalities as part of a research from one of the AIs). LC, however, does NOT give info on Shield HP/SP, NUMERICAL HP/SP of agents/abnormalities, NUMERICAL Use-Speed/Range of weapons, NUMERICAL success probability with fully understood abnormalities... This is extremely important information to properly manage the facility!\n\n- Very poor conveying of spatially-related information. The game will not notify you if someone in the facility is taking damage / in combat, nor will it tell you how they died. I suppose this could be a deliberate design decision, but it is one that is hugely irritating to me personally. I much prefer the Rimworld method of alerting you to threats. ALSO, agents can Stack on top of one another, and then you cant easily see their HP/SP\n\n[Mod partial fix] - Many models do not display the correct weapon your agent is holding, which can cause confusion in the middle of an important suppression.\n\n- Again, personal opinion, but the way the story is conveyed is very, very poor. Others might not mind this more \"scattershot\" type of storytelling.\n\n[Mod partial fix] - Unacceptable performance issues that can cause memory leaks. I was shocked to see >95% RAM utilization (out of 32gb DDR5) by this game one night. Be aware you will probably have to limit your play time to a few hours to avoid this. There is also generally poor optimization.\n\n- No spoilers, but a good number of the ordeals/bosses in this game are simply boring timesinks that are occasionally frustrating and generally tedious exercises in kiting for minutes on end. Late game can be pretty egregious in this regard\n\n- No spoilers, but some abnormalities are genuinely run-enders if you are unlucky with their placement, or just rely on frustrating mechanics to not cause immense damage (Like getting \"Normal\" results only). Getting enough abnormalities that care about agent/clerk deaths can cause spirals that go on to cause resets as well, though this is eventually mitigated with execution bullets.\n\n- Eventually ~75% of your abnormalities will be completely ignored in favor of more dangerous (more energy producing / more efficient training) abnormalities. I feel this is a missed opportunity wherein we the player have no reason whatsoever to interact with the vast majority of the facility. \n\n[Mod full fix] - This game is already painfully tedious and (imo) pointlessly time consuming after enough time has gone on that the players has a good grasp of the game. Why can't I queue actions? Some consider this part of the management process, I consider this forced, boring busywork.\n\n- You have no idea how long an agent has been using a tool abnormality and so have to: 1. guess or 2. using a separate abnormality as a makeshift timer or 3. use a real world timer (hope you are not at 1.5/2.5x speed \n in game!). This has genuinely been a huge headache on every run.\n\n[Mod full fix] - Training employees is a near complete guessing game. Perhaps I missed something, but until I read the wiki outside the game itself, I had not idea how my agents stats were being changed as a result of work/suppression/gifts. This is, again, very important information that the game doesn't tell you. I feel like Im seeing a rather unfortunate trend for a MANAGEMENT game.\n\n- This one is subjective, but I feel the way clerks are handled is very strange and could have done with a some overhauling. Essentially clerks provide you with buffs, some of which are fairly important. But eventually you will probably have to cull very large portions of them (usually with execution bullets) to prevent abnormalities from breaching as a response to too many clerk deaths from abnormalities or other events. So you can:\n1. Not cull employees, and so risk breaches, which will probably kill clerks and reduce/lose buffs.\n2. cull employees, and so diminish breach risk, but also reduce/lose buffs.\nThe player is put in a situation where they have buffs when they LEAST need them (start of day), and dont have them when they MOST need them. (middle/late into day).", "timestamp_created": 1673408653, "timestamp_updated": 1673408922, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496527761220932007", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130610397": {"recommendationid": "130610397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054485654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 637, "last_played": 1673436487}, "language": "english", "review": "Why isn't there a Horror or Jumpscare tag for this game what the fuck", "timestamp_created": 1673406528, "timestamp_updated": 1673406528, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477064222097396851", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130594973": {"recommendationid": "130594973", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972444591", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 13739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 472, "playtime_at_review": 11787, "last_played": 1700691988}, "language": "english", "review": "Mainly people are talking about difficulty so as a comparison it's similar to the endgame of Celeste hard but definitely something the average gamer can do.\n\nThe story is very good but you may need to read in between the lines as it's a bit cryptic. \nOverall great game", "timestamp_created": 1673384589, "timestamp_updated": 1673384589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130548376": {"recommendationid": "130548376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138067550", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2143, "last_played": 1669293638}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes. this game is difficult and you will press that undo button a lot\nPlease read the in-game info, it could save you from resetting the days", "timestamp_created": 1673327525, "timestamp_updated": 1673327525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130548316": {"recommendationid": "130548316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142212851", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 5799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "playtime_at_review": 5325, "last_played": 1700075591}, "language": "english", "review": "play it", "timestamp_created": 1673327440, "timestamp_updated": 1673327440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130538094": {"recommendationid": "130538094", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180634412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2885, "last_played": 1680976772}, "language": "spanish", "review": "I am 50 hours in, and I still don't know what I am doing at all.\nThe only thing I know, is that Violence seems to be the answer, and that I need to touch the button.", "timestamp_created": 1673313680, "timestamp_updated": 1673313680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130523072": {"recommendationid": "130523072", "author": {"steamid": "76561199009070035", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4075, "last_played": 1699054140}, "language": "english", "review": "Lobotomy Corporation is a difficult game but one I enjoy immensely.\n\nIt's a good game to play if you enjoy challenge and have the time to sink into it. \nIt's also good for those who enjoy fantasy, management, SCP, as well as watching your little nuggets grow and become the ugliest and strongest possible <3\nThere is no more joy than watching them grow extra eyes on their cheek, maybe where a literal face mask... yuck!
