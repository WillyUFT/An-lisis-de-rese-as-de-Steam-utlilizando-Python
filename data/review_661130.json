(To say, there's more to unpack than the 0.2hr reviews will let on because those users have no patience.)\n\nAs a start, yes, VRChat. As many, [i]many[/i] users both inside and out of CVR like to compare to VRChat, this review will be no different in that regard. On the surface, there is a fairly large amount of overlap with what that game is and does. On the surface. Where CVR differences shine in the current require digging into the minutia of what CVR has to offer, which you will not get on a casual visit, so please keep that in mind if we want to try the game for the first time. The devs of CVR want the game to become more of its own thing over time (Think CVR eventually being the Geocities to VRC's Facebook), but I can't review a game for what it wants to be, only what it is now.\n\nAlso for context, yes, I was also one of the many who was rather disgruntled with VRChat's decision to include EAC into a [i]social VR game[/i], and decided that outside of very specific circumstances was leaving that behind. Not to say you [i]have[/i] to only play one game or the other, I just personally choose to play CVR over VRC as EAC is a non-starter for giving-a-minor-s###-about-my-personal-security reasons. (VRC is exclusively played on a secondary sacrificial machine, or on Linux, now for example.)\nThe difference was I actually commit to things when I say \u201cI'm done with this\u201d.\n\nWith that out of the way,\n\n[h3]Playerbase[/h3]\nYes, it is smaller than VRChat. That is a fact. But, bigger numbers are not the end-all be-all of quality. Frankly, far from it.\n\nThe best way I can describe ChilloutVR in that regard is to imagine the difference between living in a village vs. living in a major city.\nIn a city, you are never going to meet everyone, there's a lot more room for bad actors to play off \u201cHiding in obscurity\u201d, and people naturally will hole up in smaller groups of friends and family, becoming a nesting doll of otherwise completely separate groups. With the only real interaction any individual will have to the wider whole of the population being what a given individual contributes to that city physically. Though due to that, there are great wide variety of things to do in that city.\nIn contrast, in a small village, everyone who lives there knows, or at least is aware of, everyone else that lives there. It's not bustling in overflow like the big city, but it more than makes up for in mutual comradery and a natural filter for the aforementioned bad actors as you're not going to last long if you're trying to ruin everyone else's day. Which results in a far greater quality to the fewer individuals on average you run into with the less in quantity.\nSo if the idea of a \u201cCommunity\u201d, in the genuine organic sense instead of the meaningless buzzword sense, is something that appeals, then CVR's for you.\n\nGetting away from the metaphor, there is a very dedicated regular playerbase to CVR. The thing though, it has its peak times and it has its dead times. You can not jump on literally whenever and expect to get a fair gauge of what the playerbase is like, that's just not how it works. During the evenings EU time, and far more so in the evening/late night USA time are when the most people are going to be on, with Tue/Thu/Sun being the dead days of the week, with Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat being the more active days, Saturday night USA time when the Viviklub is running being the peak of the week. If you wish to give CVR a fair shake, I would recommend getting on peak times specifically as when I say CVR is dead during the off times and days of the week, it is [i]dead[/i]. It's the nature of a more concentrated playerbase, it naturally necessitates this kind of clustering of when people are on.\n\nAlso, as of current no Quest kiddies, so while eventual Pico/Quest support will be a thing, in the moment the lack of support is a hard filter to the worst of [i]that[/i] problem. \n\n[h3]The UI[/h3]\nThis is in here due to the great many complaints about it in the other reviews. Frankly, those complaints seem largely disingenuous. Do I think the UI of CVR is good? [i]F### no.[/i] It has a [i]lot[/i] of usability and legacy crust to resolve, which is going to come in due time as of the writing of this review. But the reason why I say most of the complaints of CVR's menus are disingenuous, I have largely the exact same kinds of complaints about VRChat's UI decisions, to the point whenever I find myself there once in a blue moon, I'm sitting there confounded at where the f### anything is or how to use them.\nWhich is a common scenario going from any given software to another. Talk to a disgruntled Maya user trying to use Blender for another example of this.\nThe thing is, anyone who has played VRC for a extended period of time and is used to how they do things has been \u201cBoil the frog\u201d'd into their mindset and methodology for how to do a UI, and find it difficult to adjust to a different paradigm. Some of which is actual jank that needs to be fixed up do not get me wrong, but the exact same could be said about VRChat's. Except CVR's devs acknowledge it needs to be fixed up, while VRC flat out ignores it's a problem and think it's perfect.\n\n[h3]User Creation[/h3]\nAs I'm coming from a avatar, and by extension now the occasional prop, making background with VRC, [i]holy f### is making avatars in CVR [b]SO[/b] much better than trying to do it in VRC.[/i]\nNo absurdly low networked parameter limit, you actually have [i]ROOM[/i] to do cool things on your avatars.\nProps being a thing means [i]significantly[/i] less screwing around with world constraints or having to do repeat work for multiple avatars.\nThe actual setup in general is FAR less of a faff, no 5 different animators and two other random files to set up avatars properly.\nComponents that are WAY more useful when you find out they exist.\n\nI could go on, but that all is with a caveat: The documentation for most of this in the current is non-existent, with most of the actual knowledge for how to do things coming from some basic youtube tutorials, and asking in the ABI (company running CVR) discord for anything more advanced. This has been a ongoing thing that people have tried to address, but as of the writing it's a case of \u201cBigger fish to fry\u201d, which with CVR's need for development in certain areas still, I get, but is never-the-less a issue that needs to be resolved. Which I have full confidence it will, just again I can only review the here and now.\n\nDespite the caveat, there's also things like the water buoyancy system that was newly introduced, freaking amazing cloth physics by way of Magica Cloth (2), and a bunch of other things coming that make this all a \u201cOnce we get how the paradigm of how things work in CVR, there's SO much that can be done that a certain other game doesn't/won't/[i]can't[/i] do it's insane.\u201d\n\n(Continued in the comments.)", "timestamp_created": 1699649810, "timestamp_updated": 1699649810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149292195": {"recommendationid": "149292195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183361971", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1659521718}, "language": "english", "review": "I think you should Chillout alright VR?", "timestamp_created": 1698815285, "timestamp_updated": 1698815285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504504501819610596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149013401": {"recommendationid": "149013401", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023941600", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1698451761}, "language": "english", "review": "most worlds don't even load", "timestamp_created": 1698452239, "timestamp_updated": 1698452801, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1699193350, "developer_response": "That is not a usual issue but we would like to have a look into addressing it.

I showed up to the community shortly after the controversy broke out regarding VRChat's update adding EAC and banning mods all together. Not as a refugee, mind you, I have had no prior experience with VRChat or anything else like it before that update but after having seen some people recommend this game over VRC, I was curious and decided to check it out and boy oh boy am I glad I did. I was hooked on this right away. Why? The main reason: the community itself. While it is very small compared to VRC, 9 times out of 10 you'll find a friendly face that you can strike up a conversation and goof around with too. Of course there is some bad actors you likely come across but those are few and far in between, in my entire time playing this I've only encountered 2 trolls and 1 crasher. Granted, I typically occupy instances that have low player counts but I digress. Fact of the matter, ChilloutVRs player base is a pleasant bunch of folks.\n\nChillout has a pretty unique feature for this genre of game called \"props\" which is publicly available community made content that anybody can spawn in and play around with much in the same sort of sense as you would expect with, say, Gmod. There's a wide variety of things the community has made from cars, guns, toys, furniture, food, pocket dimensions, writing utensils, meme based stuff, etc. You name it, you'll likely find it. \n\nThe developers are actively working on this game and are doing their due diligence to make it the best it can be. It's a small dev team tho so of course updates are gonna be infrequent but they're trying and that's what matters. They recently started doing monthly blogs to keep everyone up to date on what they plan on doing and how they plan on doing it. You can even check out the AlphaBlendInteractive website to check out what they have done, what they're working on, and what they plan on doing. \n\nUnlike VRC after that one update, CVR has it's own mod support through the use of melon loader and ABI added in their previous update to the game something called the Mod Network What is it? \"The Mod Network is a built-in networking layer that mod developers can utilize. It allows for Mods to communicate between Users in the same instance in a secure way without needing any third-party Networking library or services.\" So yeah. There you go. The modding community has made some well crafted mods that adds some some fun goofy features to the game or some much desired quality of life features as well so if you decided to try this game out. Don't hesitate to check out the mods as well! \n\nOf course with this game being early access, it's not gonna be the best experience out there. The previous update upgraded the game engine to a newer version which, of course, is gonna cause some issues with user made content. Mainly speaking in terms of the shaders used. As it currently stands, VR users are gonna suffer from this shader issue the most compared to the desktop users and there's no real certainty as to if the content makers are gonna fix this issue with their content as a large percentage of them have come and gone from what I can tell.  You wont find much in terms of interactive experiences across the various worlds you find, this is mainly due to absence of any sort of scripting to allow for custom interactive experiences to be possible but some users still have been able to get something done. The menu UI could be better, it's not terrible but I'd argue it could benefit from some improvements. \n\nTL;DR\n-The community is friendly\n-This game has user made item content you can spawn in and play around with\n-The developers are actively improving upon this game.\n-It has good mod support\n-This game being in early access , it's has some flaws. \n", "timestamp_created": 1695257641, "timestamp_updated": 1695257641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547883272171020508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146635195": {"recommendationid": "146635195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352415121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 135, "playtime_at_review": 2436, "last_played": 1700507787}, "language": "english", "review": "When they say \"early access\" they truely mean early access. \n\nThe game in its current state is almost ready to be your VRChat replacement, but does not have the players, yet!\n\nThere is so much potential with ChilloutVR (CVR)!

[b]TL;DR: It's probably not ready to replace VRChat just yet, but keep an eye on it because it correctly does everything that has bothered VRChat users for years.[/b]\n\n\nI won't sugarcoat it, [b]THIS GAME IS DEFINITELY EARLY ACCESS.[/b]\n\nThe negative reviews are right that the UI needs a LOT of work and that the already limited community content was further reduced by the recent Unity upgrade. [strike]It's features are also relatively limited, it doesn't have the avatar interactions VRC has which I am especially disappointed by among many other things.[/strike] I've been informed that avatar interactions were actually added since I posted this review so that's good. I'll have to redo this thoroughly after I can find some time to play it again enough.\n\n[h1] HOWEVER[/h1]\nI see such an incredible amount of potential in this game and the devs behind it seem passionate enough to realize that potential with time. Some things that CVR even now does better that VRChat:\n- [b]Performance:[/b] The best FPS I can get on VRChat is 40 on a good day, but more often it's more like 25... CVR gives me a consistent 60 minimum. \n- [b]Community Communication:[/b] The CVR team does an excellent job keeping the community up to date on what they're doing. They make monthly community posts here on steam describing update progress. Versus VRChat that dropped news of a universally hated update mere days before it went live.\n- [b]Modding:[/b] CVR actually supports it! And mods currently implement a good number of things the base game doesn't yet.\n- [b]Handling of Mature Content:[/b] Mature content isn't outright banned on CVR. It is hidden behind a free DLC with the mature tag. People who want to see mature content are free to do so while those who don't want to see it don't need to. And, assuming their parents setup parental controls on their child's Steam account, kids still can't access it.\nOverall, CVR just gives a far better impression towards its users. It feels like they actually care. Again, CVR is definitely still lacking in terms of featureset and content, I won't deny that. But it's still early access, the limited features will be resolved with a bit more time, and then it's up to us to fix the content issue.\n\n[h1]My Recommendation[/h1]\nPut it in your library and keep an eye on their posts. Check back every few months and see if it's gotten anything you really want from VRChat.

It is promising as a platform, but in its current state, i dont see any reason to ditch VRChat. Here are my issues (specifically in comparing it to VRChat)\n\n1: The UI is definitely worse. Its very hard to figure out how to do things at first, and i still struggle with certain parts. VRChat is way more user friendly.\n2: There isnt a player base.  Its hard to join a VR community that essentially barely exists. I have not seen more than 50 people online at any given time.\n3: A recent upgrade to Unity ChillOutVR implemented screwed with a bunch of maps. Its cool that they allowed the older maps to exist, but they may as well have removed them, because a lot of them are barely playable due to the screwed up shaders, and it applies to some of the avatars too. Yeah, VRChat had a similar issue where they changed the SDK (i believe is what its called, their map creator) and decided to delete its older maps, but in doing that, meant that every map they had worked, where ChillOutVRs approach just makes the game look buggy and bad if you pick the wrong maps.\n4: Some of its options are limited and confusing. My main issue is button mapping, which as far as im concerned, doesnt exist. The buttons on your controller and what they do cannot be changed. (And lord, i dont know why they made disabling finger tracking one of the main buttons and not just a option in the settings. I accidentally activate it all the time and its frustrating) Im not 100% sure this is the case, but i searched for a while, and the lack of guides online due to this games very small community makes navigating the options a bit hard.\n5: This is more of a personal gripe, but the need to download a seperate DLC to view any avatar remotely NSFW, regardless if its something small that really isnt NSFW, is pretty stupid. Just have that be a thing you can change in the game, not be a seperate DLC. Its just an annoying and unnecessary step.\n\nAll this being said, there are some positives.\n\n1: You can look up avatars rather than having to find a world to do that. Its way more conveinient doing it that way.\n2: This same search bar can be used to look up props you can spawn into the world that vary in meme value and size. You can just shove a roller coaster into a world if you want, and i love that.\n3: Im not a content creator myself, but ive heard its a lot more user friendly to upload maps and avatars into ChillOutVR, (though due to the new Unity update, most maps have to be upgraded).\n4: Flying is a thing that comes automatically in the game, rather than having to look for specific avatars that do it, which is cool for maps you just want to screw around on. Though realistically, most maps will probably disable it.\n\nThats about it. Anything else i didnt mention, VRChat either does equally as good or better. ChillOutVR has a lot of promise, but i cannot see myself switching to it anytime soon. Heck, most/all of the maps i go to are maps that were ported from VRChat (which are all unplayable at the moment due to the unity upgrade by the way). Its fun to go into it in a one day journey, but then youll just stick to VRChat for everything else. Maybe one day ill be redoing this review if it gets better, but i just cannot reccomend this game for the long term at the moment at the moment.", "timestamp_created": 1691691333, "timestamp_updated":

Drone mode allows you to fly the camera to where you want instead of positioning by hand.\n[*] No subscriptions or crypto unlike other social VR platforms.\n[*] Seems to be a scripting frontend in the works for avatar, prop, and world creation. \n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1687121384, "timestamp_updated": 1687121384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595569014549255371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139929611": {"recommendationid": "139929611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235837310", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1658882006}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't even like this game", "timestamp_created": 1686551338, "timestamp_updated": 1686551338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484266787767410278", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139874857": {"recommendationid": "139874857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078650337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 449, "last_played": 1691112582}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]tl;dr: this rocks[/h1]\nthis literally is the perfect mash of NeosVR and VRChat combined.\n[b]two major selling points[/b]\ncompared to vrchat:\n    - supports mods and updated unity\n    - has significantly higher average fps\ncompared to neos:\n    - actually uses an editor to setup avatars and worlds, similar to vrchat\n    - both vrchat and chilloutvr have significantly better performance\n\na lot of these negative reviews have fair points! such as smaddy's review. all of those points are perfectly valid points. if any of those points bother you, i'd recommend following this games updates or discord.\n\nhampter", "timestamp_created": 1686464545, "timestamp_updated": 1686952308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495903134346008301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139752489": {"recommendationid": "139752489", "author": {"steamid": "76561199111558425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1670, "last_played": 1698053795}, "language": "english", "review": "solid game, lacking in players though", "timestamp_created": 1686256110, "timestamp_updated": 1686256110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139662840": {"recommendationid": "139662840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417905727", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1672958927}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great Social VR community.

All user content, avatars, worlds, and props are encrypted. Stuff you made and upload won't be stolen.\n\nAlso props, in-game objects can be anything. You can legit make anything you want and add it to the game. It is the thing that is beyond amazing and cool about this social sandbox game. There is a nice in-depth tagging system to find what you're looking for. Plus you can tailor your experience to what you want with an avatar and props. Don't like flashing lights and loud noises? You can disable that and not deal with those things, it is a very smart feature that improves a lot of users' quality of life. It is very much GMOD in spirit and I think a lot of people feel right at home here.\n\nThe Developers and moderators are really going above and beyond for this platform.

Its more akin to Garry's Mod (GMod) over anything else. From the systems currently implemented and to the ones on the drawing board, ChilloutVR (CVR) at this moment in time has that sporadic chaotic energy that some [b] Older [/b] GMod fans would appreciate.\n\n   As someone with mild social anxiety [spoiler] and fairly weak social skills [/spoiler] the one thing that surprised me the most was the community. [spoiler] I may get a bit emotional here, please bear with me [/Spoiler] Genuinely my heart goes out to the users that populate the rather few public lobbies at any given time, they honestly have to be some of the most brilliant and most passionate minds in the VR-Scape. A great number of them you'll find are constantly working on something in the background while they are in game, constantly trying to push the boundary of whats achievable in such a platform. Yet they are usually willing to stop for a moment and listen, whether it's to help exchange technical advice or to simply be an open ear. A lovely bunch they are so please don't ever be afraid to ask for help.\n\n   I'm terms of administration this game probably has one of the most in-depth systems I've seen, Developers constantly roaming the lobbies, File encryption, Filter and Tag System's, A working partnership with a web security company, Hell I even saw the Founder of Alpha Blend Interactive (ABI) and CVR simply checking on how everyone was doing once [spoiler] which was both fucking awesome and nerve racking for someone like me [/spoiler] . Then there's the settings....soo many settings. They give you all the settings you could ever need to moderate your own experience within CVR, from content filtering settings to limiters that give you granular control over what is rendered on your end. The end goal of the developers from what I've heard is to protect users while giving next to full control over their experience while in game which is nutty if you ask me but deserves mad respect. All this without resorting to a half baked kernel based Anti-Cheat implementation. The Devs genuinely care for the users and the user experience and are usually open to answering questions and helping out whenever they can.\n\n   Welp anyways I've been working at this review for nearly two hours now, there is still soo much I could talk about when it comes to the many features and systems that go on within this game but I'm getting a bit burnt out. \n\n   Please give this game a fair chance, don't just login for ten minuets and then dip, you'll just end up missing out on something incredible. Don't be afraid to ask for help, there are many users who are willing to lend out their time.

So I know my ways around Unity and quickly pick up new dev tools such as the CCK.\n\nAs a content creator:\nI really like working with the CCK and it gives me tools to very quickly set things up in my worlds, such as drag & drop toggles, animator drivers, audio, basically anything where a user interacts with a world where no need for any advanced scripting or node graphs are needed.\n\nThough, the lack of scripting is holding me back on some fronts, especially PvE combat worlds, but that will soon be released and with it I will release my own full PvE package for other creators to use to quickly create their own worlds.\n\nAvatars are really easy and quick to set up, one can skip out a lot on making animators for toggles and instead use the CCK to create toggles with a quick Drag & Drop system. Very flexible in ways you can adjust your avatar, even Avatar Scaling work perfect and quick to set up.\n\nProps are so nice to have, being able to carry any item over between avatars and be able to spawn them into any world as well. Seen full PvP tanks and fighters, starships, mini-worlds, weapons, games, event / community newspapers etc, it's crazy the different things people create with props.\n\nAnother big positive in my opinion as a content creator is the encryption of content, they do a really good job at protecting against ripping which shows they care about the creators. The Terms of Services are also very content creator friendly.\n\nSo far, I have created 6 worlds and 8 avatars during my time here since mid 2022.\n\nAs a player:\nI really love the community and public instances here, a lot of friendly people that openly interact with others when approached, many helping each other out and just trying to make the platform really good. It makes me happy to see this and makes me want to spend time in publics.\n\nMature DLC is a very good addition to the platform, separating Violence / Suggestive / Nudity into a DLC to minimize the exposure of that towards minors but also for people who just don't want to see it. It keeps those things under check in a good way without banning them.\n\nSomething that surprised me was how much the devs engage with the player community in publics, been fun meeting several of them over time, to me it shows dedication towards their own platform.\n\nThere have been some bad people I have encountered during my time, but you can't avoid that anywhere on the internet. The moderation team is quick to handle issues, and you can just like devs see some moderator helping out to solve issues in instances and engage with players. Past two months I can't really remember running into any bad player.\n\nSummary:\nI really like the platform, many positives and few kinks.

It hasn't been around as long as VRC but has made leaps and bounds in QoL improvements and persionalization features. The props feature is wild, you can still make avatar specific props but at the same time they've added the ability to make props you can load up with any avatar! Props like custom pens and keyboards and such are no longer avatar specific. you can add vehicles as props too.\n\nAs far as optimization goes it seems to be in a paradox of being better optemized than VRChat while also still being worse off, but with frequent updates and plans to bring the game to the latest versions of unity, they're expecting a jump in performance. \n\nThe game isn't quest compatible which is unfortunate but it also means you don't have noisy children running around either. and with a smaller user base you'll find a tough time finding active instances. Playing last night at time of writing and there was quite literally only 2 active instances in the whole game, public at least. HOWEVER it was in one of those instances I found a group of regulars who really showed me the fun of ChilloutVR, I had to turn on my prop options but they showed me so much. I'll very much have to say CVR seems to have a very fun future and if it can get more players, it'll be a great time. Apparently they're bringing scripting into the game which will be an interesting thing there. \n\nThere are major improvements that need to be made in its UI though, It's just as unorganized as VRChat's UI but not as appealing. it has room for improvement and as of now I wouldn't count it a replacement for VRC. but it's getting there.

The features are miles above the other game enough to where they steal them to try to compete, but they wont be able to with what the future beholds for this game. The prop system here is amazing, and is a must for any new players to try out, and there is a lack of avatar worlds due to the fact you can search up avatars in the main menu so there isnt much of a need. There are a few issues with lag on some people, which easily can be fixed in the settings menu, and the servers occasionally will time out if you are in the USA playing on an EU server or vice versa, but keep in mind the player base is small so theres no need for overkill servers at this point. it also can be confusing for new players to figure out controls in vr as there is no native keybindings other than using steamvr profiles to change the binds. There is a few quirks that takes some getting used to, but for a game thats only now pushing 2 years old at the time of writing, and never had a need to really push for quick updates with the 3 players it had average before people began moving here, its about what you would expect from any indie game in an infant stage. This game is definitely not bad at all though, theres much worse. the fact people can play on laptops from 2010 with little issue and still average over 60 fps is a big thing, and performance is expected only to improve. This game has a lot in store, and so much to come. I would recommend giving it a chance for more than the launch time, and learn that it is worth your time. and hey, the more people who play, the more content creators will wish to create for this game which will bring more things to do, and help raise player counts. doesnt do any good to join, complain then leave. as i always say, be part of the solution, not the problem.

Chillout uses a more current version of Dynamic Bones which is far better optimized than the one used in VRChat. I apologize for my flawed understanding ^.^'. Merry Christmas~!\n\nI personally maintain that I love VRChat and that the game is a massively improved product after the EAC update. VRChat on an overall feature level is still at this point the superior product in my opinion. Unlike many people in the CVR community, I have no dirty feelings regarding VRC or its developers. Though the people with those dirty However I do see in ChilloutVR the bones of something that could surpass VRC.\n\nChilloutVR has its own charm. It is an immensely better optimized experience (getting double the FPS at higher people counts than VRC on similar worlds) and is an overall free-er experience. You can upload and insert your own props for example!\n\nThe first person I met on CVR showed me around and tossed me in a prop that teleported you 2 kilometers into the sky to show off a horror maze he made. We didn't even leave the world. Another person put down a prop that created a massive space battle at the edge of the skybox that was bad*** to look at.\n\n[strike][i]However one of the primary issues I am wary of is the over-reliance on dynamic bones. Dynamic bones are a highly unoptimized technology not meant for the scale it was implemented in VRC and still is in CVR. For a long time there was a false rumor that VRC entirely ran on a single CPU thread because of how dynamic bones specifically are simulated.[/i][/strike] \n\n[strike]However I have been told that there are people working on a solution to this problem and I wish them all the luck in the world. If dynbones can be replaced with some comparable or superior in quality to physbones then this game will genuinely be a more stable experience then VRC in all respects.[/strike] Feature-parity would then make it a far superior experience overall.\n\nChilloutVR, from my experience thus far, has been a game with a respectful mature community willing to introduce the wonders of its experience and quirks to new users.

When i came to this game last October It had the same feel to VRC but..less people, less toxicity, new gadgets like props, a video player and people helped me understand the game mechanics and settings. What more could you ask for right? \n\nWell since my computer is half a decade old about 14/15 times i join a world with a video player and people are using it i would crash and have to start the application over again. I ask people if there was any way to solve the problem but for a good number of months all i received was \"Seems like a skill issue\" or \"get a new computer\"... thanks... It wasn't until about a month ago that someone told me that all i had to do was disable a file on my file explorer to not load the video player. That helped in letting me join my friends but it never game me the same experience that they can be laughing at a funny clip while I\u2019m just watching a black screen. \n\nWithout being able to watch movies and clubs not really being my thing the best thing i have left is trying to make conversation with everyone here. In general I want to say beforehand that I care about everyone in the community and want the best for the community itself. I will admit that i am not the best at that talent so when i try the next best thing of being silly as an ice breaker it was met with a wide range of different reactions. I've been hit, mocked, gas-lighted, teased, spat on, ignored, vote kicked, and blocked for the worst range and on the lighter side i have  been hugged, complimented, friend requested, given small talk,  moaned, and licked at. The least i can say would be that it is an 'interesting' community but it is up to perspective of what that means. For a majority of the time i experienced, unless you bring up something that they really love talking about you would be ignored. Without being able to talk to know conversation topics it is very difficult to have a genuine wholehearted conversation with someone. \n\nWhen i figured out there was nothing really left i can do with the game i wanted to delete my account (note this was before April 2023). When i went to ask my community guide on how to delete my account since i did not see any icon on the ABI page he immediately went on the defensive and without any clear answer he blocked me. I asked the legend member there for advice and was told to check out the ABI discord. When i went to the ABI discord I noticed that you cannot send a ticket to get your account deleted. Instead you have to send an email to the dev team to say that you want your account deleted. I went to a dev member to know what is the process to delete your account and about 2 hours later of interacting with the dev team i was given an impossible request to send a email of my abi (which was deleted before and i replaced), a transaction receipt (which requires you to pay money to obtain) and a file code of something to verify its you. I got the new email i believe and with the help of a dev i found the file code and sent it back only to get ghosted and when i confronted about it i was given the work around that \"there wasn't enough\". Thus ended my ability to delete my account without paying money (any pressing of the issue got me blocked by a dev) until this month it made the whole process way easier.\n\nIn summary, this game is the closest to a successful virtual reality platform to me and that despite the problems i have encountered by the community or dev team, I do wish that this game becomes way larger than it is now as it truly deserves!\n\n\nUPDATE (9/16/23):\n\nThis developments of the game on the side of functionality have elevated from my last posting but the community as a whole has taken the abyssal drop i never expected. The entire community is filled with those whom are not mentally secure to follow a normal conversation with most likely because there is no pillar of normalcy that hasn't been desecrated. I can only list a handful of people that are normal in a sense but the rest will spark drama because it gets them off basically. The worst part as someone who likes the game itself is that most of the negative reviews of the game are correct! There is no tutorial, the account creation is way more tedious, there is barely anyone who is on public worlds, the toxicity has increased in general to the point of cannibalizing its own veterans, and worst of all the idea of this community being nothing more than a hate group of VRChat is ABSOLUTELY TRUE. \n\nI debated with myself multiple times if i should involve myself with trying to separate the idea of the game from being nothing more than a shadow of VRC or not but the point is that the community would be more than happy to outcast or scapegoat you to make them feel better as they sink before blaming another. Last time i tried it for deleting my own account i was successful in the end but the community already has outcast me as just a troublemaker.\n\nI do not know if i should try or not but i know for certain that the ship cvr stands on will rot and die from the inside out if i just watch from the sidelines.

Literally Triple my time compared to VRC where I still haven't Touch it since EaC and TBH  forgotten about it. ChilloutVR is better than most people want to admit, out of the three main Platforms I can comfortably say ChilloutVR is the best out of the bunch.\n\nCon 1) The one thing I think that is truly keeping new users away is the lack of users, and the fact a decent chunk of the existing community is tucked away in private or friend only worlds. Gives the illusion that its dead when in reality its fairly active.\n\nCon 2) There's a lot of \"Dead Worlds\" and 1:1 VRC Worlds and or Less. Most of the worlds in CVR haven't been updated in a long time or are just \"Crappy\" Versions compared to VRC. That mostly because those People uploaded them and never came back. Assholes...\n\nCon 3) I Have a Patience of a Saint so this doesn't bother me but I know it bother others but Slow updates. I don't mind it and in fact you can see the Devs actively work on it in the Discord and in-game. Really this isn't a Con Tbh more of a Statement but the fact I know people don't like slow updates I'll Count it as A con\n\nPros) Theres way, WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too many to list. You'll just be better off trying CVR and finding out yourself.\n\n\nOLD:\n3 things: \n\n1#\nThe ABI Team (ChilloutVR developers) are some of the nicest people I have met so far in terms of developers. They not only interact with the community, hangout with us, talk and do stupid stuff. But also experience issues we experience as well and not tell us its our hardware or that our problems doesn't Exist. \nHell even one time a few of the Developers went into a Public Lobby and tried helping as many ppl as they can because a Mod broke and at the time no one knew why but the Devs. One of them was patience with me since I'm a Mute and I couldn't communicate to them as easily as everyone else. Not a single time in any game I ever played had someone as high up as a Dev. Take their time and tell me how to fix my issues in Real Time. \n\n2#\nThis platform encourages Creation, and the safety of their Creators and their users. \nThe Safety Settings is exactly what I wanted, the 18+ DLC is exactly what is needed, and THIS IS NOT PEER TO PEER CONNECTION!!! \nFor starters, the Devs. Basically created their own servers from the ground up, filled with things that protects both The API and Users. You can not rip anything at all, so Avatar Creators are ensured that their stuff safe (this also include props). If you want something that you saw the only thing you can do is ask for it or have someone remake it for you. \nLastly, whatever you make and upload to the API is yours and yours alone. Unlike VRchat where if you upload anything it's THEIR PROPERTY not yours. \n\n3#\nThe community is unlike any I ever seen, Its filled to the brim with incredibly nice ppl. Creative individuals who wants to make stuff and helps others with no string attach. Everyone is so welcoming and kind. No one yelling at you for making YT videos or calling you Slurs. If you have questions ppl within ear shot will immediately come to your rescue, if you try Crashing or have malicious mods. The Community, Devs, and Moderator will literally eat you alive and ensure you will never play again. \nIts like where one big happy Family expect we dont know each other and  were all just incredibly kind. \n\nIn other words, ChilloutVR is not VRchat nor Neos.

And it already has loads of potential unlike VRChat currently being reckless. Thus for the measure, ChilloutVR has much easier management like having filter system to load and not load avatars with the likes and interests you want. I'd say streamer friendly even. I think the most creativity and fun you can get also here is that it has prop options where on any world you can spawn props by your own will and proceed on extending that fun to a whole new level. Fair disclaimer that paywalls and mature filters are behind the DLC section but it's more appropriate looking and makes more sense than in VRChat. You pay once, you keep it forever.\n\nThe only cons I can share it has really small amounts of users: mostly furries which isn't much to interact with... but if it ever gets actual users it should get naturally in its path. If any kinds of mass attraction gives ChilloutVR a boost, it might as well gain same attraction VRChat unfortunately but it is what it is. Filters got you covered at least.\n\nOnce again, has lots of potential. Has even lots of progress done than VRChat over the years and we're talking about ChilloutVR doing actual care and dexterity given while being almost 2 years old or more while at alpha stages!

ABI takes an approach where they want to prevent having adults expose themselves digitally to children. VRC, after many years, has yet to implement any system to formalize NSFW avatars and add in filters for them, despite having vast resources, in the form of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars.

ChilloutVR has surprisingly fewer active world instances compared to VRChat. However, it does have several issues - I've listed playability issues first.\n\nDesktop play specs: Debian 11 bullseye, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core (16 threads), AMD RX 580 8GB, 32 GB DDR4\n\nThe microphone voice activity doesn't seem to be adjustable - my mic is practically always on (and no, I don't have that option enabled). Sometimes the game stutters or freezes for brief or extended periods of time.\n\nStrangely, setting AA to off results in increased CPU usage (~300%) while still managing good framerates (around 144 FPS) under ideal conditions, whereas setting it to 4x (the default) results in reduced CPU usage (~90%) but a measly 15-30 FPS.\n\nAs in VRChat, other players' avatars are a severe hindrance to performance. It's practically impossible to fine-tune the advanced safety settings when you don't have any data on how many polys, etc. a particular player's avatar has. This makes it very difficult to optimize performance at all. Additionally, clicking and dragging on numerical slider settings does not offer precision. It would be useful to be able to input a number, click a +/- button, or shift+scroll on a setting to adjust its value by some setting-respective multiple.\n\nNotably, the \"Reset Settings\" button in the menu does not work at all. I expected the button to reset the settings for the currently open menu, but nothing happens. It would be useful to be able to see what the default setting are. Tooltips could come in handy, too.

This is a LONG review! There is a simple TLDR paragraph below! \nI want to preference this review by saying that CVR is everything i wanted in a VR game. The devs care, the small community is caring, and the recent fiasco with VRC has pushed alot of people away and into CVR's new user base to find a new home where their work matters. But unfortunately I must also go over some fundamental flaws that I find with the game's community that bleeds over into the game as well as why the current player base is falling off so quickly as of writing this review. \n    To start off, so far alot of things have been addressed with this game. Server stability? Check. Exploiters and rippers? Encrypted uploads and daily patches to make malicious client code monkey's work their asses off? Check. Updates to the CCK (this games version of the unity SDK) to make it more intuitive? Check. \n    The ONLY problem now is the fact that new comers CANNOT bring over content from VRchat to this game. If VRC SDK to CCK converters were more practical then the barrier of entry for taking someone's payed for content and porting it over would be astronomically easier for the average Joe. As is, however, due to lack of  *community* (notice i said community and not DEV) content the current SDK to CCK converter we have is subpar. (As these converters are made by *community* modders to make converting avatars to a different creator engine a bit easier.) Sometimes it doesn't bring over the vesimies properly. Sometimes it f*cks up animations/gestures.\n\nNOTE! If these converters f*ck up an animation/ vesimie (in fact anything to deal with animations/using the unity animator at all.) then the average Joe is f*cked. You can look at yourself either getting into unity creating and trouble shooting and taking up your general time to try and figure out why your avatar won't work or you can go back to the game where your favorites are and where the fbx files you own actually work. (spoiler alert, most people are going to pick the option of least resistance.)\n    Most people who buy avatars usually only buy them as is, then get someone to work on them for a commission fee. These people don't understand how Unity works, nor want to go through the troubleshooting problems of making their previous avatar work on another game's SDK. \n    Unfortunately, the bleeding of CVR's relevance is also compounded on the fact that learning the CCK is out of the question at the moment for the new user. The new user needs to start with VRC's SDK to learn the fundamentals before coming over to the CCK (unless of course, they have a friend). The reason why that is, is because there is BARELY ANY recorded/written documentation, tutorials, or straight up videos on how to work the CCK. There was a new wave of documentation on this games forums and discord channel, but the forums only surged with tutorials on how to convert a VRC avatar to a CVR avatar and how to do some of the basics of the CCK editor regarding AAS (Advanced Avatar Settings). Hell, the forum tutorial post only goes over the most fundamental basics on how to get your avatar working from the VRC SDK. Visimies f*cked? too bad, gestures f*cked? go lurk in the official discord channel or beg for help every day. I am being serious when I say barely anyone wants to write or document the CVR CCK animator due to \"how much time and effort it would take to explain everything.\" Which is fair. Nobody is obligated to waste their time creating this sort of content and helping newbies out. But because nobody wants to do this for what is arguably ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT UNITY TOOLS TO LEARN, and barely anyone has, this game is HEAVILY suffering from it due to newbies  being unable to read up on the non existent written/video tutorials to help troubleshoot themselves.\n    Suddenly over 20k people are clamoring for your new service trying to move to your new game but unfortunately, the new game doesn't support their avatar(s) or something broke on it requiring them to now take potentially weeks upon weeks to fix it. People aren't willing to lose everything they owned and payed for to support a new IP. People also aren't willing to learn 3 different software programs, and take weeks working with them just to make their avatars work. It just isn't happening. People were MOVING from VRC, thus trying to bring their avatars they payed for with them.  Hell, I myself have tried CVR but couldn't get my avatars I payed for to work even after reading all the forum posts and lurking in the official discord so i simply went back to VRC. (Now granted I have been taking the hard road, and have been learning Unity, substance3DPainter, and Blender, but until I get confident in those enough and learn how they work fundamentally I'm not touching the CCK with a 10ft pole until some dev backed content regarding how specifically the animator and vesimies works differently compared to the SDK comes out, or community made tutorials become more common place then the dried up wasteland of content we have now.) \n    The point of the above is to state that  if you want to port your avatar from VRC to Chillout VR you need to know how blender, substance3Dpainter, and Unity work. (aka you know them well enough you probably sell clothing assets, can sculpt in blender reliably,  and or take basic commissions every now and then.) If you don't care for learning this stuff then good luck porting ANYTHING from VRC to CVR. Unless you have a friend who is willing to do it for you, you're sunk in the water without any alternative. \n    And none of this is the developers fault. This is all simply a byproduct of just exactly how small CVR was until this massive wave of players overswept them. Now the waves are receding and the devs and community are finding out that they hadn't prepared anything to keep player's attention and avatars over on this game in case of this happening. \n    Due to the above mentioned reasons on why players are leaving, the only people staying are content creators. Which is fine. This game needs them. But alot of content creators go to where the people are to make friends, and share their content. It won't be likely that they stay here unless its to support each other which would be the ideal outcome. With a web of interconnected content developers supporting each other, they'll be able to create things for themselves and others, tutorials, assets, mods, props, worlds, and much much more to slowly but surely make it easier and convenient to allow new comers to more easily port over their avatars or even help them create one themselves. \n\nTL:DR The lack of a community, made CVR unprepared for the massive influx of people that came in. Due to the non existant content, tutorials, servers, and other community made (and some dev) content, people could not easily move over from VRC to CVR due to how hard it was to port their avatars. Most people aren't going to just drop everything to move and support a new IP. There has to be compromise. They had already made the move even if their friends weren't going, they weren't going to make the move, lose their friends, AND lose their avatars too. \n    I'll end this review off with this. I'm learning all these things because when someone said it would be too much work to teach us newcomers the CCK animator I got pissed. I want to support this game. I DON't want to support VRC. I don't want to support a company that is backed by Eastern Investors who are so out of touch with their  GENERAL community. I want a game that has competent devs running the helm. Who know what it will take to make their game, and I want to be a part of something new to allow this platform to take off. I will learn Unity on VRC just so I can hop into the CCK, play around with it and then hopefully learn it to the point I can document the animator. It will take time, but, hopefully it will be worth it once I either complete my journey, or someone else does it. \n    \n", "timestamp_created": 1661400683, "timestamp_updated": 1661400683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510752677917480469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121168103": {"recommendationid": "121168103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292545821", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1693015575}, "language": "english", "review": "its really good and runs better than VRC.

We also need better tools and proper UI to keep those players longer than an hour.\n\n----\nend\n----\n\nThis platform has a ton of potential but really needs to work on its outside image & tooling for creators.

In my opinion it has a better foundation than VRChat, though it's behind in development. There are a few things that stand out to me over VRChat, though. One is the lack of loading screens when transitioning between worlds. It feels really good and more seamless than world hopping in VRC.\nI also find myself getting more frames in Chillout VR than I ever do in VRChat. In simple worlds with friends, even with dynamic bones I get 100-120 FPS, I honestly forget how smooth high FPS felt. It makes the game feel more immersive.\n\nIt also has a lot of curation tools that are absent from VRChat, the safety settings are more robust, though there isn't a ranking system like VRC. There's an avatar search, which is very nice for getting started in the game without hours of world hopping looking at public avatars. \n\nThe game also allows you to make and share props, which is really cool. Someone spawned a car and someone else was able to drive it. Someone also gave me a nerf gun I could fire at people. \n\nCurrently, the IK system and the UI are pretty complicated, and can feel pretty jarring at first. Though the devs have mentioned they are working on reworking it. \n\nThe creators also stated they're currently reaching out to mod creators to help iron out some of the rough spots in their game currently, so expect third party fixes to things like UI and Fullbody tracking. \n\nThere's usually people around to chat to, and I haven't had any issues with connectivity lately so it seems like that's been sorted out. It really just feels like very early VRChat, event he community.

The moderators also actually moderate the platform, unlike in VRChat, so it's a much safer and less toxic place to be. The developers also actively engage with users on Discord and in-game, which is always nice to see.\n\nThe CCK is a lot easier to work with for avatars than VRChat's nightmarish SDK, and has some nice features (like an actual in-game color picker for parameters, which I didn't even realize I needed in life). The worlds side of things is pretty much on par with VRChat's SDK2, with a few extra niceties. I also appreciate the prop system and the actual proper content sharing system, which allows you to upload an avatar to your account and share it directly with friends (or clients if you're doing avatar commissions).\n\nThis is a tiny thing, but the camera is also really neat. It has a cute little drone mode that lets you get some nice shots of worlds and stuff, and it has a (slightly janky right now) orbit mode, which you can use to get some pretty cool shots. My only critiques there are that the orbit mode behavior isn't super clear (it orbits the camera, not the player) and the focus mode could really use a point autofocus option.\n\nIn general, CVR shows a lot of potential, and it seems to be doing everything right that VRChat kept doing wrong.

many others have come here after the great EACpocalypse of vrchat, so a fair bit of this will be comparing to that.. within reason of course \n\nLets start with some positives\nSecurity:\none of the biggest and in my opinion important differences between vrc and cvr is that security issues are not just simply ignored\nvrchat has been suffering a crashing and malicious modding problem since pretty much the early days\noften a lot of these issues arent fixed for months, if at all, crashing remains practically unaddressed to this day\nCVR on the other hand implemented what is the anticrash mods we used to have in VRC, this was done together with previous modders, of which a fair few are part of CVRs team now\nSecurity issues like the funny floor drop that happened during the early wave was fixed within a day or 2, for example\nOther issues are fixed before they become a problem thats widely abused to begin with\n\nAs a side effect of this its actually much rarer to have any malicious activity at all, ironically you can just leave the avatar anticrash features disabled, since their simple existence is deterrent enough (the smaller playerbase may also be a part of why malicious people dont bother, but more about that later)\n\nThe IK (how your body moves, very important for full body users):\nIn the initial wave, CVR was using a fairly old and janky version of iktweaks, yes that is the mod that existed for vrchat, but built in\nThis has since been upgraded and, for the most part, is much closer to what the mod was later on\nThe clear advantages here are that you can actually adjust your IK settings to match you and your avatar, something vrchat simply refuses to do as they try to go for a one size fits all solution, resulting in a one size fits a specific kind of rig only mess\nOther things that make it better are its update rate, which means that remotely it will update a lot faster than vrchats very low and extremely interpolated and smoothed mess, issues like your body vibrating if you dare to turn your head are also nowhere to be found\n\nModding:\nCVR allows non malicious modding, which stands in stark contrast to vrchat that only had tolerated and now actively destroyed it (despite it only having killed wholesome modding and malicious modding being just as rampant as before)\nif you are familiar with the old VRC Modding group, it essentially just turned into the ChilloutVR modding group\nYou can find lots of neat features and fixes that the CVR team wasnt able to implement yet for various reasons (like priority, time)\n\nProps:\nYou can spawn props, anytime, anywhere*\n*If the map isnt set to disallow this, the absolute vast majority of maps will allow it however\nProps can be a fun toy to mess around with, spawning avatar independent things that you can set to do plenty of similar things as you would with an avatar, as a creator\nProps can be interacted with by you and other people\n\nSearching:\nThe game has a built in avatar, prop and as expected world search\nYou can find this at the bottom middle of the main (the big not attached to your hand) menu, the search is universal for all, simply put in what you wanna search for, then on the left side you can view the results for avatars, props, worlds and users\nsadly this is limited to 30 in each\n\nNSFW Content:\nThis is allowed by the game, assuming your content is tagged appropriately\nYou need the free mature content dlc to enable seeing NSFW tagged content, sadly its unobtainable in some countries like germany\nNSFW being allowed however does NOT mean you can freely be NSFW\nYou are still not allowed to participate in NSFW activity outside of private instances, or run around naked\nYou are however covered, if tagged appropriately, by accidental wardrobe malfunctions, or your avatar having detailed naughty bit textures as long as you are wearing clothes over it\n\nThe content filter:\nTheres a pretty decent list of tags content can be tagged with\nYou can choose to not see certain types of content by simply disabling it in the content filter settings\nSome of these will block the avatar entirely, others will just remove things like particles\nAvatar creators have the ability to tag specific parts of their avatar that will then just get removed instead of the entire avatar\n\nNow for some bad things\nThe overall feeling of \"jank\" and lack of polish:\nIf you have already tried CVR or are about to, you may notice how the interface looks very placeholdery\nThat is because it essentially is, you can find some unimplemented features here, or settings that simply dont do anything\nThe look is definitely in dire need of an upgrade\nAs well as trying to click on a checkbox often just launching you to the top or bottom of the page due to a lack of click to drag delay\nHowever saying all this, this is something that is on the list of \"will be changed\", a new menu will be there eventually\n\nAvatar loading performance:\nAvatars will cause a fair bit of stutter when they load in, much more than you may be used to from vrchat\n\nLack of proper prop moderation:\nYou cant block a specific prop, or an authors props, only block someone from spawning any props\n\nAnd now for the elephant.. or ant? in the room\nThe size of the playerbase:\nA lot of people will simply dismiss the game due to its pretty small size, which yes, can be a problem depending on how you wish to play this type of game\nIf you want to just hop on, play some game worlds, or find some quick action of other types of activities, this may not be the ideal place for you\nOn the plus side, the smaller playerbase does mean that bad actors are generally quickly filtered out, its also a much more relaxed experience\nI recommend checking this game out during its peak times, which would be starting at 20:00 GMT (convert to your local timezone yourself)\n\n\nTo close this off with\nA lot of developer effort is currently going into upgrading from unity 2019 to 2022, which will bring performance improvements, much easier support for standalone vr headsets (quest and pico version will be coming)\nHowever this means that other things are pushed back, which is reasonable enough as doing it right before such a massive upgrade would be a lot of wasted effort\n\nWould i recommend checking out CVR?\nAbsolutely, you lose nothing but a bit of your time, its free, other than the unlock dlc which is very fairly priced and only really relevant if you wish to create lots of content, as a normal user it doesnt actually offer anything you need\n\nTry not to be too discouraged by the issues i listed above like the unpolished feel, there is good stuff to be found underneath\nYou also dont have to pick between CVR or VRC, this is not a permanent choice, its a game, do what you want, play what you want whenever you want, so theres no issue with playing both\n\nThe list above is by no means a complete list of positives, or even downsides, it simply was what i could think of at this moment", "timestamp_created": 1659641790, "timestamp_updated": 1678380015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

More creators are showing up, more content is being made and more people are around to interact with.\n\nI was reluctant at first, but its familiarity and similarities made the transition comfy and its quality of life features that already exist in the game sold me on it.\n\nIf you're a content creator for another popular platform, the transition over to CVR to make content is surprisingly easily. Only a few things to watch out for, but with a helpful dedicated forum and very lively Discord, you'll get the help you need near instantly.\n\nWatch this space.", "timestamp_created": 1659480572, "timestamp_updated": 1659480572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119959858": {"recommendationid": "119959858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119556618", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1617133069}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only tried a bit but I already think it has a lot of potential to be greater than ever", "timestamp_created": 1659476110, "timestamp_updated": 1659476110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119959327": {"recommendationid": "119959327", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208657065", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1659057348}, "language": "english", "review": "ChilloutVR, a game like VRChat without EAC. If you like VRChat, i\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like ChilloutVR.\n\nPros and Cons.\n\u2022Pro, good alternative for VRChat if you don\u2019t like EAC or you have a problem with VRChat.\n\u2022 Con, Even tho ChilloutVR is very similar to VRChat, its not the same. You have to pay to upload more than 15 avatars from what i remember and you have to pay to upload more than a couple worlds. For me, it\u2019s not really a problem but for other creators (ex: Cally3D) who don\u2019t want to pay to upload avatars and or worlds. \n\u2022 Con, the game lags out very frequently due to all the new users coming from VRChat. (ex: everyone else frozen except for you)\n\u2022 Pro, I like the things that make the game different. The big menu really is nice to the eye. \n\u2022 Pro, You only have to pay for the extras one time, unlike vrchat where its monthly.\n\n\nChilloutVR is a good alternative for VRChat but also a good game in general. It does have its errors and things along those lines but still. It\u2019s a new game and still in development so you can\u2019t blame it. \nI really do recommend it for people who can\u2019t run VRChat because of EAC or just don\u2019t like VRChat because of the new EAC. To anyone reading who wants to try it out, just a warning. Signing up for ChilloutVR isn\u2019t the easiest. Be patient and you should get an email from ChilloutVR to verify your account in at least 24 hours.\n\n\n\nPS: Thank you twitch.tv/Frost_Soar for the info for the last pro!", "timestamp_created": 1659475371, "timestamp_updated": 1660089301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538922131061553955", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119959123": {"recommendationid": "119959123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105667331", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1697420119}, "language": "english", "review": "its better than vrchat even with it being in early access", "timestamp_created": 1659475105, "timestamp_updated": 1659475105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119957445": {"recommendationid": "119957445", "author": {"steamid": "76561199226789794", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1659472797}, "language": "english", "review": "It took me a bit of time to verify my account but the game is good.

development).\n\nI actually prefer the more simple style of making for example buttons and toggles.\nInstead of weird udon scripts, the game uses an easy to understand modifier.\nThis might not be as flexible as udon, but its very simple, and i believe it will only get better over time.\n\nThe only thing this games lacks a bit is the playercount and amount of content available, but as this is all

In this regard I find myself in the position to give a non biased view although through major issues with the competition it has come to find a place in my heart. The game is currently in Beta phase, I have played since the closed-Alpha version of the game. And I can say with confidence; a lot has changed. In other words this platform is a multitude more of a product than before. On the content side, it only lacks as the fresh community members who have since the debacle at the competition joined have started to experiment and learn on creating new worlds and avatars for everyone to enjoy. On the community services side; there are a multitude of clubs and events going on every week with tens of people at least. As the winter is coming we will see more people go online due to uncomfortable weather and this will definitely have a population increase. The game has gone through many issues and to the most part resolved them with the community, like a game should. Many issues still persists but with the small team, that they operate, they've come far and fast.

Honestly you're 10 steps ahead of VRChat simply due to that, and I am glad to see you receiving so many new users.\n\n\n\n(also, some additional points:\n\u2022 I feel like making a toggle for the camera to always be on top would be nice -- I'm not saying why tho :^)\n\u2022 It would be nice to have a near clipping pane adjuster in the game (0.05, 0.01, 0.001 for instance), which I used to mod vrchat for. Depending on each world for that feels terrible.\n\u2022 Being able to rejoin your own private instance would be nice\n\u2022 When losing connection, you seem to have to entirely restart the game so you can join a lobby again\n\u2022 Some more information on the 3.0-like animator system would be interesting\n\nThose are some points off the top of my head that I remember bothering me, honestly with all of those fixed I feel like I'd never need a separate social VR platform at all.\n\nPlease, correct me if I missed something in any of the points, I am just displaying my own experience.)", "timestamp_created": 1659314614, "timestamp_updated": 1659315118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458130031824111938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119854007": {"recommendationid": "119854007", "author": {"steamid": "76561199127025410", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1596, "last_played": 1664084086}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like VRChat but better in every way, including embracing non-malicious mods and actively patching out exploits people use for malicious intentions, both things that VRChat seems to be against.All it needs is more content from the playerbase, which is starting to become a reality thanks to the migration people have been doing from VRC to CVR, then there will be no more reason to ever go back to VRC.

Everything about this game screams the antivrchat vrchat clone and everyone on it is just that.\nLavender had more potential and more polish, right now cvr is nothing even close to being ready at all.\nI sincerely hope the new vrcmg devs can fix this mess, but i really have no hope what so ever. Big claims by rather egotistical and dramatic devs only leads to more unprofessional decisions.\nGive cvr a try yourself you need to experience its actually both in desktop and vr and even attempt to create content for this game to really get a scope of just how unenjoyable it is. It's painfully obvious the drama frogs moving here are just trash talking without ever actually playing.

But Neos is still insanely adjustable, you can do significantly more with it than VRC, so hopefully it gets a couple updates that deal with the coding and software stuff so I can run it without threat of my PC taking off.\nAnyway, VRC has just been such a weak intro to the VR landscape. There's a bunch of things that they should've included but haven't for one reason or another, and I can't exactly say it's all that shocking when supposedly cool devs decide to ban mods for no other reason than \"\"\"\"\"security\"\"\"\"\".

Let's check out the ups and downs of switching to Chillout.\n\nFirst up: You don't have to deal with EAC or VRChat's bull! The devs actually listen to their community, which is really awesome. It means that, hopefully, we can actually get important things added before it becomes an issue.\nSecond: This game is basically VRChat combined with Neos, except with little downsides of both. You get avatars and props to play around with, and if Neos' in-game creation menu and items are anything to go by, people are gonna abuse the CCK to create some AMAZING things. I can already see it now.\nThird: Chillout has PRELOADING! This means that you can load a world that you want to play in before joining, and not have to deal with sitting in a waiting menu for who knows how long, even if you have terrible internet! BRILLIANT! (As you can tell, I have bad internet. This concept is amazing.)\nFourth: You only need to pay a fee once to get all of the perks of this game, unlike a certain subscription-based model that another game employed. Beautiful.\n\nNow for the cons of moving to Chillout instead of just staying and sitting in VRChat with it's now dying community.\nFirst downside: Moving your avatars over to Chillout's CCK isn't as easy as pressing a few buttons in unity. Prefabs especially have an issue with this due to being so heavily built on the VRChat SDK. However, once people start figuring out the CCK for Chillout, I feel like things are gonna spiral out of control with how many avatars are ported over.\nSecond: This game is MASSIVELY in development, and a lot of things are gonna change over time. This is mostly good! However, it makes the game feel slightly unfinished at times. Only with the recent influx of players, bugs started showing up, and with bugs, comes people that like to ruin everyone's fun with said bugs. Props are being abused to crash others, but at least the devs are actually working on their game.\nThird: The servers can't handle this many players. Like, at all. In it's current state, getting into a world with some folks to talk with is nearly impossible because the servers tend to kick you into a private, broken instance of a world if too many people join at once, forcing you to reboot the game. This is going to be fixed with time though, which is a nice thought.\n\nOverall, this game is unfinished. Massively so. It's still in open alpha, so these things are expected to exist. Give it some time though, and Chillout is gonna be a BIG contender against VRChat, especially with the roads the two games are going down currently.\n\nDo I suggest ChilloutVR? Yeah, absolutely! Do I suggest you play it now?... give it a chance, honestly. There are issues, yes, but YOU can help shape the future of this game by playing, discovering, and telling the devs if something odd pops up.

So far the platform loads quicker (when I load a world I'm THERE), has more implemented features that would have had to have been modded into VRChat, more customizable settings, ability to mod AND Devs who interact and listen to input. The Devs are currently flooded with the influx of new players and yet they are still there on their discord answering people's questions and things are actually being fixed and improved actively.\n\nThe community is already so much better. Even though all of us new players were causing massive lag I felt welcomed and I was instantly welcomed and helped by older players to learn how to find avatars and worlds or use shortcuts (like you can move your hands a certain way to being up a camera). Chillout also uses the Steam age to make sure kids don't have access to mature content via DLC which is genius. You also have a LOT more options for filtering out what you want to allow or not... for example you can specifically say you don't want to see any flashing from worlds or avatars OR jump scares. \n\nGame is free with a paid version via DLC for creators that allows for unlimited uploads. Uploading of avatars and worlds is also basically the same but just with a different SDK in Unity which oddly enough offers MORE customization options and seems easier to use at the same time.\n\nI look forward to this community growing!", "timestamp_created": 1659217994, "timestamp_updated": 1659217994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119783518": {"recommendationid": "119783518", "author": {"steamid": "76561199074899259", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1660137942}, "language": "english", "review": "add sex", "timestamp_created": 1659214551, "timestamp_updated": 1659214551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119782698": {"recommendationid": "119782698", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112147740", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1666578372}, "language": "english", "review": "-w-", "timestamp_created": 1659213531, "timestamp_updated": 1659213531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119782333": {"recommendationid": "119782333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338682742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1659213089}, "language": "english", "review": "10 minutes.

I would like to see them grow and do better, I want there to be another easy to use service like VRC that actually listens, I have nothing against NEOS, but it's too much of a learning curve and VRC well everyone is pretty much aware of what they did, but you know what not gonna hold it against them overall, but I lost respect for them and won't use their service as much either for how they handled everything. ChillOutVR has been getting some flack too, but last I checked they were almost 4 years younger than VRC and much smaller team and userbase, idk what people expected. I see great potential especially after everything that just happened, I'd guesstimate over the next week and then again over the course of the rest of 2022, that they'll catch way up with all the new users and new team members.", "timestamp_created": 1659086056, "timestamp_updated": 1659086056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119691223": {"recommendationid": "119691223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300318092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1674124179}, "language": "english", "review": "Lowkey Might be better then vrchat", "timestamp_created": 1659085225, "timestamp_updated": 1659085225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526627242565155029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119688989": {"recommendationid": "119688989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079290694", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1683286760}, "language": "english", "review": "Kinda sucks in its current state\nI'll wait to see if it gets better in like a year or so", "timestamp_created": 1659081192, "timestamp_updated": 1659745467, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119687509": {"recommendationid": "119687509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198947976717", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1664590393}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, runs well, and has no EAC", "timestamp_created": 1659078378, "timestamp_updated": 1659078378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119686680": {"recommendationid": "119686680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108513521", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1665183490}, "language": "english", "review": "The Devs have an extraordinary opportunity at this point in time, to take in a large collaborative community of people who love working together to make a world people can escape in.  Their primary competitor among VR social rooms who has been dominating the market for a long while has pushed out a large part of their community and that mass group of people need a new home.  ChilloutVR COULD be their home, but there is much that needs to be done.  I am optimistic, with the help of a growing community and a whole lot of passion for this escape, CVR can quickly become that new home for the Mods community and hopefully a home for a major portion of the social VR space in general.  I see so much potential here for growth and sculpting a world that everyone can be a part of and feel comfortable and more than satisfied in.  The vision I, and many others, have for this game can only be fulfilled through a strong community first policy from the devs and lots of love and care from the player base.  I have no reason to believe that this game's Devs have any sort of plans down the road to put a lid on the Mod community as their competitor has and I hope they keep it this way.  I know I am not alone when I say I have spent a LOT of time on their competitor's game and a recent update they released, despite overwhelming backlash, felt like a spit in the mouth more so than a slap in the face...  I think these Devs, now swarmed with a new influx of players, observed this self destructive behavior of their competitor, and I pray they steer clear of making the same mistake.  Though their competitor may get by just fine, many will not forget their refusal to listen to the desires of their community and a large sum of players will not be returning at least for some period of time after this break of trust.  I am happy to be a part of CVR's discord community and have been watching them stagger but re-balance and plant themselves in hard work and dedication to their game.  As I pay attention to each announcement in their discord server I grow eager and I am impressed with their resolve.  This game in its current state has some catching up to do, by no fault of their own as they had no idea this would happen.  I see many features, I always wished was in their competitor's game, already natively installed into their base game and I see so much potential to add and explore new ideas in this game, given the community sees the same potential I do.\n\nI believe it is important to show support to such a small Dev team, that cares so much about their game, and I hope many people do.  You don't have to choose sides and ONLY play CVR, though I know many people will after what I will refer to as \"the event\".  Some day many social VR games may coexist as most social media we think of today; insta, FB, twitter, etc., but at this moment I believe CVR has the chance to be a freer form of social VR and truly let people create within their giant sandbox of a game and grow in many directions.\n\nAs I stated, the Devs have lots of work to do, but I believe the growth of this game will be exponential once the theoretical ball starts rolling.", "timestamp_created": 1659076794, "timestamp_updated": 1659076794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526222407817840576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119686332": {"recommendationid": "119686332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406348260", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1268, "last_played": 1674001466}, "language": "english", "review": "W game", "timestamp_created": 1659076168, "timestamp_updated": 1659076168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119686305": {"recommendationid": "119686305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148893276", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1659151875}, "language": "english", "review": "I know ya'll might be tired of these \"VRChat Refugee\" or \"I came from VRChat\" kinda reviews, etc etc, but I will make that portion quick\n\nObviously I came to this game looking for some form of a VRChat alternative, and before all of that, I'd say I had a good time with VRC, spending over 1,000 hours in said game over the span of 3 in a half years. But of course all things mustn't last forever\n\nOkay, now for the real stuff, and that is about ChilloutVR, now despite almost everyone from VRC talking high praise on this game, I still came in with little to no expectations, I thought this was gonna be a sorta meh version of VRChat, and even with the one hour I did go through in this game, it's actually way more than that, the fact that there are so many settings and accessibility options all native inside the game with no mods, clients, and whatnot? That is amazing. There were somethings I was unable to find when searching certain avatars (Was looking for Lucia from Punishing Gray Raven) but I will assume that it's just that the game might not have as many or too many public avatars, if that's a thing, if I am wrong on that I do apologize!\n\nAs for connecting to worlds, it is seamless as hell and I love it, the transitions from the current world to the one you are trying to join is great, oh and seeing who is in certain worlds is just an added bonus honestly. I have had the issue of the servers messing up on me, which of course is not the fault of the devs, it's just that so many people are coming in at once so it is a bit to handle, so it's no biggie.\n\nIn terms of things that I can compare to VRC, I kinda wish there was a toggle mute/unmute on the controller so I don't have to open the quick menu for that, unless there is a button for such in the settings or something and I missed it, and the camera seeming a little hard to use, mostly due to me not being used to it, and then there's.... oh wait that's kinda it actually, really nothing else to major besides that.\n\nOverall, I think ChilloutVR is a great, if not amazing alternative to VRChat, especially considering the BS that is going on there. I do not know if I will stick with ChilloutVR for a while until VRChat fixes their mess, or if there is a work around for me to have my normal stuff in VRC, which both probably won't happen. Either way, I plan to check out this game a lot more, to see all that can be seen.

You see it all over the gaming space, hell, even a game like Final Fantasy 14 was once under that kind of umbrella. I give you this:\n\nMonopoly is the bane of innovation and the killer of growth. There is a reason the Government made monopolies illegal. Companies can and will do the bare minimum to appease the customer while draining every coin the can, which is why monopolies are illegal-- if monopolies reigned, there would be no innovation, and stagnation will set in.\n\nHow does this relate at all to this review? I'm glad you asked.\n\nVRChat has had a monopoly over the VR Social Experience for nearly half a decade now. This is not due to having the objectively best experience, nor is it because it lacks competition \u2014 it has what no other Social VR Platform has: A large community. VRChat started early, as one of the first Social VR games, and it has been growing since then, and has become THE Social VR Experience, and has actually killed off a number of other budding platforms by rendering them barren of players. Except for one.\n\nIntroducing Chillout VR. A small, humble VR Social App running of Patreon funds. It averages single digit user counts and is really just a small place to hang out with your friend group, which may include the devs. By all means, CVR should have followed the fate of, for example, Sansar. But it didn't, and the devs and the tiny community they'd grown stuck with the game. And as we've seen, in the end, it was worth it.\n\nCVR is, from a software standard, better in MANY ways. Better performance, graphics, graphical settings, UI, SDK (in my experience so far) and locomotion options. A number of things that were mods in VRC, such as no clip, are also part of the base game. CVR also allows non-malicious mods to be used on their platform.\n\nHowever, despite all of these things, CVR was still doomed. Because like any other new social VR platform, the sentiment was the same. \"That new thing looks cool, but all my friends and worlds and avatars are on VRChat\". And for a very long time... That was the status quo. Despite its superior software, it just didn't have the social attraction it needed. Until now.\n\nVRChat introduces EAC (Easy Anti-cheat) in an attempt to prevent crashers, hackers, and modders from having the ability to do what they do. However, the VRC team forgot some things... One: EAC Bypass methods are literally common knowledge. Two: Crashers use avatars, not external software. Three: Mods are not objectively malicious: in fact, many were used for accessibility, improving performance, etc. People were mad. VRChat has now gone from an highs of 35k users and lows of 20k users before EAC to Highs of 20k and lows of 15k after EAC. VRChat has effectively halved its userbase over night due to EAC... And this is where Chillout VR comes in.\n\nWith this massive blunder, the VRC devs forgot something in their complacency: VRChat is kept alive by good will and the community. And if you piss off the community, they can leave or find something else to do. Something else to play. And here is Chillout VR. Better software. Better SDK. Better performance. Allowing mods. Chillout DESERVES its newfound playerbase, and I genuinely hope that it continues to see success as things go on. This will not kill VRChat, make no mistake: But as the recent flurry of dev updates have show, its lit a fire under their ass to actually do some work.\n\nI recommend Chillout VR. The devs deserve it for their work, and frankly? Players deserve better than VRChat, because the devs of VRChat are clearly no longer the handful of devs that put together the game for no profit back in 2017.", "timestamp_created": 1659060260, "timestamp_updated": 1659060260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545664012432098389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119676013": {"recommendationid": "119676013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212444876", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4212, "last_played": 1660042201}, "language": "english", "review": "This game on paper is good but I hope to see more on development and promises that they gave there's a lot of missing features even though it's been about a year there hasn't been as many features as I hope that were now seeing that there is more developers on this game and that there is a player base that supports it because of VR chats debacle.

I've been on-and-off involved with the Chillout community and followed development since the beginning, in the original Closed Alpha that I donated to get into. After nearly 200 hours between Chillout itself and the ChilloutVR Discord, I think I have a firm grasp on the core community and the rate of development, and I would like to share my thoughts now, while the platform is gaining record traffic as a result of external dramas on related platforms.\n1: Development is painfully slow. I've watched several times, as peeple get a massive amount of hype over the next update adding new features, only for the features to either not be really worth the hype in the end, or to get scaled back and/or delayed repeatedly. The biggest difference I can see between Closed Alpha of years ago, and now, is that they finally added a hand menu for quick access to basic options.\n2: The UI is extremely lacking, and issue-prone. The menus with network-related options do not refresh themselves, the filters barely work, and the entire layout feels disjointed to use.\n3: Bad performance is handled far worse. In some cases, ChilloutVR will easily outperform VRChat, I won't deny that. But, if you're in a situation or on hardware where Chillout does *not* run very well, it is significantly more noticeable and headache-inducing than how VRChat or NEOS handle it. I'm not sure I can even describe it, but it makes Chillout the hardest platform of the three for me to deal with on my GTX 1050-equipped laptop, and while I have a more powerful main system, the experience on the lower end hardware is still very notable, as it signifies a much harsher hardware barrier to use the platform, especially in VR.\nIf you can deal with these points of criticism I've provided against ChilloutVR, then I will say, it's a pretty good Social VR platform to use in place of or alongside its competitors.", "timestamp_created": 1659058062, "timestamp_updated": 1659058062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119675249": {"recommendationid": "119675249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198936033602", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1686371538}, "language": "english", "review": "While the UI is basic, it's a lot easier to navigate than other social VR titles.

All known crashes are fixed here, the netcode is very robust and runs at a greater refresh rate than VRChat's. The devs take pride in this one in particular, I trust they will work quickly when exploits are found.\n-better culling, things you don't see on the avi get unrendered whenever an update occurs in the world (like someone switches avatars) meaning there is less things being rendered all the time\n-you can block specific parts of avatars. like you can block loud sounds, gore, nudity, size constraints, flashing/bright lights and much more, and then only those parts are hidden. [This is a feature plan, only partially implemented so far.]\n-you can search for NSFW content, it's tagged as such and can be hidden, or specifically looked for\n-more avatar parameters (3200 instead of 256)\n-seperate voice position (the voice actually is coming out of the avatar's mouth)\n-magica cloth simulation support which is super performant and interactive as well, doesn't just rely on bones but can use vertices as well.\n-there are no loading screens, worlds are pre-downloaded in the background and everything has a button for preloading\n-very good speech visemes: I don't remember the technical name for this, but everyone liked the mouth movement and thought it looked a lot better than VRC when people talked\n-an actual fucking youtube search natively in the video player, youtube playlists are supported too! You can even create and modify playlists in the game.\n-more favorites: 8 categories of 100 favs (so 800) for free, and 32 categories of 100 (so 3200) for unlocked\n-amazing camera, you have a native camera drone and even more options, it's close to VRClens in features. You can use just hand gestures to take photos, it's extremely cool: make a picture frame with your fingers to spawn the camera, then clap and to despawn it. (this is optional)\n-the camera also works in desktop mode.\n-no kids in public since it's not on quest (it's true lol)\n-the SDK has an automatic quick system to create avatar toggles\n-avatar parameters can be triggered by particles (you can actually shoot people if they allow it for example)\n-offline lobbies are a thing, for example you can quick disconnect from an instance and people will disappear but the world around you stays as it was\n-you can fly! (world creators can disallow this)\n\n\nI know it also has had better dynamic bones performance, avatar dynamics and interactive dynamic bones about a year before VRChat had it.\n\nPorting avatars and worlds is very simple with not many steps (ported my first avatar in literally 10 minutes) because it's all the same engine and has support for the same shaders.\n", "timestamp_created": 1659030993, "timestamp_updated": 1659030993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56031346321105957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119654520": {"recommendationid": "119654520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055621195", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2285, "last_played": 1673768066}, "language": "english", "review": "Devs care about their community, and the community builds their game without investors or NFTs to ruin it.

Which never works, because it can't be closed properly, so you regularly have to kill the entire Steam interface and restart everything. When it does work, the user interface isn't exactly accessible either. Today, after I left initial \"Server Issues\" behind, I got stuck with the error \"Failed to login using provided credentials\". Several restarts didn't change anything (with the same correct credentials I successfully used yesterday). Other options, perhaps to reset passwords or to check the account - missing.\nAfter having spent half an hour on technical problems today, without even getting into the program, I'm gone for the time being, because my time is too valuable for that. Unfortunately, I have to add that I never had comparable problems with VR Chat, neither before nor after the controversial update - so all in all, I would say that the platform is not only overwhelmed, but unfortunately also underdeveloped and currently offers no usable alternative ... not even to NeosVR, which is still rather in the development phase but still offered more in-game user experience compared to technical problem solving.\n\nP.S.: I definitely understand that a lot of people who have joined in the last few days are really annoyed with VRChat and just wish ChilloutVR to be an alternative. But at the end of the day it has to be said that the \"more politically correct positioning\" of a software is no substitute for usability.

VRChat developers have caused a massive uproar and as a result many users are considering ChilloutVR a possible replacement, so let's talk about why you should keep an eye on this one.\n\nThis will be a little bit of a short one with my limited experience, but here is multiple reasons you should give this a try. While typically you should review a product based on it's standalone qualities, I will do a comparison to VRChat instead as it's currently more apt to do.\n[list]\n[*]There is a toy/prop feature that allows you to have objects you can spawn in that aren't part of your avatar. This is light years ahead of VRChat in terms of user interaction as a result.\n[*]Compared to VRChat there is a MASSIVE amount of settings you can change including your graphics settings.\n[*]I can't believe I have to say this, but unlike VRChat you can actually set your graphics resolution...\n[*]The servers are being improved to accommodate the quickly growing user count. While at the moment you'll have difficulties connecting, this probably won't be the case later. Both user funding and servers are increasing in size.\n[*]On boarding mod developers from the recent VRChat debacle. Instead of threatening mod creators with a cease and desist... they just hire them! The same great people who made our fantastic mods and loading systems will help speed up the development and improve quality of CVR itself.\n[*]Minor or massive improvements to framerate vs something like VRChat.\n[*]CVR has an official modding toolkit for making mods that fall under acceptable usage. Terms of Service regarding this located [url=https://documentation.abinteractive.net/official/legal/tos/#7-modding-our-games]here.[/url]\n[*]As of current there is no Anti Cheat system and VRChat serves as an excellent example of an awful way to add Anti Cheat software. We can expect their decisions to be different because of it alongside the fact the team has ex-VRChat modders on it.\n[*]There is tutorials, scripts, and tools for porting your VRChat avatars and content to ChilloutVR.\n[*]Your friends COULD be going here and will find it closer to VRChat than something like NeosVR.\n[*]No crypto, no microtransactions, and for the most part very low monetization as of current. You can support them through Patreon or with an unlocked account for like 7 dollars which gives you unlimited avatar/world uploads. By default you have 10 avatars/worlds without this purchased, which isn't too bad.\n[*]UI isn't finished, we can expect them to work on it more.\n[*]A Unity upgrade was planned but interrupted temporarily by the massive migration of users. Newer unity features will be on the way as well.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1658954558, "timestamp_updated": 1659208627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54219740629196167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119598452": {"recommendationid": "119598452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113697792", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1659838241}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic social platform with an even more fantastic Development Team.

Even before that happened though, ChilloutVR showed itself as a true competitor to VRChat and other social VR platforms, with new features that really improve the experience and possibilities within the game. There are many features in the game by default that other games like VRChat require mods for (which the devs killed), or simply don't have at all, including face tracking, haptics, world interactions with avatars, wind on dynamic bones, a better portaling system, spawnables, and a plethora of allowed third party components such as improved cloth simulations, terraining and vegetation tools, dynamic clouds, and level of detail. And all of this is not to mention the fact that the developers explicitly allow non malicious modding, meaning that any features that are lacking can be added by the community. This game is, and in my opinion always has been superior to its competitors in multiple ways, and now with a push to use other platforms, this game could become a true competitor in the world of social VR", "timestamp_created": 1658946216, "timestamp_updated": 1658946216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119591570": {"recommendationid": "119591570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136519209", "num_games_owned": 1231, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1696967605}, "language": "english", "review": "Gud based game better than certain other simmilar games", "timestamp_created": 1658946096, "timestamp_updated": 1658946096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119591359": {"recommendationid": "119591359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187415178", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1699481160}, "language": "english", "review": "Fuxk vrchat\nThis game has gotten things better then them already and guess what, THEY SUPPORT MODDING!", "timestamp_created": 1658945855, "timestamp_updated": 1658945855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119591038": {"recommendationid": "119591038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344314932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1661388538}, "language": "english", "review": "Actually listens to their community, isn't greedy for money and works on a voluntary basis with Patreon.

First of all you need to understand that this is not vrchat it is a completely different platform even though it's the same style. And just like vrchat took time to develop this game needs time to develop. People shouldn't be so quick to judge, that being said me personally until they develop more. Sadly I won't get the chance to participate, it's not the developer's fault of  I'll chill out VR. That I said we won't get to enjoy it right off the back, I'm sure once they've had time to adjust to the massive amount of people running here. That things will get better and it will be great. However, I'm going to have to stick with what I know. My reason being is because although it sucks that my mods are gone. The menu is easier to understand, so this is my feedback to you chill out VR. Please try to make a simpler menu, also the colors are very straining on the eyes it was actually very painful in my headset and actually cause me a headache after only a few minutes of being in your game. The green and white aesthetic it's just really harsh on the eyeballs. However your world creation and presentation is beautiful. But because you're not used to the massive influx of people they optimization is sadly lacking. I look forward to logging on again in the future and hopefully at some point being able to upload avatars. I'll be patiently eagerly looking forward to when I'll be able to participate. However I'm going to have to wait and the game has advanced a bit further. So this is not meant to be a negative review, in all honesty I'm very excited to see the community grow for this game. I'm already very happy to see that they care about what makes the collective happy. And it was also nice to see that there are message put in place to separate taste. However like I said there are a few things that are just not very compatible. I said the biggest selling point for me that is why I'm probably not going to be playing it is because I am a full-body user and my full body system did not work.  From my personal experience I was loading up the game it was not able to register my finger tracking, or my hip movements. And sadly because I spent so much on my system I want to be able to play a game where I'm actually able to still continue dancing. So as I said it's not meant to be negative review but I'm hoping that it's some point chillout VR can move Beyond vrchat. And if money is what's holding the developers back then I definitely think that they should have a place where the community can support and or donate so that they can work towards having the space for this new community that is coming their way. Like I said I'm looking forward to it I'm just sad that I currently can't participate. Honestly, that's really all I'm bummed out about. And to everyone that's been leaving negative reviews please don't give them a hard time, most people weren't even paying attention to them until vrchat made the community angry so don't give chill out vr hard time for being a new platform. They're doing the best they can, and we all remember back in the day when vrchat was new that it had to go through the development stage with its community. I would highly recommend if you're switching from vrchat to chill out vr, that you give them the utmost respect and give them positive feedback on how they can hopefully make the game better. Clearly they care about adults having a place to be adults. So give them time to balance the game it's not easy and it won't happen overnight be patient with them and like I said look forward to when they surpass other communities because they're willing to listen to what the people want.", "timestamp_created": 1658922930, "timestamp_updated": 1658922930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539136826992034912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119571379": {"recommendationid": "119571379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058929800", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1659657929}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you for making this. \nLets all hope this wont get sold off to another company.\n10/10 would recommend using this game / switching to it.\n\nI just recently bought a few avatars and hope they work in COVR too with all their features.", "timestamp_created": 1658921756, "timestamp_updated": 1658921756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119571368": {"recommendationid": "119571368", "author": {"steamid": "76561199177151949", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1689190068}, "language": "english", "review": "slight bug. everytime i create a new instance that is friends only the ppl/friends who joins me through the instance or even through invites gets suddenly get kicked every 10 minutes or either just appear frozen but over all cvr has slightly improved.. there is still some server issues but not as problematic as before.", "timestamp_created": 1658921743, "timestamp_updated": 1664939151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119571082": {"recommendationid": "119571082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378801736", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1658994781}, "language": "english", "review": "It's VRChat without what makes VRChat bad.

Now its best alternative to Vrchat. Camera? Already better than VRC and with some functions from VRClens for example dron UwU. \n\nBut be aware that Alpha Blend Interactive is really tiny team of developers they have hard time to manage sudden flow of new players. So be patient.\n\n[b] Oculus/Meta Quest Support [/b]\nNot Yet , but planned.\n\n[b] Calls in game [/b]\nThere is only placeholder in main menu... this feature is not ready yet and will be there in the future. So please dont ask how to use that. This is common question at their discord.\n\n[b] Can i use in game camera for making photos at desktop? [/b]\nYes, you can! And i think with push of left Alt or double push... you can lock you camera in place for while and you can click at buttons at camera with mouse cursor.\n\n[b] Is modding game client okay? [/b]\nAbsolutely as long as you follow this TOS and not make malicious mod. https://documentation.abinteractive.net/official/legal/tos/#7-modding-our-games\n\n[b] Do i need to buy unlocked account? [/b]\nNope you dont need to do it. Normaly you can upload max 10 avatars with unlocked account its problably like hundred/s. And if you support them with Patreon (10+ USD tier)  then you will get unlimited amount of  uploads. But for most people free or unlocked acc is enough. So dont worry.\n\n[b] Is NSFW allowed? [/b]\nAs long as you mark your avatar or prop with correct tags.. then yes.  And also you need to download free dlc ''mature content'' if you wanna see others players with NSFW. Which only players which have 18+ steam account can see. And if someone younger will be caught with that DLC, then that person can be banned. So if you dont have at least 18, dont try to get that.\n\nAnd my final words, Alpha Blend Interactive need your support so if you cancelled VRC+ you can be their patreon without problems, they dont have private investors they use money from Patreon. Here is the link https://www.patreon.com/AlphaBlendInteractive/posts\n\nAnd also if you have some skill in development of games you can try apply for some possition here  team@abinteractive.net\n", "timestamp_created": 1658909980, "timestamp_updated": 1658910081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613620638847351074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119563434": {"recommendationid": "119563434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198861524562", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1083, "last_played": 1691640507}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is more advanced than VRChat, it has things I have issues with in VRC, CVR actually has things that fixes those issues.

But I went back to VRC in may to see how things were.... and woo boy... It got worse. And with the eac in vrc I understand everyone's annoyance. I don't use mods in truth so I'm not bothered with VRC. But here, YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOMED.

After the initial influx of refugees, it has already significantly improved server stability, has been highly communicative with users on discord, and hired some people from the former VRC modding community to help build their platform. If they keep this up, then the future is bright for Alpha Blend Interactive. They are showing what community-driven - not shareholder-driven - social vr should look like.  \nCVR already has many features the modding community from VRC has been asking for for years - like flight/noclip (can be disabled by world authors), global optimized dynamic bones, built in bhaptics and face tracking support, youtube video search, and NSFW content filtering, among so much more. A new form of content creation is also present: props. I've seen props range from bonk hammers to NERF guns, to a Minecraft building system. With future updates coming, like a server-side world scripting system, the potential for ChilloutVR content is nearly limitless. So if you'd like a change of pace from an out of touch, nearly radio-silent developer team to one that encourages the innovation that modding brings, and cares about their community?

I gave it a very short test run.\nAnd remember. This game had almost no playerbase until yesterday so they do not have the network infrastructure to run the game with this insane increase in traffic. SHOW PATIENCE PEOPLE.\n\nThis game seems amazing on a surface level. But small dev team and heavy influx of traffic is gonna choke it for a while.The summary is.\nLots of QOL features.\nNo punishing/entrapping adult content needlessly\nA somewhat overwhelming UI\nNonexistent servers outside of EU/AS\nPlayer influx effectively DDOSing their servers with traffic.\n\nNegative:\nThe game is not set up with enough infrastructure for the new influx of traffic. American servers are nonexistent currently so keep that in mind.\nIf you are migrating from VRChat, The menus will take some getting used to and traversing between worlds can feel strange.\nYou have to go the their website to edit you profile.\nDue to network issues. Ping is incredibly high and instances are crashing often.\nThe transition between worlds, though kinda nice, is horrible for your eyes.\nThe menu is very complicated for those not used to larger UI's\n\nPositive:\nSo many QOL features. A lot of it simple settings I didn't realise I needed.\nThe notification system seems like it will be a HUGE imporvement over VRC.\nThe little of the community I have met is very friendly and more than excited to have the influx of traffic despite the issues with servers being out the window right now. Most communities would attack those that are disrupting their usual vibe.\nYou can pre load worlds instead of waiting in the loading screen forever depending on internet and such.\nIndividual avatar save states. Meaning avatars that are heavily customisation can be saved in multiple states to easily load instead of always having to readjust the whole avatar (Or so i assume by the feature, I havent gotten my hands on a avatar with the ability to properly test it)\nAble to upload/spawn props\n\n\nOnce again, SO MANY SETTINGS FOR QOL AND BASIC SHIT BRO.

Transferring my avatar over to CVR was super easy and the sdk is fairly simple to use..

You can really easily set things to be toggled within the SDK without making animations, but you can still use animations if you want.\n- Group system where you can set up group events and make worlds only joinable to group members\n- The devs have an open stance about modding on their terms of service.

Barely anyone is on this game and talking to the people they are diehards for this game and think it will get the numbers that VRChat will say that only a max of 24 people are online a day. How sad to think this could of killed VRChat. I wish it did but going back to it I got bored and was done with it after an hour of playing. Some dude for an hour straight tried to hook me onto the point of this game but after seeing the reviews of people dick sucking this game because \"its like VRChat but no EAC!\" while the game dwindles in peak players shows how bad this game has gotten.\n\nEdited 8/11/22: For people to say this is a VRChat killer or a sightly better VRChat they are laughably wrong. I was wrong. After VRChat decided to kill itself by adding stupid EAC everyone finally saw the potential of ChilloutVR and everyone went to it and including me! But when I got there, spending 8 dollars for the unlocked account to get everything unlimited. All I saw was a poorly made VRChat that can barely load anything and have simple to downright confusing options with no explanation whatsoever. These \"people\" that said they would go over to ChilloutVR because of VRChat's fuck up were never seen. This game was like a literally copy of VRChat but with a terrible UI system, flight being added to everyone's options and avatars that won't even allow you to copy them unless you just import your avatar over to VRChat. The only thing good about this whole thing was that you don't need a dumb subscription to have everything unlock when you only have to pay 8 dollars for this game but I still felt like I was being ripped off. Shame on me for following the public and thinking this would be a VRChat killer. I've accepted that VRChat is dead, the game I helped with a few YouTubers to grow is dead and I accept it.\n\nOriginal: What a sad site to see. This game is just a slightly better VRChat yet barely anyone plays it, its a fucking desert. Looks like I was just a little too late to see this game be filled with people.

I wouldn't trust the good reviews of this game, as they were the result of a mass review spam because people were having a temper tantrum about an entirely different game, and not because cvr was deserving of it. Before the mass temper tantrum, this game did awful. It had maybe 20 people maximum and most of them was just moderation and a few hoity toity people who whined about vrchat. This game had a reputation of being the bootleg version of vrchat, and it honestly was. It centered its entire community around hating vrchat. It was a toxic environment which drove most people away in the beginning. I joined a long time before the massive temper tantrum fiasco, and my honest thoughts were, \"this game is sub par. It has no substance.\" The worlds were just shittily ported from VRChat, except with a  bootleg, dinosaur layout. Terribly optimized, and we ultimately stopped playing because of the safety settings, they're ATROCIOIUS. My boyfriend at the time has epilepsy, and couldn't disable people's avatars which can be falesly mislabeled to do strobes for everyone and you can't disable it. My boyfriend had a seizure and I've felt a tinge of rage ever since because of that. \n\nThe UI, was, and still is, terrible. Much worse than that, the community is TERRIBLE. The moderation is terrible. TERRIBLE PEOPLE.\n\nI tried coming back quite a few times and honestly left in tears on my final time. It's overwhelmingly toxic. Everything bad about vrchat, including the crashers and obnoxious avatars and annoyingly cruel players who drop slurs and harass you, picked up and ran to chilloutvr. My first several impressions were all the same-- it's uncomfortable. I couldn't really have that conversation that i can in other social platforms because of all the screaming and craziness that often times my voice would be drowned out, or the players woudn't acknowledge me. I have a severe anxiety disorder, so vr is a really nice platform for me, but this was the worst possible place for that. \n\nThe awful, terrible moderators were awful to me. Ignoring the screaming, and the slurs, and the flashing avatars, they came up to me instead, got in my face, called me obnoxious over a tiny laptop fan, and demanded I mute my microphone unless I'm talking (which i was talking). Embarassingly bad moderation team. \n\nYou would think some updates would be made to improve this game, but there really hasn't been. It seems they're perfectly fine being what they've always been-- a subpar bootleg game that has zero optimization, terrible community, horrible safety settings that do not protect people, terrible moderation, terrible ui, terrible website design, terrible content, and I could go on and on. It can't stand on its own.. it is the toxic congegated sludge of \"I  hate VRChat\" despite having zero substance or even a good community to back it up.\n\nIt's just a bootleg that wont close shop because it's a shitty playground for the moderators.\n\nTLDR:\n*avatars are rigged weird and uncomfortably\n*UI is awful\n*terrible safety settings\n*terrible optimization, it lags\n*theres nothing to do because the game is so underdeveloped. It's at the bottom of the market for showing VR's potential.\n*doesnt support quest which whipes out half the vr users right now\n*Moderation team ignores toxicicity and embraces the worst parts of the metaverse\n*the community is extremely toxic, the worst I've ever seen to the point I had to close dms because of the harassment i was getting from the playerbase, and makes the game unplayable (omg, worse than League!)\n\n*instead of playing a shitty bootleg of VRChat that revolves around hating vrchat, just play vrchat.", "timestamp_created": 1647452347, "timestamp_updated": 1666357096, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496575325727462769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112114003": {"recommendationid": "112114003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136916291", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 401, "last_played": 1679389174}, "language": "english", "review": "Alot of reviews here are downvotes complaining about the player population of the game.

[/strike] https://steamdb.info/app/661130/graphs/\n\nalso, to the people who think this is a vrchat rip-off: it really isn't. in fact, vrchat took some UI FROM CHILLOUTVR.  \nthese devs actually listen to feedback, and of course the game is gonna have similar elements to vrchat, ITS A SIMILAR TYPE OF GAME. \n\nif you don't want to play this because of the low amount of players, i understand that, just consider that if you want this game to get more players, tell others to try it. its fine if they dont like it, since at least in this game the devs listen to feedback.\n\nalso, i get people dont like having to pay to upload more things, but, one, 10 is more than enough for a casual player, two, theres only 3 developers and they dont have the funding vrchat does, and three, its super cheap and a one time purchase, you can add way more things to avatars and there's props and other things, so i'd say its worth paying for. you seem content paying $10 a month for extra favorites. guess what, you can get like a thousand favorites here, for free :)\n\n// LOTS OF TEXT HERE // \nListing some things the game has.\n\n- A tag system. (explaining more in the Settings part).\n\n- Allows NSFW (in non-public worlds, of course). Unlike VRChat where you have to stay quiet about it, this game actually allows that stuff as long as you dont have it in public, and to even see it you have to download a free DLC and enable nsfw content in settings. yes, props too. you can have those types of props as far as i know.\n\n- Developers listen to feedback.\n\n- From my experience, the people that play are mostly nice. If they're mean to you, either you're being an asshole without realizing, you're playing at a bad time, or you just got unlucky, because some humans are just mean. it's expected for a social game.\n\n- PROPS! Have you ever wanted the Force-A-Nature from hit game Team Fortress 2 to be usable in a social VR game? now you can! Wanna use the Meowmere from Terraria, or blind people with the Last Prism? You can! Want a cookie that you can eat? THAT TOO! Want a questionable item that needs that free DLC? Hell yeah you can. I love props. They're awesome. \n\n- Actually good settings! (this is a long one)\nGraphics: Game running like shit? Lower the Resolution (you can go down to 320x200), turn off Bloom, lower Anti-Aliasing (or turn it off), you can even change your framerate cap! (60 to Unlimited).\n\nAudio (bit buggy atm but thats unity): You can adjust the volume of World SFX, World BGM, Player Voices, Avatars, User Interface, Props, and the Video Players.\nInput & Key Bindings: This one seems to be mostly for VR, so i dont understand it. You can increase mouse sensitivity here though.\n\nContent Filter: You can choose whether you see everyone's Avatars, Your Friends' Avatars, or No-ones Avatars. You can select the Max Avatar Size (5 MB to Unlimited), and you can hide Avatars that have NSFW, Suggestive, Flashing Colors/Lights, Screen Effects, Extremely Bright, Gore/Death, Violence, Excessively Huge/Small, Horror, or Jumpscare.\nAlternatively, You can remove individual components from Avatars, these options are Loud Audio, Long Range Audio, Music, Particle Systems, Dynamic Bones (collider is separate), cameras, windzones, and lights. \nthere is a \"Reload Avatars\" button at the bottom of this page.\n\nProp Settings: Content filter for Props. This has every Content Filter setting except its for the props, and has additional options. Aside from just enabling/disabling props, you can toggle Particle Collision and Colliders, and toggle Touch Triggers.\n\nInteractions: This is the Dynamic Bone section basically. you can choose who you can interact with and who can interact with you, as well as change whos interactions you see, and theres Collision Placement and Wind Interaction. \nunder Player Physics Intercollision, you can toggle Particle Collision, Colliders, and Selfcollision. you can also enable touch triggers for player animator triggers.\n\nImplementation: fairly small page. A few settings for Tobii Eye Tracking, BHaptics, and Vive Face tracking. \n\nExperimental: I dont get this one, really. it has \"Always On Microphone Mode\", as well as IK Settings, which are Plant Feet, Pin Hip to Tracker, Straighten Neck, Hip Shifting, and Pre Straighten Spine.\n\nSupport: this isn't really a setting, but, you can generate a support code for bug reports, which contains log files and some basic info like RAM, CPU, GPU, Unity Version, Game Version, OS, and a couple other things.\n\nalright, im done with the settings part.\n\n- Avatar/Prop sharing! Currently, as it's unfinished, the only way to get props is to have someone else share their props, but it's pretty easy so feel free to ask anyone who has a prop! though, only the uploader can share them of course. Same goes for Avatars i believe.\n\n- Sub-Categories! for a lot of things! you can create up to 32 Sub-Cats for Friends, Groups (unfinished), Avatars, Worlds, and Props. Each. so i mean you have 32 for friends, and still have 32 for props. Currently, you can only edit these on the website, and this is where you enable content sharing (by default people cant just spam your props and avatar menus, you have to enable getting them from Friends or Everyone)\n\n- Groups! These don't exist yet.\n\n- The (unfinished) Website! it does things but i just wanna list it because you manage your uploaded content here. Apparently you can Transfer Avatar/World/Prop Ownership. You can also submit those for Publication, so for worlds, you can submit them and then they can be a public world anyone can join whenever. You can also manage what people shared with you, so if you got a prop you dont like you can remove it.\n\n- You don't have to pay for a profile picture (looking at you and your dumb subscription, VRChat)\n\n- You can see who is in a world before joining!\n\n- NoClip!!! assuming the world allows it, which most do, enable Flight in the menu, or press 5 on the numpad.

growing, and not many of my friends have moved onto it from other social vr platforms, but it's still really good, in my humble opinion. Loading feels a bit more seamless than other platforms where they just drop you in a loading screen, or dump you in an empty space and slowly load/propagate objects and things, uploading avatars has felt fairly familiar compared to similar platforms, and the people behind all of it seem to be taking more player feedback than one of the other top contenders (read: taking any player feedback whatsoever is doing more so than VRChat has over the last few years). My only issue so far has been in the avatar that I uploaded looking fine in the Unity editor, then having janky looking fingers ingame, but I'm almost certain that's because of my model, and is probably already fixed by now, I just haven't tried uploading it again lately. Overall, I'd give my personal experiences with CVR, out of 10: 8/10 for the platform it's self, it's a lot better in some criteria compared to other platforms,  7/10 for my personal experiences inside CVR, and an 8/10 for usability of it's Unity editor creation kits, they're built similarly to things I already know how to use, and are easy to learn with their guides, and the few third party resources like videos I've watched to catch up.", "timestamp_created": 1637826807, "timestamp_updated": 1637826807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103690544": {"recommendationid": "103690544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109423742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1619548796}, "language": "english", "review": "chill", "timestamp_created": 1637823566, "timestamp_updated": 1637823566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500130772590637207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103577641": {"recommendationid": "103577641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015715214", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 22031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1691940079}, "language": "english", "review": "ChilloutVR\nWritten by : OfficialSayon\n-------------------------\nGameplay: 7/10\nCreativity: 10/10\nVR: 9/10\nAtmosphere: 10/10\n-------------------------\nChilloutVR is so underrated but YOU guys must play this, help make CVR become great!

There are still game-wide issues, however they're actively being addressed by the developers who can be seen live testing and interacting with the community both in-game and in community outlets like their discord server. At the moment, instance stability seems to be their biggest issue.\nI still maintain that CVR is a superior platform to VRChat, and now I have vindication in this appraisal in that it seems to be the first choice for people leaving the platform. The CCK has not aged as well as I'd expected, however it is far from obsolete in design by comparison. Aditionally, my comments on the platform's expandability and modularity also need update as both the CCK and the game client have been actively embracing new features in my time away.\nRegarding my issues from the previous version of my review, I feel that while both are still an issue, they are being mended. the Chillout development team is pulling out all the stops to capitalize on the chance to garner new players and I applaud them for their efforts. In doing so, they are also now working on rectifying some issues I had with the UI, and implementing the \"radial\" menus from VRchat (hopefully as an option and not something that is just forced).\n\nConclusion:\nCVR was, and definitely is now worth checking out. if you have any familiarity with VRC then you will adapt with fairly little effort. Performance by and large is fantastic. anyone around for the SDK2 days of VRChat should only spend minimal effort relearning the CCK, and the props system remains a unique, magical way to share content and experiences with other players.

After VRChat shat the bed, a bunch of people hopped ship and now the game has a decent playerbase. \n\nYes. I would recommend you play ChilloutVR. \n\nBut what I realized while playing ChilloutVR was that both it and Neos have a long way to go to topple VRChat. Just hopping ship isn't quite enough, VRChat is a ship that the community has been building for years, so many fantastic parts and memories are still left on that ship, and it'll take a while for the new ship to even compare.\n\nPlus, the old ship had a much more intuitive control scheme and wheel layout that the captain is used to, and this is where this really shitty analogy breaks down. But whatever, review edited. ChilloutVR has a long way to go, but its on its way. \n\nHere's my old review for archival purposes at 181 useful and 8 funny:\n\n\"It's such a shame, that I have to leave this review. This is, in literally every technical way possible, better than VRChat. Runs better, looks better, more interactivity/options, the works. But what makes or breaks a social game is the playerbase, and this game is about as populated as the Sahara Desert. I could not find a single active world. \n\nIf I had to give any advice to the devs, its to try and sponsor some big youtubers/streamers in the VR space in tandem with some events. Like get a youtuber to get their following into ChilloutVR for an E3 watchalong or something like that. \n\nThe nanosecond this game gets even a decent playerbase, I will hop ship from VRChat.

"review": "While this game is currently in Early Access, its essentially VRChat on steroids with the devs ACTUALLY giving a sh*t about how it works. Sure, it still has its bugs and issues, but for something this early in development, it works better and run smoother than VRChat (Despite VRC being around longer.)\n\nPros:\n~ ChilloutVR runs nicely and the way worlds are loaded is SO much better than VRChat. Instead of having to wait in a room with a loading screen, it just keeps you in the world you're currently in until the other world is loaded in before sending you there with a very smooth transition. \n\n~ Upload process for an avatar in Chillout is much faster than in VRChat with it not breaking as much during the process.\n\n~ Allows NSFW content and avatars on their platform (which is really nice since it allows adults to be adults.)\n\n~ No monthly subscription service for an enhanced users experience (Its a one time purchase enhancement instead.)\n\nCons:\n\n~ Very few worlds to go visit and hang out with other users in.\n\n~ Can only have three instances open at a time with no guide or explanation on how to terminate instances that are created.\n\n~ Updates are pretty scarce with a lack of new content being added it, making this repetitive after a while.\n\nIn conclusion, while this is a really fun VR platform to hang out on, there really isn't a lot to do on here. After a while, its gets to be boring and with the lack of people that use it, you don't really get to meet new people at all. Plus, with the lack of updates and creators working on the platform to expand it and make it better, it really just ends up being pretty hollow.

Mature content is allowed, and properly filtered by the content filter system unlike another platform I will not mention here. I also had a bit more fun with Chillout than the other platform. One moment you're hanging out with people, the next moment, one person pulls out a bag of guns, and suddenly it's a game of deathmatch! Rocket launchers, miniguns, and so many other things. The guns are a part of the props system. If you want to make a rocket launcher that allows you to rocket jump, you can. If you want to make a working rocket, you can. I decided to make simpler props. I decided to make props of food, and other things. The CCK (content creation kit) you can get to upload avatars, worlds, and props is really easy to use. I figured out how to get my favorite avatar into Chillout with relative ease, and was even capable of adding custom animations with little to no hassle. Not only that, but the moderation is handled by human moderators instead of an AI that has full control over the platform. The AI present supposedly only calls in human moderators, nothing more. This means less errors, less unfair bans, and less stress. Since the AI is only there to alert a human moderator, spam reports by gangs are useless unless you are legitimately causing problems. This is NOT the case in the other platform. There, even if you do nothing wrong, use one of the stock avatars, and rarely talk, if a gang mass reports you, you can kiss your account goodbye. ChilloutVR overall is a much more professional and well made product, and I see the future of Chillout being bright. I'm also able to use my beeg marshmallow lady avatars with no ban.

Mostly because it doesn't have any way to make custom game modes because it's missing a way of custom scripting they provide some scripts, for Avatars and Worlds which a few of them dont work fully and some dont work at all. The ones for Avatars are good enough to make simple and complex systems. For Worlds i sadly can't say the same its missing basic functions like proper Object Sync, as of the time right now Objects are only synced as long as you hold them in your hand. So throwing an object or pushing an object with your Avatar is not synced and only works locally. Next important feature would be the \u201eInteractables\u201c its a script where you can define simple action like \u201eOn Interact\u201c which is clicking a collider. The problem is there's no syncing at all that means no way of syncing a Collider Click to every user in the Instance. A Great thing is that All Assets are Encrypted that means not every idiot can steel your Content which should be a standard but sadly its not for other competitors. They support some importand Unity features and even some cutome ones like \u201eDynamic bone\u201c \u201eFinal IK\u201c \u201ePost Processing Stack 2.0\u201c \u201eCTS 2019\u201c and a few more. Thats really helpful and makes creating content even without custom Scripting easy and beginner friendly. Everything in the Game itself is networked that means unlike other competitors there's not a lot of room for exploiting. Moderators are most of the time friendly and helpfull, Although i don't like the moderation personally which is something thats way to complex for this review tho. They are heading a great way, and have a lot of cool stuff planned like Official Game Modes, Official Event Planning and many more. They are open and the Community is mostly involved in testing and feedback. Im glad of supporting it since the first Day.

I say this now because I would like to make clear my relationship with the community/devs and to make sure any form of bias is out of the way. This review will be split between the technical and community part, since those are generally the two defining factors in any sort of social game, whether it's VR or not.\n\nLet's begin:\n\nIn the technical sense, CVR has proven itself to be the best suitable platform, between the dynamic bone interaction that is very easily configurable, to extra stuff such as props, advanced avatar settings, and the fancy little Gmod noclip flying. If you're working on something simple, or even working to convert your avatars, it is essentially the same as uploading to VRC with the 2.0 SDK. However major problems arise with more advanced efforts, as documentation is extremely limited and information about working with AAC or other such things is difficult to obtain. The UI hasn't noticeably improved, however it is dynamic and moddable so long as you understand how to mod it. As for optimization, the best thing I could ever really say is \"Check the user content first.\" If you seem to have trouble outside the hub, it may not be the game itself, but rather an avatar or a world itself.\n\nCommunity is more of an issue. While people for the most part of the player base are welcoming, there are symptoms of a plague that I tend to call the Alternative Community Paradox (ACP). Or just call it a razor or whatever you want.\n\nACP is an observation I have made across every social platform that has risen due to a piece of the mainline community breaking off to form what they find is objectively better. This community mainly comprises of users who are genuinely sick of the problems that were created by the authority of the platform which they left. Essentially a \"blackjack and hookers\" gig. However the attraction of a new platform with better features and a seemingly more welcoming atmosphere also invites malicious players who were banned from the platform previously. The combination of the veil over everyone's eyes and the toxicity of the outcasted users create an environment where a new user to the platform may perceive the alternative platform as completely toxic. Many examples include: 4chan/8chan, Twitter/Gab/Parlor/Mastodon, Furaffinity/too many to count.\n\nThe reason this is brought up is due to both personal interaction and from what I was informed. Players previously associated with \"crasher gangs\" and other toxic groups that have plagued the public space in VRChat have also been brought into CVR. While a few have given up the previous antics on VRC, there are others who are active in permeating issues, underlying rifts between the once small group of people.\n\nBesides the issues at hand with the general drama groups, there are also certain names that have sucked up the social ranks to align themselves closer with moderation. This is obviously a disaster waiting to happen, and while I do not believe the moderators themselves are actively working against their own community, this poses a great risk to anyone who may assume that because someone doesn't enjoy them, they can work their way into convincing the moderator to remove them from the platform. Another review made on the store page brought this up, and while I don't personally know any details on this, I can only assume there is something amiss.\n\nFurthermore, the most prevalent problems with CVR is ironically shared with VRC. From cliques who avoid interacting with others outside their group to the 'mirror zombie\", CVR has unfortunately become nothing but another clubhouse. I'm optimistic that the devs will be able to eventually bring the promised game modes to the platform and really set out to expand themselves, but for now I unfortunately cannot recommend this game, at least to anyone who's had experience with previous VR social platforms.", "timestamp_created": 1616561813, "timestamp_updated": 1616561813, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 228, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744337618350982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88684001": {"recommendationid": "88684001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835112175", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1646910133}, "language": "english", "review": "i tried playing it went to a world there were 2 others in it, the controls just suck ass and the turning i hate im just going to stick with vrchat", "timestamp_created": 1616123013, "timestamp_updated": 1616123013, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.406153619289398193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88682015": {"recommendationid": "88682015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153842016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1692307639}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommending on it's potential as a VRchat for grown-ups, or maybe even a VR version of Second Life.\n\nIt looks like some existing creators have  taken an interest already,  (even though this is very much still in the alpha stage), since quite  a few VRchat worlds have a parallel existence here. \n\nVery much a work in progress but most of the main stuff is there in some form.

A game similar to how VR-Chat used to be. Actual conversations and memorable discussions, a game which feels welcoming and true. When you enter a lobby there is a much lesser chance of seeing people who are just glued to the mirror, captivated by their reflection in the mirror, dwelling what life could have been if they were born as their VR character? Of course you can take into consideration, that a game with a big player base can have an increasing amount of un-monitored and dubious behaviour and due to that, especially when the moderating tools were incapable of maintaining any form of law within public instances, many of the people would gravitate towards private instances and that mentality still remains even though things have changed. But that's VR-Chat. \n\nWith ChillOut Vr being niche and possessing this long lost feeling of VR-Chat's legacy as well as a very responsive community which is always willing to aid in any regard, starting from dedicated community servers with a great collective of developers and content creators from which you can start to obtain your very first building blocks for Blender and Unity. Even though it may not have the same amount of community produced content, the potential is there and all that can come in the future, but it's up to you weather you are keen in taking the first steps forward on this platform. I think it is a perfect starting point for someone who has missed out on VR-Chat's ''Gold Era'' since late 2016 and instead should allow themselves to embrace this game which has many great features that VR-Chat tends to lack and build their own unique and memorable experience.\n\nHope this review helps to clarify previous concerns and will encourage you to try it out for yourself, thank you for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1615460681, "timestamp_updated": 1615460681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606916725635528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88218643": {"recommendationid": "88218643", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986461495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1615424028}, "language": "english", "review": "dead game", "timestamp_created": 1615424128, "timestamp_updated": 1615424128, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445138603448867798", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88216472": {"recommendationid": "88216472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317369219", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1660886840}, "language": "english", "review": "has very high potential cant wait for the updates and hope the community grows already recommended it to a friend.", "timestamp_created": 1615419970, "timestamp_updated": 1615419970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88169688": {"recommendationid": "88169688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123186129", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1612833191}, "language": "english", "review": "Garbo", "timestamp_created": 1615352241, "timestamp_updated": 1615352241, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.392561972141265869", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88167607": {"recommendationid": "88167607", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027249332", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1659489603}, "language": "english", "review": "Needs some work.

While the game is in early access, it has lacked core features that the community has begged for since the launch of the early access (which was over a year ago while the developers have told users it\u2019s only been a couple of months). Ignoring all the developmental issues of the game, the moderators\u2019 attitude and actions towards players is appalling. I have not found a single moderator on their team that serves to help other players, and yet all of them have worked to hurt the community. From personal experience, moderators have banned, falsely accused, and revoked my access because of personal grudges against my character. They will even permanently ban users who politely question a ban like my friend did.

Wait until proper updates for formal use (such as uploading content). For all intents and purposes, this game is still a prototype and so many components are either missing or only implemented at their most simplistic level. The roadmap is very straightforward and their intent is clear as daylight.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n- It's not VRC.\n- The ToS accommodate for mods!\n- [i]Orders of magnitude more control over avatar features[/i] - you can go down to targeting avatars by specific attributes such as long range vs short range audio, the type and nature of any effects (e.g. graphic, flashy, etc.), and much much more. There's a whole list you can filter through as opposed to the shoddy 5 options offered by VRC's \"Safety Settings\".\n- Far more versatile content. Avatars can have configurations to alter their appearance on the fly without the need for mods. They can also spawn props and items. The content filter allows you to disable this for avatars if you want, so when the inevitable joke avatars run rampant, it's easy to disable. Ever wanted your avatar's weapon to be an actual holdable weapon that you can let other people mess with on your own accord? Now you can! Have fun.\n- Your world doesn't sit in [strike]community labs[/strike] limbo for a year before it gets approval.\n- More rigorous avatar approval process that prevents the overly intrusive avatars and that blatantly offensive content you tend to see in VRC, or at the very least requires them to be appropriately tagged so that the verbose limit system can be used properly. Failure to tag avatars properly based on the features they have is grounds for its removal or declination.\n- Native FBT support.\n- Native Vive adv. tracking support.\n- Native bHaptics implementation, with the ability to whitelist / blacklist people or groups in terms of who can trigger it.\n- Comes with noclip for worlds that have it enabled.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- It's early in development and it shows. If you have patience for early titles, please do play this! It's enough to work with and just needs a bigger community.\n- Small team gives it a pretty big case of [i][url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6yBHDvKUw\"]These Things, They Take Time[/url][/i] (though they are working very hard towards the end goal and it is promising).\n- UI is kind of bleh (on the roadmap to be fixed within the year).\n- Takes some getting used to, the controls are odd.

For anyone who does create their own VRC models, it is no issue to port your avatar over. There is a way to share avatars, but it requires giving someone an upload key. So if you don't know someone willing to do so, you're out of luck.\n\n*UI is not as easy-flowing\n\nYou have to go through about 3+(?) clicks in-order to hide a specific person's avatar. Kind of annoying, but it is part of a new game coming out. The menu in this game is fixed, which is nice! You can lay down and use it easily. However, there is nothing like the quick menu in this game, requiring you to open the fixed, opaque menu. \n\n*No [b]customizable[/b] safety settings\n\nAs far as I could tell, the customizability for safety settings doesn't seem to be in the game yet. Meaning, it is either full avatar on or full avatar off. Not having an option for shaders off and stuff really sucks, but I assume something like that will be implemented later.\n\n*No Friend Search (this'll definitely be implemented later so)\n\n*Unlocked account needed to upload more than 10 avatars\n\nThis is an inevitably for a new game. VRChat started on local server hosting, you used to have to connect with IPs. I believe they only moved towards dedicated servers/instances like today once they gained some funding from HTC(?). This is excusable, but definitely is something that I wanna note.\n\nOh yeah, all servers are European, so that is a good reason to try the game if you're European.\n\n*No answer to Udon currently, but Newton seems interesting\n\n\"using our in-house scripting toolkit \"Newton\" (not yet available). This way we allow creators to create game modes like Trouble in Terrorist town, various kinds of coop tower defense games or even MMORPGs in ChilloutVR\"\n\nI'd infer from this that maybe a save system of some kind will be possible in Newton? Mainly the line of \"MMORPGs\" is what gives me that impression. Currently, the only way to save in Udon would be a password system or a code that is auto-generated that can be copy and pasted. If Newton could have a save feature of some kind, it'd give it a massive edge over Udon. \n\n========\n\nI had the game while it was in early alpha and tried it a few times with a single friend, which of course isn't a great metric. I am not a Unity man myself so I was basically just looking at a growing game. Once the game released on steam, I hopped on with two other friends to try the game out for a bit. We joked that this game's community would just be a refuge for people banned from VRChat, especially during the beginning of CVR. As expected, in a game where you can create custom content, we ended up getting crashed. Due to the game's small community, this will definitely be an issue, as it is much harder to avoid toxic people since there are only 100+ players present at a time. However, the nice people you meet are definitely genuine in this game and want to see it grow. \n\nThe game feels as if its in an awkward middle-ground between VRChat and NeosVR. That mainly just comes down to avatars not being easily shareable I think. The main thing the game does seem to offer at the minute is the prop system. I'm not sure how it works, but it seems similar to spawning in an item wherever you want in any world. It also has the ability for you to interact with other people's dynamic bones without the use of a modded client. I personally do not care at all for that feature, but some people seem to love it.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to help build a community, then you'll enjoy CVR.", "timestamp_created": 1613535410, "timestamp_updated": 1613547695, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553400158882141113", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1613548496, "developer_response": "Hi there, many of the things you did not like are already improved for the next update.

Here is what I can say about ChilloutVR.\n\nIt's not comparable to VRChat, this is a platform to make things outside the SocialVR aspects. Here are the pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\nThis team is highly focused on Security and end user experience. Everything added is heavily tested for security exploits before its even available in testing/experimental branches.\n\nExample content is available in the Content Creation Kit (CCK). You rarely have to look for community prefabs in order to make content here, and modules are available for various whitelisted unity packages like Magica Cloth simulations.\n\nThere are many and I mean MANY safety features ranging from whether you want lights on people or down to limiting polygon counts on meshes.\n\nModding the game is safer than ever with a dedicated modding network for mods to use. No more hosted networks from mod authors, the game servers handle it all and keeps the game and users secured.\n\nCons:\nThe game has a bad habit of users from other platforms coming in to spread misinformation. The converter tools that people released are made from users who don't play the game and leads users into a bad experience.\n\nAvatar interactions are currently limited to the Pointer and Trigger system while it is very versatile, you cannot currently grab/pull on avatar bones. This may change in the future.\n\nFinal thoughts, all and all this is a great platform for creators and has excellent security for end users.

I spent months writing a compendium for it because the information the devs offered wasn't great and certainly wasn't enough.\n\nCVR really lacks content at the moment. It would be a huge advantage over its biggest competitor if it had a complete documentation so that users interested in uploading avatars and worlds could do so easily and without confusion.\n\nAs of right now, the game has come out of alpha and into early access. On the official documentation, there is a page for avatars, which is empty, and a category on the sidebar for worlds, which doesn't have a single page.\n\nAlso, I tried the game in alpha over the summer, and it said not to criticize the game because it was still in development. Seriously? Instead of say, linking to a page to report bugs or request features? Shows a lack of confidence in the product to me.\n\nI see immense revolutionary potential in social VR, one that transform the way many of us live. I am disappointed to see the devs of these social VR platforms, the ones actually in control of its future do not share that foresight nor vision.\n\nI've heard many long time users of CVR's rival claiming that it's an upgrade, saying it cares about the community, hoping for a better platform (entirely understandable considering the alternative). But I don't see it that way. I only see a clone. And I am immensely disappointed, because it could have been so much more.\n\nP.S.: CVR will never overtake it's biggest competitor without Quest support. I say this as a PC VR user who sees that the Quest series is by far the most popular headset (we don't count PSVR) and it will only continue to become more and more dominant. Yes many social VR users on Quest are far too young and Facebook and those respective platforms need to make it clear that these are mature spaces.

That being said, the game has a lot of features that are quite different than other titles, such as VRChat.   The first thing I noticed was that full body tracking is definitely really nice.  They also have options to lock the neck or spine if you want a more rigid full body tracking.  Having it set to default allows dancers to even perform body-rolls and other smooth looking dance moves that other VR titles may not quite allow as well.\n\nAnother nice feature is that you can set your preferences to filter Not Safe For Work avatars and worlds.  This means that you can turn off avatars that are flagged correctly by users, or have them always visible.   This is a great feature, especially for streamers. \n\nIf you know how to import avatars into VRChat, then you will be fine with doing the same with ChilloutVR.  Basically, Chillout has most of the features of Avatar 2.0, with a few nice additions.  There are some good tutorial videos of these features on YouTube if you want to search for those.  There will be Avatar 3.0 type support coming in the future as well.   The Devs update the game regularly with solid changelists and development tracks.\n\nThis game will just keep getting better.

I always try to be as neutral as possible at my reviews so what i'm about to give to you is an idea of the good and bad stuff of this game. Also on most of my reviews i try to put the good and bad point lined up so is easier to jump between point and look both sides of the coin when is about specific things (Note: If there is something good/bad writed, but nothing on the oposite side it means that is perfect the way it is for me).\nAnd finally before starting the review i gotta point that comparing this game to VRChat is neccessary as it has the potential to become the main competitor with it. So on this review there is gonna be lots of comparation with VRC.\nAnyway let's do this:\n\nThe good stuff:\n-Menu and configuration: As a VRChat player, because been honest most of the players here came form VRChat, i feel comfortable enough with the many options that i cna find at the menu. Be able to configurate my gameplay is important when is about virtual reality and ChilloutVR gives you a lot of freedom on this way.\n-Worlds and Transitions: The game is well optimized when we are talking about the current worlds in the game, i got a few more FPS than at VRChat which i deeply thank for. Also is really interesting to stick aroudn and interact for a bit longer on the world where you are while the next one is loading, this was a brilliant idea, 10/10.\n-Avatars and their system: Is really good and easy the way it works for uploading avatars to your account (if you were a content creator like at VRChat). It need a few more tutorial when is about adding animations into your avatars, but that's probably me because i haven't learn yet how to do them.\nThe idea of spam Prop swhich your friends or even strangers can use is amazing. As the system with the colliders and dynamic bones by default.\n-Social Experience: Right nwo there are not that many players, around 100-150 everyday and sometimes reaching 200. This makes easier to be friendly with people becuase at the end of the day you know most of the players and is easy to get close to them and talk. Anyway making new friends has been relatively easy for me so far.\n-Payment: Is free\n\nThe bad Stuff:\n-Menu and Configuration: For some people it can be way to conplicate and even if it isn't you gotta spend a few long minutes investigating to fully figure out how it works. I would recomend to make it, not simpler, but easier to look at for the players.\nAlso you ar enot able to hide the HUD (it gives you the option, but it doesn't work for now)\n-Worlds and Transitions: Not be able to see how heavy a world is before joinning is a thing that can scare some of the users of CVR. It's true that the game has no loading screen and you can stick for a bit longer with your friend at the current world before jumping to the next one, but a \"% loading bar\" would be good so we can cancel the jumping if the world is gonna be way to heavy or even give us those seconds to say \"good-bye\" to our friends before leaving that world.\n-Avatars and their system: It need a few tutorials for those who wanna learn how to upload custom avatars. The prop spaming can lag a bit or a lot of you don't add a limit of props to spam. The loading of avatars works fast, but currently at VRChat is faster and way less laggy.\n-Social Experience: You mist your friends at VRChat and gotta put more effort into this game if you wanna drag them form there, because eventually players who give a try to this game will miss the old friends playing VRChat and they will come back. I like the game, but i'm starting to think about going back sometimes into VRChat just to be with them. This is probably the biggest problem of ChilloutVR right now.\n-Payment: Is free unless you are a content creator, because if you wanna upload you creations you are gonna need to pay.", "timestamp_created": 1613083631, "timestamp_updated": 1613083631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86422541": {"recommendationid": "86422541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328491902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1613077236}, "language": "english", "review": "Vrchat the sequel?", "timestamp_created": 1613077866, "timestamp_updated": 1613077866, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.440949738025665283", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86413095": {"recommendationid": "86413095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274484180", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 574, "last_played": 1659030219}, "language": "english", "review": "Played before it released on Steam, it's got a lot going for it I will admit.

Even all the way back then, this game has been exceptionally stable. It has better performance than probably any other VR game I've played; even when I had a first-generation Oculus Quest linked up with a 2.0 cable with my RX 580 struggling to keep most VR games above ~20 FPS, this game ran smoothly, and now that I have a half-decent rig it runs like a dream.\n\nYou might ask why I'm focusing so much on the performance. Well, this is a multiplayer VR game. If the performance isn't smooth, you simply cannot interact with other players in the same way you can in real life or non-VR games. Only if a VR game is properly optimized can you comfortably play VR, as otherwise you get motion sickness, your hands can't interact with things properly, the other players might rubberband or freeze up, etc. This is one of the biggest problems with this game's biggest competitor, VRChat, which constantly lags, locks up, or otherwise performs poorly, even on the best of specs. To me, currently, this is the main strength of ChilloutVR. It has been rigorously tested and optimized to ensure some of the smoothest gameplay of any VR game I've played.\n\nThere are some things ChilloutVR is currently lacking, but they are primarily due to the game's early access state. For one, it doesn't have anywhere near the playerbase nor user-generated content of even the smallest of the other VR chatrooms. There are only a handful of avatars around, and just a couple of worlds to be in, and those worlds nearly always seem to be empty. But don't get me wrong, this game isn't dead; rather, it hasn't been born yet. There hasn't been some mass exodus of players or anything, they just aren't here yet, and I expect that to change quickly once this game leaves early access. The playerbase isn't the only problem, though. The new player experience is quite barren, with no real tutorials of any kind, so if you haven't played similar games you'll be totally lost trying to figure out the menus and controls (and even with that experience, it still takes a while to get used to this game's menu). But this is a sentiment that can be seen frequently in other reviews, and I expect this to change before the game leaves Early Access, as these developers are incredibly responsive (I've even had a chat with them once or twice, they are quite polite).\n\nSo, should you get this game? I'd say go for it. If you want to see what the next frontier is for infinitely-evolving, player-driven multiplayer VR, come right in. But right now, this frontier is vacant, save for a few tents. If you feel like jumping in anyways, welcome! The data you generate will be crucial to testing and improving this game, especially if you join the Discord and give feedback there. If you want a more complete, polished experience, come back soon! I'm not going to lie to you, this game is not complete or polished. That's why it's in early access. But mark my words, it will be.

In my opinion, no. But it is definitely the closest thing VRChat has had to competition in a long time, and it's clear a lot of work was put into it, with a clear view of what it should be (Which, frankly is \"VRChat but with some changes\")\n\nThe best thing about this game is the pre-loading of worlds and the seamless transitions to them. VRChat needs this. Most other things are exactly as they are in VRChat. Its impressive they were able to create so much so fast, but its also clear that being able to start with VRChat as a finished product to learn from drastically shaped their view and sped up their development. But that's kinda how this stuff works.  They've legitimately added some cool stuff to that (Inter-player physics, seamless world transitions, pre-loading, a cleaner and more responsive UI... most of the time) But overall VRChat has them beat. Udon, Avatar 3.0, and just the sheer level of content, gameplay, and players in VRChat.\n\nI will definitely be keeping an eye on this project and visit often. I think the worst thing about it at the moment is all the people in the game seem like its their duty to tell you how bad VRChat and their devs are, and how much better ChilloutVR is.  Tons of people who got banned from VRChat (for good reason) existing solely to be anti-VRChat. It's really disappointing and I think they need to...

Maybe I'll end up liking it - at the time of this edit, I am looking at ChilloutVR's SDK for avatar creation, I loaded up the pre-built Rexouium CVR package and I'm just exploring it and trying to compare it to VRChat's SDK3.0. I quite like the fact it allows you to not only set a view position, but also a voice position, I had never thought of that but it's just extra detail that I can appreciate.\nThe login process into the CVR SDK requires a special key from your account from their website, which is just an extra safety measure I'll presume. So far I like it.\n\n[h1]Edit 2 (1:32am, 12/Feb/21)[/h1]\nI've given the game a second try, this time with my own avatar uploaded and even met a friend accidentally in a random world. I have to say, my opinions have changed. I'll update the review tomorrow, as it's late right now.\n\n[h1][hr]The original review[/hr][/h1]\n\nFirstly, this game [i]needs[/i] a better tutorial. The default hub world with some signs explaining basic things was not helpful to me. I was clueless playing for basically the past 2 hours playing the game, and quite frankly, still am. This game makes no effort to explain how to get avatars, for example. I still am the default Kyle robot (not using the other 2 default ones, as they don't work as well with full-body).\nI know I can upload my own avatars, and most likely will, but as a noob to the game I would've at least liked to explore it for the first time in something other than the default avatars.\nI don't think there is any avatar cloning like VRChat, and there was no 'loading' avatar either - people would literally stay invisible until their avatar loaded in. \n\nThankfully, full-body tracking is very well supported, that worked instantly when I loaded into the game for the first time. Even has some options such as 'Pre-straighten spine' which I find useful for the quality of my tracking, which are not present in VRChat. There was no weird viewpoint drift either as is generally present with VRChat full-body. Still, I would much rather prefer it if the avatar would move according to your head's position, instead of being stationary.\n\nThe menu is also freezed into the world when you open it. When you press the buttons on it, it seems to only register that something is pressed when you [i]firmly[/i] press down on your trigger, either that or it failed to register the clicks half the time (my controllers are not the issue). The menu is less than pleasant, it will take up most of your vision when you open it and the fact you can't move it make it more annoying, I would much rather prefer a menu stuck to the hand like in VRChat instead.\n\n(so, why am I comparing this to VRChat so much? Well, as I've seen being said, this has the 'potential' to overtake VRChat. If it's supposed to have the potential for that, then it has to be [i]better[/i] than VRChat, does it not?)\n\nOne feature that surprised me was, when I took off my headset, I found out that I could still control the game & walk around as if I was in desktop mode - for the most part. Camera movement seemed to be stuck to just left/right (no up/down), and I don't think I could open my menu either. Still though, it's a cool feature that definitely gets an up over VRChat, but not sure how useful it'd be in its current state.\n\nI have yet to try the ChilloutVR SDK for avatar creation, so I can't compare that to VRChat's (if I did, I would compare it to VRChat's sdk3.0).\n\nA feature I saw that I was also unable to figure out how to do was Props. You can spawn your own props in the game - at least if you know how to, I guess? There's no props you can spawn by default, and you can't clone props from the world to your list or anything like that (yet again, the game makes no effort to explain the prop system to you). This is actually something NeosVR does better. In NeosVR, by default you start with a few 'folders', containing props inside. To get more folders, you can ask people to share more folders with you, obviously containing more props and even sub-folders. Unless ChilloutVR already does this (as I said, the game doesn't explain this stuff to you, so I'm still clueless), I think that NeosVR can also be an inspiration point. \n\n[h1]Overall?[/h1]\nI don't get how this is considered a 'VRChat killer', at least [i]not in its current state.[/i] The game does very little to incentivise me to move over to it from VRChat, and with the game's poor tutorial, I was still left clueless on many of the game's mechanics even after nearly 2 hours. I wanted to give it a proper try, I really did, I could've left in the first 30 but I didn't; I tried to like this game, as I heard the hype over it and its 'potential' to kill VRChat, but I ended up leaving disappointed. \n\n[b]If you're looking for a game like this where you can meet people and hang out, go play VRChat instead, or even NeosVR.[/b]\nCome back to this game at a later date.

I would like to see the new faces stick around. \n\n\nSo far, I've played this game for a three days now (not consistently, don't worry) and it works quite well. I have yet to properly crash yet and I like the prop system and I do hope to expand my skills in it once I understand the system some more. Hell, I got hit by a crasher and I didn't properly crash. So it's good in my book. \n\nBiggest two things I recommend is to try to improve the network stability some more and to make it a tad easier to have some sort of middle ground between the hand gestures and the menu option. The people after a while start jittering more then planetside 2 with terrible ISP like Pixius. At least I don't have to deal with floating sunderers. As for the menu, things like my Shield Hero avatar could use a system to to quickly change shields. However, as I type this, I think I have a good solution involving trigger collisions that I need to test. I'm still new to this, so it might not be needed. \n\nOver all, I am happy with this game. Hopefully it will overcome the MMO problem (which can be solved by recommending it to others *ahem*), and be a good competitor to other platforms like VRchat and put a fire under them.

No its not its beta and early access for a very good reason. \n\nAnd now that we are on it lets talk about the bad stuff first even though right now this is a more informative thing so people trying CVR know what they get into. World building is prolly the most sore spot due the proper scripting API not being finalized and released yet. And just having entered beta there is glitches and annoyances to be expected. Also the UI is still pretty much a draft and will get a major rework soon, its not bad and straightforward enough but still neither ergonomic nor pretty.\n\nAnd now lets go to the nice stuff. FPS, FPS and even more FPS, even now CVR is super optimized already and runs super smooth even on pretty weak PCs, unless someone uses a REALLY badly done avatar or world. A filled instance and you still have a bloody good time. CVR is unlike a certain other platform properly multi threaded and makes use of your modern CPU to full extend.  \n\nAs the time of writing CVR only crashed ONE time and that was the Steam release day. Also the CCK you need to create content for CVR is super easy to use, quick and very clearly structured, you made stuff in Unity before you feel right at home. Also something IMPORTANT to know for creators here, your hard work gets encrypted on the server and is encrypted in the local cache so ripping is very VERY hard, if possible at all right now.\n\nAvatars are bloody amazing you can make them simple or use advanced avatar settings that adds a lot interactivity, a boopable nose, a cellphone that controls your avatar you think about it you can prolly do it.\n\nCVR has props, you have a bare bones world that needs more stuff you can add it everywhere any time and like avatars you can make them anything you want, the cake has not to be a lie anymore. And once scripting is out maybe a chess game in a swimming pool? Why not.\n\nAlso some last icing on the top that never ends, intractable dynamic bones (touch peoples hair), the ability to fly everywhere (world creators will be able to turn this off to prevent cheating in games later), avatar colliders for example like being able to stand on someones hand if they are either really huge or you very very small, and user pictures in your name tag that wont cost anything extra.\n\nAnother thing is world loading, you can preload worlds you know you want to visit a certain time later, preload it in the backround and have it ready once you go. And world loading is seamless you stay in your current world until the other world is loaded and not being stuck in the loading screen for ages if your connection is not the most quick one.\n\nAnd before I forget two last things, while your basic account is a bit restricted a ONE time fee and you get everything no monthly recurring fee at all. \n\nAnd once the modding API is done, client modding is actually encouraged and welcomed no banhammer for just trying todo something good or enrich the game client.\n\nWill update this review as the game grows.", "timestamp_created": 1612919019, "timestamp_updated": 1613038021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580173969268798828", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86303148": {"recommendationid": "86303148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274711575", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1613706708}, "language": "english", "review": "I just spent about 4 hours in this game and its pretty ok so far, here's some pros and cons\n\nPROS:\n*Has some better avatar functions such as spawning in objects, customization, etc.\n*you have the ability to fly\n*the game feels a bit cleaner than vrchat\n*faster world load times\n*easier to calibrate fullbody tracking\n\nCONS:\n*The menu is very buggy, it takes 5-7 attempts to press buttons sometimes\n*there's currently no way to get custom avatars in game other than uploading to unity\n*there's a limited selection of worlds at the moment\n*it's hard to find worlds with any people\n\nOverall this is a pretty good game, it's just in it's early stages.

Nice people, but I never made any connections. That means this review is out of pure honesty, and a non-biased standpoint. [/h1]\n\n[b] TL;DR: It's going to take some time to evolve, but it is 100% worth it. At a fundamental level, this is the best social VR application. [/b]\n\n     This social application is going to provide a lot more than VRChat soon, and there will be a big shift in how social VR is perceived. I've had some friends join this game just to test FBT (Full-Body Tracking) as well as tested it with a Kinect (v2), and it seems to perform better than NeosVR and VRChat. On top of this, it actually multi-threads, so Ryzen and Intel CPUs are essentially equal and both get a performance boost.\n     Another big thing is \"Unlocked Accounts\". I understand the gross idea of making people pay to create content, but it cuts down on spam content, such as avatar rips, crashers, etc. that can make it into the game. Even if people are able to pay the $7 USD, there's a lot more safety settings then VRChat has to offer right now. You can toggle Gore, NSFW, Extremely Large/Small, Flashing lights, etc on both avatars and props. It's something I've wanted for the longest time and I finally found it. After all, that $7 helps the developers pay for server capacity and grow the community. and its the price of a fucking BURGER for god's sake. Help em out x)\n     So far, with the CCK (Content Creation Kit), It's super easy. It's just like making VRChat content except you won't need that separate SDK for worlds and avatars. As of 2021/02/09, it uses Unity 2019.4.13f1, which is a huge upgrade from the basic 2018.4.20f1 or 2017.4.39f1 versions that people used to use. Simply a better layout, dark theme by default, new icons for all your assets; it just makes everything easier: and while I know that's on Unity, it was a pleasure that the developers chose the 2019.4.13f1 version over the others.\n\nThis game has a lot of true potential in it.

It has more features from Day 1 than VRChat has implemented in its years of operation, It runs smoother and uses a better version of unity with more security fixes. There is a-lot to love about ChilloutVR! However it is a brand new release at the time of this review and there is some polishing required but if their track record is anything to go off of (timeframe of making the game etc) this shouldn't take too long and as someone who is heavily invested into the VR social experience I can say without a doubt ChilloutVR will be on-top in terms of players in the near future.

Being a avid VRChat player I'm pretty familiar with all of the ins-and-outs of VRC, what it's good at and what it isn\u2019t.  I\u2019ve just started messing around in CVR and would like to give my first impressions.  \n\nI won't mention anything about the playable content of CVR compared to VRC because that's pointless.  CVR was just released...VRC has been out for years.  Given enough time though, I believe the CVR platform has the capability and functionality to make better and more enjoyable content in the long run.\n\nMy immediate first impressions:\n\nVisually the game seemed more vibrant, detailed, and smoother than VRC even in the starting world.  This didn't seem to be a content observation but a technical one.  It just seemed....more crisp and detailed.  Objects in the world interacted more realistically IMO.\n\nAfter messing around with unity and the CVR SDK I managed to get my personal avatar loaded and joined a few familiar worlds solo.  Performance overall appeared better than in VRC counterparts. \n\nThe IK for FBT appears to be more sensitive and responsive, however still needs a bit of work.  Calibrating took a bit for me to get everything moving right, but still some movements were still a little wonky, most notably the hip/chest movement for me.  But overall, still better FBT tracking/movement in comparison to VRC IMO.\n\nJoined a world with 15 other people and this is where I noticed a fairly large drop in performance.  But nothing that was unexpected.  After turning off some settings, or setting them to friends only, performance returned.  It should be noted that performance issue, just like in VRC, are the majority of the time due to user created content and it's optimization, not the platform.  However, having said that, I can say that given an apples-to-apples situation, I am certain that CVR would outperform, FPS wise, VRC handily.\n\nIn short, CVR could be the game that might be the next stepping stone in the social VR experience journey.  Only time will tell, but it's definitely worth taking a look into if that's your thing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1612911238, "timestamp_updated": 1612911238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610152721405029297", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86297249": {"recommendationid": "86297249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107723195", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 543, "last_played": 1672424645}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool alternative to VRC", "timestamp_created": 1612908648, "timestamp_updated": 1647725051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86295062": {"recommendationid": "86295062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144511021", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1612908715}, "language": "english", "review": "Was choppy the whole time, menu is complicated and confusing, cant find anybody, current elements i can interact with when items arent stuck to my hands is ripped from Vrchat. i cant change the menu color to not kill my eyes.

For ChilloutVR i can't say it's quite perfect... at least as of yet, what do i mean by that is that there are somethings that need changes like the ui system needs some improvements, sometimes the FBT doesn't want to calibrate (But that's a rare thing to happen), and so much i can rant on about but overall i think this game is a great switch from VRChat to ChilloutVR. \n\nHere's some suggestion i would recommend for this game; \n-Add a search system ingame, so that way people can find users and worlds.\n-improve the ui system to make it more user friendly, if they want to keep this game alive then they need to change the UI.\n-Add more option for user instead of blocking and muting and content filter, i feel like there's more options to do with those types of UI interactions.\n-Change the portal from one click opens up ui to just clicking it and let people just join in without a problem, i do feel like it's a bit tedious to have that as an idea when it comes to the whole portal system.\n-Kick user permanently (Or at least a short amount of time), when there was one user who was being annoying to me and group i was hanging i would click kick and it'll take awhile for it to do anything and the dude would just join back in right away.\n-add index inputs, i was playing the game with valve index controllers and i've notice they don't do finger tracking as great as you would do in vrchat but there is a toggle option but it only disables gesture expressions which i don't like. \n\nSo far the game looks interesting to play but some friends of mine don't think so because of the first day of how the sites going so slow but i told them give it chance but oh well.\n\nI like where this game is going i cannot wait for improvements and fixes for this game!\n\nChilloutVR - 8/10\nVRChat - 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1612903060, "timestamp_updated": 1613538194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86292883": {"recommendationid": "86292883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198889008626", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1612911866}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit 14/03/2021 : All of my points below are still true. All UI complaints will worsen with their UI \"rework\" that is set to come soon, which is arguably worse than before.\n\nThis review section is full of friends of the developers and it shows, much like with Lavender.  Check out their friends lists.\n\n- Intro screen lasts for two minutes every time you launch the game. It's not loading anything, it's literally just credits. \n- Desktop use is nauseating, camera seems to be locked to headbone. Even with head bobbing disabled this is an issue.\n- IK and player positions are choppy, worse than VRChat's somehow. You can even see this in the trailer.\n- Menu system is barely above stuck Unity and is very difficult to navigate, compared to even NeosVR.\n- There are more buttons on this menu than a flightsim flight stick possesses. Feels like it was made by a braindead skid.\n- Menu slides away from you in desktop.\n- Worse performance by myself than in VRChat, opposite of what a lot of reviews are claiming. \n- Performance HALVES when I join any \"active\" instance.\n- Finding active instances is difficult, the tab in the worlds menu doesn't actually show how active instances are.\n- \"Reset filters\" for worlds means nothing when there are no filters to reset.\n- World transition shader is painful, to experience, especially in vr. It's also pointless because there's a loading screen still.\n- So far community is primarily just the kind of people who get banned from other social vr games for crashing and harassing people. They act the same in this game. \n- Finding avatars is difficult.\n- Can't see friends in instance despite joining off them.\n- All the worlds are just reuploads of VRChat worlds, classy. \n- Only public avatars that I could find are all TDA edits. \n- Pretty bad ping (roughly 200, while I get 100 in VRC). I'm in New York.\n- Frequent soft disconnects of everyone freezing and stop talking, just to have them speed up rapidly.\n- Can't find any instances in my region. EU-only seems to be the motif here. \n- Movement in vr feels clunky.\n- Rotation in vr is based on the center of your playspace.\n\n\nI'm still playing, and I'll update this as I play more. So far, much like that failed Lavender game a year ago, this is being held up upon empty promises that will likely fall flat. Reviews are mostly full of \"Has potential! 5 stars!\" which isn't a review, but that should be expected of people who are on the steam friendslists of the developers.\n\n\nEdit #1 : \n\n- Found out about the unlocked account system. The way to get content for your fledgling game is not by charging content creators. Pretty scummy.\n- Grabbing objects is based on the raycast of your controllers, making it awkward for actual use.\n- Some worlds that are shared between this and VRChat are actual rips of VRChat worlds; this means not reuploaded by the original creator of the world. Extra classy.\n- Read in the forums that the game doesn't work correctly with an antivirus enabled? Quote from NicoKuroKusagi, one of the devs: \" Sounds more like a malwarebytes issue, do you have that installed? \" in response to someone not being able to see other users.\n\nEdit #2 v2 :  Not a review per se, but I just got a friend request on Steam from someone offering to buy me an unlocked chillout vr account if I changed my review. Their name is Maebie and they were not a member of their staff according to developers and my quick search of their Discord., \n\nEdit #3 : When I asked in their discord about the antivirus thing, they had a bot say this: \"The realtime protection of some anti-virus software like Malwarebytes, AVG and Avast causes connections to our network to fail for some users. The easiest way is to add an exception or disable realtime protection to play.\" \n\nDo not trust any service that asks this of you, ever.\n\nEdit #4 v2 : CVR will have 3 things to purchase, 2 for one time, 1 for a subscription. The 2 one-time payments are the unlocked accounts and gold accounts. The subscription seems to be similar to self hosting, as an option.\n\nEdit #5: To the developer that responded:\n\nI appreciate you reaching out to my post. I will gladly update my review in the future if even half of these complaints get fixed. Thank you for being more specific on the payment model.\n\nI joined the Discord and did manage to find the name of the person that tried to get me to change my review to positive, and it wasn't a staff member.

The unlock is to cover the costs of our cloud at least partly, such a game does not persist if it is solely free 2 play. The gold ist aimed towards big game modes that require thousands of hours to make and as such can't be free, they are not in the scope of the main game anyways.\nThe reserved instances will be an option for users and communities that want their own banlist instead of using ours, need server side logic for game modes or different things.

Also been having an annoying issue with sliding around even when standing still, I'll be looking at a menu and slowly slide away from it.

To give a couple of examples, global dynamic bone interactions with other players, and a flight mode - both of which you would need to use mods to achieve the same result with the competitor. Features for the creative mind are also impressive, and included natively such as particle force fields and the props system, which allows users to globally spawn items they've created, and all users can interact with them. You can see these features showcased in the trailer.\n\nOverall, I am very happy spending my time over the past year with CVR, the community, and the rest of the team.

The features of the game are actually done pretty well and bugs are immediately dealt with on most occasions along with security and helping the player base via features, bug fixes, communication and etc. are seen as main priorities compared to one of its competitors. The game company is an independent from big tech grasps and cooperates on certain bits with third-party companies, such as Bhaptics, and Antlion audio. The staff and devs have laid a clear roadmap and are able to plan ahead even in rough situations. One big benefit to the community is how funding is directly from the users pocket with a one time 8 dollar purchase of an unlocked account which doesn't fully hinder gameplay as it only affects you in allowing you to upload more then ten avatars and worlds so forth, Compared to a 10 dollar monthly donation for a competitor it's a steal as not only does the money go to the game development but also benefits the player with them helping fund future features for the public player base, not only for those who paid a 10 dollar monthly subscription fee to a company who is paying off a big tech corp who they owed money to. Another benefit to the player base is the system in check for safety with a content filter system allowing for the ability to filter content by certain guidelines and allow for users to choose what they wish to see by preference or use it to block things such as IE. block flashing colors for those who have epilepsy.

If you will hear someone speak badly about ChilloutVR please don't listen to them and try the game out yourself, even if it's your friends.\n[strike][u]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/u][/strike]\n[b]Common misinformation consists of but is not limited to:[/b]\n[i][quote]\"ChilloutVR is just a ripoff / a clone of VRChat\"[/quote][/i]\nYou could very well say that VRChat is a ripoff of Second Life. It's like comparing apples and pears. Yes there are some similarities between the two but ChilloutVR is its own product bringing revolutionary stuff to the market.\n[strike][u]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/u][/strike]\n[i][quote]\"You have to pay to play / pay to upload\"[/quote][/i]\nChilloutVR is absolutely free to play. When it comes to uploading you have 10 slots for avatars, 10 for worlds and 10 for props. You can remove your assets or overwrite them by reusing the GUIDs. Other than that when it comes to public avatars there are [b]NO FAVORITE LIMITS[/b]. If you want to upload for example more than 10 avatars you need to purchase an unlocked account which is a [b]ONE TIME PAYMENT[/b] of $8. Unlocked account gives you [b]UNLIMITED UPLOAD SLOTS[/b] and helps cover the storage costs.\n[strike][u]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/u][/strike]\n[i][quote]\"The game supports ripping and crashers\"[/quote][/i]\nThis one couldn't be further from the truth. The game has completely secure backend with proper authorization, your assets are encrypted, cache bundles are incomplete therefore preventing people from extracting anything of use from them. There are several more layers of security which are not public. Of course same thing applies to crasher avatars. The devs are constantly expanding the anti crasher system which includes component analysis as well as shader analysis. In the future you won't even be able to upload crashers to the game.\n[strike][u]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/u][/strike]\n[i][quote]\"The devs are incompetent\"[/quote][/i]\nTo give a bit of insight on this. This mostly comes from people coming from VRChat. VRChat has been first published in 2014 and looked like this:\n[spoiler]https://twitter.com/VRChat/status/1350271716518481920?s=20[/spoiler]\nIt has been [b]in development for 7 years now (4 years in early access on Steam)[/b] and the game is still riddled with stability issues, no security and an abundance of bugs. Not to mention the fact that [b]VRChat has about 20 developers and 15+ million dollars in investments[/b].\nChilloutVR has been in development for [b]not even 2 years[/b] (company founded mid 2019) and the team consists of [b]ONLY 2 DEVELOPERS[/b] (who with the help of the community are funding the game) and has just been released into early access on steam yet many features already exceed what VRChat is capable of.\n[strike][u]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/u][/strike]\n[i][quote]\"The staff is rude and power hungry\"[/quote][/i]\nOnce again absolutely not true. The staff is incredibly nice and always willing to help everyone. The only people who are claiming the above are those who were behaving in a toxic way, harassing newcomers in public instances, playing ear rape over their microphones, saying profanities out loud and got banned by the moderation team.\n\n[h1][b]The actual review[/b][/h1]\nThe game has the potential to be absolutely the best. Many of the features already completely outclass the competition and many more are under development. Yes the game sure is rough around the edges but the issues are very minor and the goods heavily outweigh the bads.\n\nHere's a list of great features which ChilloutVR has:\n[list]\n[*]Great performance both in Desktop and VR.\n[*]Content Filter system allowing you to hide avatars based on tags (Flashing Colors, NSFW, Gore etc etc).\n[*]Dynamic Bones are networked so you can play with each other's dynamic bones without the need to use any clients.\n[*]No Trust system or ranks, everyone has the same nameplate.\n[*]You can have a picture next to your nameplate for free.\n[*]No favorite slot limits and no avatar cloning, instead there is avatar sharing and there are no limits to it.\n[*]You can fly.\n[*]Proper multithreading thanks to which worlds and avatars are loading in the background.\n[*]You can predownload worlds to have them ready for later without the need of actually going into them.\n[*]The UI can be fully modified however you want since it's handled via HTML/CSS/JS.\n[*]Pointers and Triggers which you can put on your avatar to physically interact with it. The cool thing is that the system is networked and cross avatar compatible so you can touch other people's triggers using your pointers.\n[*]Prop System which allows you to upload interactive objects and spawn them in worlds without the need to put them on an avatar. You can spawn your props no matter which avatar you are using and other people can also interact with them.\n[*]Advanced Avatar Settings which are allowing you to configure advanced controls like object toggles, material parameter changes and many many more. It comes with 100 parameter slots (no, it's not 128 bits like in VRC, it's legit 100 parameters).\n[*]Colliders on avatars are supported so you can physically push people or lift them up.\n[*]Particle Colliders also work so you can move people using your particles.\n[*]Physics Materials are also supported so you can make a bouncy castle :)\n[*]Particle Forcefields are fully networked so you can play with people's particles if they have External Forces enabled.\n[/list]\n\nComing Soon:\n[list]\n[*]Modding Support will be coming in the future and will be natively supported by the game (once again no need for special clients).\n[*]Future gamemode support (Newton scripting) with persistent data allowing you to save your progress and load it later on.\n[*]Newton scripting will also be possible for avatars and props.\n[*]Reserved instances which can run 24/7. You will have a whole control panel for them which will allow you to configure and control them in ways you have never seen before.\n[*]Future inventory system which will support custom items generated in gamemodes. You will even be able to trade them.\n[*]Future multi instance presence. If you are for example a DJ you will be able to appear in multiple instances at once.\n[*]Future group system (sort of like guilds) allowing people to even host group based instances.\n[*]Future event system which will allow you to host events and automatically invite everyone who signed up.\n[*]Cross instance call service allowing you to call your friends or even groups of friends in different instances. While in a call a 3D projection of your friend(s) will appear in front of you. Sort of like Star Wars holograms.\n[*]Natively supported secure video player. No more IP grabbing like in VRC, the video player will have trusted domains and a whitelist for unknown domains so nothing sketchy will play without your consent.\n[*]Auto tagging of avatars for specific things like screen space shaders and other things which could be used in a malicious way.\n[*]The ability to pass audio streams into the game. Good for listening to music with your friends and for DJs. You won't need to play it over your microphone or a twitch stream anymore.\n[*]Anti crasher uploading. Yes soon people won't even be able to upload crashers.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1612878272, "timestamp_updated": 1613128683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697805643081665039", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86269837": {"recommendationid": "86269837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039719404", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1612950032}, "language": "english", "review": "Just overall better than VRchat.\n\nNothing more needs to be said.", "timestamp_created": 1612877340, "timestamp_updated": 1613304194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503424644470214844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86269385": {"recommendationid": "86269385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281459889", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 755, "last_played": 1687620371}, "language": "english", "review": "Just try it out, it's good!", "timestamp_created": 1612876797, "timestamp_updated": 1612876797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86268014": {"recommendationid": "86268014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079314344", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1672538518}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me start by saying that Chillout is great but its not gonna blow vrc out of the water any time soon, not until it has a much higher player base.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that a lot of the features that are in chillout people are hyping over have been around in the likes of NeosVR for a while and that game is still lacking in players.

I found myself playing for 7 and a half hours until my Index controllers were about to die. This game has an awful lot of potential. From my 1k hours in VRChat and 7.6 in this, I already see myself possibly permanently moving over to this.\nSo, the performance which a lot of people are curious of - It's great. In VRC, when looking at a high poly model with dynamic bones I find myself at 30-40fps (running on a 2080 super and R5 3600 btw), but in this wonderfully well optimised platform, I run at 80 to in the 100s. I have all avatars hidden in most lobbies in VRC, so having all of them shown was weird, but the lowest framerate I got was a 51. Sure, the optimisation could definitely be improved, but with the state that it's at, doesn't need to be at the top of the list just yet.\n\nThe content filter is great. Being able to properly hide what I want to hide is a pleasant feature. The part where avatars are automatically reviewed before being uploaded and malicious creations will never see the light of day is much appreciated, too. \nThe community is overall very friendly and wholesome. I did run into one guy who started trying to sexualise me due to being a femboy (it's a lifestyle, it's just that some of us do sexual things and people see that as the norm, with is not true). The 2 moderators I ran into were chill and ready to answer my questions.\n\nThis game just released publicly, and even though it's been in private access with many updates prior, there is definitely a lot to do and a lot add. Flying is allowed for everyone, and allows you to fly at a good speed and noclip through anything. It would be ideal for world creators to have the ability to disallow this in their maps (for good reason). You currently aren't able to block people, but you can mute and hide their avatar.\nRight off the bat after booting the game, I noticed my full body was quite off at the feet, pulling them forwards even after toying with the height. The bHaptics support is TERRIBLE. From what a moderator told me, the player has to be moving to activate the vest (I use the X40), and so when someone was to swipe up from my stomach to my next, it would be a very awkward moment of the vest jittering from on and off, missing most of the vibration motors entirely. I'm sure this will be better in the future, and please add a visual vest prefab that you can toggle hidden to make adding it to your avatar easier like in the VRC mod by HerpDerpenstine.\nThe CCK (the CVR Unity SDK) is pretty basic from what I've done with it. The ability to upload your own props is genius, although only you or a moderator can decide when to delete the prop, so this could definitely be exploited - not to mention the props collide with you and will push you around if big enough.\nAs I said, this social platform just released publicly, and I'm sure a lot of what I said above will be changed. I just wanted to explain what it's all like currently.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed - no - LOVED my experience so far with ChilloutVR, and will totally keep playing it, watching it evolve in all terms. I'm to get into map making, and look forward to using their coding language \"Newton\" to make some cool maps and even GAMEMODES as they promise they're going to add. From what I've heard, one of the devs plans on creating an MMO RPG, *ENTIRELY* in CVR.\n\nIf you just finished reading my review and are still deciding whether or not to get the game, stop.

It's not beginner friendly. [/b]\n\nMost of the game's players are people that have played during the earlier stages of development (CCK 2.0/3.0). Returning players mostly sit around in one corner of the map, making it harder for newer players to find them.\n\n[b] 2. Talking to people is really repetitive. [/b]\n\nYou mostly meet the same people; you (almost) never see new players in this game.\n\n[b] 3. Updates are heavily creator centered. [/b] \n\nThis game's updates are often focused on creation tools and bug fixes that new players aren't going to use.\n\n[b] 4. The lack of public avatars. [/b]\n\nThere are little public avatars, which makes it less appealing to people not wanting to create their own avatars.\n\n[b] 5. The performance [/b]\n\nThis game's performance (at least in my experience) is very laggy and choppy with constant fps spikes.\n\n[h1] The positives [/h1]\n\n[b] 1. The CCK [/b]\n\nThe CCK (Content Creation Kit) is a very simple and easy to use SDK for avatars and worlds, making everything extremely easy to do. \n\n[b] 2. The community [/b]\n\nEven though it's [i] extremely [/i] small, it's an almost perfect community. I've never seen a toxic person in this game before.\n\n[b] 3. The moderation team [/b]\n\nThe mods/admins in this game are very professional and friendly. \n\n[b] 4. The prop system [/b]\n\nThe prop system is GENIUS. It's a very nice touch; not as good as NeosVR's system, but good nonetheless.\n\n[h1] Final verdict [/h1]\n\n[b] Should you play this game? [/b] \n\n[b] In it's current state? No. [/b] The community is small and the game can be extremely choppy at times, but if you have good hardware you should be fine.\n\n[b] In the future? Probably.

Everything is encrypted and all rip tools that work in VRC are completly useless in CVR.\n\n[u]What is different to other games like this?[/u]\nFirst of all CVR as the Base is more optimized then every other game in this category, but user generated content can always worsen the experience if for example one Avatar is not well optimized.\n\nCVR has some really interesting feature like Spawning your own props that other people can interact with, Interactable Dynamic Bones and Native BHaptic support, just to name a few. (everything is optional and toggable clientside)\n\nThe last one i want to point out is the Moderation, Worlds and Avatars are moderated really well. For example a world must be reviewed by a Team member to be publicly available.\n\n\nSo thats it from me, i hope to see you ingame soon and have a nice time what ever you are playing :3", "timestamp_created": 1612831083, "timestamp_updated": 1612850252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532441675662994385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86236856": {"recommendationid": "86236856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044631162", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1658945710}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game.

They have stuck to it despite averaging only 20 players or so the entire time. \n\nFor those that are looking to try this game now that there is a flood of new players.. Be aware server issues will be a thing. They went from maintaining their game with 20 players or so average to having 15,000 new accounts made within the last 48 hrs. They are upgrading their servers and trying to maintain this tide of new players that are incoming. Be patient. It's not easy to manage a growth of 1000-2000% in such a short time. No one could have anticipated this.\n\nAs far as everything goes this is just like VRChat, but with a lot of your standard mods built into it. The developers encourage the use and creation of mods that are not malicious. Stealing avatars and content from players is much much more difficult here if not unheard of.\n\nSee you guys in ChilloutVR :)", "timestamp_created": 1612828408, "timestamp_updated": 1658955648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 174, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833105087280273438", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86234975": {"recommendationid": "86234975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088192269", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 788, "last_played": 1683837258}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is a great social platform for finding friends, take part in community events, and more.
