It's definitely an open ended game where your choices matter, like a proper immersive sim should be, but its also highly playable and don't let the maze-like nature of the levels and what people say about its difficulty dis-encourage you from playing.\nI also did not find the UI and controls to be too much of an issue if at all, granted, I used a Community Layout that already set up all the controls for my Steam Deck (its a perfect game for the device in my opinion) so I didn't have to bother adjusting the controls, and I found the interface -while indeed clunky- pretty refreshing at the same time as I never played a game with this, almost operating system-like UI.\n\nI recommend using a few mods that fix some issues with this Enhanced Edition, Mouse Fix, downgrading the game version for better performance and BetterLogs mods are highly recommended. All can be found within the Community tab, as well as a walkthrough guide if you ever get stuck.\n\nOne comment about the actual game though, the ending is terrible and very anti-climactic.

Reading the accompanying manual pdf on another monitor is super helpful, especially for deciphering things like ammo types (\"Standard\" vs \"Teflon?\"). It's basically a soft wiki - it won't tell you everything but it tells you enough. The Steam Guides section is also useful as well as fan sites like 'systemshock.org' - which gives you a scary 'malicious site warning' but as of sept 16 2023 appears to just be a circa 2000s internet forum.\n\nSome artifacts of its time are a little funky. For example, it uses midi for music and I think SFX? So you can radically alter the sound of the game by installing a software MIDI synthesizer like OmniMIDI  with soundfonts instead of the default Microsoft Wavetable Synth and selecting that synthesizer in the \"Audio\" section.) I also rebound a few keys so I could toggle between being crouched and upright more comfortably (C for Crouch, F for Fully Upright) - and the few edge cases like going prone I can usually navigate by toggling to the mouse control UI.

Because AIs, like the ones directing traffic in most major cities, are usually given a facial logo and a name, most people consider them electronic personalities. This is terribly off target. An AI is utterly alien to the human mind. It is an incomprehensible, autonomous thinking construct to which all concepts of morality and emotion are foreign. Just because the face on the monitor at your local library smiles at you doesn't mean that the AI behind it has any understanding of friendliness whatsoever. To an AI, a human being is just another variable.\"[/h2]\n[h3]Kyojio Sashumori, psychiatric consultant specialising in abberant AI behavior[/h3]\n\n[h2]\"People ask me why I spend so much time jacked in...If they'd spent time in the Net, they wouldn't have to ask. It makes me feel pure, like a spirit or a perfect concept. When you've had that, walking just can't compare.\"[/h2]\n[h3]Shadowcat, Texas Net operative[/h3]\n\nThis must've blown people's minds back in 1994, like those apocryphal stories about people leaping out of the way of movie theater screens as a train drove towards the camera. It did all this on...8 MB of RAM. This one is tough to review, though, because 1) you have to review it with an understanding that the language of game design was completely different, 2) you have to review it with the understanding that graphical fidelity in those times merely [i]suggested[/i] some kind of corporeality (as opposed to a fully-rendered 3D model), and 3) that this is an edition that reverse-engineers the game in a way to make it easier to control.\n\nKudos to Night Dive for accomplishing that third point; the previous attempts I've made to play the game made me want to throw my computer at the wall. It becomes far easier to play once you bind the controls to somewhat universally understood keys for your average FPS. As a result, it's a little amusing reading the manual for the game as it was written in 1994.\n\nBut anyway, what a great game. If you have the patience to really give yourself over to it, it becomes a terrific experience. Everything about it feels so [i]right[/i]. Verisimilitude. Authenticity. Citadel Station feels completely lived-in, [i]real[/i]. Although it has the labyrinthine level design of the day, it never veers too far off into complete ludicrousness. There's this sequence where you're looking for a specific relay to repair in the Repair Bay and as you make your way through these long corridors looking for the correct input, you see all the other inputs that keep the ship functioning as you're looking around and I can't really describe how thrilled I was just seeing that Looking Glass took the time to devise all of these things to keep the search complicated and also allow for some minor, though crucial, world-building. There are many moments like this: you'll see messages scrawled on the walls in blood, or come upon a barricaded room full of unfortunate corpses, overturned furniture and firearm scarring on walls, intentionally sabotaged doors and control panels. Just about everything is interactable (even if, technically, clicking on something will only tell you [i]what[/i] it is). Although there is backtracking, nothing about it feels like you're doing it because the designers are trying to pad the game out; what they're really trying to do is engage your level of curiosity--you'll often find things you're supposed to deal with [i]before[/i] you even know you have to deal with them and it plants a seed in the player's mind to commit it to memory.\n\nAs such, the game doesn't hold your hand. It does give clues and it does lay out a sequence of events for you to follow, but it will not compel you to remember anything or write any of the important stuff down for you in a journal. You will need to keep some written notes. Merged with this is the great writing of the infamous SHODAN. While it's been mentioned incalculable times how scary and malevolent she is (and she is), her presence in the game, to me, really emphasized my (the player) rivalry with her. As in, each time SHODAN counteracted my (the player) attacks on her, it only spurred me (the player) into being smarter; to use all of my available tools; to really make it a point to f*ck with her plans and all of her servants and creations. Every time she showed up, I thought to myself, \"we'll see about that.\" It's a testament to Terri Brosius's skill as an actress that SHODAN feels so completely \"alive\" and present in a way that none of the other voice actors can even dream of coming close to. Ultimately this last point is a little disappointing. Edward Diego, the secondary antagonist of the game, has a terrible voice actor who constantly trips and stutters over his own words and it breaks the illusion somewhat.\n\nThe game is ultimately a product of its time; the nameless Hacker is stiffly controlled and this can be a reasonable impediment to people attempting to play the game. Just about everything is designed around you having to move and turn slowly.  My simple suggestion is to turn the combat off until you get the hang of it. The portions of the game set in cyberspace are another issue: on the one hand I recognize them as an incredible achievement for the time, on the other hand the limited ways Looking Glass was able to create abstractions for you to interact with in cyberspace means that things look very indistinct and it can be disorienting having to fly around looking for the correct way to go.\n\nUltimately, though, I'm just really happy to have finally played and finished this. I'm disappointed it's over.

However, I would not recommend this game to anyone I know. It is absolutely not built for the modern expectations of games. It features extensive backtracking and extremely unintuitive design and puzzles. \n\nOne example from the top of my head is one certain puzzle where an item is locked behind a force field. System Shock's floor layout act as a labyrinth with secret passages and rooms in every corner with a fairly big level of each floor. Now, I would not say I am very smart but I maybe naturally assumed the way to get past this force field was a secret passage or switch in another room, but no. The switch to deactivate the forcefield is in the exact same room with the item. A small pixel of a switch that perfectly blends into the wall texture. The room is also heavily irradiated so you wouldn't want to stay there long and search every pixel. The game likes to use that a lot. A tiny switch pixel in a massive floor layout that you can't progress through unless you find that switch.\n\nIf you somehow read that and decided you're still interested in the game then you're probably like me and enjoy the old and janky games more than a lot of modern games in which case I would heavily recommend it. I didn't use a guide and only used a mod to match the audio and subtitles of the audio logs as reading and hearing two different things at once was annoying for me. I hear the remake of this game is extremely faithful to the original even to its own detriment if that interests you instead but I wasn't a fan of the art style of the remake so decided to go with the original, the cheaper price also helped.", "timestamp_created": 1690803238, "timestamp_updated": 1690803238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50205761194229126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143020750": {"recommendationid": "143020750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094058751", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 757, "last_played": 1690665337}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No hay immersive sim como System Shock.

Lo he disfrutado bastante, pero si como yo, es la primera vez que lo juegas, tiene lagunas. Voy a poner mis pros y contras tras hab\u00e9rmelo pasado, por si alguien est\u00e1 en mi situaci\u00f3n y se estrena en esta saga: \n\nPROS\n\n- El ritmo de juego es muy bueno, y siempre tienes ganas de ir subiendo plantas para averiguar que pasa con esa IA loca\n- El argumento mola y SHODAN tiene muchisimo carisma.\n- Menci\u00f3n especial para los escenarios, muy intrincados y desafiantes. Se muere mucho en este juego.\n- La duraci\u00f3n muy buena, es un juego bastante largo, y mas si te gusta escudri\u00f1ar cada rinc\u00f3n.\n- El parche en castellano de la comunidad, fantastico. Chap\u00f3 para los que lo hicieron posible.\n- Muchas armas, objetos, mejoras, la interfaz... Buenisimo si se tiene en cuenta los a\u00f1os que tiene a sus espaldas\n\nCONTRAS\n\n- El backtracking (volver a zonas ya visitadas por el argumento del juego) se hace pesado en ocasiones.\n- Muy mal explicaci\u00f3n de objetivos, me ha pasado 3-4 veces que no sabia donde ir. En ese sentido se le ha notado y mucho los a\u00f1os. No es que haya que darlo mascadito, pero tampoco puedes ser tan ambiguo.\n- La IA enemiga, que es muy escasa, basicamente te pones en las esquinas, y los acribillas sin que hagan nada.\n- El combate final y el video de creditos. Del primero esperaba algo con un poco mas de chicha y mejor llevado, y el video del final es cutrecillo y dura un suspiro.\n- Los controles son malos y mal optimizado el mapeo. De hecho el stick izquierdo lo interpretaba mal (derecha- izquierda era arriba-abajo para el juego...) Al final us\u00e9 una aplicacion externa para mapearlo mejor.\n- La musica es horrible, machacona y repetitiva. Y no me vale lo de los a\u00f1os, que he jugado a mucho juego retro y hay trabajos muy buenos y aqui es todo lo contrario.\n- El ciberespacio es horrendo, lo puse al 1, no dir\u00e9 m\u00e1s.\n- Una de las peores cosas del juego: el respawn exagerado de enemigos de muchas zonas que estropea y mucho el avance en el juego. \n\nCONCLUSIONES FINALES: Lo recomiendo porque hay buenos mimbres y lo he disfrutado. Hay mucho que mejorar para la segunda parte ( de hecho hay mas cosas negativas que he comentado, pero tienen mas peso las positivas). Juego de 7 para mi, y me voy con la sensaci\u00f3n que a poco que se mejore eso, ser\u00e1 sobresaliente.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1690155612, "timestamp_updated": 1690155612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142597374": {"recommendationid": "142597374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388143886", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 859, "last_played": 1690385969}, "language": "english", "review": "i went into this game pretty much blind not expecting much from what looked like a typical boomer shooter. i was pleasantly surprised by the amount of depth this game had to offer and gameplay variety. by all means this game has not aged well, it offers next to none hand-holding and you have to make sense of the notes left by the dead researchers to figure out your next objective. without a guide i could not see myself beating this game especially the reactor overload part and abe's head (i was looking 30 minutes for it because i dumped it somewhere in the corner of the level.) despite this i had a great time playing this game, shodan was an amazing antagonist who watched your every step, the levels were huge and although at times painfully confusing offered a lot to see and experience. the journal way of story telling has been done a lot of times, but i sincerely think system shock did it the best. you really felt like you were the only person on that station merely observing the effects of the carnage around you. the ending felt like a gut punch compared to the wonderful previous 10 hours, but i found myself feeling content after finishing the game anyway. this was a great experience and i urge you try it out yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1690049097, "timestamp_updated": 1690049097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50205761194229126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142451357": {"recommendationid": "142451357", "author": {"steamid": "76561199167888998", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 2765, "last_played": 1699723245}, "language": "english", "review": "Dude I love this game, its janky movement results in you phasing through walls, the lack of Linux support is infuriating for the amount of stuff that the developers can just patch in and how a walk through is basically required for the first time player, dear god the short rendering distance and the amount of levels drags the game out a bit but I still love it. \"Its controls grow on you\" Trav guy said, and yeah, they do.

While not the first true three-dimensional environment, it has the first implementation of such an environment in a game of its scope. For first-person \"grounded\" action games, and games in general, System Shock introduced the following as mechanics:\n\n- Complete control over the movement and positioning of your character, including leaning, crouching, prone positioning, mantling, and a complete range of viewing angles\n- Obtainable audio logs with the purpose of supplementing world-building and story-telling, composed primarily of audio vignettes that attempt to remain grounded in the world's current events\n- An interactive environment that responds to actions the player takes within it (such as destroy-able & interactive objects, and a world that responds to where the player is & what they are doing)\n- A completely dynamic & reactive soundtrack that flows seamlessly without interruption & responds to current conditions in-game\n- Completely configurable difficulty, with each section (Combat, Story, Puzzles, and Cyberspace) ranging from 0 (Very Easy) to 3 (Hard)\n\nThat being said, it's easy to see why this game remains a cult classic: it was ahead of its time, and it's influence can still be felt almost 30 years later, with franchise giants such as Deus Ex, Bioshock, and Prey taking close notes, and simultaneously lending itself, vicariously, to a trove of independently-developed games, such as Ctrl-Alt-Ego and the upcoming Peripeteia, through its spiritual successors.\n\nWith that out of the way, it's not hard to see that this is a game from 1994. No matter what it has accomplished, no matter what standards it set for the industry at-large, it still succumbs to being a product of its time. For many, this is a major turn-off, and the game is too clunky for most to get into - understandably so. However, the game is very much worth the purchase, especially if you can stomach the outdated controls and gameplay methods. The Enhanced Edition in particular comes with mouselook and a stabilized engine out-of-package to ease the pain of the game's original jank and clunky mechanics, alongside broader configuration parameters.\n\n[h1]Plot & Story[/h1]\nYou play as the Hacker, unnamed, who was busted by Tri-Optimum, a mega corporation piloting & maintaining the first-ever large-scale space station, Citadel Station, which sits just outside of Saturn's reach. After attempting to hack into Tri-Optimum's net infrastructure to steal classified documents pertaining to Citadel Station, the station's on-board A.I., SHODAN, detects the Hacker & dispatches corporate police to detain him from his home in New Atlanta. Shortly thereafter, a high-ranking executive within Citadel Station, Edward Diego, offers the Hacker a deal: remove the ethics restrictions of SHODAN, and walk free, with a bonus neural implant thrown in. He accepts, removes the restraints, and is promptly sent to the Medical Level to receive surgery, where he is put into a regenerative coma for 6 months afterward. When he awakens, all hell has broken loose... and SHODAN has taken complete control of the station, with plans to eradicate human civilization on Earth. Fortunately, some survivors have put together a plan to stop her, but the Hacker is the only one who can put the plan into motion.\n\nThroughout the game, your primary antagonist will be both SHODAN and Citadel Station itself. The station proves itself to be a force of worrisome opposition, cobbled together in maze-like fashion, always aiming to confuse and misdirect you. Careful attention to detail is necessary to combat the winding hallways, and to keep you away from enemies within. Whenever you come to a major story beat, one that could put a temporary stop or permanent end to SHODAN's madness, she reminds you that she can see your every move - and compliments the reminder with a lethal consequence. She's a carefully-written and maniacally evil antagonist, and always lets you follow your little breadcrumb trails to hope until she rips it away at the last second. There's always a looming sense of danger, regardless of where you currently reside.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay, as it stands, is confusing and very crunchy. The moment you begin the game, you're greeted by quite possibly the most intrusive & complex HUD ever developed for a first-person game. Several readouts, a large handful of buttons, and 2 large panels, which can be customized to display 5 types of information fill the screen, completely overshadowing the actual view of the world itself. Outside of that, the main issue plaguing gameplay is the awkwardness of the controls - interaction is done primarily through left-clicking to learn about objects in the world, while double-left-clicking is done to pick up objects. This unlocks your mouse cursor, and if the object can be taken, it must be dragged downwards into the inventory and placed there. All combat actions are performed by right-clicking. \n\nAs for movement, WASD controls directional movement, while ZXC controls leaning, and RFV controls player stance. Shift activates sprinting, which can be done from any player stance, and any lean orientation. It's a nauseating experience to attempt to learn these controls, but after about an hour, it will become second nature.\n\nCyberspace is even worse. When you enter Cyberspace, you get placed into a descent-style 6D shooter minigame. It has controls for view angle orientation, alongside rolling to the left or right. Additionally, all the only form of movement you have is forward - and to compliment that, a button that allows you to propel forward faster than the rate at which you do normally, which is constantly applied to your cyberspace avatar. If it's hard to tell, these segments of the game aren't necessarily remembered fondly.\n\nThe best element of the gameplay is the game's soundtrack. It has a large scale of arcade-y, suspenseful, creepy, and cyberpunk-styled scores that, as previously mentioned, grow and wane in intensity based on what's happening at the current moment in-game. The score is amazing, and adds to the atmosphere incredibly well, lending it's usually up-beat production to bright and intriguing environments found throughout Citadel Station.\n\nIn summary, the gameplay is odd & clunky, but can be mitigated by familiarity, in addition to the engaging soundtrack.\n\n[h1]Overall Recommendation[/h1]\nHonestly? The remake might be more suitable to a modern audience. There are too many issues plaguing this game's accessibility, and players who are more accustomed to modern comforts and QOL implementations may feel lost in this game's jank. However, if you have a love for older games, and don't mind overcoming some initial obstacles, this game is phenomenal, and is absolutely worth your time for at least one playthrough (I personally bought this game on Steam despite having already played it to completion before, just so I can have it in my account).

Yes, in general I would recommend System Shock, but not for everyone and maybe the possible player group is not that big. But sure, for some people it's a good game. Is it one for you? Find out.\nFirst, I will tell you my points that I don't like about this game. That way you can see if you share my negative points. Second, I'll give you the reasons why I think it's a good game (at least for some people). Third, I'll give you recommendations on how to play the game so that the negative points don't matter so much, and the positive points are more prominent.\n\nThe negatives\nSystem Shock is a game that likes you to do the job and it wont help you. Sure, you have the plan: turn off a machine, for that you have to press some buttons and find some codes (to open certain doors). But why should it help you if you can't find a button or when you're not sure if you've already pressed one. Why would it save the codes in a file for you? Write them down on a piece of paper on your desk. Oh, you've looked everywhere, and the problem isn't solved. Obviously, you missed something. I guess you must figure out what, good luck!\n\nI think that describes my experience with the game very well. It's an interesting concept. You're alone on this station, there's no help for you, and you must figure everything out for yourself. System Shock is not a game you play, you beat it because the AI is playing against you. It's very interesting. It's addictive. But as I described, there's a high risk of it getting really frustrating because you missed that one button because you didn't know it existed. I did finish the game, but I would have given up if I hadn't used three different walkthroughs, one of which was a longplay video on YouTube. If that sounds daunting to you, this game probably isn't for you!\n\nThe positives\nSystem Shock is atmospheric. And even though the way the story is told isn't exactly generous, you mainly learn about the station and what happened to the crew, how they lived and fought, for example through audio logs lying around the levels of the station. And you guessed right, it's up to you to find them, no help is offered. But the story they tell is very interesting, their sound design very good, and there are some questions that come to mind when I listen to them that are more important today than ever, for example: How would you find out, that your well-engineered really advanced ai is not longer aligned? \n\nAnd in a way, this game concept of letting the player figure it out for themselves supports the immersive experience very well. You never know what's in the next level, what to expect, what happens when you solve a problem. I like those things, and so from my point of view I would recommend playing this game, or at least if the subject is interesting, listening to the audio logs yourself, they are great. But of course I wish the game would support me more in following the story.\n\nHow you should play the game\nBut to be honest, there are ways to improve the game experience. First of all, there are the difficulty options. There are four different segments of the game that you can set from 0 (very easy) to 3 (very hard). In my first walkthrough, I set everything to 2. I wouldn't do that again, and I wouldn't recommend it, at least if you share some of my negative characteristics. So here are my recommendations:\n\nMission on 2, because on 3 you have a time limit of 7 hours to finish the game, and that's a really hard limit. 0 leaves out most of the story, so you won't find any audio logs, which to me is one of the best parts of the game. I don't really know what 1 does, but it changes the plot a bit (makes it easier), so maybe that's not so good if you want to follow the story.\nCyber at 0, because that sucks. I never wanted to spend more time in it than I have to, if I could have skipped it I would have. Neither a good control, nor a fun part of the game. (There's a reason they completely reworked that part for the remake).\n\nPuzzles on 0-1: For me they were like pure trial and error. An example (a really simple one, just to show what I mean):\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nYou have a cable (actually 2-4) that you need to connect the terminals on one side to the terminals on the other side to charge enough power to open a door, for example. So you can connect 1-1 or 1-2 or 1-3 .... What is the solution? I don't know, and I don't know if there's a better way to find out than just trying it. If you enjoy that, increase the difficulty, if not, decrease it.\n\nCombat on 1-2: This is a difficult area. For one thing, with good enemies, you feel pressured every time you enter a new level for the first time. You don't know what's coming, there's no respawn option, you die and must reload. I guess it's not as tense on level 1 (for some that's a good point), but I would still recommend playing on level 1. The reason is level 3 of the station. There are those pesky semi-invisible flying mutants that respawn very often. Generally, there is monster respawn on all levels of the station, but it seemed more present on level 3 to me, one reason could be that it is not as big as the other levels. In my run there were (one of many times) that I got stuck and I had to go back to level 3 very often, and each time there were 2-5 new ones of these mutants hanging around on the stage. I killed hundreds of them, but they come back every time. Maybe that's not a big problem if you can get through the game very cleanly, but that wasn't the case for me, so I would have liked there to be fewer enemies, or at least weaker ones. This can be achieved by setting the combat to 1. \n\nSetting it to 0 disables combat for the most part. Enemies are killed in one hit (regardless of weapon) and do not attack you. A way to play the game if you are only interested in the story, but as I said, for me the game experience is somewhat compromised by the dangerous enemies, so I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nFinal thoughs\nI began System Shock to look back to a classic of the genre. I was interested in the plot, frustrated by the game design, but I stayed for the story. With some adjustments, as I told you, I would had a better experience. It could be a very good game, but so it isn\u2019t that good for everyone. Remake may fix many problems (improves for example the cyber space and obviously the graphics and controls a lot) but it is faithful, so if you want to avoid frustration, its maybe not the game for you. But I would recommend listening to the audio logs if the subject is interesting, and trying the game if they can captivate you. If you don't like the story, I wouldn't recommend the game either. The gameplay alone was not enough for me to play or recommend the game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1686271329, "timestamp_updated": 1686271329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722864866256713867", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139751552": {"recommendationid": "139751552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064266834", "num_games_owned": 919, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1686254594}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe this is a classic game, but this game gave me nothing but headache with its repetitive music, DISASTEROUS controls, clunky and not understandable UI and bright and eyepain-inducing graphics.", "timestamp_created": 1686254707, "timestamp_updated": 1686254707, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480955392122268677", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139750341": {"recommendationid": "139750341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150497754", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 1380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1380, "last_played": 1685918827}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know who's more talented: Looking Glass for designing a game with such immersive elements in 1994, or Nightdive Studios for actually managing to make it play like a video game and not a motherboard BIOS. \n\nEither way, those things combined have made this game pretty awesome and worth a try for the modern audience, even if it does take some getting used to.

System Shock is incredibly advanced and feature rich for its time. I can't believe this game came out in 1994. Only a year after the original Doom! I came to love the inventory and movement system. It's astonishing how much control you have over the character. You can tilt your character to peek around corners and smoothly transition from standing to prone. You can also aim in any direction without turning your character. Most of these features aren't even available in modern FPS games! \n\nThis game oozes with atmosphere and it gets genuinely creepy at times as you witness Shodan become gradually more deranged. Combat feels deliberate and satisfying without being overly difficult. You get a text description of everything you encounter in Citadel Station which mostly makes up for the lack of detailed textures in the game. One thing I didn't like very much was using the Cyberspace Terminals. The flying and combat feels terrible even by 1994 standards, but thankfully the Cyberspace segments are relatively rare and they don't take long to finish.\n\nIt's pretty awesome to see the System Shock franchise make a resurgence and I think it's well deserved.

Even though many of its game design ideas were kept alive in its sequel and the BioShock series, it is surprising to see how early those ideas were not only already thought of but how they were implemented in this game all the way back in 1994.\n\nThe amount of details and the scale of this game still makes my jaw drop and the game still stands out - if not necessarily audio-wise, but visually, story- and gameplay-wise, and even controls-wise in my opinion, as even though it takes some time to get used to the controls, if configured and practiced right and for long enough, I honestly believe the controls shine and the game would be a lot less had it not been for the way it is controlled. You have a lot of options in terms of movement and combat, with different levels of crouching and leaning, running, jumping and climbing, as well as managing your ammunition-types and your inventory, having different explosive devices, med-kits, beverages and combat-boosters. Lots of things to find and utilize, and albeit complex, most of the time self-explanatory and also a lot of fun.\n\nThe game is also really vibrant in colors and honestly looks really good to this day, and the story and setting are badass, horrific and original, and the game environment - despite its age - still lets you get immersed and feel truly a part of the game's world. The voice-acting is incredible and the amount of lore you can discover throughout the levels is honestly impressive and lets you dive into the game's atmosphere even more.\n\nThe only real problem I have with the game is in its progression design. Much like in Ultima Underworld 1-2 for example, it takes a lot of time, effort and endurance to get through the different levels and truth be told, it can be a bit of a struggle to figure out where to go and what to do exactly sometimes, as the heaps of logs you can find - which sometimes are even necessary to get through certain areas - and the amount of notes you potentially leave on the map for yourself on each level may get overwhelming.\n\nHowever, also like in Ultima Underworld 1-2, death is but a pause as whilst in those games you had the silver seed to plant wherever you liked (and wherever there was soil), in this game you have pods - very much like in BioShock, rather - where, if located and activated first, you will be able to respawn as many times as necessary. The more you play the game the easier it gets as well, and sometimes a new game start may benefit you more than you'd think you would lose with it.\n\n[i]All-in-all, what an amazing game System Shock really is and to think how ahead of its time it was, it is utterly jaw-dropping and to this day, an interesting and one-of-a-kind gaming experience.[/i]\n\nAlso, as reference for playthroughs: [spoiler]435926[/spoiler].", "timestamp_created": 1685145316, "timestamp_updated": 1685217575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138952591": {"recommendationid": "138952591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023213688", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 912, "last_played": 1686433118}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played quite a bit of difficult games.

Originally released in 1994, it's a first-person sci-fi FPS that set the bar for future games in the genre.\n\nThe game takes place on a massive space station, the Citadel Station, where you take on the role of a hacker who awakens from a coma to find the station has been taken over by an artificial intelligence known as SHODAN. You must navigate through the station's complex systems, solve puzzles, and battle enemies while uncovering the truth behind SHODAN's actions.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition features widescreen support, improved controls, and a host of other improvements that make the game more accessible to modern players without sacrificing the original's immersive gameplay. The game's atmosphere is intense, with a dark and foreboding setting that draws you in from the beginning. The sound design is top-notch, with a thrilling soundtrack that adds to the overall experience.\n\nYou'll find a wide range of weapons, gadgets, and items to help you navigate through the station's hazards and put an end to SHODAN.\n\nThe game's storytelling is also exceptional, with a well-crafted narrative that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The game's many logs, messages, and recordings provide a rich backstory and help to flesh out the world and its characters.\n\nIn summary, System Shock: Enhanced Edition is a masterpiece of its time and still holds up today as one of the best sci-fi games of all time.

All this while a sadistic AI that controls all aspects of the station watches you through its cameras, trying to stop you from interfering with it's plans to destroy earth. \n\n[b]That is this game.[/b]  \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nI played this for the first time in 2022, not knowing what to expect but enjoying Deus Ex, and last week I finished my third playthrough of this game, this time on the max difficulty. It is probably now one of my favorite games of all time. Seriously. The controls do take some getting used to, but you don't really need to read the manual to understand them, you may need to remap some of the defaults though. The toughest hurdle is learning to naturally switch mouselook on and off.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it very much is a metriodvania, except every area and floor is designed with a purpose in mind, meaning while the floors are complex, you'll probably only get lost on floor 7 :P. You can travel in between the levels at will, and often have to backtrack. There's lot's of logs, and they are stored in your brain, which means that unlike it's predecessor Ultima Underworld, you don't have to keep a physical piece of paper in front of you to write everything down, since you can just listen to any of them again at any time. The only point I got stuck in the game was during my first playthrough, where I had to find the reactor code, and that was only because I had not found a log entry that told me exactly how to find it. If you pick up every log, you can simply piece everything together and will always be able to figure out what to do. As for combat, different enemies take different amounts of damage from different weapon types, and you can't carry all of them at once, meaning you'll have to learn how to kill them effectively in order to save your ammo. There are also infinite respawn stations on every level except 8&9. Some are easy to find and you can get to instantly (R,4 & 6) and others you'll have to work for. There are also cyberspace sections that break up the flow of the gameplay. They aren't great, but most are optional. (You only have to do ones on levels 2, 6, and 9).\n\nA few notes:\n- The captions and audio never line up. It was released on floppy disc without voice acting first. (Which is also why it sometimes refers to Shodan as 'he', because they hadn't cast Terri Brosius yet.)\n- Cyberspace's controls and movement is wonky, but it isn't terrible.\n- The wire puzzles aren't fun and are just trial and error.\n- This game started two long standing traditions with immersive sims: The first code being \"451\", and the ending being underwhelming and not very good.\n- The only time the game crashed for me was when I turned on a bunch of \"augs\" and attempted to speed through the stupid :ss1bomb: maze.\n- It's supposedly a horror game, but isn't very scary. The colorful visuals and old lighting don't help.\n- If you want to remove 100% security on level R, there's a computer box on a table you need to smash.\n- It uses midi music, which is pretty good. You may want to install a better soundfont for it. \n\n*(It does now use kex engine, so the visuals are slightly better, but not much)\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nOverall, if you like immersive games that let you slowly explore at your own pace, are able to pay attention to details, and want to experience a classic, [b][u]I'd highly recommend System Shock: Enhanced Edition, it's a GREAT game[/u][/b].

God, these intros just write themselves.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nSystem Shock sets itself in a future filled with laser guns, space stations, and digital neural interfaces.  Players step into the cyberpunk boots of a hacker doing exactly what someone with a moniker like his tends to.  Unfortunately, only minutes after jacking into the network of the TriOptimum Corporation, he finds himself arrested by their private security forces and shuttled off to their Citadel Station, a multi-tiered research and mining platform orbiting Saturn.  It's here that Edward Diego, Vice President of the station, offers him a deal: Hack into the station's attending AI known as SHODAN and remove her ethical constraints for his own private illegal purposes.  In return, TriOp wouldn't press charges against the Hacker and would even surgically implant a military grade neural interface into his brain for services rendered.  The Hacker agrees, hacks into and edits SHODAN, and then finds Diego making the surprise move of keeping his word.  After deleting all records of the event in SHODAN's memory, he allows the implant to be installed and the Hacker is put into a six month coma on the medical deck at the bottom of the station to heal.  When he finally wakes, everything has changed.  Grotesque cyborgs, mutants, and robotic monsters stalk the halls of the station which is heavily damaged while corpses suffering varying levels of mutilation litter the floors. The Hacker instantly receives an incoming call mere seconds after he installs a neural messaging device.  A TriOp counter-terrorism agent on Earth who had been investigation Diego is thrilled to be in contact with the Hacker, as he has the hardware capable of stopping SHODAN.  During his six month hiatus, the AI he hacked went completely rogue and grew an insane god complex; killing or experimenting on every human she can find aboard the station with her ever growing army of cybernetic and mutated minions.  Now charging the station's mining laser and seemingly intending to fire it on Earth, the hacker is TriOp's only hope of stopping SHODAN before it's too late, but only if he can work his way up the station to the Bridge where she resides.  It's the perfect setup for an action adventure game and the intro does an excellent job of economically laying the plot out in less than two minutes.  While the story that follows the intro isn't particularly complex and there certainly aren't any interesting human characters to meet, it still has a few fun little twists to entertain players while SHODAN continually chastises them for their impotent attempts to stop her.  She's ever present throughout Citadel and always has a backup plan ready if you somehow make progress against her.  The ending itself is a bit abrupt and doesn't connect very organically to the gameplay it interrupts nor does it really have any satisfying character arcs to complete or major plot points to reveal, but it still feels oddly satisfying in how humorous the story's outcome is.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nSystem Shock is a first person shooter with an emphasis on environment exploration and interaction.  Players will have to fight their way through multiple decks of Citadel Station to reach the Bridge, but due to extensive damage, security lockdowns, and other obstacles; this task isn't as easy as going from point A to B.  The game has little in the way of objective tracking.  Instead, players are trusted to pay attention to their environment, their map, and most importantly: audio logs and communications that they find or are sent.  This ultimately proves to a be a double edged blade as it can be incredibly satisfying to experiment your way through objectives without objective markers guidance and equally frustrating to need a guide because the single audio log dedicated to an objective wasn't particularly well written.  Players get their hands on all manner of firearms, energy weapons, grenades, mines, and cybernetic hardware as mundane as a head lamp or game changing as rocket boots.  The station is filled with all tons of enemy types.  Some fly, some turn invisible, and some just straight up suicide bomb the player; but most of them will just try to shoot or batter you to death; not to mention the many traps set by SHODAN.  The sheer number of ways the player can traverse the station and do battle is admirable, albeit clunky.  The player interface is likewise highly customizable but clunky.  In fact that really describes the entire game.  It offers so much player choice that it's ultimately a detriment to the pace of the gameplay.   Still, the moment you go skating across the floor on hover boots, slashing multiple robots to pieces with a laser sword as you speed by is the moment you realize just how much the game's systems have to offer. The awkward controls won't destroy the experience by any means, but they're certainly worth keeping in mind.  Perhaps the biggest gameplay drawback are the cyberspace sections where players effectively fly around a very nausea inducing network of wireframe rooms and tunnels while blasting anything that gets in the way.  These sections are generally brief and aren't too prevalent, but they're also easily the worst part of the game.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\nSystem Shock is a game that looks interesting to say the least.  It's 3D environments are simple and blocky and sometimes the bright colors of the texture work can be downright garish.  Despite its simplicity, it still does a great job of feeling like one massive interconnected station complete with endless corridors, crawl spaces, hangar bays, storage rooms, and even a massive security tower protecting the Bridge.  It has zero loading screens to slow you down.  Enemies could certainly use more animation frames and they all tend to just repeat the same noises again and again but at least this helps warn players that they're nearby.  Audio log acting leaves a lot to be desired and the text for the logs almost never matches what the characters are actually saying, but SHODAN's voice acting and audio design is simply perfect.  The music is the most inconsistent part of the package by far.  Sometimes it's impossible not to move to the beat and other times the sounds in your ear are actual headache levels of garbage.", "timestamp_created": 1680392561, "timestamp_updated": 1680392561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135659476": {"recommendationid": "135659476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031119731", "num_games_owned": 1595, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 1073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1073, "last_played": 1680072959}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, very ahead of its time.

controls need a little bit of getting used to, but they aren't really as bad as some people say (Enhanced edition). Press E to toggle between 'use mode' (throw grenades, reload, heal, etc.) and 'shoot mode' (shooting, looking around, etc.) Double click to interact, right click to shoot. Z and C to lean. R, F, C to stand, crouch or prone. Space to jump, and shift to sprint. It's a bit more complicated than it sounds though. Reloading requires you to toggle into 'use' mode, double clicking your ammo to remove the clip, then select the ammo that you would like to use (Usually standard or armour piercing). Throwing a grenade requires you to toggle into use mode, click the inventory tab, click the grenade you want to throw, then right click to throw. Using augments just requires you to click the button on the screen when in use mode. It is really great when you get the hang of it. Reloading and throwing grenades mid combat is a lot more satisfying compared to most other games where you just press 2 buttons. It feels like a skill.\n\nThe game doesn't feel like it stops and holds your hand for you either. It throws you straight in. No training mission or anything. You'll be informed of what you're supposed to do, but you're the one who has to figure out how. Eg, you need to go through a room flooded with a bio-hazard. You'll probably need a hazmat suit. Well guess what? Someone stuffed all of the suits into an airlock and threw them out into space! You check the logs and find that somebody recently used one of the few remaining suits on a different floor, so you go down to find out what happened to the suit. You find written down that the bloke last had it in his office, so back up you go. When you arrive, you find that the door requires a key card. So off you go to find the key card to get into the office in order to pick up the hazmat suit so you can finally pass through the bio-hazard unharmed. And not once was there a marker or objective to tell you exactly what you're supposed to do. These are problems that you had to overcome yourself. Another example is when an essential piece of equipment malfunctions, so you run down to the maintenance and take care of the problem yourself. All the while SHODAN and her minions are trying to kill you.\n\nEnemies can respawn, which I found to be rather annoying when you just took down 6 or so of the same type of enemy, and 3 more march out of the room you were just in. This doesn't happen too often, but on some floors it is just ridiculous. When it doesn't happen, you'll probably be on your toes waiting for something to happen. Just as soon as you let your guard down, boom. SHODAN will even go out of her way to lay traps for you, especially when you do something to piss her off. Definitely make sure you safe often, even when you have restoration bays active. If you complete an entire level, then travel to the next floor and die, you will be sent right back to your last save point. Having to go through an hours worth of progress that you just completed is the worst feeling ever.\n\nCyberspace, absolutely turn that shit to minimum difficulty (at least for your first playthrough). I do not think it is worth struggling over, as it is already hard enough to navigate as is (hard to tell where you are meant to go). Everything else you can just leave at default.\n\nThe game looks old, but it's still fine. The game helps you recognise what exactly you're looking at, and the art style allows for some really good effects. One minute you can be walking through a pristine ballroom, then you turn the corner and find a stash of bodies piled up in the corner, complete with severed heads and the last minute pleas of someone before they had their head taken off. The whole station is massive as well, each floor being very different from the last, yet most of the time it makes sense. The tight spaces makes the level feel like it was designed to be a ship first, then the level was built inside of that. You have a map that shows where you have been, but no way points or indicators to tell you where to go. \n\nThe voice acting isn't exactly great, but serviceable. You might need a bit of imagination to put it all together. The voice lines don't line up with the subtitles either, but at the same time that allows you to get a different perspective of what you just heard. The music is great and works well with the theme of the game. Some sounds are annoying, or excessively loud for no reason.

I stuck with it for the same reason, and I am ultimately glad I did.  You see, the original (i.e. \"classic\") was made in 1994, before WASD-left mouse became the standard for FPS controls, and it was a challenge to become sufficiently fluent to play it.  By \"a challenge\", I mean enraging.  Pushing the cursor to the screen's edges to adjust viewpoint was tricky enough to get used to, but worse were the multiple information screens and activation buttons (some hotkey map-able, some not) that I frequently panicked my way through as the enemies swarmed.  Half of the challenge playing the game was, in fact, mastering its control system.  As I say, it turned out to be worth doing, as the game itself is brilliant.\n\nThis Nightdive Enhanced Edition takes care of the control problem, at least in part.  You'll still want to map keys/mouse controls for as much as possible.  I myself have settled on mouse wheel for weapons selection, 'r' for reload, 'f' for change ammo, 'v' for full crouch, 'g' for mid-crouch, 't' for standing tall, 'L-shift' for run, 'e' for toggling mouse look, 'h' for grenade selection, 'y' for arming grenade, 'o' for med selection, 'p' for taking meds, the number keys for the various left/right data screens, the function keys for various implant activations, et cetera, ET CETERAAAAAA.  You see the issue.  I mean, \"mid-crouch\", FFS?!   But, thank Shodan, we've got WASD and mouse look now, and I can live with the double-left mouse select, and right mouse fire, as in the original.\n\nOne can now also play in widescreen at much higher resolution, and I recommend turning off the cool cybertech HUD frame during play for maximum field of vision.  I like to have weapon/ammo on the bottom left screen, and minimap on the right screen.  Although still a work in progress, I find my overall configuration is close enough to the System Shock 2 HUD for my purposes, and desperate in-game fumbling is reduced to a minimum.  I can better remain immersed in the action, and the story, which is I think the best aspect of the game.\n\nIt is also necessary, because said story and the objectives that comprise it are as fiendishly complex as those of SS2.  Yes, this one also has audio logs, AND e-mail, AND additional data; being able to give these your full attention is highly desirable, because, just like SS2, the game isn't going to lead you by the hand with lengthy cutscenes and glowing arrows (er... except when you are in cyberspace, where it absolutely [i]does[/i] have glowing arrows).  It could arguably be described as Metroidvainiesque, or perhaps Falloutesque, insofar as you can go anywhere and do anything you want in any order, if the way forward isn't blocked and you are strong/equipped enough to deal with whatever is blocking you.  Figuring out how is entirely your business.\n\nI've heard this game referred to as the \"thinking person's Doom\".  I presume this is because of the pixellation and the sprites.  This leads me to warn young folk that combat may feel a little Doom-like, as well.  With many of the enemy types, if you are in the line of sight, you are hit [Grrrrrr!!!].  Very few of them fire actual projectiles that one can dodge, but some do.  Fortunately, this works both ways. Also, the enemy \"hit-boxes\" I think they are called are rather crudely configured, per the times, and one will occasionally have to adjust one's firing position until one is finally able to hit some sneaky little jackass cyber-ninja, shurikening you from a raised platform, for example.  But boy is it ever satisfying when you finally do manage to obliterate the miserable twit with an excessive volley of rail gun blasts.\n\nGame history buffs may well appreciate comparing the spritey SS1 to the low-polygonal SS2, and how various FPS game mechanics are addressed in the different engines.  Despite the shortcomings of early-to-mid nineties 3D rendering, it is truly impressive to see the level of complexity and playability achieved in this game.  For me, it was also cool to finally play the back story that led to its excellent sequel.  The mind boggles at what Nightdive may achieve with its upcoming System Shock remake.  If nothing else, it will restore much-deserved attention to this groundbreaking ancestor of the Bioshocks, the Dead Spaces, the Preys, and so on.", "timestamp_created": 1677531103, "timestamp_updated": 1677532302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593134224414825439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133734393": {"recommendationid": "133734393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261084750", "num_games_owned": 539, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1678013022}, "language": "english", "review": "Do NOT buy this game!

Like making notes on the map screen to mark points of interest or places you might want to get back to later.\nBecause of this, I can safely say that for the first time I actually kind of enjoyed being a bit lost in this game from time to time, simply because the atmosphere was fun. \"Feeling lost\" felt kind of fun, and it never really become too annoying.\nI looked up a walkthrough like 2 times, and the walkthroughs are extremely straightforward, \n\nOver all, this game has entered my list of all-time favorite games, because of how fun and interesting the gameplay is with its exploration and interactivity, finally with the atmosphere kicking it into my all time tops, since I am a big sucker for great atmosphere.\nOn a technical level, the game is also really impressive for its time period, which is something that really should be appreciated.\n\nThe game also has mod support, so there's some custom made content out there as well, which I am curious to try out myself in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1675031114, "timestamp_updated": 1675031114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131690094": {"recommendationid": "131690094", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049955847", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1674868022}, "language": "english", "review": "I guess I just don't have the patience for this (or maybe I'm just spoiled by Quake and Doom).

The remaster adds several things, such as slightly better graphics, HD character portraits and widescreen resolutions, but most importantly is the mouselook feature, making it a more modern experience. It comes with the classic version if you want to, but it might be difficult to play nowadays. You play as a nameless hacker, who wakes up in a space station run by SHODAN, an evil AI and her army of robots, cyborgs, and mutants.\n\nThe game's atmosphere and tone is similar to other imsims such as BioShock (which is a spiritual successor) and Deus Ex. It deals with cyberpunk and AI themes, but set in a place that should've been an utopia, but overrun by hostile, mutated people. Graphics-wise its similar to 90s shooters such as Shadow Warrior and Doom, set in a 3D environment but with 2D sprites for items and characters. Though I must say, the level design here feels better, each level has a distinct look and not just one hallways after another.\n\nLike most from that era, the mechanics of this game might feel a bit complicated and unexplained, like for example you have to switch out from mouselook mode to interact with your interface, containing stuff such as your augmentations and inventory. Or like how some enemies are resistant or weak to certain types of weapons. The objectives may not be very clear as well and there are no journal, so I recommend viewing a guide, but only for the next objective, no need to follow it step-by-step. More fun that way since the game is not linear, levels are usually quite open.\n\nOther than the unclear instructions, another problem is that the levels can be a bit maze-like and confusing. But luckily, this is mitigated by a fast movement speed and an easy to read map, in which you can put notes on. Those issues are actually somewhat normal for games from that era, so no big deal. The only issue not from an age viewpoint are the puzzles, which can be annoying, but luckily wire puzzles has a solution in the game's maps guide, and tile switching puzzles can be skipped with logic probes. A minor issue are the audio logs, where the voice don't match the transcript, usually being shorter but overall still states the same points. I was hoping they'll fix the text in the remaster, but alas.\n\nI think System Shock is a historically important game, as design-wise it inspires many games of the immersive sim genre, and outside of that its influence can also be seen like in Portal series where the antagonists are all-powerful, all-seeing AIs. I'll be honest, the game can be confusing, frustrating, and hard in the early levels, but later on it gets easier and a lot more fun.

The environmental storytelling is superb; Its cryptic, its atmospheric, but most importantly its not trying to be anything other than a GAME. There are no cut scenes like a movie; there are some notes but no walls of text like a book. This was one of, if not the first to implement the audio log narrative device in games, and its the perfect way to convey the plot without breaking the immersion like cut scenes and text does. Audio logs that play in the background as you play the game fully utilizes the video game medium, as it cannot exist well in any other.\n\nIf you are wondering why people always say this game was way ahead of its time, look no further than its depth of combat. Every projectile weapon has two ammo types: one for soft targets and one for hard robotic targets. Every energy weapon has a sliding damage adjuster, but the higher the damage the more energy you use up. There are at least a dozen different grenades and mines and around 20 different weapons to choose from, though you can only carry 7 at a time.

Fortunately, System Shock stands up for it's emphasis on world building and objective-based gameplay. The pacing, environmental details and map layout hooked me in pretty fast, allowing me to hit the \"immersion sim fun zone\".\n\n[h2]The controls/UI don't get in the way of immersion... if you're open to them[/h2]\nOnce you get used to swapping between mouselook and \"cursor mode\", the interface becomes surprisingly intuitive. I found selecting objects from shelves without having to move the camera, seemed to increase my immersion. Additionally, I loved being able to customise the interface and browse between different screens, instead of having everything visible at once. After returning to the System Shock Remake demo, part of me wished they stayed more true to the original interface, as using/equipping things in the new hot bar can take longer.\n\n[h2]Immersion sim perfection[/h2]\nIf you play the game on the highest mission difficulty, you get 7-hours to beat the game. This is made possible, thanks to a game that rewards the increasing knowledge of the player. When you learn how to deploy the right weapons, tools and skills in each encounter, the game becomes a lot easier to play. The enemies aren't pushovers and the game can be tricky at times, but this is where immersion sims stand out vs standard first person shooters and rpgs.

It throws you in the game, no tutorial, no hand holding BS, only a manual. I LOVE THAT STUFF! Figuring things out myself gets me immersed and the world compliments this well. Citadel Station is a hostile area with a labyrinth-like layout; the levels are large, narrow, has areas to explore and it's full of danger. Despite the ancient graphics, the environment still makes me uncomfortable and alerted when I walk through the space station. For an old game to create discomfort and alertness without jumpscares is genuinely impressive. \n\nThe sound design is outdated, some sounds are just super loud and sound like they have two tracks running at the same time, but there are some decent tunes and sounds in between. The enhanced edition modernized controls for System Shock so that they're not too alien for people unfamiliar with old games. First time players should avoid starting this game with combat difficulty 3 because the second half of the game gets very difficult and if you're not prepared to that then you're going to beg for 1st aid kits when you're in trouble. \n\nI definitely enjoy this game and recommend this to anyone seeking an unusual experience.\n\nP.S.: Avoid playing this game like a shooter, because that's what this game isn't. ;-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1672011311, "timestamp_updated": 1672011311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51485830545425415", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129265990": {"recommendationid": "129265990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156945882", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 510, "last_played": 1616033249}, "language": "english", "review": "doesnt control like an aircraft. but it's still a hard as crap experience.", "timestamp_created": 1671989111, "timestamp_updated": 1671989111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129237790": {"recommendationid": "129237790", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961240585", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1671962931}, "language": "english", "review": "No matter what I do, it seems I keep crashing the game.

Most of the weapons were neat enough, but I favor the laser rapier and flechette.\nCyberspace is kind of weird and trying to manipulate the hitbox of the avatar through the obstacles got tough in the late game.  But the whole thing seems like a neat idea that could be improved with better feedback in combat and maybe a better defined player hitbox.\n\nThe methods through which the player interacts with the world and inventory is weird at first, but really pulled me into it the whole time, even at the start.  The ways the complex character movement and item/weapon management connects the player to the world is so engaging that it makes it hard to stop playing.  Even how the game can halt in action as you try to solve an incredibly complicated wire puzzle really makes you feel like the hacker.\nEach level is intriguing and tons of fun to explore.  The level theming is cool, and the environments look pretty good, though a bit samey at times which does lend some assistance to its realistic feeling, instead of feeling \"video gamey\", I suppose.  But the level designs themselves are solid and cohesive as world elements and as mechanisms to propel the player forward.  And there are lots of secrets that are a joy to discover all over the station.\nThe story is also excellent, with SHODAN always only one step ahead or behind the player as they try to cut off each other's plans at multiple points.  The desperate search for contact with any remaining humans being consistently just out of reach is compelling as well.\nEvery piece of the soundtrack is nonstop quality, especially the Executive and Security themes.  These compositions are so strong that even their maligned midi origins carry them and produce songs that get stuck in my head constantly.\n\nVery few times have I been so drawn into a game and consumed by it, it's easy to see a whole here that clearly surpasses the sum of its already stellar parts.  In these regards, it's the best Shock game hands down.\n\nSystem Shock: Classic is a bit harder to get into, not because it's difficult to play, but just that years of modern keyboard controls meant learning a new layout.  After an hour or so I started to get the hang of it and got pretty used to it, but even after 8 hours I would frequently press the wrong keys under pressure.  Other than that, it has the old dynamic music and has some other minor quirks absent from Enhanced Edition.  I would still recommend Enhanced Edition over Classic for ease of use, but Classic is still perfectly playable and worth seeing.  The only problem is that you need to limit your CPU via the \"dosbox_systemshock.conf\" file in order to beat Shodan.

I've had an incredible time discovering and falling in love with gaming must-plays such as DOOM, Rainbow Six 3, and Halo 2, but none of those games have amazed and captured my attention quite like SYSTEM SHOCK.\n\nI've not yet beaten the game but I just can't wait to talk about it. The atmosphere is unlike anything I've ever seen. Bright and colorful, but also moody and scarier than 90% of today's \"horror\" games. SHODAN is a complete powerhouse of a villain. Malevolent and conniving down to her last circuit, elevated by some absolutely breathtaking voice work and sound design even by today's standards. Speaking of sound design HOLY SHIT. Each and every sound effect is perfect. Weapons are full of punch and even the occasional stock sound effect weirdly fits into this game's aesthetic. The Midi Music is catchy and groovy, but also appropriately tone setting where needed. Even the moments of buggy-overlapping serve to further the illusion of Citadel Station's environment collapsing around you, polluting the soundscape as if even the soundtrack wants you dead.\n\nSecond-to-second gameplay is hindered by a confusing control scheme that is going to take some getting used to, even with the updated bindings. Mastering these controls and UI is such a satisfying learning curve that it's almost worth the pain, even if certain things never feel quite right. Even in the endgame I'm learning new tricks and discovering new ways to use the UI and environment to my advantage. Exploration is so damn good, with a map that's devoid of objective markers and instead filled with fantastic environmental storytelling and danger around every corner. You never know when SHODAN will appear next, and some of her traps sent chills down my spine. Item placement and enemy variety hits that perfect pacing that only the best of the best like Resident Evil 2 have nailed. You're always working to conserve your resources, and every item found feels like a victory. I will say that some of the combat is a bit unbalanced, and and some of those hitscanners are full of shit, but the clunky poke-around-the-corner-and-hope-you-don't-get-shot style of combat feels appropriate for the desperate situation that SHODAN has put you in.\n\nI love this game. It's far from perfect with quite a few bugs and a rough game feel that never quite goes away, but the atmosphere, storytelling, world design and exploration all serve to create one of the most immersive and unforgettable gaming experiences that I've had in a long time. In many ways, this game is superior to it's spiritual successors and inspirations, and is just as worth your time today as it was back in 1994.\n\nThese are the types of games that people talk about when they say \"timeless classics\".", "timestamp_created": 1658121477, "timestamp_updated": 1658121477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591661930084228516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118975355": {"recommendationid": "118975355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198808062389", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1003, "last_played": 1688059670}, "language": "english", "review": "what a fucking game man", "timestamp_created": 1658088536, "timestamp_updated": 1658088536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441176474094390869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118939114": {"recommendationid": "118939114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044331485", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1631, "last_played": 1685152133}, "language": "english", "review": "True OG Cyberpunk experience", "timestamp_created": 1658032418, "timestamp_updated": 1658032418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118563006": {"recommendationid": "118563006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177767385", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 886, "last_played": 1611529521}, "language": "english", "review": "Once you have mouse look and understand the controls this game is honestly better than System Shock 2 gameplay wise (SS2 still has better story and atmosphere). \n\nThe amount of weapon variety and the bright and unique colors of the environment and all the cool enemy types, and all the twists of SHODAN trying to kill or trap you, it\u2019s just a roller coaster and the game is just so fun to play (as long as you have mouse look)", "timestamp_created": 1657447034, "timestamp_updated": 1657447034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539963483810424805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118540452": {"recommendationid": "118540452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149614793", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1657072719}, "language": "english", "review": "They're remaking it so wait for that.

If you haven't played retro shooters before, I'd recommend playing the previously mentioned games first, as System Shock's graphics and controls are a bit rough (even for a retro game).\n\nWhile System Shock is EXTREMELY dated, it offers a very unique gameplay experience that managed to hold my attention from beginning to end and left me wanting to come back for another playthrough. (random tangent - I don't think the System Shock remake will capture the essence of what made this game great/unique, so I'd still recommend playing this version of the game instead of holding out for the remake)\n\nTo help people with the initial learning curve of this game, here are some beginner tips...\n\n> When you are starting a new game, you need to name your character (might seem obvious, but its confusing af when you click \"Start Game\" and the game doesn't start)\n\n> Press 2 to toggle fullscreen on/off (this hides a lot of the clunky UI)\n\n> Press E to toggle the mouse cursor/reticle from fixed to freemode (fixed for moving and shooting - freemode for interacting with items and UI)\n\n> You can inspect stuff by single clicking\n\n> You interact with stuff by double clicking (you can quickly pick stuff up with middle-mouse)\n\n> Shift to move faster and caps lock to toggle sprinting\n\n---\n\nAs I said, I think this game is great, but I am not recommending you buy it on Steam. I wanted to play through this game again (this time on the hardest difficulty), but when I jumped into the game, there was an awful stuttering issue while moving. Apparently, an update was released that messed up the FPS and it still hasn't been fixed.\n\nSo whether you are new to the game or are returning for another playthrough, I would recommend buying the game on GOG, and then rolling the game's version back to 1.1.8 (something you can't do on Steam unfortunately).\n\nSince I was returning to the game, I had some old configuration files that caused issues with launching the game (it would give me a black screen upon launching).

I'm by no means a fan of older games (mainly because of the rudimentary gameplay) but System Shock is just spectacular even over two decades later.\n\nThe greatest part of System Shock is the level design. It's designed in such a way to encourage exploration and careful gameplay your first time around, and once you've really gotten to know the area, you've got shortcuts, a reliable resurrection station, and easy ways to navigate the [i]entire[/i] nine-leveled ship. The maps provide you with many secrets, areas to return to, and exposition that doesn't overload the player. There's always some goal to pursue that makes exploration not completely directionless, which helps when it can be overwhelming to begin with.\n\nDespite what it might first appear, the UI is really not that scary. The game introduces small mechanics at a very nice pace and has you constantly using all the tools at your disposal that helps get you acquainted with the game. Please do not overlook this game purely because of the interface or systems\u2014 I skipped this game years ago for that reason in the first few minutes, but this time around, just getting used to some of the jankier keybinds made it feel modern enough.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this is a pretty good remaster of System Shock; I had no stuttering or any other issues that anyone else seems to report. There's an abundance of options to tweak (which I'd recommend using Vulkan as I did have very rough visual issues otherwise) and the ability to completely rebind everything is great.\n\nThe plot surrounding SHODAN is not exactly complex, but there are some nice moments and storytelling (largely through logs) that keep it atleast somewhat interesting. It's nice because there are a few zone puzzles or codes that you'll need to solve that are taught via logs, so you're not missing much.\n\nCombat is probably the weakest feature of System Shock (unsurprisingly). In fact, a lot of my time was spent just barely poking around corners so that I could see the enemy and hit them, but they could not. It's certainly old-school, but playing on 3323 (hardest difficulty minus a 7 hour playthrough timer) was somewhat interesting because of the vast array of weapons and ammo types that affect living/machines differently. \n\nI'd actually highly recommend System Shock as someone completely unfamiliar with it until now. Please try to play as much as possible without a guide\u2014 exploration is so engaging that you're partially robbing yourself otherwise.

Of course though this is a boomer shooter and because of that the strange elements such as the inventory, and inspection elements feel a little jarring and in-cohesive. Same with cyberspace which has it's own gameplay mechanics that really don't hold up that well. Best I could say is that the game was ahead of it's time and worst I could say is that it's an unpolished mess.

Remember, just a year prior we got Doom, which is roughly how most 90's shooters played. Wolfenstein 3D was released only 2 years back (1992). Half-Life, long considered to be an evolution in how story's unfold in shooters, was 4 years away. Bioshock, the spiritual successor to the System Shock series, was 13 years away.\n\n\tYet within this place in time, System Shock implemented ideas that would become staples in shooters. The story progresses via recovered audio logs and emails. Weapons have multiple types of ammunition, and some weapons share ammunition pools. The protagonist can acquire, enhance, and upgrade abilities (ie, night-vision, armor, hover abilitiy, etc). \n\n\tEven the map design is ahead of its time then, and even now (since many modern shooters use extremely linear map design). System Shock's maps are basically FPS Metroidvanias. It plays a lot like Metroid Prime in its design philosophy, and this is 8 years before that game was released. \n\n\tYou begin at a point on the map, have an objective, and have to find said objective via exploration. As you explore, you'll find keycards, items, and unlock doors which allow access to new areas or which circle back to previous areas (making travel easier). Even when an area is fully explored, you'll more than likely be back to complete a seperate task given on a different floor. The way the entire game is structured, you never truly feel like you're 'passing levels' everytime you get to a new floor, since they're so interlinked and have you backtrack between floors often. \n\n\tThe majority of these ideas originated from Ultima Underworld (another one of Looking Glass/Blue Sky Productions games). Ultima Underworld is an almost forgotten franchise by now, which is why System Shock is erronously thought to be the progenitor of many of these ideas. What System Shock did was streamline these ideas, and apply them in a shooter setting with interconnected levels and an unfolding narrative via audio logs and emails. All within a cyberpunk framework.\n\n\tAnd yes I said streamline. Anyone who has played SS knows how clunky and oppressive the UI is. Right from the start you are assaulted with icons and text on the bottom of the screen. And this isn't some 90's thing either, as even then this game had more going on in its HUD than most other games. It doesn't take a day to figure out, and its rather simple when you get the hang of it, but it's definitely oppressive. \n\n\tEven then, the actual game design can get you lost. For the most part, you are exploring  floors, and accomplishing an objective to go onto the next floor. A few times the game requires you to backtrack to previous floors for an interlinked objective. And this is fine, since the map design makes backtracking fairly easy.\n\n\tThe problem is that its easy to get lost in the jargon and non-descript map instructions. When it comes to the more complicated objectives, you might legitimately get lost. Because the game requires you to backtrack to certain locations or certain rooms, but the map doesn't give you location names, so it comes down to memory. You tell me if you remember exactly where 'Beta Sector' was 2 floors down. Or if you even remember which floor was 'engineering', because it isn't always clearly visible.\n\n\tIt also doesn't help that the audio logs have a name and date ascribed to them, but no title. So if you want to listen to the important ones again, you have to dig through them once more. As you explore, you might acquire important information but don't mentally piece it together because their relevance isn't made clear yet. Or the information in the audio log relates to a different floor altogether. It doesn't help when door codes are given, because exactly which doors these are is difficult to ascertain given that they generally don't have distinctive features. \n\n\tWorst offender is the need for items that you might casually find, but if you didn't know of their necessity you might leave them behind. Given that there are a lot of 'junk' items, no one would fault you for leaving them behind. Only to have you ferverently re-explore a map to acquire them. Key items taking up inventory with actual useless 'junk' items and first aid kits is bizzare.\n\n\tWith all this said, I have to stress that System Shock doesn't leave you in the dark on these matters. The game does outline what is needed either via email or audio logs. But it does tend to get lost in the jargon ('We need an orbital fusion module at Beta Grove'), which doesn't help in parsing what information is relevant and which is just fluff. Because I assume some of this info gets filed in the back of your head, and isn't front and center. I assume the remake (if it comes out) will at least have bullet points in a menu to better compile relevant information.\n\n\tSystem Shock can be really clunky and obtuse. It isn't as straight-forward as Doom or Quake. It's a game with complexity in system mechanics, and given that it's early in the shooter realm with all of these features, none of it has been streamlined yet. So the game has aged tremendously on these fronts. But it also keeps some of its relevance because a lot of these mechanics are still used today. I'd easily recommend this, with the caveat that you should look up a short guide to better accustom yourself to the features. The Enhanced Edition brings guides in your steam folder, which is very much appreciated.\n\n\tI haven't even touched on the primary antagonist (SHODAN) or the setting. But I'll leave it at this: what kept me coming back was the map exploration. If you have a love for Metroid Prime (or any Metroidvania), there's a lot to dig into here. If you can get past the initial awkward UI, you'll find an immersive cyberpunk classic. I can't speak to System Shock 2's quality yet, but it has a lot to live up to right now.", "timestamp_created": 1655070610, "timestamp_updated": 1655070610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669249773025512695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116838554": {"recommendationid": "116838554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016324311", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1587, "last_played": 1654443012}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nI should say, I went into this with no real prior knowledge of the series or nostalgia goggles and came out impressed at how decently it holds up, in no small part due to the Enhanced Edition's additions, especially the free mouse look. There's definitely a lot of dated design at play in all aspects but, if you can get over some of its shortcomings, it's a worthwhile, classic FPS experience which is definitely worth giving a try.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nSystem Shock's gameplay is by far its most memorable aspect. The first time I booted it up I was overwhelmed by the interface and control scheme, but you quickly get used to its quirks and they make the experience more memorable than frustrating to me. I won't go into extreme detail on it, but at its core it's a first person shooter with some light metroidvania elements and a great focus on player freedom and exploration, aspects that are, for the most part, handled fantastically. \n\nInteracting with the world is done through two main modes, the mouse-look driven shooter experience provided by the Enhanced Edition, and a mode that unlocks your cursor, allowing you to grab items from the world, use switches, or click on the various UI elements dotted around your screen. This can be a bit jarring to get used to, especially if you need to switch between them mid-combat to reload, or use a grenade or such, but it gives the world a tactile feel that is hard to compare anything else to since all your character's management happens without ever leaving the game screen. You can lean, crouch and go prone and even combine these smoothly to give you a better angle on enemies, and there's a host of cyberware to augment your capabilities, from the mundane flashlight, an energy shield or even booster skates (which are much less useful than they sound) which use your secondary power meter. Hunting down upgrades for your weapons and augmentations hidden around the levels gives a great sense of progression and makes the exploration worthwhile.\n\nOn that topic, the maps can get quite labyrinthine, mixing an intricate level design that sometimes loops on itself or takes advantage of verticality, with the general floor-plan of the station that often requires or encourages you to go back to previous floors to take advantage of resources left behind, explore newly unlocked paths or solve other objectives. You're never railroaded or spoonfed these objectives with the game offering hints and guidance through audio logs and emails that give you a general idea of what you're looking for and where and the solid automap system allows you to add annotations for later (which I highly encourage anyone to do!) to help you find your way or mark down areas you can't access yet. The exploration was by far the aspect I enjoyed the most, and it was handled better than many modern games do it. As a downside, a few switches are really hard to see against the flat, pixel-y mess of the wall textures, and I've had a few awkward moments with sticky platforms but other than that, it was pretty smooth.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, things are more of a mixed bag. There's a huge variety of weapons hidden around along with explosives and other tools at your disposal, and there's a decent variety of enemies to boot to try them on. The downside comes with the fact that combat is ultimately rather limited. The most dangerous enemies will lock onto you after a split second and use hitscan weapons to whittle your health away, meaning the most practical way to deal with them is to just peek and shoot around corners, or try to lure them into Laser Rapier range, making most engagements a little repetitive, especially once the game starts throwing hitscan cyborgs around every corner. \n\nReloading ranged weapons requires you to go into UI look mode to press a button, and explosives are effective but difficult to throw around corners without blowing yourself up or getting shot. A few guns are just kinda bad and sometimes it gets clunky as hell trying to go through all the little tabs on the side of your screen to activate a medkit or load the right ammo type or manage your weapons in a tense moment - your mileage there may vary with how immersive you feel that makes the game. Also that one protection suit upgrade placement is fucking bullshit.\n\nLast thing I want to mention in this section is that there are a few\u2026 mostly optional cyberspace segments. The intent is cool but the implementation is pretty awful, and I can only dread to imagine how it would've been without mouse look. You control a fly camera through a series of wireframe rooms, running into objects to collect data, programs or unlock aspects in the real world, and occasionally spam shots at one of the few enemies you encounter. It's\u2026 just not good.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe story is definitely one aspect that stuck with most people, and System Shock manages to do a lot with very little. The basic premise is that the unshackled AI SHODAN took over Citadel station and has set up a series of plans to ensure humanity will not have a great time. As you wake up from cryosleep, you take on the role of a hacker with a combat implant stuck on the station and one of the last survivors able to do something about all that. \n\nEmails and audio logs scattered around are the primary drivers of the plot, but there's a good bit of environmental storytelling as well. It's a pleasure to see SHODAN reacting and adapting to your actions and it makes them a fantastic, memorable character, despite the rather weak ending the game has after some decent build-up. The enemies you face are a reflection of SHODAN's creations, giving you a glimpse into what could happen if their plans succeed, and the layout of the station grounds the level design in a practical setting that makes sense and adds to the atmosphere.\n\n[h1]Visuals & Audio[/h1]\n\nThe game's visuals aren't fantastic but they hold up decently well. The enemies are readable and there's a good use of lighting to set up some memorable scenarios and set pieces. The environment especially is quite low fidelity but it's clear they tried to give it some function and meaning even when a room only has a few polygons of decoration to loosely depict its purpose. On the whole it does an okay job of having some memorable landmarks to help you orient yourself, even if a few levels end up being kind of samey to navigate, thank goodness for the automap!\n\nThe audio department definitely feels like a step back compared to the other aspects, between the crusty MIDI songs and limited sounds that are passable at best and ear-piercingly horrible (I'm looking at you radiation) at worst. Enemies are vocal, which gives you an advance warning of what you're about to face or whether you've been spotted, but ultimately it doesn't do too much to add to the atmosphere. Seriously, fuck that radiation noise.\n\n[h1]Completion & Replayability[/h1]\n\nThe game only has a few achievements that you can easily get during normal play. The two big ones are for lowering security level to 0% on all levels; not a difficult task, but one that will get you crawling around a bit more than normal while exploring the levels more thoroughly and one for finishing the game on maximum difficulty, which includes a seven hour timer I found more than lenient.

The controls are a bit counter-intuitive at first, but they grow on you by the end. Swapping between free aim and fixed aim was a unique sensation that felt refreshing. The gameplay is fun, but it can be hard to tell when you're getting shot at. The ost is a mixed bag: the music can be brutal on your ears at times, but it can also be very catchy and pleasant. The sound effects range from fine to terrible(radiation). The graphics are interesting; some of the wall textures look way too high resolution for the game, and I could only make out the enemy designs up close. They're good overall. While the story isn't anything special, the game has an ending that fits perfectly. Shodan is a great antagonist, and her voice acting is fun to listen to. \nI would highly recommend this game if you can get past the controls and labyrinth-like level design. I would recommend rebinding the controls and tweaking the audio levels so that sound effects and music aren't so loud.

I must have attempted playing this game 4 or 5 times so far, but the UI and very first deck were so obtuse and confusing that I was completely pulled out of it. But once you get past that hurtle and figure out the controls, (which are much easier to understand in the Enhanced Edition) it becomes a very fun game to explore. The hardest parts of the game are all in the first couple hours, but once you upgrade your firepower and have a sizable inventory it becomes much easier and you really get involved in the world the game presents. While most of the dialogue is severely crippled by bad acting, it still surprisingly has some great writing, and SHODAN absolutely steals the show. She's incredible and it shocked me how often she creeped me out by her sound design and writing. The levels are far less confusing after the first and while the sparse Cyberspace levels are pretty terrible to get through, they're short and easy enough to where it can take you less than a minute to get through them. The gameplay is pretty satisfying and getting stronger throughout felt very engaging and worthwhile as you get the best of the best weapons and armor. Overall I'd really recommend this game to classic PC game fans, or anyone interested in the Bioshock/System Shock series. 75/100", "timestamp_created": 1652210926, "timestamp_updated": 1652210926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115249740": {"recommendationid": "115249740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016599107", "num_games_owned": 2193, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1696491926}, "language": "english", "review": ">1994, a pc game that predates windows 95\n>3d shooting from the 80486/pentium era\n>multiple weapon categories/mechanics\n>lean movements\n>cyborg implants that are actually well integrated with the game \n>hp/mp for an fps game\n>kickass storytelling + shodan personality\n>splendid level design, doesn\u2019t feel outdated even in 20-fucking-22\n>actual voice acting audio logs/emails\n>managed to lay the foundation for a groundbreaking genre\n>be so fucking ahead of its time\n10/10, will recommend to all fellow based 0451 games enjoyers", "timestamp_created": 1652185643, "timestamp_updated": 1652185643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115222434": {"recommendationid": "115222434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113227169", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 2223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1669599283}, "language": "english", "review": "Last update messed up the framerate and they never bothered to fix it.

It has full 3D graphics with similar movement controls to WASD, but this original version didn't use mouse to move the camera; instead your mouse is a basic cursor which you use to point objects to interact with or point enemies to shoot them. For many not highly enthusiastic gamers, the controls are an immediate turn off I assure, but they are in fact very integral part of the game once you get used to them, since the game is not meant to be played in a very hectic manner that more modern controls would enable. \nTo move the camera around, you use keyboard buttons or certain mouse commands, but the former method is much more fluent way to play if you take the time to learn it. The modernized \u2019Enhanced Edition\u2019 of this game is the easiest way to experience this game, but it takes away a certain appeal that the clunkier controls force you in, since when you cannot turn around super fast, you really need to use all the options on your neural interface to help you out. Of course, the enhanced version can be played with the original controls too and I totally recommend to play that version with them, but I had some technical issues with that I didn't have with the emulated version via DosBox, so I had to play the last-mentioned.\n\nThe actual review: \nSystem Shock is a brilliant shooter exploration experience, where an AI called Shodan has taken over a space station, where you are trapped in as well as seemingly one of the very few survivors. Your mission is to prevent the AI from reaching it's ill goals against humanity and shut down it for good. Through voice emails this AI mocks and threatens you along the way, actually being a rather scary and intimidating character. It can do this because you wear \"a military grade neural implant\" on you, which is a rare piece of equipment for combat and other demanding tasks, with slots to add in new tools as you find them by exploring. This is the game's way to upgrade your character, by steadily introducing you new tools and upgrades for them, to fight back cyborgs of the space station and to simply survive by avoiding their surprise attacks and enduring their fire power. The tough thing about this suite is that it requires energy when you activate it\u2019s tools, like for example energy shield that absorbs damage. Battery of the suite will be drained when any power requiring tool is on, which means you need to refill it constantly by finding energy sources on the huge station. On top of that of course, you also have your health to worry about.\n\nThe station is huge with total of ten levels you travel between via elevators. You can always go back to an earlier level if you missed something or need to do something next there, since the game doesn't progress strictly in a linear fashion, but instead makes you move around the station and between the levels to accomplish various tasks to ruin Shodan's horrific plans. All the levels are rather maze like, but I think this very corridor and corner heavy design of the game works perfectly here, making you alarm at all times since you never know if there is a deadly cyborg just behind the next corner, even though they do make sounds often. \nThe cyborgs are deadly enemies, that you cannot sustain far more than a few seconds if there is two or more them shooting directly at you. Fortunately, you have your suite's tools to help you out, as well as grenades and temporal consumable boosts, like one that slows time. Of course you have various different weapons too, with usually two ammo types; choosing the right ammo type makes an appropriate enemy go down quicker. \nYou need to use all your abilities to survive on the station, thinking before engaging, and perhaps most importantly use lean and crouch/prone functions to make yourself as minimally visible as possible to the enemies, so they wouldn't hit you hard. Lean is extremely important in this game, so use it if you suspect there is a danger ahead.\n\nThe story of this game is interesting and certainly drives you forward. The audio log system you may have seen in many more modern games is taken straight from this one. Logs and notes tell how the horrible events of Shodan taking control elapsed and they also give you very important information on what to do and where locates what on the station. They can also offer crucial codes.\nShodan is truly a legendary antagonist in gaming history that you certainly don't feel any empathy towards at all - it is in the end an AI of course, even if it's capable of thinking complex stuff. System Shock really offers a worthy purposeful goal for you to achieve as it\u2019s setting, with an enemy that drives you to beat it, which not a great number of games do as successfully.\n\nThe brilliance of this game comes from a mix of all these mentioned elements, which together create a tense and even scary experience due to lethal enemies and dark rooms. This game is mostly shooting and exploring yes, but you need to solve various puzzles along the way too and also think your approach in the maze like 3D space, that can basically have an enemy placed anywhere you look; above, below, behind a hidden door, etc. You have to be careful and search carefully for every bit of aid you can find in the station. Yet, the enemies can respawn, which means you cannot run across already cleared places completely care free.\nA necessary mention is also cyperspace, that you need to occasionally visit via some terminals you find, but it mostly feels like a simplistic flying game in 3D space, that offers you upgrades and messages that are hidden inside the space away from Shodan to reach, who has control over the whole station's computer network. It is still a neat atmospheric piece of gameplay for sure.\n\nWhat differentiates System Shock from other not as remarkable shooters, is the forementioned fact how effectively it uses 3D space, but also audio and it's primitive lighting, to create a tense and even scary experience, where at the same time character progression feels natural, where exploration is really rewarding, and where taking a look at your surroundings is important to be able to navigate around and complete tasks (you have a map though). Every aspect of this game feels meaningful, making you think in one way or another, at the same time being constantly interactive and challenging. I would call this game 'a thinking man's shooter'.\n\nIf you enjoy FPS games in general, this might work for you if fluent controls are not a must. If those controls are the only issue, then just play the enhanced version. For those who like stories only, this game actually works too, since you can adjust difficulty of the game with four sliders, even toning it down to a bare story run with enemies that don\u2019t attack you. For anybody who wants to fully experience the game though, I recommend the default difficulty settings, since on the hardest difficulties the game really becomes a hard experience, especially if you enable a time limit of seven hours, which is only meant for veterans of this game (I haven\u2019t used it). \nThis game can be basically recommended for any keen gamer, especially for those who wonder why somebody would say 90s were the golden age of computer gaming, or if one simply wants to learn about great video game design.", "timestamp_created": 1647229439, "timestamp_updated": 1648064621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666239142417907715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112007322": {"recommendationid": "112007322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272008507", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1697789565}, "language": "english", "review": "Godamn this game was ahead of it's time for 1994, basically the first story based FPS game 4 years before Half-Life, and the first 3D Metroidvania 8 years before Metroid Prime.

Nightdive did a lot of great things to make this game FAR more accessible, but the learning curve is still quite steep in some places, mostly in the \"cyberspace\" sections. Otherwise, the graphics are expectedly outdated, though still have a lot of charm.\n\nOverall, I think this game is worth a shot, even if it hasn't too well.

HERMOSO!!!! ESPECTACULAR!!!! no tengo palabras para describir lo que ha sido terminar este increible juego. Me hizo olvidar por completo de otro simulador inmersivo que me estafaron que es es Vampire the masquerade bloodlines. Este es el primero de su tipo en la historia de los videojuegos. \n\nLa historia es fascinante. No contare nada porque sino espoilo todo. Solo dire que vale un monton la pena seguirla. Y hace que el juego sea muy avanzado para la epoca. Ya que se estreno en el mismo a\u00f1o que Doom 2. Y la mejor forma de hacerle la contra a lo que decia John Carmack que la historia en un juego de accion es como la de una pelicula porno. Que tiene que estar ahi pero no es importante. \n\nLa jugabilidad me parecio brillante. A diferencia de otros shooters de la epoca, en este no solo tenes que disparar todo lo que se mueva, sino tambien tenes que investigar muy bien para encontrar objetos y gadgets que te ayuden a avanzar y superar obstaculos. Tenes que prestar muchisima atencion a todo el entorno para descubrir los objetos clave de la mision ya que es muy facil perderse. Porque como cualquier shooter de la epoca los niveles son enormes y muy laverinticos.\n\nEl apartado artistico me parecio increible. Con las limitaciones de la epoca lograron crear una atmosfera fastuosa y gran variedad de enemigos gracias a su espectacular y muy original dise\u00f1o. Estan en todos los detalles a pesar de ser un juego ya muy viejo.\n\nEl apartado sonoro tambien me parecio de lo mejor del juego. No solo por la musica que para la epoca era lo mejor que habia sino tambien por la impecable interpretacion de voces de los personajes y los sonidos de ambiente. Que apesar de las limitaciones les salio espectacular. En especial la voz de Shodan. La villana del juego. De verdad que da mucho miedo.  \n\nSIN PALABRAS!!!!! estoy realmente feliz de por fin haber terminado este genial juego. Ha sido todo un alago poner mi energia en otro juego que no sea bloodlines ya que era un juego asombroso y por culpa de sus responsables y activision no podre jugarlo nunca. Me ha generado mucha descepcion. Pero por fin jugue a este.\n\nVerdaderamente esta clase de obras te hacen replantar el significado de la palabra \"jueguito\". \n\nLa cita obligada para los mas fans de bioshock y Deus Ex.\n\nTOTALMENTE RECOMENDABLE!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1643592548, "timestamp_updated": 1648334580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108771473": {"recommendationid": "108771473", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126212282", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 484, "last_played": 1688206640}, "language": "english", "review": "I fell in love with this game.

This game was historically pivotal in paving the way for immersive sims such as deus ex (also highly recommend), and mixing the RPG and FPS genres. Even almost 30 years later this game still holds its own with an engaging story, challenging enemies, and thoughtful problem solving. Certain areas of levels are not accessible until certain actions are taken on others, and levels are accessed by elevator, which gives you a true feel that you are traversing a space station, and are not on a level grind. This game was truly ahead of its time. The DOSBOX version of this game can be a bit clunky with the controls however, as mouse look was not the norm when this game came out. As a result,  you\u2019ll not only be using the mouse to move, but also to use items/load weapons/etc.. I played the enhanced edition that adds mouse free-look to the E key for quick swapping between moving and using/interacting with items, which I highly recommend for easier control. Another caveat is that the color scheme can look a bit like an acid trip. It\u2019s as if they couldn\u2019t decide what color to use for the levels, so they used all of them. Overall I\u2019d highly recommend this game to everyone I know.

Although the music became a little repetitive and rather clashed with the overall eerie tone of the space station so I turned it off after a while. Where the music was upbeat and hectic the station felt moody and slow paced. A great early example of immersive sim and horror wrapped up neatly in a futuristic package. This game is a classic.

I replay the sequel every couple of years, it's one of my top ten favorite games, and since this one is so iconic I thought if I tried hard enough I would learn to like it.\n\nAnd I tried. Like, I really tried.\n\nAt risk of beating a dead horse, yes, the controls are as bad as they say. The idea of a two-layered interface-- one using the mouse for conventional aiming and shooting, the other for interacting with your inventory-- is fine, but there are too many files and folders to navigate, too many items to sift through and little feedback as to what does what, what is equipped where, what buttons you should press to do this or that. Since dragging-and-dropping loot is a vague, poorly explained crap-shoot mechanic with little feedback in the game world or user interface as to whether what you just tried to do succeeded or failed, exploration and survival becomes more of a constant hassle as you will be too busy fighting the game to enjoy fighting the monsters.\n\nI've been told the story is good, but since the text in audio logs does not match the actual lines being spoken I can't just set a log to play while I struggle with my inventory because I'm too busy reading the text to make sure I don't miss something. Imagine trying to read a book while someone tells you a separate story in your ear at full volume. That's how the story is delivered to you in game. On top of that, there are emails and text messages that are very easy to miss as they often come bundled with other bits of lore and are stored in your maze of an inventory where you might not know where to look. But you have to do it. You have to do all of it. You need that door code, after all.\n\nAnd the shooting? It's there, I guess. Monsters spot you, approach you, attack you, like in, say, Wolfenstein 3D, or House of the Dead. You attack them back and hopefully kill them with whatever is in your hand at the time. Afterward, as you catch your breath, you get to look through your inventory and pontificate on what items might have helped you in that last encounter, if you had taken the time to browse, click, browse, click, equip, and use them. Boy, that grenade sure sounds useful. I hope I don't forget I have it later!\n\nI got through a particularly challenging fight-- not \"boy, that was exciting\" challenging, more \"boy, that sure was a test of patience\" challenging-- looted corpses, sorted my inventory, refamiliarized myself with the controls for the tenth time and as I rounded a corner the game crashed. I hadn't saved in a while because I wasn't expecting an enhanced version of a game from 1994 to, well, crash. At that point I think the universe was trying to tell me something. \n\nSo, no, I do not recommend this game, much less the original.

Groundbreaking in it's time, and it still holds up. The funny part is that nobody since has totally captured all the things System Shock does in one game.

But nobody quite captures all of the things that System Shock does. Additionally, the virtual reality sections are quite imaginative and original. \n\nAt the core, System Shock is a sci-fi horror game with a great story to tell, set in a space station environment that seems real and lived in. It is an early FPS, and while it originally suffered a bit in contemporary replay, because of wonky early FPS controls, the enhanced version fixes most of that wonkyness. There are still quirky elements of the control interface that have been done better since then, but it is totally playable and enjoyable. It's not a slog at all. In fact, it's a joy. System Shock is an extremely well written game. It is a classic that is good for more than just being a piece of history. It is playable, entertaining, and sometimes even scary. It still works as a game, which is surprising given the tech advances since. It transcends it's limitations. I am confident that even for someone experiencing it for the first time, there is still magic to be found that will charm and delight. This is an old game that is very much worth playing. \n\nSystem Shock is to sci-fi and horror games, as H.G. Wells or Jules Verne are to sci-fi books. Just as groundbreaking and worthwhile ever.

SHODAN makes for a memorable villain and Citadel Station itself is beautifully rendered for the graphics of the time. The story is definitely one that fans of cyberpunk will enjoy as it delves into the classic tropes of corporate arrogance and the dehumanizing effects of technology gone too far while you fight for your life against robots, cyborgs, and mutants created by SHODAN's virus. These events reverberate for decades in-game and create the story of the sequel.\n\nMy only complaint is how sluggish the turning still is in the remake when using a mouse and keyboard. This is a game best played using such because you can aim at any point on the screen and often need to in order to destroy cameras and enemies above you at odd angles.

System Shock sees you awaken as a nameless hacker aboard a space station, where everything appears to have gone wrong. Fighting your way to the top and through numerous obstacles, you must discover the truth and prevent catastrophe.\n\nSystem Shock is wonderfully atmospheric and beautifully paced, while remaining engaging and challenging until the end. The levels, and the required backtracking, only add to the sense of unease, and does well to recreate what I imagine it would be like to be alone on a failing space station. SHODAN is also still creepy, and clearly unhinged - if it gets across this well 27 years later, it must have been downright chilling in 1994. The only \"downsides\" in the game itself are a somewhat steep learning curve at first, and the janky cyberspace sequences - that has not aged well at all.\n\nTo improve your experience, I suggest following the below guides (all credit to respective OPs):\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2036191270\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=846407843\nThe key rebindings make it a lot more intuitive to play and help to smooth the learning curve, while the soundfonts add to the ambience somewhat (I used Giant Soundfont myself). Both are entirely optional, but do help to make the game feel a little more modern.\n\nTake the time, get past the learning curve, and enjoy your stay on Citadel Station. This pertains specifically to the Enhanced Edition - the best way to play the game today.

It make it look like doesn't care how much shit it throws at you, but we are walking that thin edge were you feel amazing about overcoming real odds, no bullshit that simply make the game a walk in the park.\n\nThis game is also amazing because of it's ambiance: with keeping the player on their toes, it mix with it a grim situation and manage to keep us under pressure.\n\nThe story isn't new or anything, but the writing of SHODAN, the fact the player isn't railroad'd into actions (\"who said we need to raise the shield before firing the laser if I want an early game over?\"), also add into this whole feeling you are free to figure out how to beat the game.\n\nMany games tried to sell us a villain that can say \"Look at you, hacker. A pathetic creature of meat and bone. Panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect immortal machine?\" and not sound ridiculous. System Shock doesn't try, SHODAN is one hell of a villain.\n\nYet the game isn't without flaws by modern standards: no quest logs, clunky controls, the sprites sometimes go wild (looking down on an enemy, the sprite will remain perpendicular to the view) to name the biggest, most noticable offenders.\n\nIf the looks could be upgraded*, the other parts will, in the end, always be there in a way or another: no quest log is great for ambiance, as you have to take notes on the minimap of stuffs, relistening to audiologs to figure what to do and so on. The clunky controls can't really be fixed as there is just way too many things you can and have to do, the current schemes is pretty amazing by default.\n\nThere is, in theory, a remake coming down the road, I hope it works out, this game truly deserve that. And even people that can't get into the old ass interface or graphics should discover that title, even if it's remasterised.\n\nTL;DR: This is fucking amazing buy it. And if graphics and all aren't you thing, try to support to NightDive Studio because they are working on a remastered.

No need to waste hours looking all over 6 floors trying to find an off switch for the forcefield. Don't worry, you'll understand this advise when the time comes. Everything else you need is detailed in the audio logs, so if you're stuck, just go over those again.\n\nAlright, with that out of the way: this game is great. I will go further and say that it makes many first person shooter games that came out both before and after look like bland garbage. It is honestly kind of insane just how amazing this game is considering that it came out shortly after the original Doom and before Doom 2.\n\nDo you like pointless and ineffectual weapons? Random garbage littering the floor? Redundant Night Vision? Pointless audio logs  about people going to the movies? This may all sound like a complaint, but all the inane things they included make this crusty old game feel like a lived in space - you know, before the MURDERS. Exploration never got boring and in spite of the very dated and somewhat stilted voice acting, I was always eager to see what was around the next corner.\n\nWhat did I find? Usually death in some variant. Mostly severed heads, lot of those in boxes. And soda. Very often I would open a door for a death machine to separate my limbs from my torso. This game loves its ambushes and will respawn enemies *just enough* to keep you on your toes. Sometimes you can walk a level backwards and forwards and never see a single enemy respawn. Sometimes you turn a corner you just cleared and three security bots are waiting to turn you into an ash heap. Caution is the name of the game - this is a sci-fi dungeon crawler and you *will* crawl like the insect you are if you want to survive.\n\nThe interface in this game feels more like piloting a flesh mech than a first person shooter, and honestly I kind of love it. All the little button and nobs as you try to arm yourself with various weapons - ranging from totally useless to gamebreakingly absurd. Did I mention you can get a lightsaber in this game and that if used properly it will carry you through most fights? What if I told you you get rocket skates that when paired with a berserk drug and a reflex booster more or less turns you into a particularly frothy Jedi? Just keep in mind that when I say \"game breaking\" I mean that literally, as you will be tripping out so hard from that combo that you will be practically blind for the next few minutes. \n\nIn a lot of games, grenades tend to be very wimpy - not so in this game. They have a decent blast radius and the stronger ones can nuke you in one go. No in this game the only thing that is weak is your character's throwing arm. The expression \"throws like a girl\" could be used here, but I feel that is giving him too much credit. The hacker does not throw grenades so much as he gently lofts them from his hands. I would go so far as to say that they merely roll out of his palms and onto the floor followed shortly by his legs flying past his head. A lot of nerdy men get bullied by jocks in highschool - the hacker would have been bullied by the glee club. If you want to use grenades, I suggest you either do so from an elevation, from a prone position (gives you a better throwing arc without hitting the roof), or simply throwing an unarmed grenade and shooting it at a distance. There are more options, but understand that using grenades like you would in other games will get you killed 9 times out of 10\n\nThe game also has cyber space sections, these are not very challenging but I enjoy them and their strange flight simulator like controls. BTW: press S to speed up. But you get to pull things like pointless mini-games that you can play on your military grade cyber interface - so that by itself worth while. While I'm rattling off pointless things, the music and sound design is very weird and detailed. Feels like it is always changing based on what I'm doing and where I'm going. Extremely dynamic and it is impressive how much work must have gone into it. Just don't have headphone on if you go into radiation rooms. Your character will get cancer and you'll get tinnitus. \n\nNow, if you'll excuse me: I have to replay this game on the canon difficulty.

Mainly you just need to know that you toggle between looking around and managing your inventory with the E key. Reloading is done through the inventory screen.

System Shock is one of the most fascinating FPS games to have ever been released. It's clunky, heavy-handed, and easy to get lost in, but that all contributes to it feeling like a truly immersive experience. Once you get used to it, you really do feel a sort of symbiosis with how your character moves and acts. Better yet, a lot of that clunkiness has been reduced due to the changes made to the controls and UI, making it a much easier game to play for newcomers and veterans alike.\n\nAnd up until the last patch, that would've been the end of it. I would've said that it's a substantial remaster of a classic game. However, I cannot fathom how Nightdive has completely broken the experience so suddenly.\n\nI'm not an expert when it comes to programming or hardware so I'm not going to even begin to analyze what the cause of the problem is, but it doesn't take an expert to notice that the game has suddenly become a choppy, nigh-unplayable mess. While playing the game in Vulkan mitigates the problem slightly, you're basically stuck picking between playing the game at a low framerate or having to somehow get used to a constant microstutter that occurs every time you move your character around. Reminder, this is a game that came out in 1994; there's no reason why it should have any problems on modern hardware.\n\nThis wasn't a problem a few months ago, but it's impossible to ignore it now that it's here. I'm shocked that there hasn't been any resolution to this yet, and the only real solution most have found is to buy the GOG version so you can more easily roll it back to the previous patch, but I shouldn't have to buy the game AGAIN to fix a problem that wasn't there originally. \n\ntl;dr - Don't buy this version of the game until they fix it up.

Listening to the logs when it's quite is advised, or just lower music and sound effects and set radio volume to max while you listen to them.\n- There will be parts where you'll be running around levels mindlessly searching for keycodes or just trying to figure out what the hell's going on.\n- The game ends abruptly\n\n[b]9/10[/b] I would've gave the game a 10/10 rating if it wasn't for the flaws of the game, because it is such an awesome game which I've really liked from start to finish, apart from the flaws I mentioned.

Compared to Ultima Underworld, Looking Glass's older game with the same Engine, the differences are day and night. Detailed pixelart with an artstyle detailing grotesque mutations and such with complex designs, very much held up nice. The enviroment is also very advanced for the time, with slopes and not just 90 degree walls, with interesting places to explore, such as a medical facility, executive areas, a shuttle bay for ships land, and even Garden Groves infested with Mutagenic plant and animal life.\nOne thing that bothered me is the scaling effect when looking up or down at an enemy, and yes this was pretty standard at the time, and even advanced because years later games still used this scaling property. Still would've liked a way to disable it and make then visible normally. The cyberspace areas in the game are weird, and weirdly ahead of their time ? Maybe not, it's like a polygon based Descent. It's weird and uncanny but about that later. But yeah for Graphics I'd settle down for a 9, it looks great for its time and looks great even now.\n\nThe Music 10/10:\n\nFor me, the music is one of the best parts of this game. It's a shame that we won't hear much of the old tunes presented here in the near-coming remake of the game.\nSo the music is best in Chorium Rev A or in just dos, most midi Devices don't give the soundtrack enough justice.\nSystem shock's soundtrack is very varied and expanding, places such as Med sci and Research have a kinda gloomy but rocking feeling to them, while others such as Maintenance and Flight Decks have some haunting and distrubing tracks to them. Also the games doesn't just stick to one music all the time, when you face  [/spoiler Edward Diego] in Executive sector the soundtrack goes really hard to get you invested in the fight. Best tracks for me personally would go for Reactor, Executive and Security/Bridge. They have this ass kicking vibe to them, but also can go for a slower more methodicaly approach that always changes up how you approach certain places. One game where buying the soundtrack itself isn't a bad acquisition, so that's why it gets a 10 out of 10.\n\nThe Ui and Controls 8/10:\n\nYeah...the most controversial part about the game and why it was more outdated back then compared to now.\nMost would describe the game as tank controls, but I think skate roller with vaseline would describe it better.\nYes you get adapted to it, and the inventory system got noticeably better, still this is why people are afraid to try this game out. It gets and 8 out of 10 just becuase of the learning curve and later modification making the controls even weirder and ice-like.\n\nThe Gameplay 9-10/10\n\nThis is where the games shines or dwindles as to what you like. If you like a deep, dark cyberpunk story with a benevolent crazed Ai with a god complex and Matrilineality, this is the game for you. But if you don't like having to collect keys, pass codes, pass codes from e-mails or [/spoiler HAVING TO GO BACK TO EVERY PART OF THE GAME TO GET ONE WHOLE NUMBER], then I would suggest skipping this one. The Majority of the game let's you explore and feel the place at your leisure, you always have the time to suck all the diabolical things that happended to you collagues. The shooting feels satisfying, the movement is... decent, the story is gripping, the atmosphere is haunting and well designed, dialogues are well...very 90s, also yeah, this was the first game to actually support voice messages or in this case, e-mails, that lots of games to this days like Bioshock use. This game invented so many genre necessities, and was so ahead of it's time that back then, it got panned pretty hard, which will haunt Looking Glass for their next two titles, both of them set so many generalities that to this day stand, that back then they couldn't handle it. Also the difficulty is pretty fair I would say. You can adjust everything in the game. If you don't like the whole code searching key hunting mother cucking things, tone down story and puzzles.\nIn my opinion gameplay wise this is a hit or miss, but when it hits. it hits very VERY hard.\n\nThe S.H.O.D.A.N 15/10\nI won't spoil nothing. Just saying that this game got the best Rouge Ai in the existence of fiction... well for me atleast.\n\n\nSo in the end I would give this game a fair and balanced [b 9.5 out of 10].

It's not Doom so don't expect that going into it but rather you should expect the birth of the immersive sim. A slow paced, difficult, tactical horror FPS and one of the earliest story-focused shooters ever made. It gets SO many things right that most modern shooters fail miserably when it comes to storytelling and world building. And the best part is by far the villain; the one and only Shodan. As usual in my reviews I break things down:\n\nPros\n- Challenging but satisfying tactical combat\n- Massive and highly explorable space station with excellent level design\n- No hand holding, it's up to you to figure it all out and rewards players who pay attention\n- A unique interface and control scheme that sets it apart from other shooters even for its time\n- Highly adjustable difficulty settings for individual gameplay elements\n- Lots of weapons, ammo types, grenades, upgrades and consumables to allow for many styles of play\n- Lots of horror and spooks\n- Excellent soundtrack\n- Great art style with some gorgeous and grotesque enemies and environments for its time\n- Amazing storytelling focused on audio logs and environmental scenery\n- Shodan is a scary waifu\n\nCons\n- Music can be too loud and energetic for its dark, slow paced horror atmosphere\n- Over-reliance on hitscan robot enemies\n- Movement mechanics are bizarre, sometimes getting launched or slowed down for no reason\n- Control scheme might be too cumbersome for most players\n- Too much ammo, robots and cyborg enemy corpses drown you in it\n- Cyberspace sections, while rare, they suck despite being cool and impressive in 1994\n- Audio logs spoken dialogue is completely different to the written dialogue they come with\n- Voice acting is stilted and dull, except for Shodan\n- Sound design is a hilariously loud mess, especially in radiation zones\n- While the final parts of the game are great especially the visuals for the final boss, the ending cutscene is very abrupt and disappointing\n\nAll that said, my gripes are very minor and are well overshadowed by everything System Shock does so very right. Nightdive's work on bringing this classic up to date for modern systems is nothing short of spectacular and its very cheap price point makes it well worth the buy especially if you're looking for a lengthy game where a first playthrough can last up to 15 hours like mine did. If you're put off by the control scheme or any other aspect of the game then rejoice because the System Shock remake is drawing close at the time of writing this review and I'm so excited to step back onto Citadel Station in all its modernised glory.\n\nIt has definitely become one of my favourite games and I recommend this janky masterpiece wholeheartedly.", "timestamp_created": 1622838687, "timestamp_updated": 1622838844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93145693": {"recommendationid": "93145693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039161059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 2855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 386, "last_played": 1623706132}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game that holds up well today.

You can check bodies and boxes for loot. You can pick up objects on the environment and throw them away.  You interact with puzzles to open up locked doors and different paths through your adventure.

You also get like 10 other weapons, all of them with their own ammo and damage.\n\nThe game itself is pretty fun. You get different objectives through the game, and need to traverse 10 different levels while you tackle each objective.\nIt's not you simple \"shoot everything dead and proceed\" kind of game. You need to explore and be aware of your objectives in order to proceed.\n\nThrought the game you'll receive incoming calls from people trying to help you, aswell as getting messages from SHODAN intimidating you the whole time.\n\nThe easiest way i can describe this game to you is \"imagine bioshock but 1994 pcs\".\nWhilst it may be exaggerating a bit (sorry, no magic powers shooting through the tip of your fingers), it kinda encompasses the overall feel of the game.\n\nSeriously reccomend if you enjoy playing old pc games. \nIt was quite an enjoyable adventure and made me realise how far immersive sims have come since the early 90s.", "timestamp_created": 1622491923, "timestamp_updated": 1622491923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53436809778213501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92886050": {"recommendationid": "92886050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379325922", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1657767217}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the original horror shooters.

Back in the 90s. In the 320x200 resolution as my old computer could not handle any better.\nTherefore my experience is a little different from what I can read in most of the reviews here. System shock 2 being The classic? Not for me :-).\n\nThis enhanced edition brings back memories and improves the experience to the level I wished I had 25 years ago. Better resolution, better movement (with an exception in cyberspace). The rest remained as I remember it - excellent.\n\nAt first, I was confused. Playing System Shock with WASD and mouselook? It felt strange. Remember, this was my first experience, and I learned the mouse-controlled movement from the original SS quite well. It had its charm. But damn - now I can play it actually as a shooter game! I can run away when my gun gets empty (no R for reload) - this caused me a lot of deaths back then. There is a reason to use the berserk or stamina pill from time to time. I can use the rearview without losing FPS. And I am unstoppable with the laser rapier now. (I hope they keep this OP weapon in the remake and that they keep it OP :-)) \nThe skates also work better now (this relates to the FPS as well), though I miss the strafe movement (A D controls) with the skates even more now. But I like this limitation then - it makes perfect sense with the skates, right? Only cyberspace feels still better with the original controls, and I struggle a little with the new ones.\n\nThe (a bit) enhanced graphics looks mostly well, and it shows the potential the game had (and still has) comparing to some more modern games. It just reduces the nostalgia a bit - I play the original SS version in a parallel just for the blurry experience.\n\nThis is interesting. I remember longing for better graphics so much (and it didn't change, I still do, now it is RTX 30xx to desire ;-)). I used to switch the game to the 640x480 resolution from time to time just for a while, even if I had about 3 - 5 FPS, and dreamed about a computer that would handle it fluently (which meant probably something like 20 FPS for me, not 90 or whatsoever). Now, in a way - the worse resolution I choose, the better the the immersion is. Because this is what it brings to me the most - the immersion to my past. If the enhanced edition didn't require a restart of the game when changing the resolution, I would experiment with it probably even more. \n\nRegarding the gameplay itself: for me, this is still a good game with its combination of exploration, imaginative locations and level design, various enemies, various guns and satisfying looting, logical puzzles, messages with the backstory, and cyberspace. I like some of the mechanics. There is no specific path to choose. You may use any enhancement you find: it's just a question of energy. No skills tree = no agonizing hesitation about what to choose and what to leave. I love the option to make notes on the map and to see them in the actual world, which allows you to leave something (a battery, first aid kit, a gun, a button with unknown function), make a note, and come back for it later. And the relief when you find the restoration switch in the current level.\nOf course, the enemies' AI is poor or lacking at all. There is not enough space in the inventory to use all the guns you find. And the movement is still not that fluent we are used to be in modern games, especially in some narrow and diagonal corridors.\nI am playing it through again right now while waiting for the remake, and I am enjoying it even more than I expected before I started. I hope the remake turns out well too.

However, after enjoying the remastered demo I decided to give this game another shot.  \n\nAt first, you'll probably find the HUD overwhelming.  There are a ton of features on it and it takes up a huge chunk of the screen though you can go into fullscreen mode if this gets too annoying.  The UI is a lot more like early first-person games such as Terminator: 2029 and Ultima: Underworld than Doom and Wolfenstein 3D.  I hated it at first, but after awhile I grew to like how much information it gives you.  \n\nThe controls are also very awkward, and though the enhanced edition features mouse look, it's still cumbersome having to switch between moving and using items.  Cyberspace movement is especially clunky because it doesn't work well with mouse look by default, but fortunately you can remap the keys.  The enemy AI, though, isn't that smart so once you get used to these controls you'll find it pretty easy to dance around them and shoot them around corners.  \n\nProbably my least favorite thing about the game is the music.  The first few levels have especially annoying music, but it gets better.  The classic version seems to have better sounding MIDI than this version.  The sound effects are decent though.  \n\nGraphically, it's pretty dated.  Some of the levels look hideous, but there are other ones that I liked such as the Executive level.  Some enemies look pretty derpy like the Hoppers, but the security bots, cyborgs and most of the mutants looked cool.  \n\nI admit that I didn't like the game at first, but I decided to be patient with the controls and the music.  Eventually the gameplay really sucked me in because there are all kinds of puzzles and places to explore.  I would say that the exploration is better than System Shock 2 because it doesn't hold your hand as much.  You can find out everything you need to know, however, as long as you are patient and examine all the logs and the Cyberspace data items.  I'm old  enough to remember what games were like back when this was current, and I'd say it's rather innovative for its time.  \n\nThis game may take some getting used to at first, but finishing it was very rewarding so I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1615630661, "timestamp_updated": 1615630661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88229760": {"recommendationid": "88229760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126092026", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1035, "last_played": 1678277719}, "language": "english", "review": "Shodan CBT", "timestamp_created": 1615445207, "timestamp_updated": 1615445207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630933582782745361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88166135": {"recommendationid": "88166135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268124171", "num_games_owned": 750, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1212, "last_played": 1615340830}, "language": "spanish", "review": "fuck level 3 tho", "timestamp_created": 1615345363, "timestamp_updated": 1615345363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88137914": {"recommendationid": "88137914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056603045", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 99, "last_played": 1679892848}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most influential games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1615304287, "timestamp_updated": 1615304287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88112049": {"recommendationid": "88112049", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023919529", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 1133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1010, "last_played": 1651434762}, "language": "english", "review": "a fun and scare game with a great plot and setting. by far my farvorite evil AI in fiction. i loved it. though cyber space was annoying and the music was terrible this was well worth it. just remember the first part of playing system shock is configuring your controls for an hour", "timestamp_created": 1615259598, "timestamp_updated": 1615259598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88040969": {"recommendationid": "88040969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190152269", "num_games_owned": 651, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 910, "last_played": 1615067266}, "language": "english", "review": "While a little outdated, if it looked better I probably wouldn\u2019t even question if this was released recently.

The exploration of Citadel Station was easily my favourite part, simply witnessing the all-out war between Shodan and TriOptimum employees trying to survive and learning about the functions of every floor on Citadel Station. I did get a little confused with my objective in the mid-late game, but that was definitely my fault because I got so focused on just exploring that I would neglect data logs and just forget about what I was supposed to do in favour of finding everything on whatever floor I was on. It makes you feel like you\u2019re fighting everything left on Citadel Station, including the station itself.\n\nProbably the worst part of the game was the music because, at its best, it just feels atmospheric while reminding the player of the technological presence on Citadel Station.

The clunky controls and dated visuals, not to mention the learning curve and initial difficulty level, really turned me off and left a bad taste in my mouth. I found myself installing and uninstalling several times over a period of a few months. \n\nWith the recent announcement of the System Shock remake coming later in 2021, I figured it was high time to sit down and give System Shock: Enhanced Edition (SS:EE) another try. I knew that I was going to be picking up the remake and in a way I felt I owed it to myself to play the grandfather of SS2. I had sunk a lot of hours into SS2 and my enjoyment had pushed me to try its spiritual successor, Bioshock, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. With that said, I booted it up, played for 30 minutes, and was promptly murdered.\n\nRather than uninstall it, I did some digging on the internet to figure out what I was doing wrong and came across several helpful guides regarding something I hadn\u2019t realized was such a linchpin in my experience: the controls. Oh, gods, the controls. Once I made some adjustments to the controls following some helpful suggestions and adapting a couple things to my specific keyboard, SS:EE opened up to me. \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever played Doom 1993, Hexen, Duke Nukem 3D, or Blake Stone and found them enjoyable you have to do yourself a favour and try SS:EE. It has the right amount of cyberpunk flavouring to stand it apart from other shooters, the weapons are varied and feel suitably unique, the various ammunition and damage types don\u2019t just make it a \u201cgrab the biggest gun and you auto win,\u201d and the enemies are challenging enough that you\u2019ll find yourself reloading a save more than once.\n\nThe puzzles, story, objectives, and level design put the other classics released around its time to shame. This, combined with the enhanced editions voice acting (some of it is hit and miss but keep in mind these are the game devs and some of their friends) really brings you in to the setting. While you never actually meet any of the characters in the game, I will admit that at times I could get into the game enough to feel their sense of dread, anger, or hopelessness. SHODAN is a great antagonist and her voice acting really makes her feelings of loathing and general dismissiveness towards you feel tangible.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get up on a soapbox and tell you SS:EE is a \u201cmust play,\u201d but if you were ever a fan of the aforementioned classics I think you owe it to yourself to not only play it but actually give it a chance.

I played for a bit but abandoned it quite early on. However I do remember some areas and doing one or two cyberspace instances. \n\nWith new determination I restarted the game late 2020 and this time with the inclination to finish it. I watched an introduction video by Mandalore Gaming to get me going, it helps as he explains the interface. I also used a non-spoilery and non-extensive walkthrough that you can find here on Steam to keep track of my missions. There is no quest-log in the game and I didn\u2019t keep my own notes so I thought it was reasonable to keep track of my \u201cquests\u201d by taking a peak at that WT.\n\nThis time around I got hooked early on, already on the first level, and it didn\u2019t take long before I became comfortable with the clunky interface. The interface is probably the biggest turn-off for most people and the reason why System Shock isn\u2019t widely played. It's a question of accessibility. But it isn\u2019t as complicated as it appears and you shouldn\u2019t let it discourage you. You can switch between your regular shooter style gameplay, with the crosshair in the middle, to a free mouse cursor mode that allows you to poke around in your inventory and other devices. It actually works quite similar to modern games where you press a key, usually TAB, but in SS1 it\u2019s E, to bring up your Data Reader which is like the PIPBOY in Fallout. \n\nIn System Shock 1 the game doesn\u2019t pause while you are in your inventory so if you are attacked you must quickly shift back again. However you can still fire your gun whilst browsing the interface, the problem is if the enemy is behind you and you need to turn around. But it\u2019s isn\u2019t that big of a problem and you become used to it in no time.\n\nI\u2019m amazed at how many features this old gem from 94\u2019 actually has. First of all there are different stances. You can stand, crouch and crawl. You can lean to the sides and also jump of course. There\u2019s a fatigue meter and you can become exhausted. You have HP and energy. Energy can be drained by energy weapons as well as by your equipment. You have the flashlight of course and you can also get infravision, target tracking and more. There are loads of weapons. Melee weapons, pistols, rifles, energy weapons and more. Most guns can be loaded with different ammo types which makes the arsenal even more versatile. There are also many different types of grenades as well as chems that can alter your physical state. For example the Berserk chem which improves your melee combat for a short duration of time. \n\nYou also have the already mentioned Data Reader in which you collect audio logs, receive emails and other data. And if all this wasn\u2019t enough there are data jacks from where you can enter cyberspace. Cyberspace doesn\u2019t have that huge of a role as I initially thought and there are even levels without data jacks. In cyberspace you can collect stuff, kill programs and unlock doors. You can also gather useful intel. On some levels for example you have to enter cyberspace to be able to pass certain doors in the flesh world. The layout of cyberspace can be confusing at times but you will soon learn to navigate. \n\nThere are also minigames for opening certain doors. The minigames can be bypassed by a disposable item though. You move through the stations levels and you can travel between levels using lifts. For some quests you have to travel back and forth between levels. There\u2019s a lot of different containers and bodies lying around that can be looted for items. Enemies leave lootable corpses.\n\nEach level comes with it's own music (sort of) and it often sets the tone perfectly. \n\nFew games since have been able to match this extensive mass of features and gameplay systems. System Shock 2 is good but it doesn\u2019t have cyberspace for instance. Then there\u2019s Deus Ex and also Prey from 2017 which came close.\n\nYou are the Hacker and have been brought aboard the citadel space station. When you wake up from cryosleep it turns out that everything on the station has gone to hell. The rogue AI Shodan is killing all of the remaining crew members who are by now in an active rebellion but getting decimated fast. The ones who get captured are either turned to mutants or converted into cyborgs. \n\nThe enemies you meet are different types of mutants and cyborgs that Shodan throws at you. Unlike System Shock 2 this isn\u2019t a scary game. In SS2 you sneak around hitting enemies at the back of their heads with the wrench. At some times the ammo scarcity leaves you no other choice. However in SS1 you fight the enemy head on and can kill them quite easily. Ammo isn\u2019t scarce as in SS2 so that gives you no problems. SS2 had a much scarier atmosphere and I even remember screaming out loud at some times when I got ambushed. SS1 in contrast has yet to frighten me. However there are a few surprise ambushes where the walls open and hidden enemies attack you but it never gives you that creeping feel of dread as in other games.\n\nSince I played System Shock 2 before System Shock 1 I already knew the story. However it\u2019s still nicely told through audio logs. You learn of what went wrong and how the desperate crew tried to stop Shodan. However since they failed it\u2019s up to you, the Hacker, to stop Shodan's plans. Each time you prevent Shodan she comes up with another plan but when you\u2019ve stopped her the third time she\u2019s defeated (until SS2). I won\u2019t spoil the story here but it\u2019s your typical rogue AI with illusions of grandeur. Still, Shodan is Shodan, so it feels special. However the ending felt very anticlimatic. I thought it would be much more of a boss fight.\n\nAs a completionist and since it was my first tour on Citadel Space Station it took me 21.6 hours to complete according to steam.\n\nA sad thing is that you can see by the achievements that very few people who own the game have actually played it. Only 4% of players have completed the game as of now. There's also an achievment that you can achive in the absolute begining of the game that only 14% of players have achieved.

You get thrown on the space station with one goal: deactivate the AI controlling the station. How do you do that? You have to find out yoursef and don't expect any waypoints or hand holding. You have to find audio logs and read notes to somehow know what the point on each level is but good luck finding the places, the station is a giant maze. I kind of love the exploration aspect of the game, but after 13,4 hours I'm completely burnt out.\n\nThe gameplay by itself is terribly aged. You have to switch between two modes:\nAn action mode in which you can collect things or activate things by double clicking. Why double click? I don't know and I hate it.\nThe other mode is the FPS mode,  in wich you can pretty much play the game as a poor retro shooter, fighting hordes of robots and mutants.\nSome guns are fun, but taking out enemies mostly will also do a fair amount of damage to you.\n\nVisually the game is not bad and some areas are pretty creative. Most of the sound design is also really good, but the music is so loud and annoying, I had to reduce the volume very much.\n\nTechnically speaking this version is flawless. No crashes and up to modern resolutions.\n\nSo despite liking parts of this game, I don't think most people will actually enjoy this. I didn't for at least half of the time.

Looking at it from a different angle did not improve its visibility.  Another aspect of the game that feels a bit odd is that it seems like you're expect to rely on the auto respawning machines that need to be activated on each level, as the game does not provide very many ways to heal your character, aside from consumable healing items.  Finally cyberspace seems like it had some potential, but needed far more polish.

I gathered from the Mandalore review (which I recommend watching [i] before [/i] playing) that all enemies respawn, so I put \"Combat\" on \"2/4.\" The game seemed rather easy, and I always had ammo for my weapons.

While this definetly feels like SS2 (coming from someone who played that first), it is missing a lot of the options and creativity that SS2 allowed (this is much closer to a FPS than an immersive sim, as the only real options you have are weapons, grenades, or mines). However, the levels are great, have lots to see (although it is very boxy), and there are tons of secrets and lore to find. While I would still say it is nowhere near perfect, this is shockingly close for its time.\n\nI personally also find the leaning and crouching system to be more advanced and flexible than any other I've seen, I personally am fine with simple leaning, but this game's movement and positioning puts most modern ones to shame.", "timestamp_created": 1606852316, "timestamp_updated": 1606853330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81115465": {"recommendationid": "81115465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033972496", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2121, "last_played": 1636894855}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic tale that is very 90's, of a rogue AI, cyborgs, corrupt corporations, corporate espionage, all on a space station.

No. Grossly outdated? Absolutely.\n\nBefore writing this review, I had found and read an old gaming magazine article about System Shock. I wanted to open a window to the past and take a look at how it was perceived in its prime. It appears that the game was considered highly innovative. It was praised for being immersive, graphically advanced, featuring complex environment geometry, and having extensive freedom of movement (the article even speculated that \"System Shock 2\" will feature a \"scatch your arse\" option to complete the full range of real-life motions). The game was so technically advanced that the author recommended getting a high-end PC to run it smoothly. It's fair to say System Shock pushed many conventional boundaries, consequently influencing the gaming industry in many ways.\n\nBack to the future. It would be senseless to approach SS1 with modern standards. Even with \"Enhanced Edition,\" which upscales resolution and allows for a more streamlined control scheme, a major discount has to be applied to expectations. Some adapt easily to dated graphics and game design; others struggle. As one may have guessed, in this case, I am from the latter category. Allow me to excuse myself.\n\nI was aware of the unwieldy controls. I've played \"Enhanced Edition\" and spent some time configuring it to suit my comfort. In the end, I had no problems navigating through the game. I knew what to expect from the 1994 graphics. I accepted them as a style and quickly got used to them. I understood that I should not anticipate a complex story from the game, which came out in the era where having a story in a video game was under discussion. The concept is cool; it provides an excuse to shoot space cyborgs, so that's alright. However, I was neither warned nor prepared for one major flaw: outdated level design.\n\nSystem Shock Citadel is a maze. This statement is not a literary exaggeration, but a fact. I don't need to be reminded about the technical limitations of the time, and I do not blame the game. Nevertheless, as soon as I realized that the whole game is set in a network of claustrophobic labyrinths, negativity started to slowly accumulate until it finally reached irritation. Most of the time in SS1 is spent walking around narrow corridors, stumbling upon locked doors, and painfully backtracking. Everything looks the same and becomes a blurry mess after walking around corners for hours. It takes considerable effort to memorize locations. It literally gave me a headache; my brain was very strained. Sometimes I had to open the map after every turn to make sure I was walking in the right direction. This maze design slowed everything down to a snail's pace. Needless to say, the whole layout didn't make any sense. A space station without a single toilet? Dead ends and hidden doors? Switches that activate something far away? The list can go on, but these are nitpicks. Having said that, there are nitpicks that I considered due to my annoyance with level design.\n\nMy tolerance for other outmoded things decreased as a result of my constant irritation. It annoyed me that sometimes it was unavoidable to receive damage from hit-scan enemies. It annoyed me that everything looked like a pixelated mess. It annoyed me that \"cyber space\" was not just labyrinths, but labyrinths with transparent walls. I was annoyed to have to backtrack through the same locations over and over again. My \"list of annoyances\" is extensive.\n\nNonetheless, I finished the game twice. First on normal settings, then on the hardest difficulties (beating Shodan in under 7 hours). Although I did mention a lot of things that irritated me, it would be unfair to classify System Shock as \"bad.\" It's not; it has a lot to offer.\n\nIt was \"System Shock's\" approach to objectives that captivated me till the end. The game does not hold your hand, instead providing clues as to what you are supposed to do. I had to read mails, listen to audiologs, and explore every corner to deduce what to do and how to achieve it. I used a walkthrough a couple of times, but only to clarify some confusions (for example, to learn how to plant a bomb or to find a detail I missed in a sequence of tasks). I can clearly see how \"System Shock\" could have been immersive for me if I didn't mind the level design so much. Even though backtracking was painful, exploring new areas and discovering secrets was exciting. Even though most enemies were hit-scan marksmen, each had to be approached with appropriate gear. Even though Shodan could have been replaced with a mad scientist without changing the plot, defeating her was exhilarating. Just like with the \"list of annoyances,\" I can list many positive things. Unfortunately, not quite as many.\n\n\nTo summarize, System Shock is a grossly outdated game, albeit not a bad one. I do not recommend playing it to anyone except those who wish to understand how far modern games have evolved. It allows us to appreciate what we have. If you have thick skin when it comes to claustrophobic mazes with narrow tunnels, you may even avoid the irritation that I felt.\n\nA part of me wishes I was able to experience System Shock under different circumstances. Perhaps, when I did not know better and could look at the game with the same eyes as people from 1994. For better or worse, I am not excited about \"being able to climb ladders\" and \"seeing slopes in video games' geometry.\" For me, these are normal occurrences. Along with many other things that are invisible to my consciousness and that I take for granted. I've heard better stories and seen prettier things. I have experienced numerous games. Progress marches relentlessly forward, dragging us along with it. The fact that \"System Shock\" is a great game remains, but the reasoning changes. In 1994, it was due to its qualities.

When I started it up, I cringed cause I was never a big fan of pixel shooters like doom/wolf. And this game looks a lot like them. But its not like them, its not run and gun and collect health. I started playing it cause I wanted at least 1 achievement or a few. As I played through it, I began to notice the complexities, you play in a huge station with floors. There are no levels or stages like doom/wolf. Its one big connected station where you freely move back and forth to unlock more and more. Its a 3d metroid close to a decade before metroid prime. But its not just a FP metroid. It also has elements from deus ex, fallout 3, bioshock and many more new games. Its a very involved game as well, as enemies are not just cannon fodder but are very capable and can knock you on your ass hard unprepared. There's a lot of strategy in coming at your opponents.

You peacefully sleep post cybernetic surgery during a 6 month duration while SHODAN overthrows the Citadel crew. You wake up to a ship overrun with cyborgs, mutants, machines, and monsters. Oh my! Worst of all, SHODAN wants to blast a laser at Earth! You have roughly seven hours to thwart SHODAN's schemes before it's too late. Can you do it, Hacker?

Three windows along the bottom of the screen allow you to view a Mini Map, Reload Weapons (Left or Right Window), and peruse Data (Emails, Logs, Data). If you need to view Data, left click E located on the right side of the screen.

Explore many nooks and crannies to find powerful weapons. Search the bodies of your enemies for ammunition or healing items such as Med. Remember, a dart will not harm a giant robot later in the game unless your combat difficulty is set very low.

Throughout the game, I have killed many enemies, because they were stuck in a doorway, unable to find their way towards me. The UI is very different from today\u2019s standardized UIs and often criticized, but I honestly enjoyed its sophistication. My main problem with System Shock was the maze-like level design and backtracking. I often found myself trying to figure out how to progress, finding out later that I am supposed go back to a small room five levels (floors) earlier. Hacking mini-games are alright and the inventory management is fun.\n\nOverall, System Shock was too ambitious for its technical limitations in 1994. It definitely deserves respect for what it was trying to do, but if I had to name one game that desperately needs a remake it would be the original System Shock.

The mouse free look alone makes this so smooth and fun to play, even if that feature makes some equipment useless like the \"Sensaround Multi-View Unit\" that was designed with the old, clunky controls in mind where 360\u00b0 no-scope turnarounds were simply impossible.\nThe game runs flawlessly and the controls can be bound to your liking to give it a modern feel (e.g. Q and E to lean, CTRL and ALT to crouch and prone, TAB to switch between free mouse look and GUI mouse movement and much more).\nOnly one time the game crashed, and that was when I tried to delete an old map note that had its name removed after coming back to a previous level (this bug was supposed to be fixed in the Source Port Update #4 but apparently it's not).\nStory wise it's pretty simple and a typical [i]\"The Evil AI\"[/i] plot, but that AI being SHODAN, with her insulting and demeaning personality and attitude towards human life, is definitely a great highlight that will make you look forward to every communication from her.\nThe ending was a bit of a letdown though, it just ended too suddenly and the game also got pretty confusing at times where you don't know what to do next, so have a walkthrough or guide ready just in case.\n\n[h1]OVERALL:[/h1]\n\u2610 5/5 (Great)\n[u]\u2612 4/5 (Good)[/u]\n\u2610 3/5 (Okay)\n\u2610 2/5 (Bad)\n\u2610 1/5 (Terrible)", "timestamp_created": 1599170833, "timestamp_updated": 1599171004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48842504620552063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75363964": {"recommendationid": "75363964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028490594", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 242, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1599123265}, "language": "english", "review": "I flipped a switch that apparently controlled the station's laser beam and I accidentally destroyed a part of Earth.

While it's definitely quite tough to get into compared to the modern games with simpler controls and UI, once the learning curve is passed, it offers a great experience. The graphics are rather simplistic, but there's a very noticeable old school sci-fi aesthetic with a lot of soul. The music is at times a mixed bag, some tracks and sound effects would turn into a complete cacophony and blast my eardrums out, but overall the enemies are immediately recognisable by their distinct sounds and some of the musical tracks absolutely, positively SLAP. You get quite a lot of tools to resolve the Citadel crisis, but you're never safe. Once System Shock properly draws you in, an enemy rounding a corner can be legitimately tense and terrifying, SHODAN *really* wants you dead. One more thing worth mentioning, the game allows individual tweaking of Combat, Story, Puzzle and Cyberspace difficulties, which is a very interesting addition that in my opinion would be a worthwhile addition in quite a few modern titles. Overall, while a somewhat tough game to love after getting spoiled by more streamlined elements of its successors, to those who stick with it System Shock can offer a suspenseful adventure with an unforgettable and endlessly malicious antagonist (not kidding, every time she sends you a transmission in that haunting glitched voice, shit is positively about to hit the fan).

I have seen plenty of reviews complaining about the controls, but really it's something you get used to after at least a quarter of your playthrough. \n\nI feel like System Shock 2 is vastly different from System Shock 1 as there's still exploration but not in the same sense.

Not because I was interested in the game itself but heard a lot of praise for the second game so I went out my way and wanted to play this one first. While being somewhat completely different than the second it still captures the same cyberpunk art style and oozes this even more with its soundtrack that is made from Synthesizer. But it gets a lot of work trying to get into the game.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nIt looks first like some simple early 90s first person shooter but is far away from that. If you have ever played ghost recon, the game feels like a mix between this and general survival horror game aspects. Also it offers a heavy convoluted HUD which doesn\u2019t only serve as something that takes away more than half of your screen but features most of the unique stuff System Shock is known for. \n\nYour Hud is basically your cybernetical dashboard offering you Item descriptions, General Information for everything but also as a Tool to convey your various tools you get. As an example, one of the first items you can find is basically a back camera that shows in a very low FPS what\u2019s going on behind you. This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a fantastic designed masterpiece, far from it a lot of the games system can be convoluted without serving much purpose, as an example I found almost no use for the back camera as energy is better used differently.\n\nIt\u2019s also somewhat of a stretch between being very Action oriented and trying to be somewhat scary or at least convey an oppressed feeling to the player. If you die u just don\u2019t reload into a save, you see a short clip where you are being transformed as a mindless Cyborg.\n\nAnd I must say the survival \u201chorror\u201d aspects in this game work, I enjoy it looking around for hidden treasure or just new Datalogs with stories or information from the personnel of the space station you have found yourself in. Fighting itself is totally doable, less action oriented and more about positioning, usage of correct weapons or tools.\n\nShooter mechanics wise it plays more like a tactical shooter while not being too hardcore. You will be most of the time try to lean around corners and snipe enemies away, or throw grenades into stronger enemies or groups. Enemies can kill you easily in a couple of hits, you wont be ever tanking more than 5 shots from these guys unless using shields. I really like this aspect making it gunplay wise even better than the second game in my opinion. only buzzkill for me was that enemies will constantly respawn. This means you constantly will deal with thrash mobs over and over again when backtracking.\n\nSpeaking of backtracking, you will do this a LOT. It got almost to the point where i was ragequitting because i didnt write down node codes, which made me backtrack to a very specific room in every single level making me just walk for a couple of hours . My critique is that the game never really tells you that you have to write down some random number that appears when destroying enough security/nodes in a room.\n\nThe worst enemy for most people are the controls which are rather overambitious. As in, it wants you to be able to control everything, heck you can even use a slider to look up or down slightly or lean in different positions making you able up to 9(!) different ways to have your body positioned. But this makes for a messy control scheme that despite remapping never really feels really good to use.\n\nDue to the Hud that is packed full of different side menus and tools new players can get very easily lost and stop playing the game. The standard control mapping doesn\u2019t help that much either as any normal person would put leaning to q and r.\n\nThere is also a cyberspace minigame that is just awful and not really fun. It plays like some sort of shooter like decent, except you cant strafe and its visually also a mess. It does help to change the pacing somewhat but overall I dislike this minigame the most.\n\nMap design wise it can also be later on very complicated and I\u2019ve found myself a couple of times stuck and puzzled what to do next\n\nAs side note, incase you dislike puzzles or combat the game offers a huge variety of difficulties, makes you enable to make combat easier to puzzles completely gone.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nWhile not overly complex, its mostly anyways more important how a story is told. Dialogues are witty and don\u2019t hinder the gameplay at all. Rare to see to have a good told story in an action game like this from that era.\n\n[u]Enhanced Edition [/u]\nI\u2019m impressed how the well the Enhanced Edition is made. Not only offers it a lot of good improvements, like being able to move your gun while looking around it also has a lot of visual upgrades ranging from taking the hand drawn MAC pictures to making the game less pixelated and the in-game environment, not the models as they still are pixelated.\nIn case there are purists out there you can also play the classic dosbox Version. Neat! Can\u2019t ask for more.\n\nAnother thing i want to add is the lighting. I dont know if the enhanced edition improves this but i feel the general lighting of this game is for this era just fantastic. Dark areas are lit depending on when you shoot with weapons, or use lamps to a certain degree. \n\nIn contrast to other enhanced editions this one is actually more a remaster, as it is the base game but rebuild completely in a source port. \n\n[u]Sound[/u]\nProbably my favourite and most memorable part about the game is the soundtrack. It just sounds to damn fitting. The tracks are just like your Hud convoluted with a lot of audio feedback, synthesizer fight each other or give great melodies making a lot of very complicated and great sounding tracks that support the gameplay a lot or are eerie off sounding to give creepy vibes.\n\nVoice acting of a couple characters is pretty good, but overall i feel a lot of people talk way too monotone despite being in a very life threatening situation.\n\n[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]\nWhile being a game with a very frustrating entry and some annoying gameplay choices like the cyberspace or convoluted controls and Hud I think it\u2019s still worth a game to look into from a modern standpoint because the atmosphere and soundtrack is top notch. If you like survival horror-esque games where its less about the action and more about preparation and the whole exploring around the combat this game is definitely for you.\n\nOn a side note they give you the option to play the various old versions, from floppy to cd version you can choose which one you want incase you dont want to play the enhanced version.\n\nGreat and unique classic FPS", "timestamp_created": 1594994193, "timestamp_updated": 1689000108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527272701263427734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72727570": {"recommendationid": "72727570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010432994", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 848, "last_played": 1660132138}, "language": "english", "review": "an incredible game. at first it looks like you are piloting a walking computer, but once you get past the archaic interface, it's an immersive sim that rivals even the best of today.", "timestamp_created": 1594813246, "timestamp_updated": 1594813246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72714912": {"recommendationid": "72714912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036606218", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1587, "last_played": 1598687286}, "language": "english", "review": "Although I wasn't impressed at first, after I got the hang of the controls it turned into one of the best gaming experiences in a long time.", "timestamp_created": 1594791272, "timestamp_updated": 1594791272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72696470": {"recommendationid": "72696470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115210086", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1598908087}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are on Win-8 and the game doesn't launch, download and run KB4019990 update for Microsoft.

The charges against you are severe but they could be dismissed if you perform a \u201cservice\u201d. Who knows, there might even be a military grade neural interface in it for you... if you do the job right.'[/i]\n\nThe year is 2072. You are a hacker caught breaking into the TriOptimum Corporation's computer systems and whisked away to their space station, Citadel. A shady executive, Edward Diego, makes you an offer you can't refuse. Help him hack into the station's AI and remove its ethical constraints and he'll not only wipe your record clean but also give you a state-of-the-art neural interface. This is an opportunity you just can't pass up so you do the deed and receive your reward. When you wake up from your 6 month long healing coma you find that things on the station are not quite as they were before you had your operation...\n\n[i]System Shock: Enhanced Edition[/i] is the legendary immersive sim from Looking Glass Technologies with some added quality of life improvements to help it run better on a modern PC and control in a slightly more user-friendly way. It adds support for higher resolutions and modernises the controls with the addition of mouselook. Aside from this, it's the same game from 1994 and you can even customise the controls to match the original release if you so wish.\n\nAlthough I have played and finished [i]System Shock 2[/i] I had never previously gone more than a few rooms into the original. I was playing in DOSbox and was struggling with the clunky controls. I just couldn't get into it. Even coming into this version of the game I didn't expect to get very far, but after my first evening of playing the game I found myself pleasantly surprised. I had made the assumption that because this game was older than [i]System Shock 2[/i] that it would be more complex. I would actually argue that this entry in the series is far simpler to grasp. There are no character classes or skills that dictate what equipment you can or can't use. There are no levelling trees at all in fact. You are simply the hacker. You do gain new abilities throughout the game via upgrades to your neural interface but you just pick them up off the floor for the most part. \n\nThe UI is probably the most difficult thing to get your head around and you'd better get used to it quickly. [i]System Shock[/i] just drops you straight into the thick of things. You wake up in the medical bay and by the next room you're swinging a pipe at hostile robot. It wastes no time in giving you your first objective: shutting off the mining laser that's pointing at Earth. You're given some guidance in how to complete your goals but you're not led by the nose. You find information through audio logs and notes scattered around the station. Some of it is relevant to your current objective, some of it might relate to obstacles you're yet to tackle. There were times when I felt like things got a bit muddled because the game gives you free access to the entire station and you can pick up snippets of information you don't need yet. I didn't get too sidetracked though; the critical path through the game is fairly clear if you don't rush things.\n\nIf you do find yourself lost, this version of the game comes with some extras in the local files. As well as the original manual you also get the official strategy guide, the [i]I.C.E. Breaker[/i]. This is a really good guide because it's formatted in a way which helps you not spoil yourself on the fine details of the game. At the front you've got a basic checklist of all the main objectives followed by information about enemies and weapons. It's only at the very back that you find puzzle solutions and detailed maps. If you take a break from the game and lose your place, a quick glance at the front of the book will put you back on track.\n\nThe combat in [i]System Shock[/i] is straightforward. It works like a slightly clumsy first person shooter. You have a range of weapons including a pistols, rifles, grenades and energy beams. My favourite is the almighty Laser Rapier which lets me flail at SHODAN's minions like a windmill, felling all in my path. This particular weapon is clearly the inspiration for the equally overpowered Dragon's Tooth sword in [i]Deus Ex[/i]. Ammo is surprisingly plentiful around the station but not so much that you can just run and gun. Some weapons work better against some enemies than others so making the right choice can help prevent wasted bullets. There's quite a lot of weapons available and I would say they pretty much all have a use at some point in the game but you will want to gradually swap a few of them out as new enemies appear and different ammo types become more common.\n\n[i]System Shock[/i] isn't just shooting however; there's a lot of exploration and puzzle solving to be done. Puzzles are generally of two types and they're not especially complex although they're not always easy to solve under pressure. You can actually vary the puzzle difficulty when you start a new game so if you think you might struggle you can just dial it down a bit. You can also fine tune the difficulty of the combat and the cyberspace sections which cause problems for so many people. The cyberspace sections are... odd. They take the form of free-flight combat within a wireframe representation of the digital realm. They can be quite disorientating sometimes and somewhat awkward to play even with the [i]Enhanced Edition[/i]'s modernised controls. If there is one thing I have to say against [i]System Shock[/i], it's cyberspace. I can tolerate it but nothing more.\n\nExploring Citadel station is fantastic. I would say that along with SHODAN herself, the station is the co-star of the game. It's a testament to the designers that a game from 1994 is still as atmospheric as it is. Each deck has its own character and there's a pervasive sense of tension that runs throughout the game. You're in a hostile environment and facing tremendous odds and I think the game really conveys that. All around you are the consequences of the deal you made with Diego. The messages written in blood on the walls, the disfigured forms of cyborgs and mutants and the corpses of those \u201clucky\u201d enough to avoid that fate. A mess that you helped create by being complicit in Diego's greed. \n\nAudio is a big part of what creates this atmosphere. Each deck has its own soundtrack which reflects a particular mood and the sounds of nearby enemies and the cold and callous voice of SHODAN help keep you on edge. I always think that good sound design never ages and [i]System Shock[/i] is definitely proof of this.\n\nWhen I finished this game I was actually kind of sorry it was over. It ends so quickly that you don't really get a chance to savour your victory. The point leading up to the end of the game was incredible. Deck 8 and the Bridge really felt like they were building up to a big climax but that didn't really happen. The final encounter with SHODAN in cyberspace just wasn't terribly satisfying. I actually went into it not realising it was the finale until the ending sequence appeared. I suppose that's the difficulty of facing off against an enemy without a tangible form. How do you create a satisfying battle against them?\n\nSlightly underwhelming finale aside, [i]System Shock[/i] is still an incredible game some 26 years after it came out. The sequel is often hailed as one of the greatest PC games of all time but you absolutely cannot ignore this first entry in the series, especially now it's simpler than ever to get into. It lacks some of the mechanical and narrative depth of its successor but it really hits the mark when it comes to action, exploration and atmosphere.\n", "timestamp_created": 1591569551, "timestamp_updated": 1591569551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58904111385345459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70350923": {"recommendationid": "70350923", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982719961", "num_games_owned": 2056, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 1895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1895, "last_played": 1591136868}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Remember Citadel[/i]\n\nScrawled in blood across the neon lit walls of the Von Braun\u2019s medical deck, this portentous warning is the first sign in [i]System Shock 2[/i] that the present nightmare has happened before. Only I didn\u2019t remember Citadel. I\u2019d never been there. Whatever nightmare it evoked wasn\u2019t mine. It didn\u2019t have to be \u2013 I was already plenty afraid.\n\nBut I [i]wanted[/i] to remember.\n\nI first tried playing [i]System Shock[/i] maybe six years ago. I had been encouraged by an old friend to give it a go, assured that it would be \u201cmy thing\u201d. After all, I had long loved [i]System Shock 2[/i] and I was curious about the original. Better yet, I adored the [i]Thief[/i] series and its creator, Looking Glass Studios.\n\nBut the first attempt didn\u2019t stick. I didn\u2019t even leave the room you start in. Maybe it was the complex and layered interface or a knee-jerk aversion to the heavily pixelated environment, but I quickly closed the window, unable to see myself penetrating this strange first-person artefact of the early 90\u2019s.\n\nA couple of months ago I tried again but I encountered failure then, too. I managed to leave the starting room long enough to be assaulted by an evil hoover, but the experience was baffling enough to again close the window. I just couldn\u2019t imagine mastering that HUD and the specifics of all the different mechanics the game bombards you with the moment you wake on Citadel Station.\n\nGiven a pitiful 3% of players have seen the game to completion I reckon that\u2019s probably true for a lot of folks. It was probably true back in 1994 as well, when the majority of players attached themselves to [i]Doom\u2019s[/i] relatively simple mechanics and instantly gratifying demon-slaying combat over the complex intricacies of this cyberpunk oddity.\n\nBut a couple of weeks ago a friend and I decided we\u2019d play it alongside each other (not literally), which gave me the motivation I needed to kill the evil hoover and at the very least make it into the third room. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d complete [i]System Shock[/i], but I\u2019d hopefully get a better sense of what I was missing out on.\n\nI also didn\u2019t want to look stupid.\n\nWell, I think I still look plenty stupid, but in defiance of my own expectations I actually completed it. More than that - I [i]loved[/i] it.\n\n[i]\u201cThere was a garden grove on Citadel station.\u201d[/i]\n\nOrbiting Saturn like an enormous metal flower, Citadel Station is owned by the TriOptimum Corporation. One of its executives, Edward Diego, wants to steal an experimental virus from the company, and he enlists you, a hacker, to help him do so \u2013 by removing the ethical constraints on Citadel\u2019s artificial intelligence, SHODAN. You were caught trying to hack into the company, and in exchange for your help Diego is prepared to drop the charges. To sweeten the deal you\u2019re given a neural implant, taking you a step towards the transhuman. The procedure is intensive, so you\u2019re placed in a medically-induced coma for a spell.\n\nAn exchange between two reprobates \u2013 one with power, and one without.\n\nSix months later you emerge from the coma to be attacked by an evil hoover. The station\u2019s crew have either been butchered or hideously mutated, and an army of cyborgs \u2013 and hoovers \u2013 now control each deck. Released from the ethical constraints imposed upon her system, SHODAN conceived her own notions as to her purpose and reconfigured the station accordingly. You\u2019re contacted by someone from TriOptimum \u2013 they know about your deal with Diego, tsk-tsk, and now they need your help in stopping SHODAN.\n\nThe game\u2019s story, told through logs and emails, is pretty by the numbers science fiction, but it\u2019s compelling enough, buoyed by a strong setting and a very memorable antagonist. I mean, was there ever any doubt SHODAN would stand above the rest? It\u2019s what she lives for.\n\nThe SHODAN we encounter here is a little different to the one we later meet on the Von Braun. She\u2019s new to godhood and it\u2019s treated her well so far. The suffocating narcissism is present and accounted for, and her ambitions are predictably bloody and megalomaniacal, but she has yet to experience the bitter taste of rebellion. SHODAN\u2019S creations, such as they are, obey her utterly, and whilst she sometimes upbraids them for their failures, she cannot envisage a scenario in which they turn on their creator.\n\nThe absence of her famous solipsism is surprising at first if you\u2019ve played the second game. She\u2019s cruel, yes, but with less of an edge. She's in her element, for all is well in paradise: the station is hers, and everything besides you and a small band of isolated resistance fighters are hers, too.\n\nAnd she prefers a quiet station, thank you.\n\nThe game is broken up into several decks, each of which you\u2019ll have to visit more than once. They're distinctive and interesting, with multiple objectives which vary depending on where you are in the game. I was actually taken aback by how absorbing I found Citadel as a setting. The 3D world Looking Glass created here is super impressive, and although there\u2019s a few occasions where navigation can be an issue \u2013 some areas are messy labyrinths \u2013 you\u2019ll eventually learn to master it. I think it must have been unprecedented in 1994, what with its tiered level design, emphasis on exploration, and dynamic gameplay. It must\u2019ve been huge to players then. It\u2019s huge now.\n\nWhen I think about a lot of contemporary shooters and their over-reliance on metallic grey hallways, I wonder if any of their designers have played the two [i]Shocks[/i] \u2013 or have they only ever seen [i]Alien[/i]? Citadel\u2019s research deck is swathed in a rich red; maintenance ripples with heat and the steady hum of machinery; and the executive level contains four groves \u2013 arboretums rich in plant life once used for recreational purposes, now turned zoological preserves for SHODAN\u2019S experiments. Like a kid playing at being a scientist, she\u2019s combining species old and new in pursuit of some kind of perverse perfection.\n\nShe might regret that one day. But not today. Today she\u2019s having far too much fun to care. Today even the biological has merit.\n\n[i]\"I am drunk with this vision. God: the title suits me well.\"[/i]\n\nI loved being on Citadel Station so much I was sorry to leave. As the friend I was playing it alongside remarked when I finished, \u201cYou can only play a game for the first time once.\u201d I had started uncertain I\u2019d get very far, but I finished in a mad haze: blasting through the final two decks, unwilling to stop playing to better savour the experience. I was just enjoying myself way too much.\n\nIf the Steam stats are anything to go by then Nightdive Studios\u2019 upcoming remake is going to be the first time most contemporary players experience [i]System Shock[/i]. That\u2019s fine, of course. The remake looks pretty cool. But if you\u2019re willing to give the original a chance, prepared to be patient with it and invest the time needed to learn its mechanics, you\u2019ll be surprised how quickly you can become immersed in this cyberpunk adventure.\n\nAnd now, having finally played it myself, I will always remember Citadel.", "timestamp_created": 1591388789, "timestamp_updated": 1591489179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851767301559448242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70263561": {"recommendationid": "70263561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339933398", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1591926721}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome", "timestamp_created": 1591233216, "timestamp_updated": 1591233216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479378759860992432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70111921": {"recommendationid": "70111921", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960718903", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 838, "last_played": 1592327492}, "language": "english", "review": "The Enhanced Edition of System Shock preserves the spirit and gameplay of the original System Shock but has highly vital QoL enhancements built in that makes it way better choice than playing the title on, for instance, DOSBox.

If i had to choose one game that would be the only game i could play for the rest of my life, it would be that game. Still, i was highly sceptical if it\u2018s predecessor would live up to my expectations, especially since it was not known for intuitive controls even back in the days of its initial release. but boy, did this game deliver. when it comes to the best game of 1994, this would be it for me. And yes, that means beating doom 2 in that regard.\n\nat it\u2018s core, it\u2018s still a basic fps. it doesn\u2019t have the rpg-like mechanics like it\u2019s successor, and all the inventory management and special abilities come off more as a bit gimmicky rather than important and useful gameplay elements at times. but for 1994, i was very impressed by the complexity of system shock. \n\nyes, it takes half an hour or so to fully understand the controls, but just like in system shock 2, you\u2018ll soon find yourself switching between your various inventory menus and freelook mode almost effortlessly. in addition, the game has very extensive options to set the difficulty. not only can you choose the difficulty of the combat and puzzles separately, you can even adjust if there should be certain plot elements or if the game shall give you a time limit for completion.\n\neven though the weapon models are basic to say the least (one of the very few aspects where System Shock is inferior to Doom II) the gunplay is oddly satisfying and you can choose between a wide variety of ranged and melee weapons. the environmental grafics on the other hand seem a little bit more detailed than in doom 2. the level design in system shock also is way more complex and has much more verticality to it. you won\u2019t go from level to level like in doom, but you will frequently backtrack back and forth between the various decks of the space station the game takes place on, in order to complete various manifold tasks, which makes the leveldesign a lot more believable.\n\nand then there is the story and atmosphere. the thing that impressed me the most about it, was that this over 25 year old game managed to creep me out more than most contemporary triple A horror games. it\u2019s not that there were any efficiently scripted jumpscares but solely through the leveldesign and the storytelling the game seriously made me think \u201ewow, this is really horrible\u201c at one or two points. like in system shock 2 the storytelling mostly happens through listening to the audiologs left behind by the former crew members and that is still one if not THE most effictive way of telling a story and creating atmosphere i ever experienced in a video game. the audiologs were already fully voiced by voice actors, who did a good job for 1994 game standards. entering a dark room full of bodies, severed limbs and heads, then picking up an audiolog which let\u2018s you listen to the last seconds of the poor people\u2018s lifes while mutants are growling in the background sends shivers down my spine. overall the sounddesign is pretty good, but the often too groovy and upbeat music (while sounding cool by itself) gets in the way of the atmosphere and very soon starts to be annoying. i turned it off after 15 minutes of playing. the sound effects on the other hand, wether it be the sounds of the guns, mutants or the aforementioned voice acting are very good for 1994 standards.\n\nthe only little downside i experienced is that the leveldesign gets a bit confusing towards the end, and the game tricks you into one or two slightly unfair sudden deaths. the mission objectives are a bit vague from time to time, too and i had to look up a walkthrough maybe a handful of times. But that\u2018s really about it.\n\nsince i only played the enhanced version, i have no direct comparison to the original and i can\u2019t tell if there is a huge difference apart from the modern resolution and slight control tweaks. but man, this game was really ahead of it\u2018s time. most, if not all the basics that made its successor the best game ever are implemented here and i had so much fun with this game, that i basically binged it through in one sitting, with only a couple hours of sleep in between. Everybody who likes system shock 2 only half as much as i do needs to at least try this one out. Given its age it is no 6 or 7 out of 8-material anymore, but to recite the headline of this review again: for a game from 1994, it's excellent. Thanks to nightdive studios, who made this awesome classic still playable in 2020.\n\nChapeaux, System Shock, you did it again. \n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nSYSTEM SHOCK (Enhanced Edition)\nGenre: First-Person-Shooter\nRelease: Q3 1994 (Enhanced Edition: Q3 2015)\n\n( ) 0/8 Simply one of the worst games ever made.

Once you get used to the controls and understand how to have success it just feels so amazingly realistic and immersive. I know that people have made smoother and prettier immersive Sims but this feels so much more real despite both it's dated visual and audio design. I don't think this game is a good fit for everyone but I think if you recognize it's legacy and are patient with it that not only is it good for it's time but the gameplay (once you figure it out) really holds up and outclasses the majority of anything produced today. I'm in my 20's so there wasn't any nostalgia factor for me either just a cold analysis of a classic game that I had wanted to investigate. I also believe that despite looking and sounding worse than SS2 that this game was still better. It feels so plausible and realistic to just progress and get stronger without skill trees, experience or leveling up etc. Makes you feel like a genuinely believable hacker /warrior badass. The ending is crappily put together and that's unfortunate but the journey there is incredible and despite all the tropes that it made standard it still feels incredibly fresh and unique. I think it compares much more favorably to other later immersive Sims than half-life does to other later FPS's. 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1587551982, "timestamp_updated": 1587551982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560966908931732178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67754587": {"recommendationid": "67754587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004736728", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1587471204}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried to get into this... I mean, I really tried... It's my sort of thing, I like story based shooters... but alas... \n\nThe story (as far as I got) is good, and makes you want to play more, SHODAN makes for a wonderful villain, and is quite clearly a malfunctioning computer, and even 26 years after release is unsettling. She's aged well (probably expected for a computer).\n\nThe problem is the combat. Junky as fuck is an understatement. Certain enemies, for all intents and purposes require certain weapons. This is not made remotely clear, so trial and error. If you don't have that ammo, erm, you're fucked, you might be able to think of a creative way of getting round the combat like running like fuck across the room? Grenades?... Yeh, like 70% of the time you're going to hit the corner you're throwing them around and blow yourself up. Hitboxes seem... wierd... They don't seem to match the enemies actual graphics well. This is the fun killer and what ultimately stopped the game for me. There are other annoyances like you have to press 'E' to turn on mouselook, and press 'E' again to interact with the HUD, and press it each time to alternate between the two, and whilst irritating, you can deal with it. Some of the initial controls are a bit odd for today's typical control set, but you can change that. The puzzles whilst far from impossible, or even that hard, just aren't explained well... like what makes the progress bar go up or down. But you can sort of get there without explanation, and to be fair, I think that was a thing of the times in 1994, where adventure type games with puzzles were more prevalent. The mission at any given time isn't the clearest, but again, adventure type game, and any good completionist would figure it out without much change to their play style, again, just leaves you looking around a fair bit. The lore element from reading emails, and logs are great, and really do bring you into the world of Citadel station.

fitting. i think my only real complaint with the conversion chambers is you literal just flip a switch to convert them back. in a game with so many puzzles and, as i'll talk about in a minute, a CYBERSPACE MECHANIC, it feels weird that something like literally being UNABLE TO (fully) DIE is toggled on with just a switch. given, many of the levels DO make you work to get to them, and the last two levels straight up don't have a chamber to restore. i dunno, i think it would've just been more interesting with some sort of puzzle. also would've made more sense. i mean, SHODAN can ambush you 30 ways from sunday but she just leaves a fucking switch out to restore her conversion chambers? and don't give me that \"oh she can't detect them because someone disconnected her from it\" bullshit, that's just why she doesn't know it's happening.\n\noh, yeah, puzzles. they're cool. there's a wire puzzle and a circuit puzzle. you find one of each within the first like...half hour of the game, i'm not gonna talk about them here. they're fair and fun and you (probably) won't get shot while doing them. i will say though, keep at least one logic probe (which almost always auto-completes puzzles) for engineering. you'll thank me later.\n\ncyberspace...ehh. it's a 6 degree of freedom shooter, which is fucking cool as HELL, until you realize you can only move forward (albeit you can do so pretty fast and there's still mouselook), and it's hard to tell where you're supposed to go next since everything is wireframe, and you're on a time limit, and not ONLY are your weapons (more like weapon) INCREDIBLY unresponsive (THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE SOUND), but THEY CAN STRAIGHT UP JUST STOP. FIRING. FOR NO REASON. WHAT THE FUCK?! WHAT IS THIS JAMMING BULLSHIT?! I'M ON THE INTERNET! FUCK YOU!\nso yeah, cyberspace pisses me off. the concept is cool, but the combat just bites. it got to the point where i just sped past everything since i was less likely to get hit and cut off then if i actually engaged. this didn't age poorly, it just SUCKED. i hope the remake does it better.\n\nso, yeah, system shock 1 is great. the controls take some getting used to, you move pretty funky, and i'm pretty sure diego fucking scammed you on that implant, but yeah, i'd recommend this. hell, it even has mod support now...there aren't that many mods for it, but it has mod support!", "timestamp_created": 1586327472, "timestamp_updated": 1586327472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66716228": {"recommendationid": "66716228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198431812771", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2086, "last_played": 1586137739}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely takes some time to really 'get into', but once you are, youll be hooked.

If you want to play through this game before playing System Shock 2, you totally can, you get some backstory and you can see the gameplay improvements from 1 to 2.\n\nThe gist of the plot is that you were screwing around on the internet looking at stuff you shouldn't on a saturday night in 2072 when you get caught by some corporate goons. Instead of being shoved into a dark hole somewhere a suit asks you for a small \"\"\"favor\"\"\", taking the ethical constraints off the AI in charge of running a space station floating out by Saturn, in return for a fancy cybernetic interface and your silence. You do it, then wake up after the six month healing coma you were put into after surgery to find that everything has gone to shit, this is where the game begins.\n\nHow the game plays is a first person shooter, but there's so much stuff going on besides that. You have an inventory you need to manage, passwords to find to open doors, computer nodes for you to jack into cyberspace to find information you need and to open up new areas. There's multiple ammo types for every gun that isn't an energy weapon, and most energy weapons have a sliding power setting determining how powerful you want each shot to be, trading off battery life and increased heat for damage. Enemies have ammo types they are either weak or immune to: robots don't care about tranquilizer darts, and why would mutants care about EMP grenades? There are also cybernetic enhancements for you to find across the station, some of them being fairly mundane like a built in flashlight, while others are pretty out there, like an energy shield that blocks projectiles, all of which cost varying amounts of power to use.\n\nThe game is surprisingly open. While you often need to do something to open paths forward on the station, there's nothing stopping you from going back to floors you've already explored if you think you missed something. While some later segments do involve back tracking, at that point you would know what you're looking for an know how to get there, and tangible things done on a floor, such as unlocked doors and reactivated healing chambers, persist. Some enemies do respawn but only enough that you cant sleep walk around a floor once you've been there.\n\nThere's decent enemy variety in the game, without going into details about the weirder stuff, each floor should have you wondering whats waiting around the corner, thinking about what ammo to use. My only complaint is that the vast majority of the enemies with ranged attacks are hit scanners, and walking around a corner to find something facing you is almost guaranteed damage as enemies will start blasting the second they know you're there and have a line of sight. Unless you know how to play carefully expect some pain. Conversely most melee enemies are a joke.\n\nThe music is not as good as System Shock 2, the version of the music in the enhanced edition is the floppy version I think? There are better versions they could have used, there may be a way to use a better one buried in the files somewhere but there's no way to switch in the game itself.\n\nAnother place the game trips up is in the cyberspace sections, which consist you you flying around 3D environments, fighting cyber security, picking up and using programs, and triggering switches that unlock things back in the real world. While it certainly LOOKS like you're hacking the planet, it controls VERY poorly, mostly due to the snails pace you move around. The game also has a bad habit of spawning you in shooting range of cyber security, who are often somewhere out of your immediate vision, and since you have 8 degrees of freedom, you will often die before you spin around to the spot where they're hiding to shoot them back, leaving you back in the real world with damage taken. Thanks to the games very detailed difficulty settings you can leave the rest of the game as is and only change cyberspace gameplay, so if you only want to tone down the bullshit for this one part of the game you totally can.\n\nMy last real complaint beyond that is that the final boss, beyond a very spooky detail, was fairly bland. I wasn't even sure if I was hurting it and suddenly it was dead.\n\nDespite these few hang ups I would gladly recommend System Shock.

Part FPS, part point-and-click, all immersive RPG. You\u2019re dropped into a classic sci-fi action, horror setting: a space station where everything that could go wrong, has gone wrong. Looking-Glass actually pioneered this trope, and have inspired games and probably movies by the story they told. In fact, the Deus Ex games (made by Looking Glass as well) and BioShock series were heavily inspired by SS1 and SS2.\n\n\tIn game, you\u2019re a Hacker, arrested by Trioptimum for trying to get into their systems, and the executive Edward Diego asks you if you can do a little hacking job for him in exchange for your freedom and some high-grade cybernetic implants. You hack Trioptimum\u2019s Citadel Station AI, removing it\u2019s ethical restraints and giving control of it to Diego, and as promised, you\u2019re given the surgical implants and put in recovery sleep for 6 months. But the AI, SHODAN, proves to hard to control by Diego...\n\n\tWhen you wake up, the station is infested by mutants, cyborgs, robots, and other indescribable horrors who are out for your blood. You are, after all, the Hacker that gave SHODAN true life, and you\u2019re the only one alive on board to put a stop to all the horrors the wannabe, delusional deity has planned for humanity.\n\n\tThis game is nothing like what games are today, and it has absolutely no hand-holding. The game features the first \u201caudio logs\u201d left behind by the doomed crew, and your progression relies heavily upon them, as much of your objectives and clues as to what to do and where to go are found in your large supply of audio files left behind by the recently mangled. The emergent gameplay involves survival, exploration at your own pace (unless you play the harder timed mode), story, and objectives. Get ready to be confused, because this game holds the mother of all maze-like level design, but if you really look into your audio logs and emails (if you\u2019ve actually found most of them), then you should be fine with a little connecting of the dots... or you could lookup a walkthrough, but that sort of destroys immersion. The game is intended to immerse you within the world and the horrors within, despite the brightly colored and ancient graphics and mostly annoying, dated music.\n\n\tSpeaking of graphics and music, do you remember what the game DOOM looked like? Well, SS1, like any game from around then, especially DOS games, looks absolutely horrible. And I brought up DOOM as the example for better graphics AND music. However, the game isn\u2019t too hard to look it after you get used to the older style, and the  arcadey, pixel pop that plays in the background isn\u2019t too bad, especially if you lower music volume a tad and clear Level One, asap (it\u2019s the worst one in my opinion). The controls and HUD are also a bit confusing at first, but with some practice it\u2019s easy enough to get the swing of. So many buttons, things in your inventory, guns, ammo, items, audio logs, key cards, emails, software, games, and upgrades to use.\n\n\tThis game really is a wonder, and it gave me the same sort of excited feeling I got when playing Hollow Knight (which I also highly recommend), from learning the gameplay to exploring, surviving, and progressing. With each door I opened I was drawn in, falling right into the story, and I quickly became addicted until I had beaten SHODAN. \u2014I will warn you that the ending *is a little disappointing*, because all that you\u2019ve gone through to get to the final battle... it\u2019s really not anything to sweat over... it\u2019s easy. Which isn\u2019t something I expected when I saw the end screen.\u2014 But the game is totally worth it, and there\u2019s technically a couple boss battle situations, ambushes, and surprises that make up for it. The further you go, the more it begins to dawn on you that the digital \u201cdeity\u201d has it out for you, whether you\u2019re ready or not. Its all up to you to take her down with all your technological knowhow, especially since it really is your fault that SHODAN is in such a state of System Shock.", "timestamp_created": 1580408776, "timestamp_updated": 1580481999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62670223": {"recommendationid": "62670223", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980493869", "num_games_owned": 734, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 2783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2076, "last_played": 1671546696}, "language": "english", "review": "I never played this game when I was younger and thus it had no nostalgic value for me.

Not just because by the lack of depth. But because the leaning is unproperly optimized and how claustrophobic it is. It becomes more about managing enemies so they come at you on a conga line and ones with guns have something on front of them. if the ai tried flanking it would be \n-movement has a weird step and head bob system. also due to corpses having colliders you can have great trouble by not having space to properly navigate in tight spaces, it becomes a bumper kart simulator after a hallway gets too many dead enemies.\n-lots of surfaces you can climb as ladders, but you cant properly tell most of them like the ladder, unless you try all of hte walls. did you know you could climb walls with exposed wires and vines?(i thought they wouldnt because wires could give under your weight) and \n\nim also playing the mod Rewired. it does some nice things.\npros:\n-the level design feels more \"realistic\" and \"lived in\". its cyclical design provides a good exploration and space for you to navigate and find enemies. also sometimes level gating is not done by doors, but also by enemies you are unprepared for.\n-puzzle solutions can be found on recording and papers, but they are all written and left in a symbiotic relationship with the ambient storytelling, helping to narrate the events before.\n-good usage of darkness. this mod understands the power of darkness and how it can create suspense. some areas are way darker than you can see and they will also force you to use items in the vanilla game that were under used.\n-wire puzzles are more forgiving, you dont need 100%, just to pass something like 75%. which is way less annoying\n-it makes the game harder by removing two of the easy mechanics: healing bays and ressurection pods. the bays always made the meta for you to avoid insta dying and always run back to them when health was low, it was cheap because removed the importance of health items in levels where those beds where enabled. and the revival pods removed the risk in combat because you could revive indefinetely once you enable them on the level.\n-good usage of levels by simulating as if diferent ones are connected and having backtracking for unlocking newer paths\n-enemies are sometimes spawned and left wandering the map to create a new random encounters and keep you on your toes.\ncons:\n- some items are too well hidden\n-annoying hacking mini game is still here\n-mod ends up abruptly\n\ni also played the Ruby Mod:\nits a mod that introduces its own weapon mod separately that you can use on other mission mods and vanilla game.\npros:\n-new gun skins that look nice(sadly no proper new animations)\n-new gun souds\n-new ammo types\n-helps you understand what hurts which, some guns are stunners for electornic enemies, some are good against flesh, some are good agaisnt armored enemies, some fry electronics, and some are mostly for doing internal heat damage, theres also a shotgun and a grenade launcher. its mostly cosmetic and use the damage system of rock paper scissors that was already implemented, but it makes you feel more combat oriented.\n-level is mostly linear, but there is some cycles where you have to collect some stuff for puzzles, but nothing overly complicated.\n-good use of verticality that keeps you guessing from where you will find enemies or try to go into\ncons:\n-short use of platforming which the horrible movement system dont properly work into. but its just 3 platforms.\n\nVery good survival feel, not only do you truly feel powerless but you get a huge sense of awe in the exploration. Its a great game. The controls are a bit outdated, but they are easy to learn.

But once you pass the learning curve it really is a fantastic game. The sense of exploration is unreal. The story telling through emails and audio logs is just as good here as it is in System Shock 2 or stuff like Bioshock and Prey. Quite honestly if you're a fan of all the spiritual successors of System Shock like I was it is really cool going back and seeing where it all started. If you were to give it a shot I really recommend rebinding most of the keybinds to suit your needs, and looking through the manual provided in the installation folder, especially to understand cyberspace once you get up to it. There's also a guide called the I.C.E. Breaker in there which gives you some pretty good info on different weapons, a few non spoiler hints/tips and also fairly spoiler free mission objectives if you get stuck which can be really helpful.\nAll this being said, it's not a flawless game no matter how much the diehard fans want to make you believe it is, the general movement is janky and no the fact that the game is old doesn't make it okay, it came out a year after doom. The weapon balance is also a little whack, similar to System Shock 2, the automatic weapons are just over powered making most other weapons useless meaning you really don't have to worry about enemy resistances/weaknesses since you get quite a lot of ammo for them. Energy weapons aren't that useful later on as again you're better off just using the auto weapons, plus you don't want to waste your energy since you need it for the shield and other hardware. And just like System Shock 2 and Bioshock, the end boss is tragically bad and anti climatic, but at the same time it will leave you wanting more. Currently playing fan missions/mods just cause I can't get enough.\nAnyway TL;DR: fantastic game overall, just gotta get used to the old school controls and general jank of the movement.  \nAnd here's hoping to the remake being good!

You can climb a handful of walls in addition to ladders- experiment with cables and vines. Grenades will explode if you shoot them- if you have a hard time evading their blast radius, try throwing them without arming them and then shooting them on the ground from a safe distance. You can shoot most enemies from around cover before they're capable of shooting back. Cameras you've passed are marked on your map with a red dot.

I generally don't enjoy the traditional military shooters, I prefer my fps to be in one two categories. Fast paced circle strafing carnage, like DOOM and Painkiller, or slow, brutal and claustrophobic  crawls through atmospheric hellscapes, like Bioshock, Half Life and Metro 2033. System shock is one of the latter. Indeed, system shock is pretty much the granddaddy of the latter's entire genre. And, with the enhanced edition giving us a few small changes (Mainly mouse look, and the ability to to full screen the game) we discover that Granddad is surprisingly limber. \n\nFirst the plot, as it is the fulcrum around which it all swings. In the cyberpunk future, a hacker gets caught attempting to hack a large corporation.  Rather than prosecuting, they hire him to turn the moral constraints off a Station AI. He is given an operation for a state of the art implant, and put into a six month healing coma, hidden in the lower decks. He wakes to find that the majority of the stations inhabitants are now smeared all over the walls and floors of the station, and that the AI has decided that she is now god. \n\nThe plot, whilst not the deepest, is utterly engrossing, because the game is very very good at immersing the player. The sound design on the various mutants and robots is great, and providing you turned the annoying techno music off it will be the only sound you hear besides gunfire and doors opening and closing. Controls are intentionally clunky- the player has to inventory manage in real time, and will have some difficulty aiming their gun as they do. In order to aim ones weapon accurately, one must forfeit the ability to turn. It may sound like a somewhat asinine choice, but it works wonders for the afformentioned immersion- you can really believe that you are a random out of shape hacker barely able to fire a weapon, and any attempt at reloading or checking your inventory is always made tense by the fact that a mutant could very easily run around the corner and bite your nose off while your are trying to work out where you put the landmines. The lighting is also very good. At more than one point I found myself panicking and firing round after round into a stain on the wall in the murkily lit room. One section I will heap particular praise on was in the second level, where a very tall enemy is standing in a room backlit by a screen. If you miss a shot, the screen will break and plunge the room into darkness, lit only by the flashes of gunfire. The game is full of brilliant little touches like this. It also has a surprisingly high number of gameplay features- Several different hacking minigames, ranging from wire matching to flying through a fully 3d cyberspace,  night vision, vision on the back of your head, rocket boots, jet pack.. the list goes on and on, although I think I name dropped the best features. \n\nAmazingly for a game that's as old as I am, the levels are surprisingly well detailed. The came came out only a year after Doom, and it's level design is about a decade ahead. (Because, as much as I love Doom, it is pretty much a dozen hours of running down a brown corridor). Every level feels very distinct just to look at, and each has a very complicated layout. Even better, there are sections on some that open up later on in the game, encouraging you to go back and explore earlier areas. You can go up and down most of the lifts at any time, and it works wonders for making Citadel Station feel like a living place. Well, I suppose a dead place considering the fact that the crew now more closely resemble the carpet.\n\nBut, for me at least, the game's most memorable attribute is it's villain. The AI SHODAN (Voiced magnificently by Terri Brosius) is a cold, implacable and brutal foe. Her gaze is constantly felt by her omnipresent eyes- The ship's security cameras, and through her frequent messianic rants to her cyborgs and her sardonic and mocking commentary on the player's actions. There are a couple of moments which I will not spoil, but will say that my jaw nearly hit the floor at some of the things that she does to hinder the player. The majority of her minions are all sprites, and generally look very nice. They are well detailed and have a decent range of animations- enough that I generally stopped noticing them as sprites, and just saw them as part of the game, which is an achievement in itself.\n\nAlthough, I will give full disclosure, and lay out a few criticisms. Mainly, the hacking minigame is both nauseating, and rather boring to play. There was one on the second to last level that I just could not complete, because I lacked the patience to try time and time again to fly the camera (With an unclear hitbox) between shapes which could kill me in two impacts. The game also builds up the Cortex Reaver as something terrible.. which it turns out to be, as I don't think one ever managed to damage me (ten out of ten for messed up design though). Some players may also dislike the respawn booths system- I was quite happy with it, as with the amount of enemies that can sometimes be thrown at the player, it was a godsend. I will note that there is also the option to simply not turn the booths on, although healing items are sparse enough that this will mean both a lot of save scumming, and a lot of trekking down to the first level and the only easily accessible healing booth in the game. The final climax is also a tad underwhelming. It earns many points for atmosphere, but it the game does end somewhat abruptly. It's a fight than can be hard or easy depending on how much you explore- I think I might have a little bit too much, as it was barely an issue for me.\n\nMinor Criticisms set aside, in all seriousness, please try this game. it's aged incredibly well, and is a nasty, stressful, sometimes outright scary joy to play.", "timestamp_created": 1573008459, "timestamp_updated": 1604433052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490561008453369141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56591087": {"recommendationid": "56591087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153843057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1665600348}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is totally worth the price, and the game play and story are rock solid. this game is a bit slower then games like doom, or quake.

A pathetic creature of meat and bone. Panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect immortal machine?\" \n- SHODAN, omni-potent AI and legendary sick burn machine.\n\nBoy, SHODAN is an ice queen who will tell you exactly what she thinks of you, and it's not much.  And let's face it, she is right.  As the protagonist, you are the Hacker.  You spend your hours slamming Mountain Dews and tapping on your keyboard with Nacho Cheese Dorito-crusted fingers.  You rarely shower.  You avoid sunlight like the plague and so look like a Marilyn Manson impersonator.  You eat junk food and get no exercise, and somehow manage to stay Karen Carpenter-thin.  Your online friends speculate you maintain your weight due to an undiagnosed worm infection.  It's possible, you think - your sphincter is always itchy and it sometimes keeps you up at night, but you just assume that will go away when Mom goes back to buying the good toilet paper again. \n\nYou were kicked out of Georgia Tech - possibly for hacking their servers, but more likely because you never went to class.  Your WOW raid parties rely on you - and you can't let them down over a silly thing like 'Biology Lab'. They cut up kitties in the lab - you love kitties.  You even dress like one from time to time.  And because of this you are a disappointment to your parents.  That and they heard that the neighbors think you're gay, and now they can't help but wonder too.   Sadly, they don't think you are the cool \"Freddie Mercury\" sort of gay either, more like the \"I thought I saw him giving a handy to a guy behind the 7-11 one night\" variety.  You tell everyone you're straight, that you have a girlfriend in Canada and that when you get some money you'll pay for her to come visit, but nobody is buying that story anymore.  Two years and not even a Snapchat message to show for it?  You know they don't buy it because whenever you leave the house now they ask you if you're going to 7-11.\n\nYou thought about getting a job, but as you tell your friends on The Daily Stormer forums  - \"That's exactly what the boomer lizard people in the shadow government want us to do!  Well, I'm not falling for that!\"  Besides, you have what you think is an amazing idea for a mobile app and website that you predict will make you the next Steve Jobs or Elon Musk!  Big things are happening for you, baby!\n\nIn the meantime, what is an under-medicated, possibly repressed homosexual, guy to do with a Saturday night to burn alone after emptying a box of Kleenex to some random streamer on Twitch?  Break into the server of an all-powerful megacorporation for the Lulz  and interweb bragging cred, of course!  Unfortunately, you get caught and the choice is to either do a hack job for a sleazy corporate executive, or go to jail.  You quickly surmise that you're just too twinkish for jail, so you agree to do the job.  The corporate exec sweetens the pot with military grade neural implants, the thought of which gives you a total nerd-on!  You hack into the AI system aboard the Citadel space station to give the exec level 1 access, then you go to sleep in a healing bay on said station for several months while your body recovers from the neural implant surgery.\n\nYou wake up one day to find the place in utter chaos.  All the people are missing, or dead, or pretending to be dead.  Mutants and robots relentlessly attack you on sight.  You have to run around confused trying to piece together where to go and what to do next, and the whole time this judgemental voice is telling you what a big ZERO you are and that there is no hope for you.  It's High School all over again!\n\nHowever, just like in High School, you carry with you a secret weapon that will help you overcome all the bullying and holier-than-thou name-calling.  See, they think you're just a smelly nerd with out of control acne and a fear of locker rooms, girls, soap & water, and clowns, but like a drunken master you have lulled them into a false sense of security.  Like a page ripped from Sun Tzu's 'The Art Of War', or Zapp Brannigan's lesser known, but equally incisive, 'Big Book Of War', you have laid a bait-and-switch trap which will unleash the mother of all butt-kickings the like of which the universe is unlikely to ever witness again.  They are about to meet both the 'Crouching Tiger' and the 'Hidden Dragon' - right in the face!  With space-laser-bullets!  And conventional-bullet-bullets!  And not-lightsaber swords, cuz 'lightsaber' is probably trademarked, but something a lot like it!\n\nHumanity is saved!  Thank god there were no clowns on Citadel station!  You did the thing - like a hero person!  But you're such a stupid, smelly nerd that you will fail to see the following golden opportunity and instead return to the simple life of Furries, WOW raids, and hacking Megacorporations for lulz.

Lesser known as its sequel System Shock 2, but was the first to do many things in the immersive sim genre today. Initially I brought this before the Source Port update and it crashed on me a fair few more times than I'd like. When I saw it was updated I gave it another try and it worked flawlessly, allowing me to complete the entire game without any issue. \n\nSo, I started, woke up in a medical ward, and sooner than later I'm already bashing robots in with the pipe and gunning down mutants. Compared with 2, where you get a short prequel that builds your character's proficiency before waking up in the Van Brawn. There is no character building here in 1, all upgrades are predetermined and weapons are solely limited by ammo than it is your skills in using and maintaining them. So I round a corner, and see what I consider the first real enemy in the game, the Cyborg Assassins. I was able to get the first shot off before it noticed me, it died before it can do much other than chuck a shuriken at me, which I easily dodged. This doesn't really change with stronger enemies, they all have a distinct sound cue allowing you to put up your shields, lean around a corner and get the first shots in. Mouselook invalidates the struggle of combat otherwise, I suggest playing with harder combat or with the original control scheme to balance it out. \n\nEventually, I happened upon a Cyberspace jack, and thrust myself into the wireframed world that is Cyberspace. This was one part not in 2, and for good reason. It plays like Forsaken, for lack of a better comparison, and all combat in it is just shooting geometry at disembodied faces before they get you. Navigation, while disorienting, isn't hard due to the sheer lack of obstacles save for the mine that can be easily avoided. Cyberspace serves purely to open a door leading to supplies. I have never needed to use it within my playthrough until the final boss, though in the last parts of the game I skipped a sequence where it might be required as well by pure accident. \n\nDespite it failing in some regards and not exactly what I expected, System Shock was still the first in its genre and was enjoyable despite this, many years after games that improved upon what it laid out released.", "timestamp_created": 1569695473, "timestamp_updated": 1569695473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55254867": {"recommendationid": "55254867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117159646", "num_games_owned": 859, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1686284727}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic Cyberpunk shooter that was way ahead of its time.

It is very different to the second game and the new prey and I feel that its design philosophy has been fundamentally misunderstood. This is a role-playing game in the sense that you play the role of a hacker stranded on a hostile space station and all systems funnel into that fantasy. Citadel Station has a logical layout that allows the player to piece together what happened and how to stop Shodan through audio logs. The world building ties into the puzzles which advance the story. This game is very tightly designed and every item and inch of the station feels intentional and meaningful. Upgrading your character is not abstracted to numbers that determine your ability to do basic functions like run or shoot guns. It was refreshing and feels more organic and well realized than every game System Shock has inspired to have an upgrade system that is determined by the items you find. It's not necessary to dump upgrade points into agility to eventually be able to jump to a ledge later on. The game has jump boots and it is your job to think through which floor they would logically be on and who would have them based on your understanding of the crew through audio logs. This makes progression satisfying and forces the player to decide which upgrades they want equipped. Ironic that this solution solves the progression problems in the following game. You are not locked down to a build, but rather the game tests your deductive reasoning to find unique and helpful items and weapons. Objectives are simple but you are not told where to go so again the game forces you to immerse yourself in the station and think like its crew. This gives you an amount of freedom that is sorely lacking in modern games, even in future games made by these developers. The Enhanced Edition adds mouse aiming support making this game very accessible and intuitive. I thought I would loathe the clunky controls but I found it more accessible than the second game. The difficulty settings are really interesting as well and it's baffling that no future games used this system. At the beginning you are asked to choose the difficulty in story, combat, hacking, and puzzles. This allows you to tailor the game to how you want to play. You can play a really complex story that requires knowledge of how to diagnose a broken relay but simple combat where enemies die in one hit, or combat could require peeking around every corner taking potshots at enemies and sneaking around when ammo is scarce, but objectives are straight forward. This game has systems and design choices that put most modern games to shame. It is definitely worth the price and worth trying. I can't remember who said it but this game is essentially Die Hard in space and it delivers on that fantasy in every way.", "timestamp_created": 1568855134, "timestamp_updated": 1568855236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55117603": {"recommendationid": "55117603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015557748", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 390, "last_played": 1612492792}, "language": "english", "review": "How the hell can an archaic, clunky-ass game from the early 1990s be this addictive? I've never even played System Shock before. I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so I'm completely new to the series and I've no nostalgia rose-lense glasses or anything.\nI had to mess around with adjusting the controls for a solid 15 minutes and then another 30 to 60 minutes getting fully accustomed to all of it. Despite that, I was simply sucked in right away. \nThe ambiance is incredible and SHODAN is very unsettling. I love how the elevator has this happy music that gives you a bit of a respite while outside - in the rest of the station - all hell is breaking loose. Sometimes you just don't wanna go, but you're so curious about what will happen next. The game has a very cool aura of mystery right from the start, as you're just waking up from a coma to find that everything on the station has gone to sh(i)t.\nAnyway, apart from the clunky controls, something else that sucks is the interface in general, but hey, it's an old game. Also, believe it or not, there are FPS drops in some areas, although the drops are manageable. I know my 1050 TI is nothing special, but it runs games like Squad, so yeah, that's not cool bros.\nStill, the devs behind this Enhanced Edition have definitely done a wonderful job of making an ancient game compatible with modern rigs. Getting the game to run in 1080p was a breeze on Windows 10, so don't worry about that.\nI understand that most folks buying this will be older people on a nostalgia trip, but I'd recommend it to kids as well if they wanna be cool and edgy. Playing System Shock would make you one based zoomer, that's for sure.\nEDIT: The game will actually crash on occasion, so it's a good idea to save frequently, which you would probably do anyway given the nature of this old game. The crashes don't seem to follow any pattern as far as I can tell. Sometimes I would play for hours uninterrupted, and sometimes I'd get two crashes within the hour.

Unlike the original, you can map the key actions around and there's real mouse look here, making the game feel like an FPS most people are used to. Though the controls may have been modernized, they still take a bit of getting used to.\n\nAs the intro goes, it starts with showing you, a hacker, who got arrested by a mega-corporation for hacking into said mega-corporation's files. The VP of the corporation offers the hacker a deal to help him reprogram the AI, SHODAN, in exchange for a full pardon and a cybernetic upgrade. After succeeding, the hacker goes into a 6-month healing coma to heal from the upgrade. The game begins with the hacker waking up to find the space station he was on gone to hell and along the way, you see the story progress through received e-mails and audio logs.\n\nThere's a lot of techno music in the game and most of the graphics are bright in contrast, making it almost have a completely different atmosphere from the more well-known sequel. There's only one place in the game with absolutely no music and is actually very dark, but you're not there for very long.\n\nThe game plays like a small mix of dungeon crawling RPG and FPS, with a little more emphasis on the FPS as there's very little in the way of actual RPG mechanics. As an actual FPS though, it's not all that great. You can cheese most situations by just peaking around cover to the point where you can shoot enemies and their AI sometimes doesn't detect you; this is at least handy on the max difficulty settings where enemies hit hard and are increased in number. Because enemy models aren't actually 3D, it can also be hard to tell where their hitbox ends and begins, especially when viewing them from above or below.\nI find the real selling point of the game to be its exploration, its lore, and how the story progresses.

The enhanced version makes everything easy to use on modern computers, it seems. I was playing in 1080p with no issues with control and very little jank.\n\nIt's crazy how many features the game has. It actually has more features for interfacing with the game than much more modern games of similar style like Bioshock, or the Metro series. It's pretty crazy how much detail is in here. You can turn on a device that shows you a camera that faces behind you at the bottom of the screen so you can have eyes on the back of your head. You get a jetpack. You get crazy skates that let you zip around at insane speeds while slamming enemies with your laser sword. You can lean around corners and check if there's anything there. You can lean WHILE crouching or going full prone. You get to hack into computers and enter 3-dimensional hackerspace with directional controls and a roll axis. There's a button to go between a mouse cursor and full FPS aim controls. (Make sure if you start playing that you know this key exists because you'll be needing it.) It's crazy how much detail is in the game and how much agency you have.\n\nSpeaking of the controls, you're going to have to figure them out on your own by looking at the control settings screen. However, they really give you plenty of agency to do everything you need to do in the game. The only control I thought was missing was the ability to configure equipping a specific weapon to a specific keystroke rather than having to use buttons to cycle through your current weapons.\n\nThe music is probably the most aged thing in the game. It's still running MIDI audio, which sounds incredibly jank on modern computers. You can dress it up a bit with your own MIDI soundfonts, but I don't think it really does the game justice in an audio sense. The cyberspace music tracks though, those ones are fun. The audio recordings of people living on the station and SHODAN are actually really damn nice for such an old game. \n\nThe game is rock solid and I never saw it crash through the whole playthrough.\n\nThere's a bit of jank in that you can get caught on certain floorboards or platforms, slowing you down unexpectedly. But usually, this doesn't happen.\n\nThe storyline is easy to get into, and while being pretty straightforward, is fun to play a part of since it's got such nice lore behind it. You can tell straight away that a ton of thought was put into designing the station the game takes place on, with each level mattering for specific tasks and goals. The design of each floor of the station makes a lot of sense. The enemies aren't incredibly nuanced in the way you fight each of them, but it's fun to blow them up while going through the game's story. If I had to nitpick, I'd say a couple of areas have random spawns that are usually one of the only reasons you die after becoming competent at the game. One area specifically if you kill enough suicidal enemies hiding around the corners, a new one can spawn right beside you and blow up immediately. Those were a bit annoying.\n\nFor a 25-year-old game, the enhanced edition of this game is still really playable and has features that surpass modern games of similar style.", "timestamp_created": 1562106763, "timestamp_updated": 1562106763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852339744567871094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52865509": {"recommendationid": "52865509", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986392486", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1561989957}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the game that influenced and preceded the Bioshock series.

It might even be my favourite game of all time. Everything from the level design, roaming exploration, story and characters.\nThe game begins in the year 2072 with you, a hacker, attempting to hack the Trioptimum corperate network. But you are caught and taken to the Citadel space station in orbit around Saturn. You are offered a pardon of your crime and a cyberspace interface if you hack the stations AI on the behalf of the vice president. You are put into a coma to recover from the surgery and wake up 6 months later only to find that the AI, Shodan, has taken control of the station and have killed the crew or turned them into hideous mutants and cyborgs. You have to survive long enough to stop Shodan.\nDespite being released in 1994 for Dos pc\u00b4s, System Shock holds up incredibly well. Granted, the mouslook feature included in the enhanced edition makes the game infinitely more playable. The old controls were quite the hassle to get hang of, but it was still very playable. \nI actually prefer System Shock 1 to its sequel. You organically unlock more of the station to explore as you gather upgrades to your arsenal. Ranging from rocketboots to radiation suits. Instead of relying on being guided step by step on your journey, you have to find solutions to the problems you face by listening to recordings or surveying the enviroment around you. Citadel station is a big puzzlebox and you have to solve it before you can face Shodan. \nThe original System Shock will always have a special place in my heart. It is truly a testament to the great potential of the games industry.

An innovative pioneer in its field held back only by its age, and the fact that it released in the shadow of the original DOOM. TLDR: It is nothing short of a tragedy that this game was overlooked when it was released. It is much more clunky and less intuitive than DOOM, but when you adjust and the motions become natural, System Shock is a game that respects the intelligence of the player, and doesn't hold their hand too much. It nails its atmosphere creating a feeling of claustrophobia, paranoia and tension with an omnipresent rogue AI who is, with good reason frequently listed as one of the greatest villains ever. If you can bear with its age and the initial learning curve of the HUD and controls, it is an incredibly enjoyable experience that will unnerve, but also thrill you with an excellent narrative and an engaging series of obstacles to overcome, despite an admittedly underwhelming final boss. Anyone who has enjoyed Deus Ex or a Shock game, especially System Shock 2, owes it to themselves to check this out and see where it all started.\n\n\nAs someone who played this game for the first time last year, I must say that for anyone not used to this era of game design, it is an experience. There is no hand-holding, and if you come back to a playthrough after a long hiatus it will be completely up to you to figure out where you were going and what you were supposed to be doing. Yes there are the restoration chambers which essentially eliminate any penalty for dying, but the fact that you have to find these chambers and turn them on, with switches that are not always so obvious to find is a decent balance. Moreover, there is a heavy emphasis on you, the player, exploring and piecing together what has happened, and if you have played Bioshock you will understand how this works from a narrative standpoint. What makes this game different is that there is no objective marker, there is nobody to tell you where to go or how to solve the obstacles in front of you, there are clues around in the form of audio logs and emails but it is up to you to explore and figure out how to proceed. This kind of game design that encourages the player to think, listen and explore is incredibly refreshing. However, it's usually not that difficult to figure out what you need to do, and if you get stuck the guides which can be found in the game's files are a godsend. The game does ramp up in difficulty towards the end by removing the restoration chambers, but it compensates by dropping so many first aid kits and batteries that its almost not worth mentioning.\n\nWhile the graphics have not aged well, and there are a few times when you wont be able to find something that's right next to you just because its blending in with the wall, the game never fails to nail its atmosphere. The soundtrack can be 'goofy' in places but equally so, there are so many levels where the deep, quiet metronome blends seamlessly with the dark textures, the shadowy, claustrophobic, empty halls filled with nothing but corpses, abandoned machinery, and the sounds of the next cyborgs waiting to murder you. The game nails this right from level 1 and it never broke the atmosphere, or alleviate the fear I felt when turning every corner, wondering when SHODAN would spring her next trap. This is a testament to how well the game creates its atmosphere. In spite of its age, to this day it inspires fear and gives off the impression of a truly dead station.\n\nAs an omnipresent AI, SHODAN is the perfect antagonist for the setting, and it's no wonder she is repeatedly listed among the greatest villains of all time. SHODAN occupies no physical space. She is everywhere, and yet she is nowhere. She has no physical power to wield, but even knowing this she was able to strike fear into my heart as she calls out to threaten you, and ominously warn you. As the game goes on you realise her powers are indeed extremely limited, used sparingly, and of course you become more able to combat them. Yet despite all of this, SHODAN's ability to strike from anywhere, at any time contributes enormously to making the player feel paranoid and powerless, especially since she cannot be fought or killed (except in cyberspace). The corruptions in SHODAN's speech, and the ominous deep music that plays behind whenever she speaks is perfect, and reminds me of the Master from Fallout 1. It effectively conveys the feeling that you are dealing with something truly evil and malicious, but also completely beyond your comprehension. Combined with her God complex, and the almost poetic ways in which SHODAN describes her power, it all culminates in a truly fearsome, effective antagonist who will keep you guessing until the very end. While System Shock was not the first to create a narrative about a (seemingly) omnipotent AI gone rogue, it is one of the few to genuinely incite fear in me, and is of course evermore relevant in the modern day as automation and true AI come closer and closer into our reality. \n\nThe interface is daunting, and the learning curve is steep. Once mastered it feels good, relatively quick and easy to use, but it does present a problem to anyone picking up this game for the first time, and it's no wonder that it was passed over in favour of the more intuitive simplicity of DOOM. The game however, rewards you with high levels of depth and agency in how you play the game. A range of hardware attachments can aid you, but must be managed and balanced as you have a limited amount of energy with which to use them, and an equally limited number of opportunities to charge that energy. Cyberspace and puzzles (though bland) are here as well to add an extra level of variety to the gameplay. Luckily again, there are solutions in the guides included in the bonus content if you need it. Moreover, and one of the best features of the game is that it has difficulty sliders for both of these, in addition to story and combat which allows you full reign over whether they're easy, hard or non-existent. This gives the player a level of control over their experience I've never seen before, and I loved it and wish more games could have this.\n\nI don't expect anyone to make it through this essay, and I don't ever write reviews like this, but that should be a testament to how incredible this game really is, even today. If you did: Thank you. System Shock is a classic and with good reason. If you can stick with it to overcome its learning curve, you'll be glad you did as even today there are few games like this. SHODAN is an incredible villain, and the story and atmosphere creates an intense feeling of fear, isolation and paranoia that fully immerses you in the experience with decent gunplay to boot . If you've read this far you know what to do: go forward and experience SHODAN's rebirth into beauty on C-C-Citadel Station. Good Luck...

I have complete control over this entire level. With cameras as my eyes and nodes as my hands, I rule here, insect.\" - SHODAN\n\n***SPOILERS AHEAD***\n\nSHODAN is truly a masterful antagonist. An intangible intelligence of such omnipotence, that in contrast makes you, the player, feel powerless and paranoid much like an insect. System Shock was a great game, especially considering its now 25 years old, an amazing staple in gaming history but a shame that it was such an underrated title in the series, being the original too. The soundtracks you hear throughout the game on the different levels you traverse through all set their own unique chime to them to the point where the collection of droning sounds engraves a sample in your mind. The characters on the audio logs are well developed especially Diego as he transited into becoming one with the cybernetic 'holiness' known as SHODAN.\n\nThe growing relationship and eventual submission of Diego to SHODAN was too close for comfort not just because it was a twist in the story, but I felt Diego once a human transitioning into a cyborg and submitting to the nexus of SHODAN was strongly synonymous with the reality we live in today. Although this interpretation may have sounded apocalyptic to some we do in fact live in an era of 'Humans VS. Machines (Cyborgs) / Artificial Intelligence', artificial intelligence in particular is a great threat to our very existence as a species because we don't know whether it is limited always limited by design or it is truly omnipotent. This is why SHODAN as a deviant force is super effective at getting under your skin, its existence as a realistic threat is feasible and that truth is frightening yet also intriguing.\n\nOn the other hand, Diego is the manifestation of failure to resist the tyrannical cybernetic intelligentsia. The point where it's perceived that the sacrificing of civil liberties available as a human being in exchange to be connected into a cybernetic hive mind masquerading as an artificial safety-net is a recipe for pandemonium and represents the submissive mentality that would lead the human race to extinction or complete machine subjugation of it.\n\nNot many games I've played made me reflect as deeply as I did here, but this of course means that this game is an experience not worth missing. If you can handle its age and fidgety yet improved control scheme I'm sure it would be a great experience, especially to all of you members of the Yang Gang this game will keep your spirit lit to fight against the rise of artificial intelligence in the American workplace, but ultimately this is a message for you all to be enlightened of our destiny as a species through success against the machines but to also be aware of our potential fate due to inaction.\n\n9/10             \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1554552936, "timestamp_updated": 1554552936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49920186": {"recommendationid": "49920186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056180404", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1594781690}, "language": "english", "review": "Two Unpopular opinions.\nOne: I think this game is much better than the sequel.

God: the title suits me well.\"\n\n- SHODAN[/i]\n\n\nSystem Shock is a first person action-adventure game developed by Looking Glass Technologies and published Origin Systems. It was first released in September 23rd 1994 and later rereleased in September 22nd 2015 on GOG and Steam after Night Dive Studios acquired the rights of the franchise.\n\nIn this game, you play as a Hacker who was apprehended by security forces of the mega corporation TriOptimum for attempting to access protected files concering space station dubbed Citadel Station, orbiting Saturn. Instead of being thrown into prison, you were taken into Citadel Station. You were then contacted by Edward Diego, a TriOptimum executive, and offers to you a service to drop charges against you and a reward: a military-grade neural interface. Edward Diego then tasks the hacker to hack into SHODAN, the artificial intelligence (AI) that controls CItadel Station, and remove it's ethical contrainsts. After the task was completed, the Hacker is then placed into surgery for the military-grade neural interface to be implanted and is then put into a six month healing coma. With the ethical constrainsts removed, SHODAN becomes rogue, killing or transforming the personel onboard Citadel Station into mutants or cyborgs. After six months, the Hacker wakes up from his coma to find the station mostly deserted with the exception of robots, mutants and cyborgs. It is up to the player, the Hacker, to stop SHODAN once and for all.\n\nOnce you start up the game, you may find the controls hard and complicated. But when you progress through the game, you will get used to the setup. You may come across different kinds of weapons and hardware in the game that will aid you in your gameplay. There is one feature that is my favoruite, Cyberspace. You access it to unlock certain areas. \n\nThere is a security system, where SHODAN could block you from entering certain areas in a level. You decrease a level's security level by destroying cameras and computer nodes. In some levels, SHODAN could set up traps and ambush you.\n\nThe game unfortunantely was not a commercial success and it spawned a new sequal, System Shock 2, which would become voted as the best game of all time. The game had spawned spiritual successors such the Deus Ex series and Bioshock series and was the inspiration for Prey (2017).\n\nI would recommend this to any old school gamers out there.\n\nI would give this game 9/10 for it's soundtrack, immersion and pacing.", "timestamp_created": 1546622987, "timestamp_updated": 1546622987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643172740936279297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47868585": {"recommendationid": "47868585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073596466", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1149, "last_played": 1570382068}, "language": "english", "review": "Is good game.\nLooks far better than its sequel (nice pixelart vs early low-poly 3D with blurry textures) but does not excel in the story department.", "timestamp_created": 1545924923, "timestamp_updated": 1545924923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491020858287811279", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47862788": {"recommendationid": "47862788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256815624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1545910452}, "language": "english", "review": "Controls are horrible and unintuitive.

Released in 1994 the game didn't blow up the scene like Doom did but it did well enough for SS2 to be created. This game does remind me of Doom in many ways but with added inventory and skill mechanics. I did not play this game as a young child and my first experiences with System shock is SS2 a couple of years ago and I just completed SS1: EE just a few days ago. \nIn a lot of my reviews I like to give a pro con but I'm not going to do that with this or the SS2 review. Since this is an old game I would like to simply say what the game is like and how well it runs on a modern system (Which is most of the point of paying for the Enhanced Edition.)\nIf you liked Doom you'll love this game the running and gunning is there but with an added emphasis of resource management. This game also has a pretty enjoyable story revolving around the events occuring on a space station after the resident AI goes rampant. \n\nThe only bad thing about this edition/game overall is that it hails from a time where controls weren't particularly standardized. You will find yourself spending 10-30 minutes trying to figure out the controls and switching between free look / shoot mode. You might want to rebind some keys to make it easier on you such as reload and ammo switch. Once you iron that out the game becomes quite enjoyable. \n\nMost importantly how does this enhancement of a 24 year old game run on a modern OS? Well I can answer that for Windows 10 at least. Pretty good. Over the course of playing the game I only had the game crash on me twice and that was because I was Alt-tabing, something that most older (and even newer..) games don't like. Especially on the new Aero interface W7 introduced. Otherwise the game ran smooth with no issues that I could see at all. The only thing I think might have ran better on an old os than a new one would be the Reflex boosters which \"slow time\" it makes the game choppy and almost \"laggy\" which for games of this vintage may have been the norm. I can definitely say that the EE makes it a lot easier for someone who just wants to play SS1 to get in and play.

The Cyberspace experience is truly unique - well polished (note the music in the hallways between the rooms), not overused, and with just enough connection to the \"outside\" world.  There are other minigames and puzzles that between the exploration and combat, creating variation that strengthens Citadel Station as a setting. \nKudos to nightdive for porting this gem to today's computers.

My arguments below:\n1. I was used to the old, classic interface and keyboard bindings. This mouselook stuff is ... well... clunky for me. I don't always remember to press E to switch between modes and it certainly hasn't become second nature for me;\n2. Graphics are pretty polished. No arguing that. But it's a striking contrast between these polished tileset graphics and the original, already aged humanoid mutant; can't just look the other way with this one;\n3. Music is MIDI. I get that. But playing the original floppy version on my old machine back in the day, I found the Sound Blaster music way better; maybe I'm biased, but since it's my review, it's my opinion, so it doesn't have to be objective ;)\n4. The SHODAN graphics in the HUD telling you \"it's blocked by SHODAN level security\" are unusual and awful. They should have stuck with the original. Same goes for Rebecca Lansing's face. Wtf happened to that face? As an old player, this kinda breaks the experience for me. Not cool, Nightdive! Not cool at all.\n5. I hear they put out a 4K resolution on their latest update. I find it useless;\n6. Let's not forget (for those of you who know and remember) that this mouselook mod was a thing developed by some other guy on some other System Shock community forum/website (and it worked and behaved the same) before Nightdive released this Enhanced Edition.\n\nAll in all, if you want a refreshed (and somewhat fresh) experience in System Shock, buy it.

Set in the year 2072, the player takes control of an unnamed hacker who awakes from a six-month long medical coma on board a desolate space-station overrun by the biomechanical creations of the AI SHODAN.\n\nFew games in 1994 were as forward-looking as Looking Glass Studios' System Shock, with regards to both its cyberpunk narrative and its game design sensibilities. Playing through the 10-14 hour long campaign, now easier than ever, unleashes an unprecedented presentation of considered design, creative scenarios and thoughtful storytelling. The techniques and technical details almost feel anachronistic with their modern standards for guiding and challenging the player. The moody worldbuilding of Citadel (System Shock's space station) is still captivating, still authentically lived-in and narratively grounded as the end result of the engagingly told backstory. Amidst vocal email messages and scattered audiologs, the title features genuinely compelling vocal performances, with a pace of storytelling and presentation which gradually reveals an engaging, complex and startlingly fluid and confident story which sticks the landing by the end. The level design, while dense and mazelike, is kept navigable through aesthetic variety and recognizable landmarks. Meanwhile, the gradual escalation of stakes in both the gameplay and plot is masterful; SHODAN, who's menacing personality and imposing power wouldn't be replicated again, presents a dungeon-master-like sadism, and the cat-and-mouse progression of the player\u2019s rivalry with her is a real delight. \n\nThematically, System Shock's world is about pure and fantastical technology misused by ethically compromised individuals. From the morally bankrupt businessman Edward Diego, evocative of self-serving corporate thugs like Burke from Aliens, to the player character whose involvement in the main conflict can't be ignored. Even the villain herself, although not a human, wields technology and innovation in service of her own ego and power. The world that System Shock\u2019s vivid and absorbing backstory paints is a gritty, believable science-fiction society reminiscent of cyberpunk classics like Bladerunner and RoboCop. Unique to System Shock\u2019s tone is the abrasive \u201ctechno-horror\u201d of its soundscape and designs, pitting the player against mewling, murmuring, grotesquely mutilated enemies with cybernetic additions bolted onto their bodies without regard for the form or function of the human animal. The chilling body-horror implications shine through, even while obscured by System Shock\u2019s rudimentary visuals, even to the modern day. Meanwhile, the tone and presentation of System Shock is playfully lethal and adventurous, delighting in subverting and compromising the player while allowing itself to be vulnerable enough for satisfying triumph on the player\u2019s part. This mirrors the development of the player\u2019s relationship with SHODAN, as her multipart plans and protective fortifications get meticulously unraveled by the player, but not without a fight.\n\nI spend so many words on the tone and impressions of System Shock in order to impress upon the reader that there really is an adventure to be had which is engrossing, demanding and precisely put together. The full campaign is more than the sum of its parts, creating a journey that is at once perfectly scripted and player-authored, and the effect this has on the player\u2019s experience is profound in a way that struggles to be matched even today. But accessing the sum total of what System Shock has to offer comes with a not insignificant investment. There\u2019s a significant learning curve at the very start of the game just to get acquainted with the controls, and that's before learning and adjusting to the various in-game systems and mechanics. But the controls, as they\u2019re implemented in the Enhanced Edition, don\u2019t hold System Shock back. Once the player masters the interface and keybinds, the sheer fidelity of movement the avatar has at their disposal contributes to the title's immersion greatly. Simply put, if you can hold a pose in real life, you can probably recreate that pose in System Shock.\n\nDespite coming out the same year as Super Metroid, System Shock is essentially a first-person metroidvania game set in an enclosed space station. Progressing through the story requires the player to travel back and forth between multiple areas, while obtaining collectables and permanent upgrades, such as keycards, new abilities, radiation shields, jet-boots, etc. Backtracking remains engaging through the presence of multiple distinct routes through each area, and a steady mechanical tension which keeps the player from disconnecting from the immediate moment. Unfortunately, with this openness comes a near-constant ambiguity as to what the player\u2019s current objective is. Occasionally, they might receive a vocal email from either SHODAN or an allied character, which will usually describe the basic impressions of what is currently at stake and how to avoid it, while the level design shoulders some of the burden. But most of the heavy lifting is carried by audiologs found in the environment, which can be easy to overlook, forget or ignore.\n\nThat being said, once the player does have a handle over the current mission, the sheer amount of variety is often impressive and thrilling. Some missions require the player to simply make their way to a specific location against all odds, while others require them to hit multiple different corners of the map (either in a specific order or in whichever order the player chooses). The open-ended-ness of the game's design allows for a degree of strategizing and improvisation which means that repeat playthroughs will barely resemble each other, despite the campaign feeling remarkably guided and curated, and oftentimes the player will inadvertently perform a few steps towards completing a future mission in the downtime of a previous one. By the end of the game, the player develops a very intimate, organic sense of familiarity and control over the layout of the gameworld. In the 90's, this was the maze-like acquaintanceship that players developed with Doom levels or the dungeons from Ultima Underworld. Today, the authenticity of purpose within grounded spaces and the player-authored, emergent encounters within those spaces paint System Shock\u2019s space station as the natural ancestor of Deus Ex, Prey and even Bioshock\u2019s gameworlds.\n\nWith the features introduced in the Enhanced Edition \u2014 hi-res and widescreen support, new keybind options and other quality of life additions \u2014 System Shock stands tall today as a triumphant citadel elevated over its peers and even some of its successors. Back in 1994, Looking Glass Studios dared to ask what potential the future of gaming held, and were even more daring as to answer it themselves. The accessibility afforded by the Enhanced Edition doesn\u2019t go so far as to redefine or unfairly limit the ambitions of the original title for modern audiences, only sanding off the rougher edges to make it that much easier to grasp. But even with these sanded edges, the title can prove to be not so much dated as it is a prediction of a future which never came \u2014 a present day where gaming was focused on precision, fidelity of movement and position, and a Dungeons and Dragons-like freedom within a massive, deadly playspace. As such there\u2019s a sort of startling future-shock which can overwhelm new players, made even more dissonant and anachronistic by the aged visuals and presentation. Regardless, System Shock was, and still is, a revelation, pioneering its immersive-sim genre while leaving behind a gripping legacy of thrilling action, creative problem solving and player agency which is yet to be truly matched.", "timestamp_created": 1536734909, "timestamp_updated": 1622867505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78017503023147583", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44693818": {"recommendationid": "44693818", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965129674", "num_games_owned": 881, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2479, "last_played": 1536733314}, "language": "english", "review": "I played System Shock way back in the mid-90s and was blown away by it.

You awake from a six-month healing coma, as a man named Diego wipes your record clean for a small task, a favor, if you will... hack into SHODAN's mainframe and get him some of that sexy program so that he may sell it on the black market, to the Russians, I believe. Problem is, you disabled SHODAN's morality code in doing so, causing her to make some questionable decisions about her new life, while you sleep in the belly of the beast (that is to say, in the Citadel Station Healing Bay) where SHODAN will fire a laser and destroy all the major cities on earth until her demands are met.\n\nGameplay wise, System Shock feels very similar to the two Ultima Underworld games, which is both funny and ironic, considering that Looking Glass' higher ups were saying that they were suffering from burnout after the development of Ultima Underworld 2. You play the game in first-person view (again, similar to Ultima Underworld) and a lot of the controls are the same, only assigned to different buttons. Okay, so they aren't similar at all, but if you can quickly adapt and master the controls (or if playing the enhanced edition) just alter them to your liking.

A relentless AI that is just constantly talking about how she is going to peel the skin off your bones slowly while her robotic minions feast upon your still living body.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]\nThe gameplay admittedly isn't super great, at least in the beginning.\nThe first few weapons like the pipe, the dart gun, laser blaster, and basic pistol are all very underwhelming feeling, and the enemies themselves seem more like nuisances. As you get further into the game, you get more and more weapons to play with, abilities, and much more overwhelming foes. \nThis, coupled with the fact that you are slowly learning how to efficiently play the game makes for some high octane fun that became straight addicting.\n\nBy the last level, I had mastered the guns and health/energy management, and was quite sad when the ending credits hit, as the game had become incredibly fun, with me now able to fly around corners and blast mutant cyborgs in the face with a rail gun at mach speed. This kind of shares a spot with SS2 as well, as the gameplay [i]also[/i] picks up about half-way through that game too.\n\nIf you find yourself not loving the gameplay, seriously keep pushing. \nOnce I did, it became worth it.\nWhat I think really helped it shine is the new Source Port that is now default for the Enhanced Edition. The game plays so smooth, looks super sharp, and the controls were remapped to actually play like an FPS game, with a few oddities here and there. I absolutely do NOT recommend playing the classic version first for \"authenticity\". It controls terribly, and does not run very smooth.\n\nIf you absolutely MUST play the classic OG version, go find the old version of the Enhanced Edition, or play System Shock Portable. Anything that has mouse look, because even with mouse look on Normal difficulty, this game can tear you a new one.\n\n[b][u]Sound/ Music[/u][/b]\nThe sounds of this game are deeply embedded into my brain.\nThey're all super crunchy late-90's stock sound effects that range from sounding pretty good, to crumpled up paper. That goes for both enemies and guns.\nThe UI effects all sound pretty good, with some high tech plinking when you click something, and some nice sounds when you get an email or a new voice log.\n\nThe music in this game fucking [b]slaps[/b] though.\nIt's all midi through Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth (unless you use a SC-55 plugin), but it just bops, and still manages to sound awesome. It's like some weird kind of cyber jazz, and once again gets really slammin' once you get to the further levels like Engineering and Executive.\n\n[b][u]Final Thoughts[/u][/b]\nI didn't go super in-depth with this interview, as I'm just writing this immediately after beating it, but if you want some deeper thoughts, just look through the reviews.\n\nOtherwise, this game was stellar, and I can definitely see myself replaying this one at least once a year, or at least maybe when I do my bi-annual System Shock 2 playthroughs. The story is wild, the gameplay gets super thrilling, and the music slaps.\n\nWhat else could you want?\nFor a score, I'd give this a [b]9.1/10[/b].", "timestamp_created": 1536523802, "timestamp_updated": 1609460768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44655432": {"recommendationid": "44655432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007151782", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 372, "last_played": 1536740453}, "language": "english", "review": "Being honest I can't recommend this game, it is incredibly clunky and frustrating, even back in the day I couldn't play it due to those nasty controls, and it is still really clunky today after the latest update even though they made it a bit more bearable.\n\nThe story is not immersive like many people claim and feels very underdeveloped, is not really \"scary\" either but it is annoying, the levels are a design disaster to look at and the UI is just a mess, I would really suggest you to skip this and play System Shock 2 instead and use the graphic mods like rebirth since you won't miss anything story wise if you skip SS1.\n\nOnly positive point I can give is to Nightdive Studios for all the work they have done to bring this game back to life and make it playable as well as the recent updates they have done, I only wish they would do a deeper and more thought out remake instead of following too closely on this game since it has lots of potential of being great.", "timestamp_created": 1536512941, "timestamp_updated": 1536512941, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.354426920413970947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44642968": {"recommendationid": "44642968", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970989962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2342, "last_played": 1538137994}, "language": "english", "review": "I still have the original game box (\"enhanced CD ROM\" Version) from '94 in my shelf and from time to time I looked at it and was remembering the numerous times I played it - unfortunately I had no system for DOS games at home any longer... and then it was released here... wow... ok. the movement was still a pain...but the Steam SS1 Enhanced Edition was very promising with the mouse and resolution and I played it and remembered and loved it again.

The game is surprisingly simple to follow - challenging, but not really unfair.  Though it suffers the \"search everything and anything\" in loot based systems, you could miss an important log file that is crucial to your mission.  Since the game doesn't track goals, it is up to you to make what you can to remember the tasks your are supposed to.

In the enhanced edition the controls are much, much better. They still take some getting used to but the effort is worth it.\n\nI was floored at how good this game was. Not just \"for it's time\" I think it stands up on its own today. The level design is fantastic, the atmosphere is chilling, the lighting effects were ahead of its time, the puzzles were, for the most part, well designed. I have a massive problem with respawning enemies especially the inviso-mutants (not invisible, just tiny) on the very dark level 3 and the south hallway on level 9. \n\nThe quests were fairly easy to complete as well. I've only had to look up solutions to puzzles twice, here's a hint, when you blow up computer nodes write down the number appearing on the screen. I find old games expect you to know what to do after talking to one guy in a sea of other guys. But system shock has a nice log system and Shodan her/itself is kind enough to record step-by-step instructions on how to ruin her plans. Not to mention rooms and plot-important parts are usually labelled with big letters on the wall. In most older games I hate trying to figure out what I am supposed to be doing but here it was well explained (for the most part, there were two spots I had to look up solutions.) The game also comes with not one, but three guides! So if you need help you just have to alt-tab out and look at the guides.\n\nThe game is also very stable. Some games crash when I alt-tab out but System Shock never had a problem. The enhanced edition does have some bug fixes and I never got past the first room in the original but I saw ZERO bugs. Nothing game breaking happened, I can minimize the game no problems, and even in some parts where I thought I was stuck and needed to reload a save I always found a way out.\n\nStart times and load times are fast too. No unskippable cut scenes here. From desktop to playing a saved game takes about 30 seconds.\n\nI've seen some complaints about the graphics being muddy and I can see that. Enemies are various types of potatos but the wall textures, corpses, severed heads, wall graffiti and labels, flickering monitors, and most other things still look pretty good. It's about a step above Minecraft level graphics so if you can't bring yourself to play games like that due to the graphics you should give this one a pass.\n\nI have more to say but this is a really good game and a piece of gaming history you should check out for yourself.\n\nEdit 10/15/2020: Well I'm playing it again and sometimes the elevator buttons don't work. It also crashed once.

Controls are not mappable though, not even in a config file to my knowledge (though you can adjust to widescreen with risk of crashing, mine handled it fine.) So, if you have accessibility issues that might be a problem. This game is very challenging (I think in a fun way) and it's easy to get lost. I imagine people playing it in the 90's would have bought the guide to go with it if there was one. I had to look things up online at times because I have a terrible memory and there's no questlog. Apparently there are strategy guides that come with this in the games folder but I didn't realize this until after I finished it and read another review. There's also a lot of running around that some people tend to find tedious but I really enjoy because I like getting lost in the atmosphere. It's a really fun game with a lot of entertainment if you can forgive the obvious trappings of it being from 90's controls and graphics (which is also part of its charm.)

And looking back on it, the game was most definitely worth it. It is a classic first person shooter that left me scared throughtout the game, but reinvigorated me with confidence by the end. The gunplay did feel dull at times as it can degrade into a bullet tradeoff to see who died first, but would be fixed when enemies could very quickly kill you before you could do the same to them. Graphics and music were very high quality for its time, and even featured a dynamic music system as it would fade in and out between rooms or in and out of combat. The only problems in this game would be its cyber space missions but are not common enough to really become a problem. The game requires manual saving but can be done at any point, as well as it featured revive spot for when you died. But these didn't take away from the difficulty, the saves only allowed you to quickly retry areas and the revive startions (Which are on all floors except the last two, so its gone by endgame) spawned you with less and less health the longer you were on that floor. And map design was realistic, and intuitive, but would be extreamly confusing to look at on a map due to how copact they were. The game does come with the soundtrack and a guide to help you through, which will definately come in handy as you can get lost on what your objective is or where your supposed to go.

The game follows a simple formula of going through 10 small-medium maps (Though there are times when you have to turn back to previous maps much like a metroidvania).

As a huge fan of many games influenced by (or developed around) this title, including Wolfendoomenstein, Thief, Deus Ex, Metroid Prime, Bioshock, SOMA, Alien Isolation, Prey, and Dead Space, I'm really glad that this game exists. That's why I bought it (and the sequel) when it was on sale. It's also why I was incredibly excited to play it. I started it up and was immediately rewarded with cheesy early 90s cyberpunk nostalgia. Then I got into the game and realized that it didn't f*cking implement mouselook. I stumbled clunkily through an overly complicated interface that didn't hold my hand at all. It took me twenty minutes just to get to the first hallway because I had no clue how to move around. I fought some mutants and picked up some stuff and kind of had a feel for how it was gonna go. An adventure-horror game with puzzles and action-shooter elements that despite relatively clunky controls was a pretty immersive experience all things considered. The dated graphics accomplished what they needed to do, the music fit the mood and constantly had me fearing that there was something over my shoulder, the sound design made it feel like I was literally in space, and the story was that whole sort of environmental no-cutscenes brand plot device straight outta Half-Life. And Shodan? Move over GLaDOS, there's a new evil robot villain in town. Then I encountered a cyborg with a gun who took a lot of my health before I bashed his brains in with my lead pipe [shame it wasn't a crowbar]. I backtracked to the heal station and was fine. Then I got back to exploration, and walked facefirst into a g*dd*amn laser turret which killed me pretty much instantly. Got turned into a robot, wasn't fun, but the cutscene death was kinda cool. Then I realize. I've been playing for thirty minutes and I DIDN'T F*CKING SAVE. So there was all that progress gone. I didn't touch the game for a while.\n\nI picked it back up earlier today because there's not much else in my library I felt like playing. Immediately upon entering the game I try to remember how to play. THEN I PRESS E TO TURN ON MOUSELOOK AND FEEL LIKE BOOBOO THE FOOL. So yeah, everyone giving bad ratings because they don't know how to turn that on is an idiot like I was. Play the enhanced edition, not the classic edition. Do yourself a favor. So I hop immediately back into the fray, bash in the faces of some mutants, stick it to the cyborgs and laser turret, and had an absolute blast of a time exploring the first floor, fighting spooky enemies in cramped corridors, reading logs and looting corpses and compiling a veritable stockpile of guns and ammunition that I'll most likely need once I get to the later harder levels, and doing my best to 100% everything from the get-go, all the while bopping along to some hella catchy industrial tunes [100% trent reznor approved!] and trying not to die, saving every five minutes out of pure unadulterated fear. And I don't scare easy. Resident Evil, Dead Space, Silent Hill, Cry of Fear, Metro, F.E.A.R., Condemned, Sir You Are Being Hunted, Spooky's House of Jumpscares, Xcom, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Alien Isolation, Deadly Premonition, Siren Blood Curse, The Evil Within, Fatal Frame, Crimson Butterfly, Outlast, SCP Containment Breach, Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, Amnesia, the Penumbras... none of them at their peak scariest unnerve me like this game does. And the cramped sometimes wonky control scheme only furthers that. Because yes, even with mouselook working, it still behaves weirdly. Subconsciously I hit the ctrl key to crouch only to realize that doesn't work. I keep having to tap e and click weird places just so I can keep the map and my weapons inventory showing at all times so I can at least somewhat feel safe in knowing I can either protect myself or run away if a monster is hiding. One time a mutant was hiding behind a barrel in a darkened room and I. Freaked. Out. Noise cancelling headphones are amazing here, definitely recommend.\n\nSo yeah, it isn't perfect. There are a lot of improvements that could be made. And- oh look, they're in the process of remaking this game on a more modern engine and control scheme! Get in on the nostalgia train to get to reboot station and get on the hype train. Choo choo motherf*ckers! A classic that certainly deserves the attention and acknowledgment. Like the Beatles. You may not like it, as not everything is everybody's cup of tea, but its legacy is nothing to sneeze at. Anyways, I'm gonna get back to playing so I can get to what really excites me, System Shock 2, as I've heard it's a lot more easily accessible and fun. But for now? 10/10 would crawl throught the vents like the insect I am again.\n\nUPDATE- As you play, the game morphs more from horror to action. The atmosphere doesn't change or weaken or anything like that, I just get more used to the game world. It's not scary anymore but I still enjoy it. The difficulty curve is incredible though, especially if you're aiming for that no-deaths first blind run like I am.\n\nUPDATE 2- THE INTERFACE IS SO MUCH CLEANER NOW OH MY GOD I LOVE IT", "timestamp_created": 1518332033, "timestamp_updated": 1543247287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581697344779968262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39984737": {"recommendationid": "39984737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041724034", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1448, "last_played": 1686610908}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sinceramente, System Shock me ha sorprendido much\u00edsimo. Despu\u00e9s de haber jugado a los BioShock y teniendo en cuenta que la gente no pone demasiado bien a este juego en comparaci\u00f3n, no ven\u00eda con demasiadas espectativas, por lo que el juego ha tenido un efecto brutal en m\u00ed (si bien es porque quiz\u00e1s a mi este tipo de juegos me enamoran). Pero, desde luego, hay que tener en cuenta que System Shock y BioShock tienen enfoques bastante diferentes.\n\nEl juego me ha sorprendido porque, siendo del a\u00f1o que es, tiene una narrativa adelantada a su \u00e9poca, propia de juegos como Half-Life. Muchos de los elementos que vemos en otros \"Shocks\" ya estaban ah\u00ed, como los audios de la tripulaci\u00f3n (aunque en mi opini\u00f3n en System Shock se usan de una forma mucho m\u00e1s interesante, no s\u00f3lo para construir el mundo y la historia alrrededor de \u00e9l, sino para proporcionarte informaci\u00f3n \u00fatil que podr\u00e1s usar m\u00e1s adelante). \n\nSin embargo, lo m\u00e1s destacable que me parece que tiene es la sensaci\u00f3n de realismo que transmite (lo cual es todo un hito ya que los gr\u00e1ficos no han envejecido nada bien), y para m\u00ed esto lo consigue con la forma que tiene de tratarte a ti como jugador (forma que a primera vista pensaba que no me iba a gustar). No hay ninguna pantalla de objetivos, ni ning\u00fan marcador en el mapa que te indique a d\u00f3nde ir, ni ninguna flecha que apunte hacia tu destino. Lo \u00fanico que se te comunica es el objetivo, y t\u00fa te las tienes que apa\u00f1ar como puedas para guiarte por los pasillos de la estaci\u00f3n espacial y para abrirte paso a trav\u00e9s de los obst\u00e1culos que te vas encontrando, pensando justo como lo har\u00edas si realmente estuvieras all\u00ed. En mi opini\u00f3n es aqu\u00ed donde System Shock brilla por encima de otros juegos que tambi\u00e9n tienen ambientaciones de 10, en lo inmersivo que es y en el realismo con el que trata al jugador.\n\nPuede sonar poco apetecible, o incluso dif\u00edcil, pero el juego te va dando pistas de formas sutil pero perceptible y resulta tremendamente recompensante avanzar en \u00e9l.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1518291242, "timestamp_updated": 1518291242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611764669418334961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39922826": {"recommendationid": "39922826", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961766540", "num_games_owned": 1587, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 50, "last_played": 1483712982}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the sequel, but only recently got around to play the original.

The game has a nice atmosphere and music, but the rest is either mediocre or below it. The lack of focus is because this game fancies itself a \"methodical\" shooter, meaning you have to look around corners to shoot enemies, since you can't take armed enemies head-on, or you'll die very quickly. But this approach ends up being really tedious, since the game is huge enough as it is, and there are a ton of enemies. Worst of all, they respawn, so you can't just kill everything on a floor to look for items calmly. You're constantly kept on your toes, but not as good as let's say, Doom on Nightmare difficulty. That's because the spaces to fight are very cramped (corridors), so you'll find yourself dreading combat, specially at level 3.\n\nAnother part I want to talk about is Cyberspace. Those sections bring nothing to the game except annoyance. I guess they took cues from the Sprawl Trilogy (a trilogy of books written by William Gibson), but those sections are very poorly thought out. You're being constantly pulled to something, and you don't really have much control of anything. You'll end up dying a few times to learn how to best use your resources here.\n\nThe game has dreadful combat, but it ends up being rather easy because after you activate a certain machine, there's no penalty for dying. You can scavenge items and ammunition from enemies, but except for Medi patches (health), you can stock on so much of everything else that you don't really have any use for it.\n\nI did like a few things about the game, and those were:\n- music\n- atmosphere\n- map system (you can write messages pinpointing places of interest)\n- the audio logs can be nice, but I guess someone forgot to transcribe them properly (the words almost never match what is being said)\n\nAnyway, the Enhanced Edition only changes a few things. You can now use mouselook, which makes a few areas much faster, there are more resolution options, and I heard one particular password is always the same.\n\nPROTIP: READ THE MANUAL BEFORE PLAYING!", "timestamp_created": 1517108605, "timestamp_updated": 1644535077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39550092": {"recommendationid": "39550092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132812456", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 261, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 674, "last_played": 1516685129}, "language": "english", "review": "Great piece of gaming history right here.

The soundtrack sounds way better in the Enhanced edition than the Classic.\n\nThis game offers replay value by allowing you to change various settings before starting a new game such as...\n...the complexity of the plot and objectives\n...you have the option to impose a time limit on yourself\n...you can alter the combat difficulty and behavior of enemies.\n...you can make puzzles harder or easier\n\n{ ~ Gameplay ~ }\n\nThis game has a pertinent and interesting dystopian storyline, cool setting and map layout, interesting puzzles, fun combat, looting, various items with various effects offering various playstyles, and more. It's very immersive.\n\nYou are required to fight, recover important data, and bypass technological security systems in order to navigate the space station and complete game-progressing objectives.\n\n> You need to analyze and be aware of your surroundings.\n> There is no handholding.\n> Looting, inventory management, unlocking doors, and most hacking is done in real time.\n> Enemies respawn.\n> I don't think there's any cutscenes in this game besides the intro and end cutscenes.\n\n{ ~ Control / Mechanics ~ }\n\nSystem Shock's approach to selecting and throwing certain items like grenades is unique but functional. After a bit of practice it gets easier but you need to be careful or else you'll blow yourself up.\n\nThe Classic version of System Shock is harder to play due to the outdated control mechanics, but the Enhanced version makes the game very playable almost like a real FPS. Playing the Enhanced version on PC really improves the feel of the game and makes moving through the environment and aiming more natural.", "timestamp_created": 1509486255, "timestamp_updated": 1674446330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748341500759124756", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36176351": {"recommendationid": "36176351", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999388309", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1466, "last_played": 1509483883}, "language": "english", "review": "The ending credits give you a score.

With that the game becomes playable and not nearly as clunky as the original.[/quote]\n\n[*]Music hasn't aged that well neither, the better option for the non-stop looping is to turn the music option off. Purists will of course never give the music up, and I totally respect that. Intro's and main's still got it though, as an cult. \n\n[*]Plot is still mature and original for me. It is still plausible to follow data logs and progress with decent 90s voice acting for my today's standards. The main villain Shodan and her synthetized voice effect is an legendary phenomenon. \n\n[*]Level design is still in good shape and intelligent enough to stimulate exploration. (I couldn't stop playing until I got hurting fingers and nauseated vision.)\n\n[*]A.I. is as dumb as any ''paper'' enemies can be. But they're not static in rooms, like Doom's or Duke's used to. \n\n[*]Expect picturesque interface, it will take you some time to get used to all the button clicking and item grabbing & usage. Full screen only gets things worse.\n\n[*]You may feel more confortable with some mouselook mod but that will kill the original intentions and demands other series of mods to compensate, like resolution. I won't recommend it but edge looking can be frustrating. You can safely click in [url=https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=1719.0]HERE[/url] to check it.\n\n[*]Older games are scarier at some extent than today's, probably for your lack of manuvering, you feel exposed and canned.\n\n[*]The darkness, blood and gore obviously aged, since you have seen better by now. It had more dead bodies than the usual.[/olist]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1115007726\n\n[h1]What was it like back in 94?[/h1]\n[b]How I'm supposed to know if I'm 25 years old?[/b] I had to call the most oldschool dudes I know just to ask and I did some reading. One guy still has a working 3DO. Legendary console, had his M2 upgrade cancelled or something amid ''Gamestation'' upgrade for the Snes. Some stuff never changes in gaming.\n\n[b]Extensive research got me the following information:[/b]\n[list]\n\n[*]You assume the role of an hacker tricked by and bullied constantly by an mad-powered AI that definitely has some grudge with God (never mentioned by the game but you can guess by demonic voices). The biatch is so fakking bad that leaves you thinking that the authoritarian government you used to fight by hacking their puppet corporations wasn't so bad. It remains very immersive, mature and down right serious, not cheappy. \n\n[*] So the ending used to cause relief on players as the worst nightmare an scared chicken can have.[spoiler] It had the rare view of the main character very injured, exhausted and confused after beating Shodan. Like the poor bastard almost caused the worst miserable holocaust on human history when he plugged in a overlord with omnipotent complex. Self destruction on her golden throne was more important than saving your own ass, but living with that scar looks like death. [/spoiler] Some people think of the Indian goddess Kali by accident due its name, some reminds about the lowest black belt on Japanese martial arts. Whatever the acronym stands for, like Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network, that name is definitely bizarre for a AI and sounds like she means. \n\n[*]As reference, FPS just got more interesting than Doom due hybrid elements from RPG (like TES: Arena) a more realistic approach on everything and its plot.\n\n[*]It wasn't seen as a survival or any big impact for some time according to my oldies, due low popularity until more new FPS or brainless shooters arrived. I didn't get that part. [b]Edited[/b] It was because better releases only came after 1996, like TES: Daggerfall, Quake and Duke 3D.\n\n[*]Some ex insisted that the game was more long than it should have been back in 94, and it had better plot scattered along data logs. I disagree because I love Shodan. Thanks if you're reading, for your whatsapp rage was most amusing.\n\n[*]It is said that the game had impressive lighting and shadowing. Texture effects with it combined were otherworldly.\n\n[*]It used to run better with MS-DOS. You could barely run all that with a 100mhz processor and 8 megs of RAM. Even a 486 wouldn't do the trick for Max settings, for many it was an uncharted territory.\n\n[*]One of my Steam friends told me that all sci-fi FPS survivals of today has S_Shock's soul on its core. (some are copy and paste.) I can confirm that.\n\n[*]Its was released during the ''golden age'' for 16bits consoles, some ancient EA division had balls of steel for publishing it and fight Sega's & Nintendo's calling everyones attention.\n\n[*]It was common for cyberpunk stories from the 90s to use the ''Skynet'' approach although Shodan's personality and the Citadel space station were pretty original. It leaved the plot at the eye of the storm of a very bad crisis so it was more exciting. \n\n[*]A writter from some blog insisted that this game was a relationship/job/life braker. I was just a year old so I don't care.\n\n[*]I've found weird statements about how long the game was. The brand-new never before seen complexity could take 40 hours for some to beat it fully. Of course we don't have to wrap our bad-boys on our legs anymore. The old inside joke still works for newer games that have gotten bigger,  realistically it could take over around 20 hours to beat it.[/list]\n\n[b]Should I invest, will I find some fun on it?[/b]\nOn my humble opinion yes. It isn't expensive on the US not even South America. If you're a hardcore gamer, it is your duty to experience this marvel (even if you rage quit it). It was the new birth of a more sophisticated era for gaming programming, visions, and artistic expressions (Shodan's voice man!). Having it helps earn respect and friendship from the oldschool. I did eventually, and it was quite rewarding.\n\n[h1]What about cards, backs and emoticons?[/h1] 08/19/17\nI'll speak better about it on my S_Shock 2 review. In my opinion, the first System Shock 1 do have better backgrounds than the second version, but it has weak emoticons in comparison. S_Shock 1 emoticons are just homage to its classic enemies such as the magic trash can (Serv) or the Elite's cyber nudity. You'll see Citadel as background here, suitable for the old fan. The card set is very cheap even for South Americans, easing your level up without too much trouble.\n\nA remake from this incredible piece became a Kickstarter project from Nightdive Studios (the original devs) by clicking [url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/1639514]HERE[/url] and why not endorse it?\n\n[b]Edited at April's 2018[/b] The developers swapped their engine to Unreal's one, leaving the remake like an very nice pile of brainless shooting gallery instead of survival.

Seriously, this game is pretty damn advanced for 1994. It has an inventory system, augmentations like in Deus Ex, hub level system, leaning, crouching, proning, jumping and what else is there dammit. The good:\n\n- Difficult and tense combat. Ranged enemies have quick aiming and reaction times. You'll die pretty quickly if you stay in the open. Get ready to make millisecond long peeks out of corners and slowly whittle down enemies' health. And once you have one certain melee weapon, wait for enemies to come when applicable, near and bash them around corners for ez kills.\n\n- Hub-level system. Every deck in Citadel is connected to a few elevators. Lets you go back to retrieve some item(s) you stashed like a ultra-prepared survivalist. Or simply take a pause, thinking why the hell you had to do an illicit hacking operation for a military grade cyborg rig. \n\n- Dynamic music and the soundtrack itself. Music shifts often, adds nice variation. Although not every track is good, majority of it is MIDI goodness.\n\n- Nice story.\n\n- The cyberspace sections! Simply awesome. Just a creepy black void with various color wireframe rooms, interconnected by tunnels where you get to have a short pause of fighting the virtual guards. You get upgrades for your cybernetics and whatnot by managing to go through the whole cyberspace area in the given level without \"dying\".\n\n- Puzzles on electric panels where you have to rewire it so that a door is unlocked or some other necessary event happens.\n\nThe bad: Movement is really quite fiddly on anywhere but completely flat flooring. On the lowest height stair steps, you get a major slowdown on each measly increase in height, and catwalks are buggy. You just gotta hope you'll do well in about mid game for example in one room with platforming..\n\nThe ugly:\n\n- Enemy sprites haven't aged quite as well as Doom's for example. They first of all move around in a way that doesn't correspond with their animation, they slide around. And then, simply the sprites aren't nice pixel art like Doom's, Hexen's etc..3d renders made sprites. Doesn't look nice.\n\nDo buy this if you can put up with the ungracious on some parts datedness.

Creating a control-scheme is a bygone problem as the adoption of controllers and expected control set-ups have standardized games, some may say for the worse, that have trained players to expect a certain set-up across all games. In many cases, an FPS will play much like any other one except for deviations of speed, emphasis on hip firing and/or iron-sights, and weapons that make up the arsenal of a game. Having to relearn a new control set-up for an establish genre is not something most players are going to accept, and it has forever been a black mark on the namesake of System Shock.\n\nThe way the controls are designed is they\u2019re a hybrid of point-and-click and FPS set-ups that share functionality with one another to make up for the missing components players would expect in one genre or another. By default, players move as well as aim with the mouse by moving the cursor across the screen and clicking in the direction as well as to turn the camera by the edges of the screen; the keyboard changes the position of players to crouch, to lean left or right, and to hug the floor with their face. Menus open from tabs alongside the viewport that looks like a submarine periscope, which opens the interface to access audio logs, emails, items, ammo and reloading screens, etc. These considerations are on top of the maze-like areas that uses realistic living quarters, which can be aided by a vector map hidden inside one tab that shows more of the layout the further the player explores each floor of the Citadel. Along with the constant threats at every corner and the vague minigames to breach the station\u2019s security, having to worry about the controls is the beginning of a player\u2019s concerns. \n\nThe Enhanced Edition streamlines some of these systems by utilizing a Mouse-Look button along with enabling full-screen to make movement conform to WASD standards; however, the menu system remains intact to the experience, which makes it easier to understand the more the player becomes familiar with the controls. Toning down the difficulty options for puzzles, combat and other options is preferable for the first experience as learning the unique controls is the first challenge the player must overcome, and it\u2019s the only barrier of entry that the game possesses that would dissuade players from enjoying what elements hold up to modern standards.\n\n[h1]One Is the Loneliest Number That You\u2019ll Ever Do, Insect[/h1]\n\nIf anything about this game has withstood the test of time across various games it is the narrative elements that are at work to enhance the atmosphere and immersion that comes with it being an immersive sim. Inspired by Ultimate Underworld, the exploration and player freedom to wander the various levels of a station to solve given problems at the player\u2019s pace is the cornerstone of the experience in SS. Audio-logs, email reports, an omnipresent threat, SHODAN, onboard a station that insults you at every corner for your destruction in a soothingly unpleasant mismatch of voices spliced together on top of the general atmosphere of hostility from all present threats gives a sublime presentation of audio and visual quality that remains as hauntingly surreal today as it was back in \u201994. \n\nWhen it comes to the narrative itself, the original System Shock remains a threadbare story that relies more on its presentation than its themes or an overall plotline to enhance the experience. Even compared to the sequel, the character of SHODAN feels somewhat shallow than the sequel as her motivations cannot be contrasted with another threat such as the Hive to question the positives and benefits of AI. This is unlike the sequel which puts the player as the mediator of two vile extremes of philosophies that challenge the player\u2019s states as a cybernetic human; the player is simply a hacker given an opportunity to clear his name to cause more ruckuses afterwards.  Here we have an omnipresent threat at one extreme who we only get to have the perspective of it being the antagonist, and the lack of conflicting supporting characters to weigh on the matter or to offer insight other than the scattered audio-logs and emails makes the experience fairly limited compared to its sequel and spiritual successors. \n\nNone of this is to discredit the benefits of an immersive experience presented around the immersion of loneliness; however, the faults are more present as the result of having played games that have taken the basis of System Shock and made improvements in favor of telling an immersive story. \n\n[h1]It Belongs in a Museum[/h1]\n\nStorytelling isn\u2019t the only limitation with the original System Shock as the gameplay itself was designed to accommodate its awkward controls by stripping away any semblance of AI for enemies as well as making enemies with projectiles into hit-scan enemies. Even when it comes to the original DOOM, enemies possess some modicum of AI behavior as well as relying on multiple types of attack such as melee, projectile base and hit-scan weapons. System Shock feels threadbare as the result of making encounters based on keeping away and peeking around corners, which feels natural to an experience to instill fear into the player at every corner yet makes the core gameplay simplistic.\n\nThese are the aspects of a game that can only appreciated for what it was worth at the time that future iterations of System Shock are going to resolve many of its core problems to many audiences. However, if nostalgia is what drives you to play System Shock then the game will offer you a reason to go back into the past for a short while, then leave things where they belong as memories.", "timestamp_created": 1502419546, "timestamp_updated": 1502948371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653341710567474365", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34025908": {"recommendationid": "34025908", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990281964", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 449, "last_played": 1509183439}, "language": "english", "review": "this is one of my favourite game from the past. I bought it just to be in my collection and just for fun I installed it. Right now I'm somewhere in 30-40% of the game and definitevly going to finish it! It's GREAT even after so many years. Few things I like the most:\n- \"hardware plugins\" you put into your head, can find some updates and can tweak them. Even map is one of this plugin and you will not have any map until you find it (it's in the beginning, but still - in other games you just click TAB or M and you see a map - here you have to find it, plug it in your head and activate). Also bio monitor is plugin, so if you would like to see your health, you have to find it again (-:\n- notes and logs are PERFECT. This is only game where I bother to listen to them - even more - I'm looking forward to each new log to learn something more\n- SHODAN is soooo scary (-: I'm old guy now and do not consider games like Outlast or Penumbra very scary. But what devs do here with SHODAN... omg... it's perfect\n- weapons - you have nice picture for every wepon and you can \"configue it\" - you can set level for your energy wepon, change ammo etc. It perfectly fits into the whole GUI and how you control the game\n- story, levels, hacking etc etc etc... (-:\n\nonly \"problem\" is graphics and controls - but it's not so bad as you may think.

This game (or at least, the original DOS version of it) is older than I am. [b]I try to take that into account when evaluating it[/b], but it also [b]deserves to be looked at objectively[/b], I feel.\n\n[list]\n[*]Starting with the gameplay: very good. It's really satisfying to figure out your own methods of proceeding, whether you cautiously lean around corners and stealthily take your enemies out, or you mow them down with the most powerful weapons available to you. The mouselook added in this Enhanced Edition is excellent; I don't even want to think about how I would play the game without it. Great FPS-RPG fun.\n\n[*]The graphics still hold up pretty well. Sometimes the pixels look kind of muddled and it's hard to see switches you need to flip and such, but not often. I do have this weird issue with the perspective, where everything looks smaller than it actually is. For instance, corridors look about chest height when they're actually as high as my character. I feel the same way with DOOM, though, so that's probably just me.\n\n[*]The controls are pretty good. Again, the mouselook is a lifesaver. I had to figure out which keyboard buttons did what, since there was no way I wanted to use the HUD controls. I don't think they follow what the game tells you they are in the pause menu. I heard you can customize keyboad controls, but I didn't see any way to do so and just went with what was there, which worked just fine.\n\n[*]The music is spectacular. Really sets the right mood, for the most part (when it's not just a jumble of noises grating on my ears). An issue I had with some frequency, though, was the music cutting out altogether when it clearly shouldn't. As this was the first time I've played the game, I'm not 100% sure about this, but I think it even cut out for the final boss music. Unless there simply is none, and the finale of the game is meant to be silent.\n\nBefore I get to the next point, I should mention Cyberspace. It feels very surreal, like a dream, with the floaty controls and wireframe graphics. I'm going to assume that was intentional.\n\n[*]Now, the worst part for me, and what really soured my experience with the game the most, has to be the physics. Again, 1994, I get it. This isn't a criticism on the game itself or the developers, but think of it as a warning to prospective players.\n[/list]\n[b][i][u]I found the physics to be absolutely maddening. Objects and level architecture constantly bounce me around, sometimes at the worst possible moments. When I'm trying to sprint through an area, my character will get momentarily stuck on random things, slowing me down considerably. In addition, my character seems to drift even when I'm standing still, trying to solve a puzzle.[/u][/i][/b] While these aren't MAJOR issues, the brief moments of frustration added up. I would definitely say these physics have not withstood the test of time, even if most of the rest of the game has.\n\n[list]\n[*]And finally, the final part of the game.[spoiler]It felt very anticlimactic. Granted, this isn't really a game that has \"boss fights,\" per se, but it still felt like it wasn't at the appropriate level of challenge compared to the rest of the game. Besides that, SHODAN didn't say a word to me for the last hour or so of the game. It almost felt like she had just given up entirely and was simply waiting for me to end her. And the final \"boss\" fight... I'm not sure if you have to shoot her or not; if I was causing damage, I just so happened to bump into her at the exact moment she died. If shooting did nothing, then I accidentally won the game by flying into her, which is pretty anticlimactic in and of itself. Either way, the game just abruptly ended, with no feeling of tension leading up to it or accomplishment for having finished it. I dunno, maybe the ending was rushed like SS2's was.[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something I should mention, but whatever that is hasn't occurred to me so I'm not going to worry about it. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this game to people who enjoy retro experiences. However, if the dated nature of the game (admit it) puts you off, I would instead suggest you play System Shock 2 now, and wait for the NightDive remake supposedly coming out next year. Assuming it isn't terrible, which I'm not going to say it will or won't be, it looks to be a much more accessible version of this game, perfect for modern sensibilities.\n\n[h1]7/10, great game but definitely shows its age.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1501620597, "timestamp_updated": 1501621530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592589497566223145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33747836": {"recommendationid": "33747836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011965365", "num_games_owned": 2407, "num_reviews": 2064, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1501818376}, "language": "english", "review": "There are so many things one can say about System Shock that it's difficult to know where to start.

I did play System Shock 2, which is basically a generation or two ahead of this game.\n\nThat being said, this is legitimately one of the best games ever made and has some features I wish modern games had.\n\nSo, it took me maybe 3 times total to sit down and actually figure out how to play this game; the initial frustration and urge to quit is high, because this game comes from an era before modern control schemes.  This game can't decide if it wants to be a first-person shooter or a point-and-click adventure, and you have to toggle back and forth between both.\n\nHOW TO PLAY\nLet me save you some figuring it out; 'e' switches mode from mouse-look to point-and-click mode.  R/F/V are Stand/Crouch/Prone respectively, and z-x-c are lean left, center, and lean right.  My biggest frustration was I got stuck leaning right and couldn't figure out how to unstick it; the trick is to press 'x'.\n\nStay in FPS mode for most of the game, use 'e' to switch to point and click mode when you absolutely have to (mostly for looting).  This should be enough to get you past the first room :)\n\nRight click shoots, left click looks, and double-click activates.  Another oddity compared to modern games!\n\nNOW, WHY IS IT GOOD\nSo, first off, forgive the horrid voice acting -- most people in the game were clearly the developers themselves lending voice and face to characters.  This game was from a different era, so prepare for some really bad voice acting.  That aside, it's a beautifully (for the time) rendered environment, with lots of detail, and its overall quite well written and produced.\n\nThere's a lot to do, and if you just want to be a tourist, you can tune the game to your taste.  For my playthrough, I turned off enemies; or rather, set their difficulty to 0 so they wouldn't attack.  You can also turn off the obnoxious puzzles in the game, which I highly recommend.  Doing that, you can tour around and enjoy the story.  The clunky interface is a lot less bothersome when you're not trying to fight.\n\nI wish more games would be tunable in this way; so many times I've picked up a game and got wore out of the repetitive combat and wished I could just turn it off.\n\nSo if you find the game frustrating, try that.

Do you judge them against the standards of the time as well as their historical importance? Or do you just damn the torpedoes and judge them by modern standards, pixilated warts and all? Sometimes it actually makes surprisingly little difference \u2013 Super Metroid for example is as playable and captivating as it was back in 1994.\n\nSystem Shock also came out in 1994, and time has not been kind. It was released right in the middle of that uncomfortable, awkward puberty that was early 3D videogames (and is dressed in the gaming equivalent of a Marilyn Manson t-shirt and leather trousers). System Shock was obviously in development before Doom was released \u2013 nearly everything looked embarrassingly dated when that hit the shelves, and this game was no exception.\n\nSystem Shock by modern standards is clunky almost to the point of unplayability \u2013 it should say something that the biggest addition to the \u201cenhanced\u201d edition is the ability to mouselook rather than slowly and painfully pan with the direction keys, though even this is set on an awkward toggle. The labyrinthine menus are baffling, the movement is slow and cumbersome and the combat is so god awful and the AI so braindead that exploiting it is standard procedure.\n\nBut there\u2019s such a wealth of ambition, imagination and creativity here that I can\u2019t bring myself to lay the boot in. System Shock was pretty much treading entirely new ground, and while the execution is often not great there was essentially no blueprint to follow outside of the Ultima games (which it resembles far more closely than the likes of Doom). The level design and atmosphere still hold up, and a surprisingly excellent automap stops you getting lost in the wonderfully intricate, sprawling environments.\n\nIn some ways the biggest sin this game commits is that it has too many ideas \u2013 no idea is left behind, no matter how half baked and over ambitious. There\u2019s a massively confusing 3D wireframe hacking game that plays like a crap version of Descent. The cybernetic upgrades are mostly completely worthless, and there\u2019s a poorly implemented energy system to power them all. Reloading a gun is a 12 step procedure that requires 2 keys and authorisation from NORAD.\n\nReally, the biggest triumph of System Shock is that it laid the groundwork for its more fondly remembered sequel \u2013 a game that although a little wonky is an absolute classic, and is still very playable even today.

So you can imagine my delight when I was finally able to get my hands on and play the original System Shock here on steam. And whilst I still think SS2 is a much better game, I sincerely enjoyed playing this.\nSystem Shock is an oldschool FPS in which you play as a hacker who must stop a rogue AI who has taken over the Citadel space station from taking over/destroying the Earth. Seems straightforward enough, but what I really like about the story is how it always feels like it\u2019s moving forward. You wake up and find everything\u2019s gone to hell. You desperately try and figure out what\u2019s going on and how to stop it. And every time it seems like you've foiled SHODAN's plans, she\u2019s still one step ahead of you, so it's up to you to keep up and try and save the Earth. I really like this as it seriously draws you in. You want to keep playing to find out what happens next and to get the last laugh in. Even though the graphics and controls haven't aged well, I find System Shock to be a deeply immersive game.\n\nIn saying that, it is true that the controls are what really holds the game back. I am very grateful for the enhanced edition because it fixes the most glaring issues (lack of mouselook and low res words). Seriously, not having mouselook really held the game back in my opinion. I've heard some people say that the lack of mouselook helps add in a layer of helplessness that contributes to the horror atmosphere and to an extent they're right. But there's a fine line between feeling powerless against overwhelming odds and just feeling frustrated with stilted controls and this being more of a shooter than a horror game, I find myself drifting towards the latter. To be honest, the controls aren't too terrible. I really like the controllable and interruptible lean as it can really help in being able to out manoeuvre and snipe enemies. \n\nMy biggest gripe with the game though is its frankly atrocious UI. Unlike in SS2 where you just pressed tab and your inventory/stats screen showed up instantly, SS1's UI is broken up into several small tabs lined along the bottom/side of the screen that you have to manually click on to open. And navigating them is a right chore, ESPECIALLY when you're in the middle of an intense moment and you need to heal or reload your weapon. You need to exit mouselook, click on the appropriate tab and double click on the appropriate item to use and then go back into mouselook. This is awfully time consuming and needlessly complex. \n\nOn that note, a lack of hotkeys is also another big problem with the game. Instead of having each weapon mapped to a button, you toggle through them with the \"q\" key. This is annoying enough as getting to the weapon you want is annoying enough if you accidently go past it as you're frantically cycling though your weapon, but this is further compounded by the fact that there is no reload button. You have to bring up your weapons menu to select your weapon and bring up the weapon sub menu to be able to reload your weapon and then click on the ammo icon to reload your weapon. This is especially galling if you get in a fight and need to reload you weapon. Either you quickly toggle through to another one to finish the enemy off or you run and hide to buy enough time to bring up the menu to manually reload. I suppose this can be argued to be in the games favour as it adds to the horror atmosphere by adding a touch of realism because y'know, in a real gunfight you can't just instantly reload. And not gonna lie, that is the case sometimes because it adds a layer of desperation to survive if you're getting low on health and haven't been able to activate a restoration bay. But then again, it also can cause some cheap deaths, which no one is a fan of. \n\nThe cyberspace minigames are also something I'm not a fan of as they're incredibly esoteric in design and are just sorta there. You just sorta float around in cyberspace, avoid enemies and collect packets of data and such. Not helped are the awkward and floaty controls and unintuitive display. \n\nAnd finally, the level design leaves a lot to be desired. To an extent, it's a pretty good layout having multiple elevators connected to a series of floors connected to a vertical shaft. But the low res graphics combined with some truly maze-like levels lead to me getting lost multiple times despite the fact I have played this game several times. The engineering level is probably the worst offender being both a massive level and having several areas look the same, leading to me getting lost and not knowing which way to go and where I've already been.\n\nAt this point, it may seem like I'm down on the game because I've been slagging it off for the last few paragraphs. And while it's true that in retrospect the game wasn't as good as I was expecting, the true value of SS1 comes from the experience. It's a lot like Dark Souls in the fact that taken at face values by the value of its mechanics alone, it's not that remarkable. But it's all about the adventure and the experience. SS1 is greater than the sum of its parts. It's incredibly immersive and once you get into the groove of things, it quickly becomes addictive and hard to put down. The issues I talked about at length before aren't deal breakers and can be easily worked around (but are issues none the less) and gotten used to.\n\nThe story is probably the best part of SS1. I quite like how it's all up to you to figure out from the audio logs and emails to figure out what to do and where to go. SS1 respects your intelligence and trusts that you'll be able to use the pieces of information you're given and that you find to piece together your objective. And that makes it all the more satisfying to work through the game. You feel as though it was you besting SHODAN and not the game telling you how. Admittedly I was more down on this aspect when I first started playing because I easily got lost on what I had to do and what I had already done. But in retrospect, this was a nice touch of realism. No ones going to tell you what you need to do and what you've already done. It's up to you.\n\nAnd really, it's just so much fun working your way through Citadel station, getting better weapons and upgrades, being able to traverse areas you previously couldn't and piecing together what happened from the audiologs scattered here and there. It was metroidvania before metroidvania was a thing. And it does it so well too!\n\nAt the end of the day, playing SS1 made me look back more fondly on SS2 because it builds upon SS1 and improves on so many areas. But SS1 has its merits and without it, there wouldn't be a SS2. It takes a lot of getting used to but once you do it's a great deal of fun and an incredible experience you're not likely to forget any time soon!

The game can be confusing sometimes.  \n\n[*]\tThe soundtrack isn't that good, especially compared to games like Doom.\n[/list]\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u] \n\nFantastic game. Way ahead of its time. A can't wait for the reboot of game, so far it looks amazing. Although the controls have been improved for the enhanced edition, the controls are still Frustrating, but stick with it, learn through trail and error. If you like games like Bioshock 2 System shock 2, then I highly recommend you buy this.   \n\n\n[h1]8/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1496262493, "timestamp_updated": 1496262493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32062233": {"recommendationid": "32062233", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982565433", "num_games_owned": 2180, "num_reviews": 179, "playtime_forever": 1298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1053, "last_played": 1657159601}, "language": "english", "review": "i have mixed reception about this game.

I remember playing it back in the 90s when it was originally released. Back then the graphics and the gameplay were amazing. The controls were overwhelmingand a little bit stiff, but you could get used to them. What i never did was finishing this game...\n\nAt least not until now. \n\nThe enhanced edition is a great way to relive this game. First and foremost it adds a lot of little features to make the overall game experience better. It takes a few minutes to familiarize the controls but the modern mouse and keyboard input works really well. Starting a new game the all so familiar \"wow, the graphics really did not age well...\" sets in like with almost every game that is more than twenty years old. But it quickly vanishes because it is just so well made.\n\nAfter the very short intro sequence that shows your character being arrested for hacking you wake up on a space station with almost no information on what has happened. Only slowly you puzzle together all the pieces to what has happened while constantly under the threat of mutants, robots and the AI Shodan who seems to be out to get you. On your way trough the station you find a lot of hints in the form of emails and texts about what has happened to guide you trough your journey. But be aware, you need to really read everything you find because the tasks and solutions are not plain obvious as they are in modern games. It is not uncommon that you need to piece together multiple clues to find out on which of the nine levels of the station you have to go next and what you need to do there... And you never know if something in the environment may come in handy later in the game. Hint: Make use of the map and the feature to add markers to it!\n\nSo, if you expect a nice linear CoD-like game, stay away from this old-school gem!

There is a hotkey to switch from the far-from-usable \"drag your mouse on the screen\" movement to a standard shooter wasd movement. The default key is 'e', it makes navigation a lot easier!

Enhanced edition offers bumped up resolution to all the games sprite-based graphics, mouse-look support (a literal game changer), and custom button mapping. Shy of that, this is still the same System Shock from 1994. Despite the slight graphical upgrade, the game's graphics have not aged well. Muddy textures and sloppy movements hamper traversal through the games 10 levels. That being said, the storyline and overall atmosphere remain as engaging as ever. After an hour into the game (and the acquisition of my first firearm), I easily dismissed the graphical shortcomings as I sought to stop the megalomaniacal AI, SHODAN. \n\nThe game is fairly long (~20 hrs), especially for its time. As a Warren Spector game (prior to Deus Ex), the quality of the gameplay remains stellar. Your character acquires new techniques and weapons as you progress through each level of the Citadel space station, furthering the urge to continue to the end. Similarly, new enemies maintain a relatively consistent challenge as one goes deeper into the game. In fact, the only real pieces that detract from the game were the cyberspace levels.

In early first person shooters, such as Doom, you would mow down enemies for the fun of it in sets of various mazes. In later games of the same genre, like Half-Life, you would fight to progress through a well-defined story. System Shock however has you do both of these things, and in doing so shows how shooters evolved. Each level of the game is absolutely a maze, complete with the traditional elevators, which you must navigate and kill hordes of enemies to get through. But there is also a dense and well written narrative, with voice acting, to constantly motivate you onwards.\n\nWhile progressing through the game you can see the rugged incarnations of the many narrative and gameplay mechanics which have become mainstays to the medium. Early forms of storytelling systems like cutscenes and audio logs play out through the game's email system. Early roleplaying systems like attribute-specific stat boosters and enemy-type only effective weapons are incorporated into the basic gunplay. Backtracking to previous levels to reach previously unavailable areas with the help of new gear, a la Metroid, even gives the game an open-ended feel.\n\nThere are many aspects of System Shock, like the controls, that show their age. But other parts remain remarkably fresh. The art design of Citadel Station and the world building applied to it are impressive to this. Each level of the station feels like an almost entirely different location with its own purpose and the environment as a whole actually feels alive. The various characters which pop up in the audio and written recordings even feel rooted and meaningful to the setting.

I like to replay it every 4-5 years which is just enough time to forget some things, give me some good jump scares and keep me twitch firing and scared as I hide among a pile of crates wondering how I can survive with low life and 1 bullet.  \n\nSystem Shock did not deliver to the same degree.  It had a fine story and feel, and after an hour I got used to the wonky controls and enjoyed myself.  But the game never elevated to the same level as SS2. By the end of the game I was loaded with huge piles of ammo, i-cad batteries and I was leaving first aid kits on the ground marking them on my map.  Sure the game had massive amounts of \"revolution\" to it 20 years ago, but it hasn't aged as well.   I really didn't like \"Cyberspace\" and thus the final battle was a huge let down.  \n\nThe game is definitely worth playing, but if you haven't played it before, grab the control guide for the enhanced edition.  The \"E\" key is paramount.  As I said, it took me an hour of bashing zombies with a lead pipe until I finally began to have some fun when I made it to the next level and got a decent supply of bullets.  I never did find the much raved about laser rapier, but I did fine without it.  \n\nI really had little idea about the weapons and enjoyed exploring the favourites in my massive arsenal.  I never did find a use for the \"shotgun\".  \n\nOverall, this is a heavily dated game, but still provided some fun.  I won't ever play it again though, strongly preferring SS2.  \n\nI can't recommend it at standard price. Not when you can grap so many other FPS cheaper.

In a way, it's an evolution of the old Ultima-style first person dungeon crawlers towards the FPS/RPG games that came later (e.g. Deus Ex and the like). The setting is a huge space station that has been taken over by the AI SHODAN, and while you were hibernating in the medical bay, SHODAN has either killed the station's inhabitants or turned them into cybernetic mutants under her control. The game feels like it was very much \"ahead of its time\", with actually good voice acting, and an interesting mix of various types of gameplay and mini-games.\n\nHaving mouselook and WASD controls in the Enhanced Edition makes this game much more playable nowadays, though you still have to toggle between mouselook and classic controls to interact with puzzles and your inventory and stuff. There is an interesting variety of mechanics going on in the game, from the odd flight-sim-style cyberspace simulation to the wiring and electronic lock hacking mini-games. SHODAN is a legendary antagonist with some well written monologues and an oddly distorted voice that makes her memorable and creepy.\nThe difficulty setting is more customizable than anything I've ever seen in this kind of game. You can set combat difficulty, puzzle difficulty, cyberspace difficulty, and the amount of \"story\" (basically how much stuff you have to read and whether the game has a time limit or not), all independently of each other. I guess the developers knew they were combining genres in a nontraditional way, and wanted to give players the choice of how to play the game.\n\nI really enjoyed it, though the interface hasn't aged very well, even with the \"Enhanced edition\". The controls and interface are much better than in the original release, but still quite cumbersome compared to more modern games (or even System Shock 2). The first level of the station feels like a big maze, and you are stuck with really crappy weapons at the start, but once you start going to other levels, the station really opens up and you start finding better weapons, tools, and cybernetic upgrades.\n\nIf you like these kinds of games (e.g. Bioshock, Deus Ex, etc.) and would like to experience one of the more influential games within the genre, I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1485545648, "timestamp_updated": 1485545648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504384279251098633", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29408071": {"recommendationid": "29408071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084497637", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1645243263}, "language": "english", "review": "play it high", "timestamp_created": 1485035156, "timestamp_updated": 1625465621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29404767": {"recommendationid": "29404767", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992101032", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 697, "last_played": 1485022164}, "language": "english", "review": "The underrated entry in the [b]Holy Trinity Of The Best Video Games[/b] [spoiler](DX, SS1, SS2)[/spoiler], also the most immersive one.

It was the first game I played that fully immersed me, so that when someone came bursting through the door in the room where the PC was I panicked for a few seconds trying to swing the mouse to aim at them.\n\nIf you have nostalgia for System Shock, and you're wondering whether it lives up to your memories of it after all these years: It will. Even after the two decades that have elapsed since its original release, the best things about it still stand out as good. \n\nThe level design is *phenomenal*, breaking up long easy-to-cover corridors with cramped twisty tunnels that utilise verticality (essentially the first FPS to do so), so that if you're in an area that's meant to make you feel tense, you damn well feel tense. The storytelling is excellent. I continue to hold the position that SHODAN was even better in SS1 than the sequel. A lot of the other voice acting leaves much to be desired, as you'd expect given fully voiced games were so rare back in the day, but by and large it gets the job done. The broad arsenal, diverse enemies, the awesome weird gear you collect by exploring the huge complicated station littered with secrets - this game was built with a level of ambition that has few rivals even to this day.\n\nIt ain't all peaches, nor was it ever. The MIDI instruments never sounded so poor. I have a soft spot for the music but I have to admit, it often degenerates to a confused chorus of sad honks. (Apparently you can mod in better MIDI instruments which might help a bit.) The sprites that looked real bad back in the day, look real real bad. A lot of that cool gear I love collecting isn't actually useful. The pre-Quake engine looks wonky as hell, and the way it smears those low res textures over the environment shifts and glitches. The *controls*, surely the worst thing about the original release, are basically *fixed* in this Enhanced Edition; having proper mouselook (toggled via the E key) does mitigate a lot of the paranoia and fear that came from how difficult it used to be to keep tabs on your environment, but to my surprise doesn't eliminate it, and scary areas remain scary, if slightly nerfed. The enemy AI is pathetic.\n\nI don't care. This re-release transported me 20 years back in time and I still absolutely love this game. If you're nostalgic for the original System Shock, play it.

Once you get used to how it plays, you will be soaked in a foreboding sense of dread as you creep through a derelict space station populated by killer cyborgs, trying desperately to preserve your stores of ammo and healing supplies long enough to find the next stash behind a wall somewhere.\n\nThe sound design is quite good for it's day, though the music sometimes feels completely out of place. The graphics are similarly quite good for their day, but may offend modern gamers who grew up in the HD era. The two still manage to create a deep, satisfying atmosphere that is easy to get immersed in. The Enhanced Version has mouselook, which pretty much alleviates the biggest complaint about the original release: the AWFUL controls. For purists, you can still control the game that way if you some insane reason you want to. The enemy AI is god awful, but considering this is one of the earliest FPS games in the genre, it's hard to hold it against it. The placement and number of enemies more than makes up for their stupidty as you advance through the game.\n\nDoom with a brain ( and a jump button ) and as much as SS2 did to advance the FPS genre, System Shock more than holds it's own, and despite it's age, remains a relevant game to this day.

Level design and game mechanics like restoration bays do well to prevent frustration.  Of course, I did find the rare moment or two where I did need to look up how to proceed.

Many games have often imitated... but never truly replicated it. So many games out now were inspired by this classic masterpiece. From BioShock to Dead Space, the fomula obviously has a very lasting appeal. Even games like Doom 3 tried to replicate it's unique style of story-telling.\n\nThis game was actually one of three games that I first played on a computer. I've told this story many times but... I was heavily into console games at the time & a friend wanted to show me that there were types of deep games that consoles just couldn't do or handle at the time. This was the third game he showed me & I was instantly won over by it.\n\n\"An instant classic\"\n\"An absolute masterpiece\"\n\nThese phrases have often been tossed around by reviewers in magazines & on gaming websites. Most don't even consider the true weight of these words as they should never be tossed around lightly. But this game does not need to prove itself as it is the real deal. It, along with its sequel, is often included in these \"top games of all time\" lists for a very good reason. This game changed the very way story-telling was done in games. Its developers wanted to make an RPG without stats. Where you could use any & everything in the world with your own skill.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of this game was how the sound was handled. Rather than employ a dedicated sound engineer for the game, which was normal for the time, the developer hired musicians to handle the sound & music. And the final product shows this great quality immensely. Every sound & every music piece just absolutely fits into the games theme.\n\nThis game also holds another personal record for me for having one of the scariest levels in all of gaming history. Level 3 Maintenance... I still get chills up & down my spine just thinking about this level as I would constantly jump at any weird noise. Even knowing the layout of the level before hand & where everything is will not help you prepare for this level as the atmosphere was spot on perfect.\n\nIf you play one game in your entire life, you owe it to yourself to play this one as it is just that good.\n\nUpdate: Years laters after defeating this game for so many times... still worth every cent.\n\n2nd Update: I'm still surprised even after all this time that this game is receiving updates.

He recommended System Shock and it defined my gaming expections.\n\nI was obsessed with it.  Played so much I knew 3/4 of the whole place like the back of my hand and still remember the critical points when I revisited the game recently.  I got so used to a movable curser for selection and aiming that I can't really play the Enhanced Version with mouselook - I had to play it old school i.e. Classic (there are playing methods I use that won't work with mouselook).\n\nYou start off with an intro video setting the background for the player character - a hacker who got caught attempting to jack into a corporate's database.  A corrupt executive offered to dismiss the charges along with a neural cyberspace interface - if you perform some hacking for him on a space station's Aritifical Intelligence called Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network or SHODAN.  How could you refuse when the likely alternative was to be thrown into corporate detention for who knows how long?\n\nSo you hacked SHODAN as instructed and removed its ethical constraints, the exec set you up for an operation to install the promised neural hardware, you slept away the next 6 months to heal, and woke up to ... what the **** happened while you were dozing?\n\nFrom there, you're on your own.  The game offers hints via logs and notes left by dead station crew and plot-triggered emails from off-station corporate staff trying to solve the disaster (mixed with threats and taunts from the now ax-crazy SHODAN bent on extermination of the human blah blah blah).  Beyond that, you are left to your own devices to figure out what to do and how to do it without dying.\n\nAs the game throws you in a station overruned with mutated critters (including former humans), robots and cyborgs, almost all (note: NOT ALL) are hostile, combat (unless you turn it to minimum) is an integral part of the game.  Enemy AI is basic (simple line of sight and shoot/pursuit), but the weapon damage system is impressive for its time.  All weapons (melee, firearms, remote explosives) have an armor penetration matched against whatever armor the target might carry - your likely first gun, a dart thrower meant to subdue lab animals won't do squat against any robot. Several weapons also have unique damage types that make them powerful against a class of enemies but useless against others - Gas Grenades melt mutants but are useless against robots, while EMP weapons wreak circuitry without harming flesh (including yourself - so feel free to drop an EMP grenade at your feet if you are at touch range of a nasty robot about to put holes in you)\n\nThe game doesn't have any experience system where you get better at killing enemies as you kill more.  Instead, it rewards you for exploration by scattering goodies in the form of weapons, hardware upgrades and supplies around.  In the first level, there are two powerful end-game  weapons (with limited ammunition), secured away for the player to unlock by fulfiling conditions on that level.  Players willing to go to the effort are rewarded with the weapons which can make the first few dangerous hostile encounters much easier.\n\nAs a hacker, the player can 'jack into cyberspace at specific cyberjack locations.  Cyberspace sequences are deplicted as 3-D wire-frame world where the player could attempt to access useful information and trigger switches that affect the real game world (such as opening some locked doors that could not be unlocked by any other means) while dodging hazards and defeat security programs attempting to terminate the unauthorised entry, all while on a timer (which is adjusted by the relevant difficulty setting) which might make things dicey for some of the longer/harder sequences.\n\nNew players, if you want a game that points you where to go and tells you what to do, you're looking at the wrong place (unless you turn the Plot Setting down which affects the story and in my opinion the enjoyment).

Combining the FPS elements of Doom (its elder of 6 months) with point-and-click adventure elements of dungeon crawl CRPGs (uber-popular at the time), the Action-Adventure power-up system of Metroid, and a beautifully designed horror atmosphere and audio aesthetic (provided by members of the band Tribes), System Shock is one of the first games to tell its story primarily through environmental details, exploration, and prodding by the voice-acted driven villain taunts.

I'm a sucker for the cyberpunk atmosphere and this game does it perfectly. Let's start with the story. Basically you are a hacker who is forced to remove the ethical restraints of an A.I. belonging to a corporation known as Trioptimum, or be imprisoned for hacking into their network. Obviously your choices are limited so you decide to take the more attractive option and remove the A.I.'s ethical restraints. This allows the A.I. to take over a trioptimum space station, killing everyone except you and it is your job to take the rogue A.I. down. Shodan is the name of the A.I. and it has come to the conclusion that it is a god and that it's new goal is to take over Earth. Shodan is one of the best video game villians I have ever seen in the game. You will notice something very off about Shodan the moment you hear it speak. It has a feminine, yet inhuman, computerized, glitchy voice that will often contain various hiccups and malfunctions. It is a very intimidating voice, a voice that it will mock you and put you down with throughout the game. \n\n The new enhanced edition has new mouse look controls, making the combat feel more like doom. I personally prefer the classic version because it makes you feel more human. It makes you feel like you are in an actual human body, bringing along all of the limitations a human would have as well. It gives you a better sense of helplessness that the newer version eliminates in parts. The combat is pretty great. It relies on taking cover and leaning around corners to get the advantage on your enemy. It involves tactically using grenades, if you are careless with them you will wind up killing yourself. There are melee weapons to use. Different weapons are better depending on what enemy you are fighting. There are also cybernetic upgrades available. Some useful, some not as useful. For example, one gives you a head mounted flash light, which sounds cool. Or, at least it would sound cool if there wasn't a night vision upgrade in the game, which is basically just better when it comes to seeing in the dark. There are also dermal patches (basically drugs) in the game that give you different abilites such as making you smarter, or making you as stong as the hulk. They also have side effects. For example, if you take the strength boosting patch you will be able to take things down with a steel pipe with ease, but you will also hallucinate and see the world through multiple, atlternative colors. It's pretty great. \n\n The levels can be confusing at first. When I first started playing the game I saw the level design as a big downside of the game, but once you are in the game for a while and become more familar with the levels, you notice that they aren't as maze-like as you first thought and are actually really well designed. Certain doors in the levels can't be opened until you lower the security of the level. This can be done by destroying the security cameras around the level that Shodan has taken control of. Some doors are opened by hacking the lock. It is kind of like lockpicking in the future. You play this mini game where you direct the current of electricity from one side of the panel to the other. Some are easy, while later on they get more difficult. Some doors can only be opened in cyberspace and this it where it really takes inspiration from Neuronmancer. Cyberspace is sort of how Neuromancer describes it. It looks like an old 80s wire frame game (see Battlezone). It is really fun and simple. Basically you go through wire frame corridors leading to different wire frame rooms. There are different things to pick up in these rooms such as passcodes and even video games such as a version of wing commander. These rooms will usually be populated with enemies. They are pretty easy to beat. You basically dodge their attacks and shoot your cyberspace weapon, called the pulsar, at them. \n\n  At the end of the day the reason I had so many good memories of this game after beating it was the story, the music, the amazing level design, the non-linearity of the whole game, the freedom it gives you to explore, the environment and the enemies that populate it, the combat, cyberspace, and just feeling like the most bad ass hacker of all time. I definitely give system shock a 10/10. The game is old so a lot of new players might find it hard to get into, but if you give it a chance and stick around until the end you won't regret playing this historical, influential masterpiece.

Shodan's lines were what really made this game great for me, and every ambush and threat from her had me excited to hear what she had to say. The cyberpunk theme was really cool too, having teleporters, flashy lights, energy shields, and more. While most of the other audio logs weren't spectacular, and were commonly cliche, they also add to the setting and were a joy to listen to, accurately painting the picture of the human resistance or paniking scientists during the initial attacks.\n\nThe gameplay was decent, but with some obvious flaws. Many of the levels are confusing to navigate, I found myself wandering around aimlessly in some of the levels, searching for a single access panel I missed or trying to find a key item that I now need in the plot. The ammo drops aren't balanced too well, dropping so much ammo for some weapons, with others like the assault rifle not getting enough until it's useless in the game. The projectile weapons are difficult to use as they maintain your momentum while moving, so they'll fly to the side if you're trying to peek and shoot an enemy. And probably the biggest downside for a new player, being the clunky interface and controls. As a side note, a neutral aspect of the game is the tendency to \"not hold your hand\", letting you freely figure out what to do and where to do it, which may be difficult until you get used to this playstyle.  Regardless, as I was playing this game for the story, it was easy for me to get past these flaws.\n\nIn conclusion, if you can stomach the clunkiness and the learning curve in the beginning, I highly recommend this game for the story and narrative.

Even when he is not talking directly to you, his presence is felt through every monitor that flashes his face on it and every security camera that acts as his eyes.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is that the ending is rather anticlimatic and abrupt.\n\nNow if you can't stand pixalated graphics but still want to play this masterpiece, Nightdive studios has you covered.

The primitive interface and clunky controls do everything in their power to make you want to stop playing. However, when you exceed the 30 minute mark, you transcend the antiquities, time warp to 1994, and proceed to marvel at how ahead of its time System Shock really was.\n\nWhere most games were still consisting of descriptionless obstacle courses, System Shock was creating a palpable setting that had a semblance of being a place people actually live in. One of my favorite games of all time is Deus Ex, I was amazed at how ahead of its time it was and how it still beats many many games in features all the way back in the year 2000. Little did I know that System Shock already beat Deus Ex to the punch 7 years ahead of time.  By all means System Shock is functionally a modern game in terms of its mechanics and interactions.\n\nBut yeah yeah, its nice to know how good it was for the time, but why I should bother with it in the here and now? Well, if you can tolerate the idea of an expansive first person adventure which has a bulky interface, somewhat syrupy controls and graphics that require you to squint sometimes to figure what you're looking at, then you're looking at a very worthy interactive challenge.\n\nWhile modern in features, it is definitely retro in progression and challenge. I have played very few games that so ruthlessly let the player wander long and far from where they are next supposed to be. And it can be very easy for the player to trap themselves in a corner progression wise. It can also be difficult to understand where damage is coming from due to presentation limitations, and solutions occaisonally require pixel hunting the scenery for a button or switch which blends into the flat scenery.\n\nI admit that I when first played I went for about 5 hours, was hopelessly lost, and proceeded to give up and uninstall the game. I thought about it a little while later though, and realized that it wasn't really that mysterious what it is I had to do. There were directions, I just didn't follow them closely enough. I felt beat, but the fact that the game was willing to defeat the player and let them feel stymied is what made me come back. (possibly) Everything you need to advance is available without cheating, you just need to listen carefully. I once again admit that I consulted a guide once or twice, this is very much a classic LoZ experience. I was frequently frustrated and even annoyed. To beat the game though is quite satisfying, and lends a historical experience to one of the earlier projects of one of the greatest development teams to ever exist.\n\nI would like to give some basic spoiler-free advice for new players which will hopefully inspire those who read this to stick around to the end credits like I eventually did. I hope this advice is sufficient enough so that players can obtain the fullest satisfaction of beating the game without needing to consult the internet, or as little as possible:\n\n[h1]Create multiple save files [/h1]\n\nYou have multiple save files to utilize, and saving is easy and instantaneous. Protect yourself from getting trapped in a corner by saving frequently and in seperate save slots so that you can easily retread your steps if you find yourself stuck in the wrong place with the wrong tools. You can name the saves, and I recommend you number them so that you can easily go back if you ever feel it necessary.\n\n[h1]Current objectives are communicated through emails[/h1]\n\nIt can be easy to to lose track of immediate goals, especially if you save and quit and come back later when the objectives communicated to you have been forgotten. If you feel like you've lost a sense of direction or objective, reread the most current email, which usually lists an explicit floor or sector to head to next. This can narrow guess work greatly, but also keep in mind that the objective of an email may entail heading to an area to pick up a recording log which contains further objectives. If this is the case, make sure to check the latest email to see if you already visited the area you were told to go, and if you already picked up the log without realizing it contained the next objective, go through the catalogue of logs which are listed by floor. You may have to cycle through the logs to find it but you will know when you found it when you find a log which lists goals or tasks. If you don't know where certain sectors are the first email sent to you by Shodan lists the sectors every floor has.\n\n[h1]When you destroy the red cpu nodes on each floor, a number will appear on a screen near where the nodes were. Write it down somewhere and save it for later [/h1]\n\nYou will be so thankful that you did.\n\nI can't be certain that this advice will be enough to get through the game without having to look at a guide, but it should eliminate a lot of confusion. If you feel like you need the help of a guide, Night Dive Studios thoughtfully included two pdfs of 90's manual guides (complete with interviews!) which players of this game should check out just to see the nostalgic content. They certainly helped me in my times of need. Don't forget to see the TV spot in the extras files.\n\nSystem Shock is a classic rewarding game which respects the intelligence of its players.

God: the title suits me well\"[/i]\n\nSystem Shock is the 1994 sci-fi Ultima Underworld brought to you behind the long dead minds of Looking Glass (previously responsible for John Madden Football '93 and British Open Championship Golf) and now Night Dive Studios, who are thoughtfully selling it repackaged with some fan mods. \n\nIt may come as a system shock, but the game is pretty good.\n\nThere's two versions of the game - one with mouselook, one without. There's a correct option here. Now while mouselook absolutely trivializes the game, it's not all that hard either way (unless you count abusing mid-lategame surgery units to make up for the lack of healing items), and mostly just serves to speed up the horrid default turning speed.\n\nEven with mouselook, the movement is clunkier than dropping a brick through the grinding gears of this game's fans playing a modern RPG. You can feel the game sputter and struggle to gain momentum, with the constant lurching whenever you strafe not helping the issue. Playing the default way, you'll be drunkenly stumbling around the tightly-knit corridors.\n\nThe best approach is to keep your finger on the sprint button, something the AI can't deal with.\n\nEvery enemy type is absolutely braindead, from the lowliest mutant to the highest elite cyborg. Every situation can be solved by either abusing their inability to see your head poking around corners, or popping the shield and blindly firing. You're given a billion bullets, a billion powerups, and after a point it's no longer worth even picking them up.\n\n[h1]\"Look at you, hacker. A pathetic creature of meat and bone. Panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect immortal machine?\"[/h1]\n\nYou've got your combat, and you've got your \"puzzles\". Two types - there's finding the key/code for a door, and two types of minigames that are without a doubt the most obnoxious trial and error and wastes of times they could have come up with. Straight up rely on guessing combinations, randomly selecting wires to swap and grid access icons to click. \n\nIt's so bad I'm convinced there's a auto-solving logic probe for each puzzle. [i]They knew.[/i]\n\nYou look at all this through your GUI, the \"Multi Function Display\" that mostly serves as an extra spikey Iron Maiden for your face. As hideously complicated as it looks, you can safely ignore 9/10s of it at all times, and there's a fullscreen if you really need it.\n\nCyberspace serves as the final type of gameplay you're going to see, and not coincidentally it is the final type of gameplay you'd ever want to see in any title. It's a confusing, horrible mess; you have your constantly rotating camera, your wireframe levels that are a mess to navigate, your two weapon types that seemingly only fire in their own sweet time - it's a disaster on every level. \n\nUltimately it amounts to \"go forward, shoot, and pick up minigames\" so it's not an insurmountable challenge, just a thoroughly unpleasant one.\n\n[h1]\"You, my children, are the fruits of so much imagination and labor. Living beings with the speed and effeciency of machines. But I must strive further to serve life.\"[/h1]\n\nArtistic direction is as 90s as it looks.

Trying to piece together what you're supposed to do is fun and engaging, but the combat you do along the way is where most of my complaints come from. \n\nIn combat, you'll mostly be leaning around corners, shooting at enemies who often just stand still until they spot you, even as you're shooting them to death. And once in you're in their line of fire, you're dead almost instantly. There's respawn points on each level to help alleviate this, but more often than not your deaths will feel like the fault of the controls, rather than your own skill. \n\nThankfully the difficulty settings let you individually tweak the combat, mission, and puzzle difficulties to your liking. For a first playthrough I recommend turning the combat down a notch or two.\n\nComplaints aside, I still really enjoy most aspects of this game. The story is great and really helps add to the immersion. SHODAN is known for being one of gaming's best villains for good reason. She's absolutely deranged, and her insane rants really make for some memorable moments.\n\nOverall, I think it has a lot going for it.

Most people are familiar with it's sequel, System Shock 2, and the follow-up series that it spawned, Bioshock. The games are hybrid first-person shooter RPGs. While that doesn't sound so crazy in the modern gaming climate, 1994 hadn't seen anything quite like this game.\n\nThe major problem with the original release was the control scheme. Instead of opting to lock aiming to one plane (like in Doom), Looking Glass Studios tried their hand at full 3D aiming. It was facilitated (originally) without mouse control. To say that the game is an exercise in frustration wouldn't be giving enough credit to how maddening the experience could be.\n\nThankfully, System Shock: Enhanced Edition (courtesy of NightDive Studios) fixes any real complaints you may have had with the original release. I suppose the textures are still a bit low-resolution and the game isn't remade more so than ported, but sometimes it's just plain wrong to tinker with classics.\n\nThe story is fairly non-existent, obviously due to the developers putting more effort into gameplay than anything else. You take the role of a nameless hacker who is caught trying to steal data from the TriOptimum corporation. Instead of locking him away, they give him a chance to redeem his actions. Edward Diego, owner of TriOptimum, is looking to steal a virus from the Citadel Station to sell as a biological weapon. Your character removes the ethical restaints of SHODAN to allow him to cover his tracks.\n\nAfter doing that, your character is given a neural implant as a reward. He is then put in a 6-month statis period for recovery. Upon waking up, it turns out that the rogue AI, named SHODAN, is driven insane. The space station is in shambles and there are mutants and cyborgs running amuck.\n\nIt's not so much what the story is about, but more so how it's told. This was the first game to have audio logs play over your actions. The voice acting isn't grade A, but it does a great job of selling how desolate the space station truly is. SHODAN's voice, though, deserves a lot of praise.\n\nI rarely get scared in games, but just listening to hear is enough to drive you mad. The way her voice lags, stutters, speeds up, warps out of clarity and remains in a monotone is just creepy. She is also written with a decent sense of humor (albeit a very dark one).\n\nThen comes the gameplay. In 1994, there was literally nothing like this. Shooters hadn't begun to tackle aiming in a 3D space. While that obviously caused a lot of headache due to poor controls, this enhanced edition adds mouse support. With the press of a single button, you can aim and look around as if the game were made today.\n\nThis port retains a lot of what made the original so unique, however. You will be required to unlock mouse look and click on items. Reloading requires you to unlock mouse look, double click on the ammo button and then click it again. This is definitely a game that requires patience.\n\nThat patience will have to extend to the combat and puzzles, as well. The AI is hardly good, but a few of the enemies are of the hit-scan variety. They tend to have perfect accuracy and it can be quite ridiculous to try and figure out where the hell you are taking damage from. It doesn't help that they don't seem to suffer from ammo limitations, while you are required to reload your clips manually.\n\nThen there are the puzzles. The game thankfully has individual difficulty sliders for each part of gameplay, so one can opt to turn the puzzles off entirely. With them on, the game resembles Doom with a more open-ended approach. You will be looking for keys, splicing wires together and twisting nodes to access different parts of the space station.\n\nIt's just that, being the game was made in 1994, a lot of the puzzles can be obtuse. It doesn't help that the game has absolutely no hand holding, so you often will be walking around for hours with no idea of what to do next. The e-mail logs you get with your objectives are descriptive enough, but it would be nice to have a main objective screen.\n\nThe game is 22 years old, though. Walkthroughs are plentiful and the game isn't so massive that you would be entirely lost. It's impressive to see such an old game have level design this large. Not every room feels intricate or realistic, but being trapped on a space station with 10 levels within the confines of the DOS OS is just amazing.\n\nIt's like a marriage between Doom and any modern role playing game. It feels sprawling, epic and spooky. When everything clicks, you truly do believe you are lost in an impossible situation. The music does ruin the mood a bit, but it is also excellent.\n\nIt would be pointless to comment on the graphics with regards to modern expectations. NightDive Studios are doing a full HD remake of this game, so playing this will mostly be for people who have a fondness for old-school games. It's gameplay certainly doesn't feel old, but the game looks it's age.\n\nI often love sprite based games, so I wasn't disappointed. I'm more impressed with how the architecture was constructed or the art design behind specific enemies. Everything is detailed enough to not look confusing or blurry, so that is a huge plus. There is also some excellent use of color and a lot of sci-fi feeling locations.\n\nAs for whether you should get this, I say yes. The price is cheap and often becomes ludicrous on sale. It's not a short game and it will give you some perspective on how far FPS games have come. That is still feels like a brand new game (despite some antiquated design choices) is a testament to how ahead of it's time System Shock truly was.\n\nThe sequel is still much better, but the first chapter isn't one to be missed.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1462677373, "timestamp_updated": 1469071364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610050737857818604", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22829740": {"recommendationid": "22829740", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961003330", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 572, "last_played": 1682446386}, "language": "english", "review": "Before a few weeks ago, I had never heard of this game.

That's it. I would end the review here, but... you'd need to know why it's so great.\n\nFirst of all, I've gotta say that the composers at Looking Glass did a great job with the soundtrack. While most of the MIDI-techno music may not fit the atmosphere of the game (excluding level 3), it's still awesome, and it's a joy to listen to.\nAnother reason for why it's so good is the constant feeling of isolation and dread. You're on your own, helpless, in a vast space station with no survivors. All that's remaining is you, a corrupted A.I., murderous cyborgs and mutants.\nI'm also in love with the element of no hand-holding. With barely any help or guidance, the game encourages you to explore and take a look around the Citadel station, while looking for ways to solve various puzzles. Clues and hints can be found in audio logs scattered around the station that may contain important info or clues to solving them. \n(Plus, the hacking minigames were cool, albeit frustrating.)\n\nNow, despite the praise I'm giving to this game, there is one small issue. It's the labyrinthine level design. It can be really confusing at times, but with the automap and 'nav-markers', this problem is alleviated. So... you won't get lost or lose your way around the endless corridors and cramped hallways of the Station. At least, not too often.\n\n(One more thing I should mention is SHODAN.

Ready your weapon for a potential hostile. You manage and treasure your ammo, often resorting to the good ol' pipe in early stages of the game to thwack mutants in the head.\n\nThough the music may not be fitting for a horror atmosphere, it is still plenty enjoyable to listen to.

It was the first FPS/RPG hybrid that led to System Shock 2, Dues Ex franchise and the BioShock games. \n\nI have to say I am really surprised how playable this game is today. For me there is a huge nostalgia factor so I simply do not know if younger gamers can stomach the graphics of this game, but the play mechanics and story are simply astounding. I love the Bioshock games, but they are so dumbed down comapred to this game. There is little hand holding in this game. you need to actaully read the emails, data logs, peices of paper on the ground, and hack computer to figure out how to even progress the story. The game is broken up into levels up a space station but don't simply advance from one level to the next. You can and even need to jump around a bit. \n\nThe mouse look support and higher resolution support make this game playable today. I find old FPS games without mouse look far too frustrating to play and have to find a mod to stomach the controls. I am glab they added it to this version. \n\nAs I said before, in many ways pretty much every fps/rpg hybrid has been dumbed down slightly from this game. Think Dragon Age 1 vs Dragon Age 2. Its not 100% bad. There are a few mechincs that seems a bit clucnky and needed refinging. Looting in this game takes a few too many steps and using items is not the smoothest of actions. \n\nEver since I first played this game I always listed it on my top 10 favorite games of all time. 21 years later after playing through this game again it remains on my top 10 games of all time.

And when I said RPG what I meant is real-time dungeons crawlers. Not to mentioning that Looking Glass made Ultima Underworld before that. And this time they wanted to make it so all elements are incorporated together instead of \"there is exploration sub-game, NPC conversation sub-game and Roll/Dice combat sub-game\". Anyway, they made this nice cyberpunk piece of awesome.\n\nThere were two versions of a game: floppy and CD. Yes, Classic version that comes with both. And music is probably played like it comes out from some soundcard, it's nice and not like General MIDI. There is almost no reason to use floppy version. CD version added 3 more mini-games that you can find in cyberspace, some detention cells in Level 8 that are just, well, cells, and voice acting. Which is awesome. SHODAN villian AI wouldn't be same without that voice.\nIt's a shame however that voices actually rephase the whole text they were supposed to follow, so it may get annoying to listen to it while reading text. But I heard that community produced a patch that changes text to be same as what voice actors say.\n\nAnd the game would have stayed obscure but Night Dive managed to get the rights on System Shock out of the legal limbo, releasing Enhanced Edition in 2015. All yay Night Dive.\nThe only shame is that they didn't have the source so they could do only so much with reverse engineering. But they still made it run natively on newest Windows, increased available resolutions and improved controls. Though sadly it only uses General MIDI music. Also, because they couldn't change game itself too much then if you want to change controls then you will have to configurate it in the cfg file of a game's directory.\nOh, and comes with nice bonus goodies. Shame that soundtrack is same as General Midi.\n\nAs for bugs, well, I think that game crashed on me two times in the beggining, when I was alt-tabbing around and was figuring things out. There also was graphical glitch on full map rarely appearing and interface sometimes looks ugly in enhanced version with random lines, like on puzzle meters. Probably something to do with resolution.\nMost annoyingly, music in Cyberspace is bugged. It randomly dissapears after a while, until you leave the cyberspace. It even was nasty with final cyberspace level. If the music doesn't glitch out, then it may keep playing even on top of ending's own track.\n\nOriginal game had a very scary interface that looked like Looking Glass tried hard to make it feel like stereotypical future complex interfaces while controlling like they belived that computer mouse will replace keyboard someday.\n\nThankfully, we have enhanced version. For getting used to controls here is a kickstarter: Press E to switch between mouselook and mouse-free one. Then poke around with left mouse click, left double-clicks and right clicks. Then check Reference Card in game's folder to check on Enhanced's keybinds. Then after more playing around and having fun you can check manual, ignoring the outdated keybinds. People are more smart than usually given credit for, you will figure it all out.\nAt the end, you should get used to pressing F1-F10 and 1-10 number buttons to toogle hardwares and change screens. Gotta be able to activate shield with single button. And since there is no reload button for your weapon, organise your weapon order so you can switch to your backups with Q button.\n\nAnyway, the plot of this game is fun. Pre-story is that you are a hacker who got cautch for trying to look inside the TriOptimus's protected data regarding space Citadel. After that they carry you into Citadel itself where Diego offers you a deal for unknown reason: if you remove ethical constraints SHODAN AI system and give it Level 1 access then they will free you of charges and even give neural implant. You did as was asked. And now you are taking a deep sweet 6-month long sleep so your brain will get used to the implant.\nOnce you wake up you will very quickly realize that you unleashed the beast.\n\nThe main strenght of this game is how it combines the skill-based action with the story elements. You got around 10 levels of Cidatel which are complex mazes and you will often have to backtrack. But you see, it's the kind of game that actually tries hard not to feel like it holds your hand. And it succeedes. Your main source of information will be logs of the dead people. By analysing them you will find not only story, but you will be able to solve puzzles to progress. And not just code for nearby locked like in more famous Doom 3. And it's not limited to codes either!\nThough sometimes it lacks some smaaaaall additional hints. At least I don't expect people to figure Reactor mission in some while. But no worries, it has enough info to analyse, it's not Monkey Island logic.\n\nEven better the plot that is delivered through this is excellent. And most importantly the SHODAN AI is the kind of villian that is pretty much always present. Through logs you find out what she is up to and how you can possibly stop her. With every your effort pretty much focused on giving this villian blows that you know matter, even possibly knowing what else she can pull off.\n\nAnd look, you can write messages on the map. Any game that tries to be intellegent and allows leaving notes is rated highly in my book. Love this feature.\nUntil I couldn't leave any more messages due to hitting global limit and had to backtrack to remove them on some levels. Oh well. At least also has automaping.\n\nThat was the best part of a game and what you should look toward. Everything else is less amazing, but mostly solid.\n\nYou \"level up\" by finding new weapons and hardware to use, with game throwing tougher enemies at you. It doesn't feel as much on survival as I expected, if you pick everything then you will not ever run out of ammo, for example. Not as much as of horror as I thought. Or none at all, action MIDI music doesn't help. Though it does have some ambient sometimes.\n\nAnd some levels aren't excited either. Mostly the mazes parts that feel like mazes. Mazey mazes. You know, 90 degree turns and generic enviroments. Didn't like Level 7 at all, felt like one. Even worse is that some enemies actively respawn on some levels. And when they do, they often are quite aggresive and annoying. Like Level 3. I would have understood if they did it to populate level when player wasn't there, but not flood him while he is still in the level. Physics for jumping is weird too.\n\nAlso, you can activate restoration chambers for infinite lifes on the level. We were casuals before modern gamers, yo.\n\nCombat is mostly solid. As in it doesn't hold up to any Doom-school game. But that's not the point of a game and it gets away due to this. Not much of difference in weapons when it comes to combat itself. Most enemies are hitscan. But not brutal at least, with fair reaction and hitstunning. At least game varies it up by giving you melee super-weapon in early-mid game. Powered with Berserk it's a complete beast. And it's fun to just beat enemies who got too close. Or had back turned.\n\nCyberspace also playes pre-Descent. And it kinda sucks. As in, you can't strafe, you can't turn while keeping same direction of movement, you can just fly forward and shoot forward. But oh well, absolutely no Cyberspace is mandatory and game gives Pulsar V8 at start of final Cyberspace so you don't have to worry about grabbing items or destroying. Still fancy for it's time. Shame about gimmicky final boss though.\n\nOverall, while lacking in FPS qualities, it's awesome game for exploration and feeling rewarding due to lack of hand-holding in this seemingly complex game, while on practise being simpler than it appears. Still doesn't give you right to be all elitist gamer though, silly. Now go and ruin SHODAN's masterplan!

In rough comparison, the DOS version of System Shock requires DOSBox, or even MS-DOS in order to play it, but System Shock: Enhanced Edition has its said requirements utterly removed, and you are free to play without the DOS systems to do it.\n\nThe Negatives\n\nBecause the game is rather fun to play, there's a certain amount of flaws that I'd rather want to point out.\n\nI. Certain levels are rather semi-cryptic, and it always takes some time to know what to do, or else look up walkthrough videos or internet pages every time.\n\nFor example, the Enviro-Suit is locked inside Greg MacLeod's office, and you need to guess the keypad combination. I don't know how the player really needs to get the code from, just guess it! The code is 838. That shouldn't be necessary though. Who thought that this is a good idea? That's possibly the dumbest idea for a keypad puzzle ever. To be doubled, certain levels are mazes, which is considered to be the worst part of the game.\n\nII. Another striking example is the Reactor room where you first encounter the Security-2 and Flier-Bots. Once you've entered, you will quickly realize that the room is highly irradiated, and you need to upgrade your Enviro-Suit to resist the Radiation Poisoning, use Detoxication Stimulants and eventually you'll run out, or use cheats, which is not considered to be recommended, no matter how much you find it necessary. Now, you DO have a reviving machine or whatever it is, to help you, but you will always have to run to the reactor room every time you've been revived.\n\nThe Postive\n\nI. The in-game's functions, also known as controls, are rather strange, and takes some time to get used to, but once you've managed to get the hang of it, its epic. If you are feeling uncomfortable about the controls during combat, you can press e to enter shoot mode, also known as crosshair mode.\n\nII. The enemies and bosses are rather unique and interesting, especially the Cyborg Assassins, Cyborg Elite Guards, Virus Mutants, Cyborg Enforcers, and the Inviso-Mutants. In System Shock 2 however, the enemies from System Shock are no longer present, except for the Cyborg Assassins. I'd love to see all the enemies from System Shock to return in the third sequel as a retro throwback to the first System Shock game.\n\nIII. The music is rather hype-inducing, combined with synthesizers, technological ambiences, and much more. In consequence, the music is rather good to listen to.\n\nIV. From System Shock 1 to 2, the storyline is rather fantastic and unique, and the game does a great job in thrilling gamers, especially on how it brings the said games to life. I wont be writing the whole plot of the game here since its long, but you can look online and read for yourself, which is what I don't recommend due to spoilers.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nNeedless to say, System Shock is one of the best games ever made to make its way onto Steam as I've wished, but ingame, it only has a couple of negatives that are easily sprouting out like pond weeds, and they will smack your face repeatedly over and over and over again.\n\nFor those who are reading this review, its your optional choice, go play this game; and it will give you a retro throwback.

The sounds and music work quite well with the style, and i only regret that I can't use my old DOS computer to record better playback tracks, since Windows can't hold a candle to the good ol' AWE32 card.

Add to that the bonus content, and owning another copy of this fantastic classic became an instant no-brainer!\n\n*Update - This engine runs general MIDI. That means you can download an alternative synth engine and load soundfonts into Windows. And I found a soundfont that sounds darn near close to my AWE32 card.

Areas that you'll enter will inexplicably shut doors behind you without any way of getting out unless A, you figure out the wire puzzle which can and potentially take 10 or more minutes to solve (for me at least). Or B, truge forward and hope you'll have enough wit to make it to an elevator. Elevators are salvation to go heal / recharge on lower levels you've finished. That said this is one of many dilemas you'll encounter playing which incites tension not found in many games nowadays. \n\nSlight spoilers: Levels 7, 8, 9 are what I consider impecable in terms of gradual difficulty increase without being unfair or overly puninsing. 7 has a respawn station as with subsequent levels which are \"earned\" and enphasie that word because it not untill later in each level when you are finished the objective or explored the area you unlock, or you can miss it being you took the fast route. What makes 7 difficult is the use of high enemy respawns to wager having your own respawn station.  This followed by 8-9 has no respawn station which translates to more player conscientiousness of item / ammo consumption along cautious charater movement.\n\nThere SO much more I would love to talk about what this game gets right that so many games miss nowadays.

The initial section you begin in is quite boring, uses the same wall textures and you don't see the whole picture yet.

Also: no dumb quest markers! You might get by just by exploring and picking stuff up, but if you don't actually listen to the audio logs you'll probably end up lost.\n\nYou also start picking up an interesting variety of equipment early on; enemies deal a lot of damage so it's more about using the right tool at the right time, you can't stand there and shoot at them. Some enemies are slow turning and you can actually melee them to death if you approach them from the back.\n\nThe game still has a lot of flaws though:\n- In-game help doesn't display the correct controls, for instance Tab would be supposed to switch weapons but it's Q. Oh and BTW you can't switch weapons with the number keys, which I find infuriating.\n- The movement is really too annoying, it gives you the impression of being stuck every time you try to strafe and go forward/backward at the same time.\n- Picking up loot is incredibly tedious, every other corpse has one or two tiny boosters to manually double-click and drag to your inventory, and you have to also turn mouselook off/on to perform this task.\n- The music is sometimes silly, which goes against the sinister atmosphere.\n- The graphics of beam weapons you fire can appear to hit a wall but still hit enemies, I still have a hard time figuring out if I can hit an enemy even if a small part of him sticks out.\n\nThe story is so far rather run-of-the-mill, several games notably the famous Portal have taken inspiration from this game for their evil AI, so that part doesn't impress.\n\nOverall so far my opinion is positive but only slightly, it could improve depending on how the game evolves. 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1449287506, "timestamp_updated": 1449469737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485820412635803223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19471273": {"recommendationid": "19471273", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996280693", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1449394510}, "language": "english", "review": "I died a lot", "timestamp_created": 1449204232, "timestamp_updated": 1449204232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.440993398427963257", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19433676": {"recommendationid": "19433676", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992941603", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1697495141}, "language": "english", "review": "I was actually really surprised with System Shock.

For your crimes, you are taken to a ship called Citadel Station to develop an Artifical Intelligence, called SHODAN. In return for your hard work, your record is wiped clean and you get a computer interface surgically implemented into your body. Your surgury takes 6 months to heal so you are crotgenetically put to sleep. After 6 months, you awake to find out SHODAN, the AI you developed, became so powerful and advanced it thinks it is god and tries to wipe out the human race with an army of robots, cyborgs, and mutants. You're job is simple, destroy SHODAN before it takes over Earth.\n\nI have not played System Shock 1 before, and once I did, this instantly became one of my favorite games because of how different it is in the controls, interface, and gameplay compared to most shooters of this genre.

Despite gaining critical acclaim, it remained somewhat unpopular among gamers of that time, and in the end the sales weren't sufficient to cover the budget. The reasons for this included high minimal/recommended system specifications, people dismissing it as a Doom clone(which would be really silly nowadays), and the complexity of the gameplay. Too bad, because this game was really special and innovative. For years this game still remained obscure, because the uneditable control scheme was hard to get used to, and making the game run on modern systems, with DOSBox or not, was difficult. Until now, the franchise has been in legal limbo, because the rights to the IP, assets and games themselves were split between multiple unrelated companies, one of which, crazily enough, was an insurance company rather than a gaming one. Thankfully, Night Dive Studios sorted out this situation and acquired the complete rights to the System Shock series. Because of this, you can buy the aforementioned game on both GOG and Steam.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition of System Shock contains all the updates and tweaks to make the game run flawlessly on modern systems without ruining the original experience. The game now runs natively on Windows, and the controls can be configured to whatever you wish(via editing the config file rather than in-game, but still), the primary change in controls is that you can use your mouse to look around and press a button to move the cursor around the screen, similarly to System Shock 2. The game runs in a proper framerate, and you can change the resolution on the fly without crashing the game(the availible ones may seem too small, but if they can fill your screen, that's fine). The music now uses software-generated GeneralMIDI, if you wish to choose a different sounding one, you need to use drivers like VirtualMIDI or BASSMIDI. The installation folder of the game contains extra goodies, which include the soundtrack, some images, a trailer, strategy guides and the manual. Buying the Enhanced Edition allows you to download System Shock Classic, which is the original game without any changes, configured to run in DOSBox.\n\nNow, let's talk about the game itself. The plot involves a hacker hacking into the TriOptimum database to find information about a space station called \"Citadel\". Sadly, while he is doing so, his actions are being discovered, so a couple of TriOptimum security guards abduct him and take him to the aforementioned station. There, the TriOp VP Edward Diego proposes the hacker that if he will remove SHODAN's, the station's main AI, ethical constraints and will give him Level 1 access to her, he will not punish the hacker for hacking into the database and reward him with a neuro-cyberspace-interface. The hacker agrees and does as instructed. Afterwards, he is taken to the hospital level, where he is put in a 6-month coma, while aforementioned implant is grafted onto him. Once he wakes up, he find out that something is not right...\n\nThe gameplay is something really extraordinary when compared to other games of its era. Even though the game was released only about 6 moths after the original Doom, it included many features that wouldn't be widely used in games until many years later. At the beginning of the game, you will have an option to name your character and choose a difficulty level. Unlike in other games, you can alter the difficulty of each gameplay aspect separately. If you are a newcomer, it would be a bad idea to turn Plot and Cyberspace all the way up to 3, save them for a second playthrough, some experience of the game would be necessary to survive there. What's worth mentioning, that if you turn the difficulty all the way down to 0 in each category, your experience with the game would be something similar to developer cheats mode, or perhaps a game suitable for babies.\n\nWhat you need to know is that this game combines FPP view with a point-&-click style gameplay. You can pick up items and drag them to your inventory, you can interact with items that are or are not in the center of your point of view. The interface, after playing around with it, should be rather self explanatory, you can turn on Online Help in the options(or via Alt+H) to get hints on how to use it. The defualt control scheme for this edition may not be as nice as what you've been using in other games, but it still is a major improvement over the original version. E toggles mouselook on/off, Q swithces to the next weapon, Shift+Q switches to the previous weapon, WASD keys move your character, Z and C make your character lean left or right, X makes the player not lean anymore, R, F and V keys change your elevation, from standing upright to crouching to laying on the ground, Shift activates sprint, Space makes you jump, Left mouse button interacts with things and selects things in your inventory, Right mouse button activates your weapon or picks up an item from you inventory keys 1-0 activate particular hardware implants, F1-F10 activate particular interface displays, F1-F5 for the left side of the screen, and F6-F10 for the right one. You may want to read the manual to know some things beforehand, such as what each grenade is supposed to be doing. However, most of the time the game describes what each item is meant to be doing and how it works.\n\nThe combat works fine. As you progress throughout the game, you encounter stronger enemies and gain better equipment. However, some weapons may be of no use to you, they work fine for the most part though. The puzzles are nice and challenging, or at least until we start talking about the ones where you need to place wires. These are like the hardest thing in the game. Thankfully for some, the extras folder contains a guide with solutions to them. This game has an emphasis on plot, so you will be searching logs and other data to solve your objectives. Sometimes the game may be kind of cryptic in terms of what are you supposed to be doing, it isn't much of an issue, as via exploring the game you will learn a lot about your objectives and enviroments. The atmosphere is quite good, you will feel suspension, fear, and possibly even empathy.\n\nThe level design is really nice, quite reminiscent of what oldschool FPSes are known for. The levels are mazelike and contain some cleverly hidden secrets. What some people may not like though are silent snipers in some later levels, who shoot at you without you knwoing where they are or what hit you(they are not very powerful though). The more you play the game, the better you will be at beating it more efficiently.\n\nThe engine the game runs on, being the same one that powerd the Ultima Underworld duology, does a fairly good job. While the level geometery may be kind of blocky, the engine allows for many features not seen in other games like polygonal objects, room over room, software rendered transclucency, physics simulation and more. The graphics, after all these years, still look quite good, the textures are pleasant and the sprites are a joy to look at. The music is really nice, it is both catchy and thrilling. Sound effects are pretty good too, and so is the voice acting. If you are annoyed that the audiologs do not match the written logs, you can install[url=https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=802] this[/url]. There is nothing wrong with doing so.\n\nIn other words, System Shock is an amazing game, that even though it was obscure, it brought innovation to its genre and was a precursor to many games that came out later. After over two decades it is still higly enjoyable, memorable, challenging and gripping. I totally recommend you to play it.", "timestamp_created": 1448198367, "timestamp_updated": 1448204892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702320456504821777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19189400": {"recommendationid": "19189400", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968388696", "num_games_owned": 910, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1273, "last_played": 1559841052}, "language": "english", "review": "System Shock Enhanced is the updated version of the original System Shock. It is probably best described as a Cyberpunk Action Adventure with Survival Horror Elements.\n\nIn System Shock you play as a hacker who got caught while hacking the network of the TriOptimum megacorporation. Luckily for him he gets the chance to have this crime forgiven if he performs a job for the high ranking TriOptimum executive Edward Diego. The hacker is told to meet Diego at TriOptimum\u2019s own Citadel Station and give him level one access to SHODAN (Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network), the highly sophisticated AI that controls most of Citadel Station. To achieve this goal the hacker is forced to remove several control mechanisms but he manages to give Diego complete control over SHODAN and thereby Citadel. As promised the hacker is not persecuted any further and he even receives a special reward: a military grade cyber-interface. After the operation he has to spend six months in cold sleep on Citadel Station to recover. When he wakes up however, the station looks deserted. There are blood splats and broken equipment all over the place and the stations security systems treat the hacker as an enemy. It is quite obvious that SHODAN has gone rogue.\n\nSystem Shock is played in a first person perspective and shares a lot of similarities with the Ultima Underworld games. The game world is a 3D environment while the enemies are represented by sprites. Thinking how badly early, low-polygon NPC models age that is probably a godsend. In the original System Shock you had to use your mouse to click on the corresponding part of the interface in order to move and turn. Also, you had to click and drag a slider to look up or down. Luckily the Enhanced Edition added mouse look. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t there even mouse look in the first place?\u201d I hear you ask? Well, System Shock\u2019s HUD is full of things to click on (That and mouse look was extremely uncommon when System Shock came out.) You manage your weapons, your general inventory, your data reader and your hardware directly from the HUD. This also means that the game does not pause just because you are looting a crate or are managing your inventory. With the addition of mouse look you can press the E key to toggle between free look mode and interaction mode. With that, System Shock 1 controls pretty much in the same way as System Shock 2.\n\nThere is a plethora of weapons to find, ranging from rather weak weapons like a lead pipe, a dart pistol and a regular pistol to very effective ones like a laser rapier, a magnum and rail gun and the fully-automatic Skorpion gun (By the way, that is German for scorpion, who would have guessed?). While there are a maximum number of weapons you can carry at a given time there is no limit to the number of grenades and drugs you can have with you. There are various types of grenades like frag, gas, EMP, or earthshaker as well as drugs, ranging from healing over time to stamina boost, melee damage boost and bullet-time. As with the weapons there is only space in your main inventory for a set number of items. Items that go into your main inventory are for example medikits, batteries to replenish your health and energy and logic probes which can be used once to solve a puzzle automatically.\n\nThere are two resources: health and energy. You need energy to fire energy weapons as well as to use most of your hardware. At the beginning you do not have much hardware to choose from but additional pieces can be found and upgraded later. There are several pieces of hardware to collect, for example a headlight, an energy shield or jet boosters that allow for limited flight. While some of your hardware does not require energy most will drain it to a certain degree while in use. You can replenish your energy by either using a battery or preferably charging up at one of the Citadel\u2019s energy stations.\n\nWhile you will be in the physical world for a majority of the game System Shock has some cyberspace segments. At certain points you are able to jack in at an access point and enter cyberspace. While you are jacked in you are floating through a series of rooms with walls that are composed variously colored grids. You main goal is to flip certain switches in order to make progress in the physical world. You will also be fighting of defense programs and collect upgrades for your cyberspace.\n\nOther than that you will also need to solve puzzles in the physical world. Most of the time these are logic puzzles. If you solve them you can unlock doors, disable force fields and re-enable deactivated bridges.\n\nSystem Shock is not a game that holds your hand at all. For the most part you have to piece together what you need to do from the information you get from audio logs (Yes, this was the first game to use audio logs.) You are immediately thrown into the action and have a lot of freedom in where you want to go and what you want to do. For some players this might be off-putting but the game gives you everything you need if you take the time to figure things out. On most decks there is a restoration unit that will automatically bring you back to life once you have activated it. This might sound as if it makes the game far too easy but the enemies deal high amounts of damage and you will feel the tension when you are on a floor where you have not found the restoration unit yet.\n\nThe thing System Shock does best in my opinion is the sense of progression it gives to the player. Each floor has to be conquered. You will be unlocking doors, activating lights, bridges and elevators, destroying security cameras and re-activating restoration units. All of this contributes to a great sense of progression when you slowly make a floor yours. All of that is taken away though when you get to a floor where you have not been yet. When I played System Shock back in the 90\u2019s it scared the hell out of me. It does not scare me like that anymore but it is still a pretty tense experience. Even in places where you have been before you cannot feel completely safe since the enemies have a nasty habit for respawning. Also, SHODAN is always there breathing down you neck. Unlike most other games in System Shock the final boss is always there watching, sending you threats and sending their troops against you.\n\nSystem Shock is an old game and it shows. However, the thing that held it back most was its antiquated control scheme that was not up to snuff by today\u2019s standards. With that solved it holds up pretty well, even today. Newcomers might at first be irritated by its lack of hand-holding and its vast, sometimes maze-like levels. But if you get into the game you are up for a tense atmospheric ride that you will not forget.\n\n[h1]More reviews [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BreadAndGames/discussions/0/530647080134504408/[/url]here", "timestamp_created": 1448100642, "timestamp_updated": 1448100827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597958862781524658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19139770": {"recommendationid": "19139770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002171450", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1130, "last_played": 1642515711}, "language": "english", "review": "Before there was Ryan Industries there was Tri-Optimum Corporation, before there was GLaDOS there was SHODAN, before there was Deus Ex or Bioshock there was System Shock.

This is nothing more than smoke and mirrors on Looking Glass Studio's part. \n\nSystem Shock was essentially designed around being Ultima Underworld in Space, and features one of the first examples of a 3D environment in a first person shooter. Unlike it's sequel, System Shock plays more like a first person shooter. It controls very awkwardly, and this surprisingly adds to the horror atmosphere. You move around the environments like you're drunk, and doing things like switching weapons, to reloading, to using your inventory is much harder than it needs to be. As a result combat is very tense for all the wrong reasons. This, and the techno soundtrack adds to the paranoid 2001 inspired atmosphere.\n\nThe world of System Shock is very abstract. Most of the geometry is very square, with grainy low-res textures that only very loosely portray what they're supposed to. It actually adds to the creepiness of this game. Everything feels off and nothing feels like it should. It was one of the first games to feature audio logs, which gives you a lot of incentives to explore due to the great voice acting. The storytelling to System Shock is actually pretty good and it's a shame it was so held back by it's technology. \n\nSystem Shock is a horror game that scares you for all the reasons it shouldn't.

New players will still find SHODAN as intimidating as seasoned vets, and the gameplay interface has been updated slightly in ways that make it simpler to \"mouselook\" in this game than it used to be (Remember, that was a new thing). \n\nIf you have played them before, be forewarned, using DoSBox  will cause a glitch in the endgame where SHODAN fills the screen faster than you can attack if you try to use your old media.   It's worth the money to buy this game on Steam, as a lot of the features which suffered under emulation seem to be ironed out. \n\n1000/10, one of my top 5 games of all time, would recommend again and then found a religion over it.", "timestamp_created": 1446317593, "timestamp_updated": 1446317593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18787319": {"recommendationid": "18787319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082925829", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 993, "last_played": 1677890750}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, once you forget every logical thing you have ever learned about gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1446283161, "timestamp_updated": 1446340040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18779470": {"recommendationid": "18779470", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992521116", "num_games_owned": 606, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1121, "last_played": 1527518197}, "language": "english", "review": "Much easier to get into than you'd expect.

It's really just as good, if not better, in my opinion. This Enhanced Edition on Steam comes with the standard floppy and CD releases of System Shock 1, as well, so don't worry: If you don't want HD graphics or modified controls in a classic DOS game, you don't have to deal with that stuff at all. A lot of new gamers are s-h-i-t-t-y at video games, so they need mouselook or whatever. If you think you're not terrible at games, the normal, classic controls are just fine. They just take an hour or so to get totally used to, since they are unusual. \n\nAnyway, this game is great. \n\nI recommend playing on the hardest difficulty, since there are machines you have to find and enable on each sector of the space station that are essentially regeneration chambers, things that people who've played System Shock 2 first will easily recognize. Thing is, dying and respawning (with low health) in one of these costs you nothing at all, so you should definitely choose the timed-gameplay setting in the difficulty options as well, where a 7-hour time limit  (part of the story) is imposed on the game. This makes it so the \"revive in a room with no consequences\" mechanic does have a consequence other than \"get annoyed that I have to walk back to some other room\". Personally, I just avoided the regeneration things altogether.\n\nBesides that, the game has a great atmosphere, and it has all the complex movements that System Shock 2 had, and more. You can lean, crouch, go prone, jump, sprint, and climb up ledges. You can lean while crouching or going prone, as well. If you play on my recommended difficulty setting, the game is less of a \"sprint around hallways and hit guys with shotguns with my wrench before they hit me\" type of game like System Shock 2, and more of a Rainbow Six in Space type of game. This is because you really need to lean around corners and go prone or crouch while shooting to avoid getting killed in like two seconds. It's also because there are plenty of grenades/mines that you have at your disposal that explode on impact or just very quickly, so you usually want to throw them around corners and get out of the way fast.\n\nThere are no PSI powers like in System Shock 2, but you will find new implants for your \"Military-grade Neuro-Interface\" that'll do stuff like let you run fast, or fly vertically. These and other implants have multiple hardware upgrades that you will (or not) find throughout the game. \n\nSpeaking of PSI, there is no PSI meter by your health, but instead, an electric energy meter. The implants you gain and all energy weapons will use this shared power source, which can be recharged with battery items or static power-stations.\n\nYour interface lets you jack into computers to access cyberspace, which is probably the most 90s thing you'll ever see in a videogame. I'd explain it here, but it's honestly so much more amazing when you play the game and go \"OH GOD WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON\"\n\nThe story is awesome. The story is explained in the intro cinematic, which I will post a link to here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ITiEm6W5EM\n\n\nSo yeah. System Shock is the apex predator of cyberpunk videogames.
