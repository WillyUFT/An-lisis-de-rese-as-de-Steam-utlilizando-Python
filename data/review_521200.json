[/h1]\n[h2] Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (5/5) [/h2] \n\n\n\nI recently played Epic Battle Fantasy 3 on Steam and I have to say, I absolutely loved it. The game is a perfect combination turn-based battles, strategic thinking, and a whimsical sense of humor.\n\nThe graphics in the game are stunning, with beautifully detailed backgrounds and intricate character designs. The animations are smooth and fluid, making each battle feel like a spectacle. The attention to detail is evident throughout the game, from the intricate spell effects to the humorous expressions of the characters.\n\nThe gameplay is addictive and engaging. The battles are challenging but not overly difficult, allowing for a perfect balance of strategy and fun. There are numerous skills and abilities to unlock and upgrade, giving players a sense of progression and making each battle feel different and rewarding.\n\nI also enjoyed the variety of enemies and bosses in the game. Each enemy has different strengths and weaknesses, forcing players to think strategically and plan their attacks accordingly. The boss battles are particularly exciting, with epic showdowns that require careful planning and execution.\n\nOne aspect of the game that really stood out to me was the sense of humor. The dialogue is filled with witty banter and pop culture references, making me laugh out loud several times. The characters themselves are quirky and endearing, each with their own distinct personalities.\n\nOverall, Epic Battle Fantasy 3 is a fantastic game that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based RPGs. The stunning graphics, engaging gameplay, and hilarious dialogue make it a truly memorable experience. I can't wait to see what the developers come up with next.\n\n\n\n[b] -Like Final Fantasy, but a Flash based game.

flash game from my childhood and brings some of the best that world had to offer. EBF 3 is a fantastic game and was so much fun to play through and finally beat since I couldn't do it as a little kid. Everything about this game just....works. The art style holds up even to today's standards and fits wonderfully. The music oh god the music is so good and I found myself just humming away at it while exploring what the game had to offer. The characters you have are amusing and I found myself liking all 3 of them. The humor in the game is pretty funny and doesn't get on my nerves like it does in a lot of other games. The game doesn't take itself seriously and that's something I absolutely love about it. Easily a top 3 flash game behind Raze and SFH and I'd highly recommend anyone who hasn't played it to check it out!\n\nThe combat in this game is simplistic yet it works perfectly. There are a wide range of moves and builds you can utilize depending on the region. Hunting for items and components to upgrade them is fun and doesn't feel annoying in the slightest. The elemental system of combat is something I quite enjoyed especially since there are a wide variety of elements you can use. Almost all of the abilities feel useful in some way shape or form. A wide variety of opponents keeps the game fresh as you jump from world to world. The enemies aren't a joke either, especially further into the game and on higher difficulties. In the last two worlds and ESPECIALLY the bosses, the enemies will brutalize you for making one mistake on the harder difficulties and you'll have to restart. That said, the game doesn't feel unfair to play with the exception of the MONOLITHS and the reaper strike some of the World 5 enemies do. Getting instakilled based on RNG is irritating and the monoliths are a little overtuned in my opinion, especially if you are playing blind and not expecting them.\n\nAll in all, this game is fantastic. I can't wait to try the 4th and 5th one since I've heard they are even better than this one and this one was super fun. Killing that last boss was so satisfying. If you haven't, please play this game. It's so good.\n\nFinal Grade: 9/10 - A Crown Jewel of the Flash World", "timestamp_created": 1684618903, "timestamp_updated": 1684618903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138338386": {"recommendationid": "138338386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119416448", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3124, "last_played": 1686203494}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite rpgs.

The characters are all silly and charming and generally fun to hang out with, the gameplay loop that would go on to appear in 4 and 5 is much simpler here, but still fun to play regardless.

You can spend hours upon hours exploring the game's vibrant world and battling monsters, all without spending a single penny.\n\nWhat's a RPG game without hours of grinding? Farming the same monster for that specific loot? You can go crazy in this game, also mindless revisiting ALL previous map for hidden paths and treasures...\n\nI've personally played this game for over 28.9 hours and I can say that it never gets old. The humor is always fresh and the battles are always challenging. The game's art style is colorful and eye-catching, and the weapons and other equipment are just plain fun to look at.\n\nIf you're a fan of turn-based RPGs and don't mind a little bit of silly humor, then \"Epic Battle Fantasy 3\" is definitely worth checking out. I hope the developers continue to make more sequels because I can't get enough of this fun and quirky game!\n\nIn conclusion, this game is suitable for players of all ages and offers hours of enjoyable gameplay.

This, as another review has stated, is \"A love letter to 90's and early 2000's anime.\" This game has an engaging, and soothing soundtrack that you can easily enjoy without much attention paid to it. Along with these beautiful displays of gaming, it makes you think outside the box, focusing on what is best, and upgrading them as much as you can, strategizing every step you make. With simple, yet complex art, a balanced yet optionally cruel combat system, and engaging battles, this is one of the best, if not THE best, old games I used to play in my childhood, now revisited with a better mind. I have pressured not 2, not 3, but FOUR people into getting this game, and playing it.

golden days, this was one of the games that I played the most.\nI tried this again and I still had fun with it, it is one of the turn-based games that are well done despite the smaller budget, of course, this game is very old and you can definetely notice that on some aspects, but it is still worth playing it\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nDifficulty\n\nyou can obviously choose the difficulty, so it depends. the balancing is a bit off sometimes (some enemies are way too easy and some are way too hard despite the difficulty rating) it also sometimes suffers from having to grind in order to beat stronger enemies on higher difficulty, even if you have a good strategy. the abilities are also not balanced very well, but it is still nicely done. the bosses are different, the encounters aren't too long and difficult and you have a choice of building your characters.\n\n\u26aa Primitive\n\u26aa easy\n\ud83d\udfe3 normal / depends\n\u26aa Challenging\n\u26aa Literal torture...\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nStoryline\n\nIt has very stereotypical fantasy \"save the world from demon of darkness\" kind of story with few adjustments, the plot isn't really that interesting but it is still fun, the sequels (?) have the same vibe but the writting gets a little better with nice twists and differences.\nDo not expect an amazing plot, still a nice setup for a turn-bases game though\n\n\u26aa No story / very basic-bad story\n\ud83d\udfe3 OK story / difficult to understand\n\u26aa Good story\n\u26aa Very well written and great story\n\u26aa  Amazing storyline, Huge bonds with characters\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nAmusement / Fun\n\nExcept a few annoying encounters and enemies, the game is very fun, especially if you are playing lot of old games.\nThe abilities have nice basic visuals and satisfying sfx, the enemies have nice variations and you have ton of ways to build your characters.\n\n\u26aa ResidentSleeper\n\u26aa Its ok, would rather play something else\n\ud83d\udfe3  Fun, enjoyable\n\u26aa Very amusing and fun\n\u26aa One of the most fun games\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nMusic / Soundtrack\n\nthe music is definetely one of the bigger pluses for this game, you would expect something basic but it actually has its own style and it bops, Phyrnna did a wonderful job\n\n\u26aa Very bad / unoriginal / no soundtrack\n\u26aa Its alright but its not very unique or listenable\n\u26aa Good soundtrack\n\ud83d\udfe3 Very nice and beautiful music\n\u26aa Heaven for ears\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nGraphics / Artstyle / Artwork\n\nDespite the older graphics and resolution, the game really has some nice art in it, a lot of creative and nice enemy design \n\n\u26aa Poopoo\n\u26aa Its alright\n\ud83d\udfe3 Good graphics and artwork\n\u26aa Amazing graphics and artwork\n\u26aa Brings tears to my eyes\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nIssues / Bugs\n\nSurprisingly, the game doesn't have lot of bugs\nit has some balancing issues, nothing too game-changing though\n\n\u26aa This game itself is a bug\n\u26aa Looots of issues and bugs\n\u26aa Moderate number of bugs\n\u26aa Few bugs, nothing terrible\n\ud83d\udfe3 Clean, didn't notice anything\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nOverall 7,5/10 Game for me, a nice turn-based rpg to get back into (still need to finish the sequels)\nIf you prefer more

Not a big deal though, and you get used to it.\n    [*]There's a lot of different armors, weapons, hats, and skills but i found no reason to use most of them.

The combat mechanics are pretty straightforward, yet they have enough complexity to make every fight interesting, and it allows for multiple choices and strategies. There are no fights that you would want to win by spamming \"attack\", practically every encounter is challenging enough for a player who leveled normally, there's no stuff like random encounters, every fight has a unique composition, and you can even skip the majority of encounters, since most of them are optional, though you would have to grind levels somewhere else. If you play the game normally by winning every battle once, you will reach the max level, unlock all skills and upgrade most of your equipment, so there's no need to grind except to upgrade the remaining few articles of clothing, and even that should not take more than 20 minutes.\nThe gameplay culminates in one of the best final bosses in JRPGs - you're not gonna be defeating him by spamming the knights of the round table, let me tell you that. It makes you use everything you've learnt about the game, while the best final boss music is blasting from your sound device of choice\n\nGraphically, modern JRPGs either fully embraced 3D, or doubled down on nostalgia by making the graphics look like the 4th generation of consoles and by using static sprites. So here is a beautiful 2D game where every character or foe, as well as their attacks and skills, are animated, and every piece of equipment is visibly represented on your characters. The art style is inspired by anime, but is deliberately distinct and unique, so even if you have an aversion towards weaboo stuff (like I had when I first saw the game on Armor Games), give it a chance, it really has a different flavor.\n\nThe only thing that can be faulted about this game is that there's practically no plot. The plot is a mere subtext for you to travel through the world and beat the obstacles on your path, but I personally would not take it any other way, it kinda helps the general lighthearted yet black-comedic mood, and makes the fourth wall jokes funny instead of grating.\n\nOh yeah, and also minigames are lame", "timestamp_created": 1632258664, "timestamp_updated": 1632356432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583353579044342041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99577480": {"recommendationid": "99577480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140821964", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 855, "last_played": 1651507393}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game, I have been playing it for 10 years!", "timestamp_created": 1631991256, "timestamp_updated": 1631991256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99498868": {"recommendationid": "99498868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241013158", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1478, "last_played": 1632505638}, "language": "english", "review": "very gud.", "timestamp_created": 1631883271, "timestamp_updated": 1631883271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99329433": {"recommendationid": "99329433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965552665", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1133, "last_played": 1662537980}, "language": "english", "review": "The Flash experience", "timestamp_created": 1631607961, "timestamp_updated": 1631607961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99319943": {"recommendationid": "99319943", "author": {"steamid": "76561199164609435", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1670380361}, "language": "english", "review": "1 HP wow i\"m lucky", "timestamp_created": 1631587611, "timestamp_updated": 1631588655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99224751": {"recommendationid": "99224751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087883181", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 1506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 904, "last_played": 1632289002}, "language": "english", "review": "I love just about everything about this game.

It never ceased to amaze me, and I always wanted to keep playing it, defeating more and more powerful foes and listening to the brilliant soundtrack. But enough of the nostalgia - let's focus on EBF3. This game is where, in my opinion, the series took off. \n\nAt it's core, it is a JRPG turn-based game. It features 3 playble characters as seen in the screenshots - Matt, Natalie and Lance. I won't say that it's a very deep game gameplay wise, but depth is present. It's not just about spamming any attack - enemies have resistance to certain elements, so they will take way less damage, sometimes even zero. On the other hand, they have weaknesses too - you can deal extra damage. Same applies to your characters as well. \n\nThere are plenty of skills for each character. You can summon rain of giants swords upon your enemy, make a giant black hole, or even launch a nuclear missille.\n\nAs opposed to its predecessor, EBF2, this game features an open world. There are 6 different areas in total, each has its own theme. You progress from a peaceful forest town with slimes and bushes to space with cosmic monoliths and dragons. Wild, right?\n\nThe story is there, but it isn't the game's focus. It's about 3 adventurers saving the world from the old evil that has awakened and wreaked havoc in the world. It's filled with humour and a lot of references, so if you are a fan of serious settings, you wouldn't enjoy this as much.\n\nVisually, graphics are not bad for a flash game made in 2010. It has overall cartoonish style, but art in combat is great, skills and equipment are detailed. The UI can seem a bit weird to use.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, it always fits the area it is playing in. I think it has the most iconic songs of the series, for example \"You'll never guess this!\", \" Wings\" or \"Estavius\". The main menu greets you with \"That Which We Have Lost And Forgotten\" and, in my opinion, that's the most beautiful song in all of EBF.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful game and I would absolutely recommend it to any fan of RPG games.", "timestamp_created": 1629840297, "timestamp_updated": 1629840297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671286702156066895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98127973": {"recommendationid": "98127973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030691885", "num_games_owned": 1908, "num_reviews": 638, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1630032372}, "language": "english", "review": "Gosh i haven't taken a nostalgia hit like this in awhile.

The graphics are clean, bright, beautiful, imaginative, and very well animated. The game play is rock solid with unique upgradeable gear and weapons that can change the character's role depending on what's equipped and can be switched out mid-battle.. The player characters are enjoyable and likeable.\n\nLots of hidden areas, scavenger type side quests, and mini-games.\n\nThere's a few cons, sure. Scavenger type side quests means a lot of grinding for the drops necessary to complete them. But for the most part they are optional. \n\nGrinding, however, is not, as the mobs in each new bite-sized area you enter are of higher level than the previous, And each area is very tiny, with about two to four battles per area. And weapon/armor upgrades require rarer and more numerous item drops.

If you mostly play these games for the story and don't really care about the mechanics at all, I wouldn't blame you for passing this one up, unless your nostalgia for 2000s anime fandom is quite strong.\n\nGiven that Epic Battle Fantasy 3 is both a mechanically solid game and free, it's going to get a strong recommendation from me.

Chronologically considering the series, this game, by far, is more more complex, larger scale, and just generally more fun than the two prior games.\n\nThe expansion of the combat system, molding it to be more intuitive and uniform, was essential.  The myriad of skills was nice, although one can discern this as the predecessor to the fourth and fifth games, where the options are even more vast and every skill fills more of a niche (lots of overlapping skills and lacking of others).  The transition to more of a JRPG format was surprising, but it made this my go-to when I was young over the previous games simply because it felt rewarding to slowly uncover the map and upgrade equipment \u2014 progress could be made and it became less of a linear arcade game.  The sheer amount of unique enemies and good designs for bosses made it interesting to make this progression through the different areas.\n\nAs the series is known for, the dialogue is very self-aware.  It satirizes RPG tropes, alludes to pop culture, and makes pretty overt innuendos at every opportunity.  This is what makes the game lovable though.  It does not pretend to have some archetypal fantasy lore that immerses the player; it has about the same vibe as any other flash game from the 2000s.\n\nEBF3 is not as polished as the fourth game, and it certainly is nowhere near as polished as the fifth.  However, the unpolished quality is nostalgic and adds to the attitude the game has about itself (which is why I find this game more fun than EBF4 \u2014 hot take).  This simultaneously feels like a flash game and does not feel like a flash game, and to accomplish something like that means a lot of work was put in.  And the game is even free!

Monsters always go top to bottom.\n+ Even your starting equipment can be relevant in the end-game as rather than providing a flat ATK/DEF boost, they multiply the character's base stats by given percentages; they also provide varying degrees of extra resistance to elements/status ailments (heck, one can [i]absorb[/i] damage and heal if their resistance to a given element is over 100%) and have extra casting effects sometimes as you upgrade them (such as the White Mage Dress auto-casting Regen on the party at random at high tiers).\n+ There's some bonus content depending on how far along you are with achievements - in a few cases, you can actually get bonus items/equipment! (Although these are often guarded by encounters significantly tougher than the average encounter for the area you're in.)\n+ This game takes tropes often seen in more well-known RPGs and uses them to great advantage. What's not to love about parodying such things?\n+ > There's a lot of humor and references in this game, but I don't imagine that a lot of it's aged particularly well over the years. Ranging from something as tame and blatant as a Dragonball Z reference to... well, I'd be referring to one of the end-game monsters if I were to talk about the other end of the spectrum.\n+ Game's perfectly free; No DLC or anything, so you're only losing time if you end up not liking the game. EBF4 and 5 also have free online versions like 3 does, but you don't immediately get some of the content with 4 and 5's online versions.\n+ KITTENS! Except you have to fight them. BUT SOME ARE RIDING MECHANICAL HORSES THAT THEY THEMSELVES BUILT! But you also have to fight those. WELL THEY'RE ALL STILL CUTE!\n+ The music is always a frickin banger, nuff said.\n\nGeneral cons:\n- A more mild con is that EBF3's unpolished when compared to 4 and 5, but the art-style and animation are still wonderful.\n- The story's about as close to an excuse plot as you're gonna get while still keeping it relevant (literally, monster screws your team over and leaves them back to square one with the bare essentials to do things, time to get back at the thing) while 4 and 5 have more proper stories, but I think it's really part of the parody-ness of the game.\n- Whole-heartedly, don't expect like a 445-hour experience trying to 100% this game, it's more or less about 10-15 hours long. (Giving a range as how much time you take to beat the main game alone can easily vary based on the difficulty you're playing on.)\n- > On the topic of difficulty, this game can and [i]will[/i] absolutely wreck you on the Epic difficulty (monsters deal 160% of their normal damage and they also get assorted bonuses). I'm certain the game was more balanced with Normal mode in mind, so select Epic at your own risk.\n- Someone said this too so I may as well echo it; Cosmic Monoliths exist in the end-game (I've already felled one so far) and trust me, they're about as deadly as they might sound by the name, their opening attack's animation just [b]e x u d e s[/b] power. Brace for pain and some extremely close scrapes with these things.\n\nWith all that said, give this game a whirl if you want!

(I don't recommend going for 100% completion, it can break a man.)\n\nGraphics / Art Style: The graphics and animations aren't exceptional, but they get the job done, and most of the enemy designs are fun and inventive. (personal favourite being the gunslinger robots) \n\nStory: The story is the game's biggest weakpoint, it boils down to; big monster knocked the exp out of you, go hunt it down. If you enjoy rich, story driven games, this won't scratch that itch. (Though some of the character interactions are hilarious)\n\nGameplay: Battles make up the majority of EBF3's gameplay, and if you don't enjoy the combat the rest of the game will very quickly start to drag, but if you enjoy the JRPG turn based style, this should be a treat, with some great boss battles.\nThere are a number of parts in the game that serve no real purpose (mostly the minigames) except to gain a couple achievements.\n\nMusic: The music in this game is brilliant, and is easily one of the best points of the game. (Though again, personal taste will factor into your enjoyment)\n\nMisc: There is a very big point that has to be made about this game before you get it. In terms of balance and fine-tuning, this game is all over the place, this isn't too obvious if you're playing on Normal, but on the higher difficulties it becomes pretty glaringly obvious.\n\nPrice: Obviously, the game is free, but unlike most free games on Steam, it's actually free. No Pay2Win, no microtransactions at all. Think of the game as a sort of Demo for the rest of the series.\nThe game's sequels, EBF4 and 5 are better than this game in almost every way, (Hence their actual pricetag) but this game serves perfectly as an introduction to the rest of the series, because it's free, you can play it and decide if you want to buy the sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1593437354, "timestamp_updated": 1593437522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602630615234375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71606197": {"recommendationid": "71606197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127931675", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 824, "last_played": 1593377195}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of the best games to come from the flash area, a short and fun JRPG-like game, and its freee?!?!??!\nPlay it, not a minute wasted doing so.", "timestamp_created": 1593381208, "timestamp_updated": 1593381208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71493848": {"recommendationid": "71493848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194040497", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1356, "last_played": 1654164842}, "language": "english", "review": "Nep Nep!", "timestamp_created": 1593268464, "timestamp_updated": 1652895894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71432526": {"recommendationid": "71432526", "author": {"steamid": "76561199058228278", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3246, "last_played": 1655065273}, "language": "english", "review": "i love everything about this game", "timestamp_created": 1593203839, "timestamp_updated": 1700684375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71338883": {"recommendationid": "71338883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053852166", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 967, "last_played": 1613435776}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been bullied by epic difficulty final boss for over a year.", "timestamp_created": 1593115002, "timestamp_updated": 1593115002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70927654": {"recommendationid": "70927654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007640972", "num_games_owned": 667, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 714, "last_played": 1498526295}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] 's good.

Use revive or heal food when needed.\nThe girl is magic resist buff, debuff enemy, magic attack increase on the gunner and revive if ever needed.\nAnd the gunner was the guy doing dmg in this build, focusing the mobs and SLOWLY killing boss while doing so.\nNatalie has white dress for heals and all the rest is focused on dark and doom resist etc, weapons hat armor, everything.\nThe black monoloths did 0 damage with their doom spell and even healed Matt, while the boss did like 50% health damage with his biggest skills. Keep evasion defence and magic defence at 50-70% at all times and you should be super fine!

I really like the upgrade to weapons/armor thing, It feels nice to just have a maxed out weapon or armor, and just being able to take damage or deal a lot of damage. Honestly all the skill animations are amazing, and overall I love those characters.\n\nThe Soundtrack:\nOmfg, just freaking download the soundtrack. Is AMAZING, In terms of music this game, gets a clear 10/10. My favorite soundtrack is probably the battle soundtrack, it just hypes me up so much!. (Might be in my opinion the best game soundtrack I've every head)\n\nOverall:\n10/10 stars, The game, the characters and the music. Just make this game so amazing, I would recommend everyone to try this game, and seeing that is free to play.

Ha sido toda una sorpresa.\nPero mi mayor sorpresa no era ver que este juego estaba en Steam, sino que la franquicia est\u00e1 m\u00e1s viva que nunca cuando pensaba que hab\u00eda ca\u00eddo en el olvido.\n\n\n\n\nAdvierto que se viene tocho de los gordos, ya que este juego tiene un gran significado para mi.\n\n\nEn una \u00e9poca donde no exist\u00edan los videojuegos F2P como Warframe o Fornite, los pobres nos busc\u00e1bamos la vida navegando en Internet buscando juegos en Google. \u00c9poca donde no ten\u00edas una consola de Nintendo o de Sega, pero ten\u00edas la Potato Master Race que solo corr\u00eda el buscaminas y un juego de pinball de Windows que era el vicio padre.\n\nAh\u00ed es donde descubr\u00ed Minijuegos.com, una web espa\u00f1ola donde se publicaba una gran cantidad juegos flash (muchos de Newgrounds) con un peque\u00f1o resumen en espa\u00f1ol (aunque luego todos estaban en ingl\u00e9s).\n\n\u00bfQui\u00e9n necesitaba una SNES teniendo el Super Mario Cutre-Flash en PC?\nMuchas franquicias de videojuegos las descubr\u00ed gracias a esta web junto a muchas otras como Mundijuegos, Juegosarea y un largo etc...\n\nTambi\u00e9n descubr\u00ed desde ah\u00ed grandes animaciones flash como Madness Combat o Super Mario Bros Z.\n\n\n\nEntre muchos juegos de gran calidad como Strategy Defense, Traffic Slam, el juego del MacDonalds y, mi favorito, el Super Smash Flash, se encontraba Epic Battle Fantasy.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy empez\u00f3 siendo un juego flash del ment\u00f3n que su sistema de combate estaba totalmente inspirado en los antiguos Final Fantasy (del 1 al 6). Consist\u00eda en juego de rol por turnos el cual nos enfrent\u00e1bamos a muchas oleadas de enemigos y un jefe antes de volver a la tienda a comprar pociones. Me acuerdo que el jefe final del juego era un \"Goku zombi\" y siempre intent\u00e9 derrotarlo en dificultad Epic pero era imposible.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 2 era su continuaci\u00f3n, pero con mucha m\u00e1s personalidad. Esta vez ya contaba con m\u00fasica propia (en vez de m\u00fasica de Final Fantasy y similares) y dise\u00f1aron una historia. Matt y Natalie deb\u00edan derrotar a un villano que result\u00f3 ser Lance y deb\u00edan abrirse paso entre muchos enemigos, los cuales hab\u00eda nuevos y antiguos (como las babas, que son el icono del juego).\n\nY finalmente est\u00e1 Epic Battle Fantasy 3, que dej\u00f3 de ser un juego solo de batallas por oleadas y pas\u00f3 a tener una aventura dividida en un mapa con mucho contenido y exploraci\u00f3n.\nMe acuerdo que en su d\u00eda, cuando era un cr\u00edo, nunca llegaba hasta al final porque nunca se me guardaban los datos, ya que el juego lo jugaba online y no se guardaban datos en la red como pasa ahora con los juegos F2P. Es por eso que me alegr\u00e9 verlo en Steam donde si se guarda mi progreso.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabiendo explicado todo eso, hablemos del juego.\n\nEl juego trata de unos tres personajes que son h\u00e9roes y deben salvar el mundo de un poderoso villano llamado Akron. Durante el viaje se enfrentar\u00e1n a poderosos monstruos que interrumpir\u00e1n su camino, saquear\u00e1n tesoros y forjar\u00e1n sus armas y armaduras  para volverse los guerreros m\u00e1s poderosos.\n\nPor lo gen\u00e9rica que es la trama, el juego no se toma en serio a si mismo e incluso los personajes se burlan de sus propios estereotipos. Es un juego que sabe re\u00edrse de si mismo y a la vez parodiar a otros juegos de su mismo g\u00e9nero, as\u00ed como animes y pel\u00edculas.\n\n\n\nHablemos de la jugabilidad:\n\nLo que me encanta de este juego es que es muy friendly con el jugador y a\u00fan as\u00ed sigue siendo desafiante.\nCuando digo \"friendly\" me refiero a que el juego pone pocas penalizaciones y hacen el juego m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo y disfrutable. Por ejemplo, aqu\u00ed no hay combates aleatorios: ves a los enemigos y peleas contra ellos cuando quieres y si quieres los ignoras. Habr\u00e1 enemigos que te interrumpir\u00e1n el camino, pero peleas contra ellos CUANDO TU QUIERES y no cuando el juego quiere.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, puedes abandonar cualquier combate sin ninguna penalizaci\u00f3n, incluso contra jefes, lo que permite un turno para analizar al jefe que te vas a enfrentar sin recibir da\u00f1o y luego tranquilamente, fuera de combate, te cambias las armas y armaduras para tener ventaja contra este.\n\n\n\u00bfDe que ventajas hablamos?\nAl igual que los Epic Battle Fantasy anteriores, los enemigos tienen resistencias y debilidades a ciertos elementos, al igual que tus personajes seg\u00fan la armadura que lleven.\n\nEs muy similar a los efectos y estados que hay en Pokemon, aunque se podr\u00edan comprar con muchos juegos de rol (si es que conociese alguno m\u00e1s con el que comparar directamente).\n\n\n\nPor \u00faltimo, me gustar\u00eda hablar de algunos aspectos t\u00e9cnicos del juego.\n\nNo me voy a poner muy exigente porque hablamos de un juego hecho por una sola persona y est\u00e1 muy currado en todos los aspectos, aunque esto de que no se pueda poner a pantalla completa y tenga resoluci\u00f3n de un juego de port\u00e1til quiz\u00e1s a m\u00e1s de uno no le acabe de gustar.\n\nA\u00fan as\u00ed el juego de ve bien y adem\u00e1s tiene una m\u00fasica muy buena, adem\u00e1s de ciertos \"efectos especiales\" de los Limit Break que molan bastante (en especial el Kyun).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResumen:\n\n*LO BUENO\n- Buen juego de rol por turnos.\n- Mucho contenido y exploraci\u00f3n.\n- Buena historia.\n- Buenos personajes.\n- Buen humor.\n- Muy friendly con el jugador.\n- Muy f\u00e1cil al principio y muy dif\u00edcil al final.\n- Muy divertido.\n- Buena m\u00fasica.\n- ES GRATIS Y SIN MICROPAGOS, A DESCARGAR YA!!!\n\n*LO MALO (y no hay para tanto)\n- Gr\u00e1ficos hechos por paint y a mala resoluci\u00f3n. No tiene pantalla completa.\n- No tiene contenido post-game.\n- No est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol.\n\n\nDejando en claro todo esto, yo recomiendo a todo el mundo empezar la saga de Epic Fantasy Battle por este (el 1 y el 2 no est\u00e1n en Steam de lo simples que son, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed los pod\u00e9is buscar en Internet y probar, pero no son obligatorios).\n\nSe trata de uno de estos juegos que no dejar\u00e1n huella en la historia de los videojuegos, pero nos dar\u00e1n horas de diversi\u00f3n y unas cuantas risas aseguradas.\n\n\n\nPor cierto, si no has le\u00eddo todo lo que he escrito tranquilo, yo tampoco.\n\nMi relaci\u00f3n con los textos tochos es directamente proporcional a la relaci\u00f3n entre Matt y los rompecabezas.", "timestamp_created": 1564349407, "timestamp_updated": 1564349407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54206256": {"recommendationid": "54206256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138912567", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1751, "last_played": 1611191315}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice", "timestamp_created": 1563687720, "timestamp_updated": 1563687720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478142082691192627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54188264": {"recommendationid": "54188264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371452213", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1645221980}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ponganlo en espa\u00f1ol >:U, igual buen trabajo con el juego", "timestamp_created": 1563590467, "timestamp_updated": 1563590467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54095796": {"recommendationid": "54095796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141497461", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 822, "last_played": 1625252390}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely fun.

What dialogue there is, is mostly meaningless and lacks any form of passion or character design, it's just words on a screen. There really is not any humor, childish or not, it's just random whatever conversations that are trying to be zany but there's actually no joke or clever wording; it's just pointless nonsense dialogue.\n\nThe combat is stock turn based role playing fights. No innovation or intricacy or any form of divergence at all from the basic format which is generally just a damage race dressed up as strategy. No satisfaction to how it plays out or any level of purposeful effort to make it unique or appealing. Yet it is pretty much the entire game, meaningless combat encounter after meaningless combat encounter. Picking up numerous items, asinine fetch quests and having to factor in loads of strength and weakness statistics on enemies which all serve as filler for where actual dynamic gameplay mechanics would be.\n\nThe world gives no sense of immersion what with the confined scopeless maps with loud generic fantasy music sounding off at all times. The characters and world itself are just a jumble of whatever random juvenile ideas the developer could come up with, there is zero consistency to the world itself or its nature; and what is there is completely bland and typical. The computer characters are void of identity and the protagonists are just generic adolescent fantasy personas, as represented by the boring dialogue they have. And the computer characters are absolutely everywhere, as if you are meant to talk to all them multiple times to fill up the space where a real story or narrative would be. Yet none of them have anything interesting or enjoyable to say, the screenshots of them saying funny things account for a fraction of how many are actually in the game.\n\n\nAs a whole it just feels very much like the kind of thing an adolescent developer with a lot of time on their hands would come up with. A copy paste combat system in a world filled with incoherent juvenile fiction with no overarching vision to why any of this is happening or exists. This one may be free but its successors are not and by the looks of it they all are this exact same shallow format with mild advancements in between.\n\nAnd apparently one of the characters can get an actual Nazi uniform as an outfit, which only reinforces the shallow tone of this whole thing.", "timestamp_created": 1544557541, "timestamp_updated": 1699283510, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.282958030700683594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47467858": {"recommendationid": "47467858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171718019", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1174, "last_played": 1527274552}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]Epic Battle Fantasy 3[/h1]\n\n\nRecuerdo que este fue el primer juego flash que lo jugaba en una pagina llamada [url=https://armorgames.com/]armorgames.com[/url] despues de llegar de la primaria a descansar y a jugar, claro, tambien jugaba otros juegos flash, pero este es el que tenia mas ganas. Cuando tenia 10 a\u00f1os, me encantaba jugar a este juego y lo jugaba en la dificultad mas dificil, conocida como epica, pero en ese momento deje el juego por que me quede atascado en una bossfight, el segundo boss exactamente (en ese momento no sabia mucho de las resistencias), pero cuando tenia 14 a\u00f1os, recorde este juego y se me dio la idea de buscar en steam para ver si estaba y me sorprendi, no dude en instalarlo para volver a jugarlo, y esta vez, pude derrotar al segundo boss y por supuesto en la dificultad epica (aqui ya entendia lo de las resistencias y que habilidades usar, aparte de que aprendi ingles). Aqui es cuando volvi a mi ni\u00f1ez y fue bonito completarme este gran juego.\n\nEs un buen juego para aquellos que les gusta los rpg de turnos, recuerdo que tiene algo de humor negro (de hecho hay gente que no le gusta el juego por el humor que tiene), tiene soundtracks buenos (de hecho mi favorito es el que suena en el video del juego) y puedes jugarlo en paginas flash o tambien en Steam. Una pena que el juego no sea tan conocido, me gustaria que mas personas conocieran este juego y los demas juegos de Matt Roszak.", "timestamp_created": 1544556782, "timestamp_updated": 1544557011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47401842": {"recommendationid": "47401842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020485405", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 955, "last_played": 1544114794}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little game reminiscent of early-oughts Newgrounds.", "timestamp_created": 1544312075, "timestamp_updated": 1544312075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47382566": {"recommendationid": "47382566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080971540", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 992, "last_played": 1573333643}, "language": "english", "review": "The resolution, style and UI navigation give away that this was originally a flash game from 2010. If this bothers you or you don't like cute things, this game might not be for you, but to everyone else I can strongly recommend this game.\n\nDon't let the aforementioned aspects fool you - the gameplay in Epic Battle Fantasy 3 is extremely solid and despite the simple, easy to pick up turn-based battle system, there's a surprising amount of depth to it. There are no boring throwaway battles like in many RPGs, where you just have to spam normal attacks to win. Every fight requires thought and strategy - especially the boss fights (these can get pretty long, by the way). In general, the difficulty is well-balanced, always giving you a reasonable challenge without overdoing it. I played on Normal, but there are 4 levels of difficulty in total (Easy, Normal, Hard, Epic), which should cover just about every kind of challenge people could want from it.\n\nThe story takes a backseat as the game focuses on combat and a bit of exploration and sidequests. There are many secrets to discover and achievements to unlock, which actually allow you to discover even more secret areas within the game, so it's worth going for them. What story is there, though, is pretty cute and gets the job done.\n\nThere are only two frustrating experience I've made. One happened during the penultimate boss fight, where one part of the boss was poisoned, but just got healed by it every turn for the rest of the fight because he absorbed poison damage. There's no way to remove it anymore, as you can't use healing items on your enemies or damaging items on yourself (which would also come in handy, considering there's a skill that does more damage the less HP you have).\nThe other one is the accuracy system. Despite making sure to buff it during and outside of combat and reducing the enemies' evasion, my characters would still miss a lot in some areas.\n\nThese are small gripes though - I thoroughly enjoyed this game. My first playthrough took me about 12 hours, but that was at a very slow pace and while looking for secrets, so I'm sure most people will be faster. It's the kind of game that's perfect to play in one sitting on a comfy day off, and it's entirely free.

Debe destacarse m\u00e1s que nada lo de las resistencias a elementos y los efectos de estado, tanto los positivos como negativos muy bien balanceados.\n\nEl dialogo es genial, aqu\u00ed no ver\u00e1s largos textos de cada NPC contandote su vida, no. EBF lo que hace es reirse de esas cosas en ocasiones, rompiendo la cuarta pared cada que puede y haciendo mil y un referencias a series de anime y videojuegos de ROL tanto en sus textos como en sus NPC\u00b4s, la ropa, comida, habilidades, etc. Los textos son cortos, cargados de humor en su mayor\u00eda y est\u00e1n en todos lados para sacarte una risa si conoces un poco de videojuegos o anime. \nEn las batallas son geniales, m\u00e1s los comentarios cada integrante cada que un compa\u00f1ero ''muere\u00b4\u00b4 o los que salen en esos momentos de puzzle.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos, perfectos con el mundo que tenemos. Realmente me alegra ver que se mantiene la est\u00e9tica de cada personaje (sin ser Lance hasta el proximo juego con su ropa) va genial con lo que hace el juego de ser como un anime de aventura y comedia en el cual realmente los imaginar\u00eda as\u00ed de ser un anime. Igualmente los enemigos que encima, antes de iniciar una batalla se ven como en esos juegos de Pok\u00e9mon que antes de luchas con ellos se ven como  una versi\u00f3n entre pixelado y estilo anime.\n\nLa dificultad del juego es la que quieras, la mejor es la media ya que es la historia sin muchas complicaciones a excepci\u00f3n de uno que otro jefe, pero por lo dem\u00e1s, este juego busca ser jugado de forma tranquila para contarte la aventura de los 3 heroes, aunque igualmente si as\u00ed lo deseas puedes subir esa dificultad hasta que se vuelve algo ... injusto, s\u00f3lo por si deseas quebrarte la cabeza disfrutando las mecanicas de combate en vez de la historia.\n\nLo \u00fanico que veo relevante para mirar algo confuso es la historia que bueh. En s\u00ed, no s\u00e9 si decir si es una referencia al juego Cronno Chross y con su pelea contra el devorador del tiempo y de ah\u00ed el plot simple de la aventura, que para resumir la aventura y su fin ser\u00eda algo como: Despertaron a un ente sellado casi indetenible que los derrot\u00f3 f\u00e1cilmente y que ahora s\u00ed o s\u00ed deben matar porque sino \u00e9l destruir\u00e1 todo lo que vea. De \u00faltima puedes decir que pega con los personajes algo brutos y que el juego es m\u00e1s de comedia, a\u00fan as\u00ed, se le puede perdonar ya que esta saga nunca trat\u00f3 de ser compleja historica ni argumentalmente.\n\nEn s\u00ed, EBF o m\u00e1s bien, toda la saga est\u00e1 hecha para disfrutar y jugar tranquilo, para divertirse con personajes graciosos que dicen y hacen cosas random por un fin que aunque este sea el de evitar la destrucci\u00f3n de todo, deja en claro que el objetivo real del juego es darte una historia divertida, pasarla bien y todo esto construido de forma solida bajo las viejas y c\u00f3modas mecanicas de los juegos RPG de anta\u00f1o.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1543687058, "timestamp_updated": 1543687058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47237849": {"recommendationid": "47237849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088553474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1575671319}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Free.\n\"By my eclection of tastes, EBF is better than Final Fantasy.\"", "timestamp_created": 1543686992, "timestamp_updated": 1543688757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536101698875427246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47157263": {"recommendationid": "47157263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105394491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1014, "last_played": 1543538660}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to play this game a lot when I younger, and I recently found it again.

Sometimes, you'll be bombarded with debuffs, or your enemies will be constantly buffing other enemies and healing everyone.

It was the first game I played that I really got into and it has aged quite well. The characters, while very simple, are all very charming. The humor is great, even if a bit offensive at times. The gameplay is really well made and quite challenging in the later areas. The soundtrack is also pretty damn good, with each theme fitting the different areas and situations. The character and enemy designs are also really charming, from cute bushes to ancient demonic deities. The whole games also looks really good, with an artstyle that portrays every kind of enemy really well. My only complaint would have to be the lack of post-game content, but that problem is completely fixed in EBF4. If you want a really good RPG to play, I would suggest this one. You can also play the earlier flash games (Epic Battle Fantasy 1&2) in the series if you want, although those don't follow the usual RPG formula and are moreso just waves of mostly unrelated enemies continuously appearing and are not nearly as polished as this one. And if you like this one, you could buy EBF4 and the soon to come EBF5 here on Steam or, if you don't want to spend the money, the entire series is free-to-play as flash games, though there is a lot of extra content in the Steam versions of EBF4&5 and quite a bit in this on as well, even though it's free.

It's an obvious, never-apologetic spoof of classic Final Fantasy, but better in quite a few ways.\n\nThe gameplay is a pure classic JRPG: turn-based, heroes first, cast your buffs, hit your limit breaks and wipe the field. EBF is a bit different in the approaches it takes: anything that annoyed you about other classic RPGs is gone here, everything is very streamlined and satisfying, and if it isn't, the game will mercilessly mock it. No random encounters, or \"chance to fail\" when fleeing fights. Characters share EXP, but you upgrade their abilities seperately, and can even decide who gets which skill if you want to build one as a tank, one as a healer, etc.\n\nThe game's music is surprisingly impeccable; I even bought one of the tracks. It looks very fine, especially for a flash game, and the creator has certainly found their style. The second element of what most puts this title above the rest is the script: the characters each have great charm, and funny moments abound. The game is never above kicking through the fourth wall to mock game mechanics, and the characters themselves make fun of the more annoying aspects. While much of the script may come off as a joke that only gets you the first time, I'd still highly recommend it just off the dialogue scenes.\n\nOne of the few issues the game has is duration. There are only three characters to play as, although they will each really catch your ear the whole time. It's rather short, for an RPG, but still has some decent runtime. If nothing else, the game still has longer modes, such as a survival mode (if I remember), and the achievements/optional bosses will hold your attention well. EBF 3 is another treasure of a flash game making it to the bigger-time, and I'd recommend it to any JRPG fan. 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1532045025, "timestamp_updated": 1532045025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571080207824707031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43632103": {"recommendationid": "43632103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004711546", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 171, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1531965372}, "language": "english", "review": "I can see why people enjoyed this game, but I personally was ready to get off after my short play time with it. It has it's pros but it honestly feels like a flash player game that you find dozens of online.\n\nPros:\nTook itself lightly, seemed to at least try to be humorous in most parts.\nSome decent features I'd like to see in more rpg's like your gear changing your appearance, I also liked the idle animations where characters would read or listen to music while waiting for their turns.\nWalking around regens your HP and MP so you don't have to continously waste items, and status effects end after the fight.\n\nNeutral:\nA lot of references, I saw quite a few characters from shows I've seen and I assume there are alot more, but I already figured a great deal of them were flying under my radar since I don't remember characters from anime that well.\nThe music was decent but seemed to be one song per area so I was getting sick of them really fast.\n\nCons:\nAnimation and art style is flash game level, skill effects were weak.\nEven in the short bit I played I could tell the game was going to be grindy, items made to cost thousands of gold, skills that cost hundreds of points, and enemies quickly climbing in health. You also get waves of enemies in some fights. So the combat started feeling more like a clicker game where enemies just become better damage sponges requiring more time to kill than any real challenge in how you use your skills.\nStory wasn't really engaging. Even though I didn't see much of it I didn't like the bit I saw. You're 3 ,apparently, OP adventurers and you get reset to lvl 0 because you poke a demon that syphons your powers. I don't know why but rapid loss of powers in order to continue the plot bothers me.\nProbably belongs with grindy but the quest system was crap, there's no way to tell which npc will have a quest so it expects you to talk to all of them. Every quest I ran into was just to gather specific items and bring them back, these may be pretty spread out too since I didn't finish a single one and therefore don't know what the rewards for finishing them are.\n\nDespite giving it a No, the game is free so definitely check it out if your interested.

I was quite happy with it in its previous incarnations; but the current version on steam has several annoyances. My critique involves specifically the Steam version of the game.\n * Some enemies, while still not difficult, are immune to all skills. This makes you grind them extremely slowly with melee attacks (as literally every single skill except \"attack\" and \"cleave\" are considered \"magic\", as is the Poison status effect!)\n * The game seems laggier for some reason\n * Several balance changes make the game easier/slower. Enemies are less weak to poison\n * These changes combined with a nerf to the most difficult boss fight makes that fight several times easier by comparison\n * Massive nerf to mini-games; while allowing you to quickly bypass them; means you'll probably play them once. Due to the way medals work in this game, this buffs your characters directly due to the gear they can receive with substantially less effort on the players' part. While I'd agree they're the worst part of the game, it used to actually be a choice to simply skip those medals and move on or put in the effort to unlock more chests. \n\nI highly recommend the browser based version of this game if you can find it before the 2016 update, but can't recommend this one given that the better version exists. It's still quite playable, but why play a worse version of the game?\n\nOtherwise:\n * The game is quite balanced damage wise and when playing on Hard or Epic; you can win but only if played very well.\n * Due to the way gear is stat'd, it takes sophistication to arrange your resistances and tradeoffs to both damage and skills (I consider this good balance)\n * Skill progressions are enjoyable\n * Lots of skills to choose from and most of them are not useless even in the 4th act; and probably half of them are still adequate or good for the remainder of the game. \n * Hidden loot that requires wandering around is always a plus for me", "timestamp_created": 1530773350, "timestamp_updated": 1530773350, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507530093193054199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43264398": {"recommendationid": "43264398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129956220", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 638, "last_played": 1616822614}, "language": "english", "review": "Brings back memories xD, from Newsground now its here, definitely a must game to play", "timestamp_created": 1530605215, "timestamp_updated": 1530605215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43141472": {"recommendationid": "43141472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013953230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 575, "last_played": 1530217742}, "language": "english", "review": "I grew up playing turn based JRPGs like FInal Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, Legend of Dragoon etc. back in the late 90s and early 2000s.

the info below with that in mind. (I'm too old and ornery for a mode any more challenging than that).\n\nFun, cute, colorful!  There's something very gratuitously satisfying about seeing HUGE numbers and flashy effects being splashed around during a fight.  I think there's a plot in there somewhere but who cares when nothing but mahem is happening on the screen.  I had a blast. The gameplay is very smooth, never had a hitch or slow-down with all that was going on.  I accidentally got a few achievements while playing but wasn't really paying attention. It was only when I closed the game did I notice them.  A good number of them are pretty funny...(pig molester???...OMG!!!...I'm a pig molestor...lol..). \n\nI didn't bother with the side-quests/mini-games so can't comment on those exept to say this:  I dislike games that include mini-games that MUST BE COMPLETED IN ORDER TO FINISH THE GAME.  Bleh... If I wanted a different type of gameplay, such as a FPS, a puzzle or a timed game I would buy that instead.  Fortunately, I could skip them as none were necessary to complete the game. I think there is an achievement for doing a certain number of them.\n\nRandom points smooshed together:\n\nThe gameplay is turn-based. There are three preset characters: a fighter, a magic user and a dexer-type.  They seem well-balanced. In a fight, the order of the characters always starts out the same: Melee with magic enhancement, a healer/fighting-magic user and a ninja with magic enhancement. There is no way to switch their order around [b]when not in a fight[/b].  During a fight the order goes back to normal after the switched character finishes his/her move. (I write about this later in more detail). All three characters use mana to perform their usual and special moves.  No matter how tough a weapon is, without using magic, every weapon is puny--might as well throw uncooked macaroni at the enemy. (Come to think of it, that might be fun.)\n\nThere are tons of spells and melee abilities with a few special spells given to each character reminding me of my Final Fantasy days when I would strike with an all-powerful one-time-use death spell. In this game when the SPECIAL is cast, the character who casts it becomes useless, (uses up all mana). He can strike with a plain weapon for [I]several[/I] turns until mana is slooowly built back up.  There are foods and spells that can fully restore his mana so he'll be ready at his next turn but whichever character gives him help will lose their turn. 'Scan' and a couple of the healer's special moves use up only a small amount of mana.  If I remember to, more on scanning later..\n\nCharacters can escape the fight during their turn with no penalties, even during a boss fight.  When [I]running[/I] from a fight, the team comes back fully healed with all statuses, such as poison, instantly gone.  When a fight is complete statuses will be removed in a few seconds and waiting a bit longer will slowly heal the team without needing to use healing items or spells. Monster's don't attack first--the characters have to walk close to a monster icon and hit the space bar to initiate the fight.  A monster blocking a path needs to be killed before the team can get by.  Using a waypoint crystal will reset the areas already completed but any monsters blocking a path before will not respawn.  The rest will respawn which is useful if you feel you're not quite tough enough for the next area.\n\nI found the waypoint/recall crystals very confusing.  They are crystals set on an object like a rock that are difficult to see in the world.  Once you click on the first one, located in the first town, you will fall for a ways down and land in an area with the other waypoints you'll find later in the game.  The others will be inactive until you locate and click on them in their own area.  Pay attention to what they look like because some are very hard to spot in the world.  You'll notice, though, that they seem to match the area they're located in. Example: The one in the snowy area is all white, is covered in snow with a white crystal on top.\n\nThere are very minimal amounts of armors and weapons but what there are can be upgraded with adds you win after victories, from completing side-quests, what you find in chests, from NPCs, or secret areas.  I find this feature a lot easier than trying to hold on to tons of sets of armors/weapons/spells/adds/tools/food on the off chance I might need them later.  Your characters don't have a backpack, per se, but can access all their goodies from the character menus in between and in fights ala the RPGs of old.  (This game first came out in August, 2010...it's old but not ancient and holds up remarkably well!)  \n\nWhat seems to build up in the menu are the items NPCs need for their quests.  A plus is the items can also be used by your characters.  If your character uses an item you find later a quest giver needs...don't worry, more of that item will come by another source in the game.  Once you pick up a quest try to keep in mind what that quest giver looks like and location.  There are so many NPCs with quests when you finally get all the items one of them needs, its a matter of \"Now where did I see that guy...???!!\"  No NPC looks like the other and are usually found in a crowd of other NPCs who are also handing out quests.  You have a Quests menu you can click on. It shows a picture of the quest giver but all of them are facing forward.  Not so in the game...they could be facing any direction, any angle, in front of or behind something.  The only thing that kept me doing the quests was some of the rewards were very useful, (including quest items for other quest givers).\n\nThere are the usual areas to fight in: forest, ocean/beach, ice, desert and volanic.  The body types of monsters are reused ad nauseum but with different colors, effects and abilities, (such as a creature in the an ice area weak to fire is now found in the volcanic area with fire spells but weak to ice).  Occasionally, the game will mix up the two in one fight creating more of a challenge.  Example: You reach an ice area, and, anticipating the area you're in, you gear up with fire weapons and ice armor.  But...surprise!  You're in a fight with both fire and ice monsters at the same time--and for giggles and grins a weaker mini-boss-type is thrown in the mix with weaknesses & abilities unlike the others.  [spoiler]Good adivce:  keep investing in dark magic for spells and adds.  Earth-based magic also got me out of a lot of jams. Lightning-based magic was very useful in the first part of the game.  For the rest of the game it was useless here--great there.[/spoiler] \n\nAbout scanning and more non sequiturs: \n\nIf you so wish, the game will keep you busy with the achievements, mini-games, secrets, and some areas entered only after a certain amount of medals are won, tasks from NPCs and scanning. The ninja can 'scan' monsters, (once for each monster type), to discover a monster's weaknesses, resistences, abilities, and useful stats, but he can only scan during a fight.  After a monster is scanned a bright spot with a (?) appears near the monster's head for all three characters to see.  [spoiler][I]When a fight is triggered[/I] and seeing a monster the ninja hasn't scanned yet, I find it's a good idea to choose the \"switch-the-fighting-order\" icon between the fighter and the ninja. The icon is found on all three characters' menus--very useful ability since the characters' lineups are static.  Switching the character's fighting order will allow the ninja to scan the monster before any aggression has occurred.  He can only scan one monster at a time in each turn then his turn is over.[/spoiler]  Other than bosses, I can't recall a fight where my team didn't throw the first punch.  Game is a solid 8/10\n\nI bought 3 & 4 bundled together.

Even the music is really nice. The attention to detail is very nice too, the detail being able to jiggle Natalie's tiddies in almost every occasion.\n\nThough I have criticize the equipment. You get all these cool armors, hats and weapons, only to never have any use to some, if not most, of them, because at that point you're better off using just the weapon that's best against most of the monsters of that map. With 5 maps and more than double the weapons per character, some weapons are simply not going to get the love they deserve. Same goes for the armor as well.\n\nAnd while the monsters are cool for the most part, I do wish at least the bosses would stand out a little more. Jack is very forgettable, especially for being the first boss. Squid's gimmick is that it has 2 tentacles that it can regenerate which really is nothing. The mammoth is literally just a goddamn mammoth, it doesn't have anything special other than being able to ram you with tiny mammoths. And the tank just has some runes which for the most part don't do anything special besides one stuns and another heals.

Since it\u2019s 100% free I would recommend this if you\u2019re into RPGs and can look past a few weirder things said and done. \n\nI used to play this a game a ton on Armour Games when I was younger, but I never got around to finishing it. I haven\u2019t finished the game on Epic yet but I still feel I have a good grasp for a representative review and I will update this review if anything noteworthy during my epic playthrough.\n\nFirst, I\u2019ll start off with the differences from this version from the online version. The steam version (and updated Kongregate version) haven\u2019t changed much from the original, it\u2019s mostly just balancing changes, which is definitely appreciated, but nothing huge.\n\nFrom Epic Battle Fantasy 1 and 2, 3 is by far the biggest jump in scale, going from a fixed path of battle them immediately another battle and then a shop every so often, EBF 3 changes a lot from 1 and 2 going to a very open game, like a more traditional RPG which benefits almost everything in my opinion and Matt did a great job in doing it so well.\n\nThe story is ok, it continues on from the last instalment, in which (Spoiler->) [spoiler] Matt and Natalie join up with Lance at the end [/spoiler]. The story starts off with the characters basically getting rekt by a literal god, losing all their powers and equipment and ending up in a small town. They then set off to try and take it down. You really don\u2019t need to have played the last two games to play this one, combat is largely the same and still isn\u2019t too complex, but still allows for a lot of strategy and you\u2019re not missing out that much in terms of story.\n\nThe fact that this also made by mostly 2 people: Matt Roszak (who was doing the coding, artwork, animation etc.) and Phyrrna (previously known as HalcyonicFalconX) (who did the music) is really impressive especially when you realise how much attention to detail has gone in (not to mention it\u2019s free). The music done by Phyrrna is great and I can see why is got a physical soundtrack release.\n\nThe artwork, animation and overall aesthetics are unique (In a good way) and make the game very distinguishable in that aspect, and the music complements it very well. In battle is where you\u2019ll see the most detail, outside still does have detail but it\u2019s more like a sketch in terms of how it looks, some people will like it but others won\u2019t, it\u2019s down to preference. The UI is really intuitive, both inside and outside of battle (although it\u2019s a bit excessive on comic sans).\n\nThe combat is one of the best things about the game for me personally. There is a huge amount of moves to unlock, use and upgrade along with all sorts of armour which you can mix or match to suit your preferred style of play best.\n\nOn your team you have three team members:\n\nMatt who is the tank who primarily focuses on strong physical attacks over magical attacks and his attacks are usually on only one enemy.\n\nNatalie is the mage and medic able to deal strong magical damage to lots of foes or just singular ones to concentrate the damage. She also has the ability to do a variety of healing moves but she has the lowest HP, defence, and attack of any character.\n\nAnd finally, Lance who is the new character added to the third EBF. He\u2019s pretty well balanced and can deal physical and magical damage to one, all or attack mostly one enemy with one third of damage going to any other enemies. He also has a couple rarer elemental attacks such as bomb and he has a decent healing move. He is also the character with the almost vital move; scan, which lets you see the enemies HP (in more detail than just a bar), what it\u2019s weak and resistant to, along with any other useful information.\n\nEach attack also has a unique animation so the really strong attacks both look like and do a serious amount of damage. There\u2019s not much grinding required, I am basing this review of a normal playthrough and as long as I went for the extra chests which involved usually fighting more, grinding isn\u2019t that big of a deal and you can get away without doing much at all if any. But If you play on hard and especially Epic you will have to grind to get to level 30 (The highest achievable level in normal play) for the last fight, but that\u2019s kind of expected for really high difficulty levels.\n\nAs for the bad:\n\n-Some of the achievements.\n\n-NoLegs is a bit too talkative.\n\n-The squid is just weird.\n\nAs for more serious bad things:\n\n-I know this is a nit-pick but there are a couple of achievements basically there to embarrass you, you can always just ignore them obviously but It\u2019s a bit annoying if you want to get all achievements, it\u2019s a small complaint and it might have just been me and it shouldn\u2019t sway you not to get the game, but it did make me hesitate as to go for all achievements. \n\n-There are multiple instant death moves and although they don\u2019t appear often, have low accuracy and most of the time you have time to syphon them before, sometimes you can\u2019t and it can lead to some pretty cheap feeling deaths.\n\n- Some of the things said and done by the characters and enemies feel a little out of place, some of the things Lance says especially makes me sometimes wonder if this game is trying to be more serious yet the rest of the game is relatively light-hearted.\n\n- The squid is generally really weird.\n\nOverall however, if you can look past some of the weirder things said and done and you\u2019re into RPGs I think you\u2019ll enjoy this game. \n\nIt\u2019s also free.", "timestamp_created": 1518448675, "timestamp_updated": 1519670634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671177983283996582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40022357": {"recommendationid": "40022357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142466324", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2494, "last_played": 1516286337}, "language": "english", "review": "great game great mecanics keep on going and best of luck", "timestamp_created": 1518434238, "timestamp_updated": 1518434238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40018862": {"recommendationid": "40018862", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998672884", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1565738914}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Bottom Line: A fun, silly turn-based RPG that has enough bite to keep interest without becoming frustrating.

"review": "The title is right about one thing, this game is EPIC!\n\n3 Players to play as, all with their own supporting role and strategies.\n\nMultiple elements and weaknesses.. and even status effects too.\n\nThere's tons of equipment, with each one being able to upgrade to Level 5 with the right materials (dropped by enemies, hidden treasure chests in the overworld, or even completing quests!)\n\nThere's alot of quests that are actually pretty useful and not that difficult, some even grant you hidden moves for you to learn.\n\nThe overworld is nice, and charming. Minigames can be fun but sometimes stressful.\n\nThe combat itself can be very complex at first due to having so many options and all 3 characters at the start.. but you will get used to it fairly soon.\n\nThe game's bonus content is suprisingly large, with alot of cool concept art and even FAN art, also the AMAZING soundtrack. There's alot of medals to get, and if you have enough you can unlock hidden rooms with even more equipment.\n\nThis game normally can take around 10-20 hours to beat, depending how you play. There's 4 difficulty modes, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Epic.\n\nOnce you get into later battles, you really have to think and not just spam attacks hoping for the best. Elemental weaknesses are very important. \n\nThe Final Boss in my opinion is a huge step-up difficulty, with me getting my first game-over on it, I pray for those souls who play on Epic.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun and charming RPG game. While the story is quite generic and doesn't really have much of a plot, it's still a great RPG game to play. If you thought this game was good, you should try EBF4, and soon awaits an upcoming EBF5.\n\nThis game is free, and the soundtrack is too!

You only fight them when you talk to them. This means random encounters are less of a threat and more of an obstacle that you can overcome at your own pace.\n+ Bestiary and medals are tied to the game installation rather than a specific save. That means if you got a medal and then died before you could save, you'll still have it after reloading your save.\n+ Some features from later games got backported, like the wave counter.\n\nMixed:\n+- The dialogue is humorous, but the overall story is nothing groundbreaking. One of the players even admits this in the Volcano secret room.\n\nCons:\n- You can choose a character to learn a secret skill, but you can't unlearn it and give it to a different character. Fortunately, the consequences aren't too dire if you know how to use the characters properly.\n- Unlike the next game, scan is single target. This could be annoying for scanning bosses with multiple boss-specific allies, especially the final boss.\n- The quest log doesn't list the locations of previously met quest givers",

Both game series mean a hell of a lot to me so I'm kiiiinda biased....No I don't have two asses... Stop playing the impossible quiz for a second and listen.\n\nFirst off I'm going to talk about the music and then...eh screw it. I'll talk about a subject when I think about it.\n\nOk, so the music in this game, like the other 2 games before it and the 4th after it...ABSOLUTELY ROCKS! It's so awesome to listen to! The music suits the exact situation it is in, from towns to forests, battles to game over screens...It's just so amazingly awesome! I love the arranges as well but I still like how there was a bit of minimalist charm to them~\n\nOnto the characters.... For Matt, we have your usual brain of mush, button mashing, lovable idiot. He's so cool. Since the first EBF, he was always the embodiment of DPS...a big stupid jock with a sword bigger than him. I LOVE how we were able to swap his swords out for certain fights for that elemental edge! He was always pretty damned strong but as with all DPS...you spent ages healing the guy. In this one, He's a little more...Well he is certainly a bit smarter and much more \"I NEED this\" in terms of his personality, which is great! I love his character growth from DPS buffoon to DPS smart-a$$. His comments on things and his in battle text are always funny~\n\nFor Natz.... As everybody who is a fan of the series will say.... BOOBS!!!....Ahem...anyway.... Natz was your standard mage without any story or character and it only felt like she was just there so Mat doesn't die stupidly...but in EBF3...her character came to life and became the Natz we know...the chick who doesn't take crap...but gets it anyway. Before she used to always be in the back, making it like she was your average mage but in this and in EBF 4, she sits in the front lines with Matt showing that she has guts...and probably some balls as well...Good thing we can't poke those.... Usually the more level-headed member....\"usually\" \n\nFor Lance... From badguy dickhead to friend of awesomeness, this guy makes his debut in EBF2 but comes around in EBF 3 and 4. Your standard military gunner who is tactical, level headed and precise...usually. Yes I use that word a lot, get used to it... I love that he not only is a \"Synergist\" but also a backup healer! (For those who don't know, Synergist means he does status stuff) The effects on his weapons were always super helpful in battles and especially his gear... [spoiler] Officer uniform dropping airstrikes and tank shots between turns was a God send! [/spoiler] His character development in EBF 3 really helped people look at him differently than that one guy that was bullshit to beat in the previous title. \n\nFor the skill system... The skill system in this...TRUCKING GENIUS!!! Most games give each character a set of skills and that's that. No whining, no complaining...\"That's what it is so deal with it plebs\" but in this game... Not only did the characters have set skills which are obvious to their equipment...there were skills that all of them could learn and you had to decide WHO got them! In my opinion, this was a GREAT move! That means you can have one of the characters be able to do something they normally cannot, like Matt using magic for example. Sure...it doesn't hurt that much but still.... Giving him the [spoiler] Sonic Metal...whatever... skill [/spoiler] lets him heal the party and do damage! You can give it to Lance if you want but...yea... Anyway... You could hand debilitating skills to Natz to make sense or give them to Lance to keep the DPS rolling with Natz! It is such a good system and I just wish other games had it too when giving you multiple characters in an rpg.\n\nThe locations were pretty cool. I love the 3D graphics on a 2D plane with 3D uhh... implications? I don't wanna say it is 2.5D because it doesn't seem like that but then again...I'm no techie so it might be...who knows? It's like mystery meat, nobody knows what it is...cept the maker..s-shut up...\n\nThe items...nothing really to say here.\n\nThe weapons and clothing... Now...this was a fun idea! Getting random in battle events to happen when you upgraded them to a set level? So awesome! The different combos you could make were baffling! Well...not really but you know what I mean... You could go with a mainstream, failsafe outfit for all 3 that ups their stats and covers weaknesses...or you could mix it up focusing on the battle events to turn the battle in your favour despite being weak to them, you could overpower them with sheer skills. Though all of us have to admit... That Air Strike between rounds is the best thing in the game. Can't deny that one. \n\nThe bosses were all pretty difficult in their own right as you went through the game. There were no real super jumps in difficul-- oh yea... The Cosmic Monolith...Um yea... FUCK that guy... anyway... Other than the final boss, which can take anywhere between 10-45 minutes, the bosses and enemies in the game were perfectly staggered with the player levels and stats making it a wonderful transition that never left you feeling overpowered...unless you grinded...\n\nThat's all my brain is going to let me review so yea...hope you all liked it. Please be nice to me... I'm tired as I write this late review.

There are so many great tracks that appear in the game from world music to battle themes. Always enjoy bobbing my head to the song wings.\n\n     The art style is nice. The art is basic but since it is indie i can deal with that. It helps add to the comedy tone that the game sometimes has and helps provides a few chuckles when transitioning to a new area and they have a visual novel like scene that has some funny actions potrayed by the characters.\n\n      The combat looks nice. Can not say much about that but the magic attacks look pretty good and character animations/ enemy animations look cool.\n\nCon:\n       Frame rate sucks. When fighting multiple enemies mainly in the later stages doing attacks can drop the frame rate down alot from 30 or 60 to about 15 or 8. It is very annoying to be in combat and not be able to enjoy the visual flare that comes from using magic.\n\n        Level system is bad. The level cap is 30. That isnt bad but in an rpg like this leveling up is the means to balancing the game. If you cap it off and make the enemies the same level then where is the fairness? Depending on your success is up to RNG and that is not a good thing.\n\n        Enemies are awful. Not only do you have to deal with the level cap that will make any effort to balance things out impossible but enemies have chances to do some really annoying attacks. For an example some enemies can use death... yes that is an instant kill move that is RNG on whether you live or die and whats worse is its RNG...there is no way to effectively balance out these bullshit moments. Also there is a chance that regular enemies can drop an ice cicle on the player and it will kill them...fun. Also the ability to freeze enemies is very apparent in the ice level which is frustrating by itself.\n\n        Horrible ice level. Really nothing needs to be said about this besides being frozen sucks and believe me being frozen is one of those high chance moments and it is worse when the ice enemies constantly combo you into be frozen leading your unavoidable death. I went 3 turns without doing anything because i was constantly frozen so all i can say is if being frozen is a mechanic...make it a direct attack to a single player instead of a party.\n\n         The bosses are terrible. When fighting a boss they can also have a 1 hit kill move. In the case of the boss in the desert which is a 1 hit team kill move you must also fight additional enemies. It isnt fun to fight a hard boss and unlimited mob like enemies. It is not fun and provides much challenge. The dragon is the worst boss because he is the same level with many 1hit kill moves and all around a horrible boss.\n\n        Enemy weakness water? There is not a single water move in the game...did the devs even proof the game before release? I see that element on a few enemies and it is just odd that the enemies would be weak to an elemental attack that DOES NOT EXIST IN THE GAME.\n\nConclusion:\n         I played this game because it was free and i enjoy RPG games but nothing could ever prepare me for a cluster fuck of an experience that i had to do. I could talk about how bad the mini games are and how the controls for those mini games were garbage. Really in the end of the day the devs will not look at these criticims and maybe discredit all that has been stated in the review but the thing that makes me wonder the most is did they even play test the game? Really having insta death attacks is not fun in an rpg that can not be balanced with continuous grinding to balance out anything challenging. That process takes something that could be impossible and makes it more bearable and having the game deal with RNG as the main obstical is something that will quickly cause games to fail and gamers to get frustrated because the flow that the game should have is completely messed up with things that are unbalanced and unfair. I did once reccomend the game but seeing these issues and overall not enjoying the game because every battle i need to have some good luck item next to me else i would be one shot killed or frozen till death really opened my eyes to how bad this game is. Yes i played plenty of flash like rpg games....one of my favorite ones was Phrozen Flames 2 which i sinked many hours grinding to get stronger and balance out the challenging enemies/ bosses that i would encounter. So for anyone curious of this game...just avoid it and play any other rpg game.

I loved it then as I still enjoy it now. Warning: there is a very slight spoiler at the very beginning. But, it also tells you this very early in the game, so...\nPros\n+Story/Dialogue: Three idiots awaken an ancient diety, get their asses handed to them, and go on a quest for revenge. Oh, they also save the world. Guess that's a bonus. \"None of us are as stupid as all of us. Maybe it's the same with him.\" - Matt\n+Equipment: 80+ weapons and armor to choose from, each with their own abilities, stat bonuses, and elements. Upgrades to make said abilities better. Drop a mammoth on your enemies, or summon a narwhal from the earth. How? Upgrade your equipment, noobs.\n+Abilities: Many abilities to learn, 3 limit breaks per chararacter, and some abilities require you to have a different one, so on and so forth. Learn abilities such as (limit breaks): drop a tank on your enemies before you explode said tank, drop a collection of oversized swords, or give a cute smile and peace sign (buffs/heals party, debuffs all enemies).\n+NoLegs: he's a cat that has no legs (but two arms) that travels with the party and helps out. NoLegs is awesome. \n+Main Characters: Matt- the warrior who wants to kill/eat/steal everything. Natalie- the mage who cares for creatures (so long as they aren't slimy) and is somewhat the voice of reason. Lance- He has guns and he has a tank. Need I say more?\n\nNeutral\n*Minigames: A nice break from the main game, usually involving NoLegs, that can earn two acheivments per game and some gold. There's one minigame per area excluding the town.\n*Sidequests/Medals: Sidequests are basic trade this for that. Some items are exclusive to sidequests and have no other use. 3 Medals in total for sidequests. Medals unlock an extra map in each area (excluding town) filled with stronger enemies (compared to that area) and some treasures. Both can net you some nice equips.\n*Puzzles: See the image of Natalie commenting on how stupid they are. Then solve the pretty simple puzzles. Hint: the switches have those markings on them too.\n\nNegatives\n-Combat: Combat is always your three idiots move, then the enemies move and repeat. You can have your idiots move in a different order by selecting each one, but otherwise it is always Matt, then Natalie, then Lance. Enemies will always move from the one at the top of the screen to the one at the bottom.\n-Beasiary: This and medals are shared between saves. So once you scan every foe on one save, you never have to again (Scanning one foe uses Lance's turn once). This means that your first save is a chump for doing all of the work while all of the others never have to waste a turn scanning. You can also delete the beastiary and medals at any time though, but you have to actively go do that.\n\nFinal Score: 10/10\nThe humor and subtle references in the game make up for the two negatives I mentioned, and neither of those detract from the game enough anyway. The fact that this game is free online and on Steam means that unless you absolutely hate RPG's, some pervyness, and other humor, you should give this a try somewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1497448337, "timestamp_updated": 1497448760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32365930": {"recommendationid": "32365930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253814583", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3344, "last_played": 1527464503}, "language": "english", "review": "OK, I have just finished the game and I could say like this: \"How can this game be so epic?\", and the answers are in these pros and cons :\n\nFirst, the pros :\n+ The third game of the EBF series, follow the classic JRPG game style (explore and more grinding).\n+ Colorful graphic (All hail Flash game!!).\n+ The soundtrack is... oh boy, no comments, every tracks are AMAZING, from the field battles to the boss battles.

But I actually had finally completed it in 2013 and during my age of 14. Then I had even finally completed it again on Steam on absolutely December 31, 2016.\n\nThis game actually does make me feel nostalgic and especially the song \"Acruta Lao D'nor\" does more than this game.\n\nThank you Matt Roszak for making this game ever.

That's because I'd find Natalie 'cute' and not 'hot' because I actually don't find any female characters 'hot' but I like female characters I find 'cute' such as that cute teenage magician girl named 'Natalie'. I would never play a game for hentai.\n\nI even had seen/met Yoko Littner and Curly Brace as 2 NPCs being cameos/references in this game. Speaking of those 2 characters, I kinda like Curly Brace although she's not my primary favorite but I'm never looking at Yoko Littner's outfit in her actual franchse.\n\nDespite the cosmic monolith being that damn powerful, he's actually my most favorite enemy/monster in this game ever.

AHORA!\n\n[h1] gameplay: [/h1] bueno, estamos frente a un jrpg clasico en todo su esplendor, el que no sepa de lo que hablo, tenemos batallas por turnos en donde podremos atacar una vez con cada uno de los 3 heroes que tenemos disponibles, cada uno con un set de armas y habilidades distintas para obtener distintos resultados, y esto juega un papel importantisimo, ya que todos los enemigos a los que nos enfrentaremos tendran sus debilidades, resistencias y ataques, asique tendremos que armar de la mejor manera posible a nuestros heroes antes de toda batalla (por ejemplo, si un enemigo es de fuego, la mejor estrategia es vestirnos con trajes resistentes al fuego y armas que potencien los ataques de agua/hielo) este detalle, hace al juego significativamente mas divertido\n\n[h1] soundtrack: [/h1] EBF 3 cuenta con una banda sonora bastante tipica en esta clase de juegos, musica con flautas y cosas asi para un bosque, canciones tipo hawai para la playa y obviamente, metal para los bosses, ya saben, cosas tipicas de un jrpg, sin embargo, esto esta hecho con un proposito, y esque este juego es una parodia a los jrpg, obviamente los cliches tienen que estar ahi, asi se hace mas facil burlarse de ellos, y la verdad esque los chistes que lanzan los personajes respecto a apartados del juego dan un aire mucho mas divertido al juego\n\n[h1] historia: [/h1] el juego toma lugar justo despues de EBF 2 (el juego esta gratis en internet, puedes jugarlo si asi lo deseas... o no...) luego de salvar al mundo de una guerra liderada por lance, este decide unirse al grupo de heroes, y juntos van a buscar aventuras, sin embargo, en una de sus incurciones encuentran un demonio encarcelado, se ve muy peligroso, mejoir dejarlo ahi... nah, eso seria muy aburrido, vamos a liberarlo!... resultado: todos los heroes vuelven al nivel 1 y pierden su equipo, y ahora que el demonio esta libre, nada le impide DESTRUIR EL MUNDO! asique nuestros heroes, como fueron unos retrasados, van en camino al demonio nuevamente a detenerlo y salvar al mundo una vez mas... no se ni porque me molesto en explicar la historia ya que el propio juego no le da importancia a la misma, se podria decir que esta de fondo, pero siempre es bonito saber porque haces las cosas no?... no?...\n\n[h1] personajes: [/h1] ya hablamos un poco de la historia, pero que hay de los personajes? primero tenemos al se\u00f1or todopoderoso matt, un imbecil de dudosa edad que adora las espadas, y tiene tendencias a hacerle bullying a su compa\u00f1era de batalla \"mejor te hubieras quedado en la cocina...\" matt, natalie, la maga blanca tetona, puede hacer todo tipo de hechizos, ya sea para curar, bufar o MATAR! aunque es animalista, cosa de la que los personajes tambien se suelen burlar \"no lo mates QwQ\" natalie, y el ultimo personaje es lance, el jefe final del juego anterior, personalmente me siento identificado con el ya que tiene una adiccion a las bebidas energeticas, usa armas a distancia y tuvo ligeros traumas en su ni\u00f1ez, traumas que son chistes recurrentes luego de algun golpe, \"mi padre me golpeaba mas fuerte que eso cuando era un bebe\" lance.\n\n[h1] duracion: [/h1] la rejugabilidad no es algo que se tenga muy presente al completar el juego, pero de aqui a pasarte el juego al 100% eso te tomara tiempo, hay armas que encontrar y mejorar, objetos que conseguir, recompenzas que reclamar, gente que ayudar, habilidades que desbloquear, objetos que consumir y hay mas, puede que no tenga mucho valor de rejugabilidad, pero te va a tomar tiempo pasartelo al 100%\n\n[h1] conclucion: [/h1] EBF 3 fue un juego que me causo muchos ataques de risa, tiene referencias por monton, es largo, los personajes son carismaticos y en cima es divertido, no he llegado mas alla del mundo 4 ya que los jrpg nunca se me dieron presisamente bien pero si eres un fan de final fantasy o cualquier juego de ese estilo, sabes ingles y te gusta el anime, pues hey, tengo un juego para ti\n\n[h1] puntuacion final: [/h1] le doy a epic battle fantasy 3 un 9.5/10 muy buen juego de combates por turnos y referencias sin fin, las historia no tiene mucho por si sola, me gustaria que hubieran puesto mas enfasis en ese apartado pero como ya dije, este detalle palidece ante lo que esel juego en general\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsi te ha parecido que hice un buen trabajo con este analisis, agradeceria un pulgar arriba de tu parte, si crees que me he saltado un punto, o que no detalle algo importante, puedes hacermelo saber en los comentarios evitando insultos o actitudes toxicas\n\npor mi parte eso ha sido todo, nos vemos en el proximo analisis, NRG fuera\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489955083, "timestamp_updated": 1489955083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.69160616397857666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30562326": {"recommendationid": "30562326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087565116", "num_games_owned": 498, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1814, "last_played": 1489720777}, "language": "english", "review": "I beat it (100% achievement) on epic in 25 hours of casual play.

The story & characters aren't meant to be deep but the game does have its humorous moments.  The combat and item systems are well done.  Music is pretty good as well.\n\nThe game is fairly simple in design.  You start in the only town with 3 characters to use.  You'll venture through 7 different environments battling enemies, leveling up, killing bosses, opening chests, & getting quests.  Each environment has a quick travel point right before the boss that allows you to instantly teleport back to the town.  The town has a couple shops where you can buy wearable equipment, forgeable items, and health/mp/status related items.  Each of your three characters has their own unique set of skills (fairly sizable) that you can upgrade as you choose throughout the game.  You'll have limited points to upgrade your skills at the start/mid points, so your choices will matter, but you will be able to unlock everything before you reach the end.  You'll also find a plethora of permanent stat upgrade items throughout the game that allow you to customize your characters further, you could keep your characters well balanced or buff certain characters to excel in certain stats.  Each character can equip a weapon, armor, and a hat.  The game has an autosave feature, but you can manually save the game at any time outside of battle.\n\nCombat is the game's main focus point and is where it really shines.  All enemies & bosses are viewable as you walk around, so you choose who you would like to fight.  Each environment has enemies on its \u201cmain path\u201d that you will have to fight in order to reach the boss; once you kill them they will never respawn.  Enemies off the \u201cmain path\u201d will respawn if you go back to town or to a different environment, so you can grind for extra XP or skill points should you need to (I played on the hard difficulty and never had to grind at all).  Enemies off the main path are often guarding chests or paths that lead to chests, so you're given incentive to fight them but don't have to if you don't want to. Combat is usually quick and simple.  Battle animations only last around 2 seconds or less for all attacks/spells (the exception being characters' limit breaks), so no sitting around for 10 seconds watching a character cast a damn spell.  Enemies start off simple but get stronger later on.  Enemies can be permanently scanned to see what elements and status effects they are weak/strong against.  Unlike a lot of RPGs, status effect spells and buff/debuff spells can be very useful in combat and are often essential against advanced enemies and bosses.  The mid and late game bosses are both difficult and rewarding to defeat.\n\nThe game has a unique equipment system that I don't recall seeing before.  All equipment starts off at level 1 and can be forged up to level 5.  All of a character's base stats are multiplied by 1.00 (So 30 base attack X 1.00 = 30 attack power).  When a character puts on a piece of equipment, instead of giving an increase to a stat (such as +30 attack), equipment gives an increase to a character's multiplier in various stats (such as + .15% to attack and + .10 to magic defense, so that 30 base attack is now multiplied by 1.15 = 35 attack power).  Instead of getting better and better equipment, you'll receive equipment that buffs/debuffs the multiplier for different stats, give different elemental/status resistances, and occasionally have a unique bonus that will unlock upon being upgraded to level 4 or 5 (such as automatically casting regen on your party or having a mammoth attack your enemies).  Even your starting equipment is viable at the end of the game, as no equipment is necessarily better or worse than any other equipment.  What equipment you want to equip will usually be based on what element enemies are currently weak to, what elements you should increase your resistance against, what stats you want buffed, or simply because you like the special bonus it provides.  Forging equipment is as simple as acquiring the necessary items, either by finding them in chests, receiving them from combat, or buying them at the shop.\n\nSome NPCs give quests, all of which are fetch quests.  You'll eventually find the items in chests or through battle.  The quest log lets you see what quests you have completed/outstanding and shows whether you have the necessary items to complete them.  Some of the rewards are pieces of equipment or permanent stat boosts, so running through and completing side quests once you get to the end of a zone can be helpful.  Completing quests are the only real backtracking you'll do in the game, but all NPCs are reachable once the main pathway is cleared, so you never have to fight enemies to get back to an NPC.\n\nNot much more to say.  Combat is solid, skill/equipment systems are diverse and interesting, occasionally funny (especially a couple of the achievements).  Would've enjoyed the game just as much if I'd paid a couple bucks for it.

Before the EBF series, he mosty used to create amateur animations that date back to as early as 2004. Considering he's around 26 now, I think you can imagine they were created and uploaded for fun, as a hobby.\nAnyway, back to the game.\n\nThe first game came out in 2009 and consisted exclusively of constant enemy waves and a boss fight every now and then until the very end. No savepoints too. The only \"break\" you had was a single potion shop. The fights themselves weren't very special too. Most of the time, it went like that:\nYou have two characters: damage dealer and a healer - equip the the damage dealer with the right weapon - spam one skill - the healer spams multiheal ability for 99% of the game.\nOf course it changed a bit on highest difficulty, but still the premise was the same.\nIt was Matt's first try at this kind of game and it kinda worked.\n\nThe second game added a few RPG elements, and by \"a few\" I mean that after every few waves of enemies (or a boss) you could upgrade one of your stats and pick a skill. It wasn't a deep system, but it was surprisingly fun to think of new strategies that it introduced, but othet than that, it was pretty much the same as the first game, with constant waves of enemies and bosses (this time you had two checkpoints however, each allowed you to save a game and also featured a mini-game where you kill undead cats as NoLegs -also a cat-the series' mascot)\n\nEBF3 is basically Matt's first semi-serious game. What do I mean by semi-serious? I mean that it's still very simple, rather short and not very deep, and it's also a browser game (the Steam version, which is free of course, only added stuff like higher Resolutions, fullscreen, turbo mode etc.).\n\nBut it's a start. It features an actual overworld which you can explore, search for treasures, secrets and quests.\nThere's also a normal levelling system and a whole lot of skills that can be upgraded separately. Combine that with more than 80 unique pieces of equipment and you get a fun jRPG-esque game which offers plenty of customisation and different tactics to defeat an enemy. Combat is still the main focus of the game and its core hasn't changed: you have a party, this time consisting of 3 party members, each with own strengths and weaknesses, battling waves of trash enemies and bosses until they die, not much to say.\nThe quests featured in the game are nothing more than simple fetch quests (or rather, getting some random crap from chests and enemy drops and giving them to an NPC), but hey - they're there.\nThe game isn't very long either, I finished the Steam release in under 8 hours while getting all the achievements, but those were fun 8 hours.\n\nOverall, if I were to compare EBF3 to budget games and AAA titles, that would be obviously unfair. The fourth game might be closer to that.\nBut as a simple browser game brought to Steam, I believe EBF3 deserves a solid 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1483033234, "timestamp_updated": 1483033234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.79996192455291748", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28751769": {"recommendationid": "28751769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061048547", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 689, "last_played": 1616797021}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego constituy\u00f3 un salto enorme desde su antecesor, que no era m\u00e1s que una sucesi\u00f3n de batallas por turnos con dos personajes ya desarrollados pero que ten\u00eda mucho encanto por su estilo flash, sus animaciones, enemigos, ataques, humor y referencias a la cultura pop por todas partes.\n\nAqu\u00ed te presentan la evoluci\u00f3n de ello, con un mapa para explorar, NPCs con sus misiones secundarias, personajes que subir de nivel desde 0...

Y los efectos visuales como las particulas son muy chulos.\n[*]Matt Roszak se merece mi respeto s\u00f3lo por haber llamado al jefe final como el villano de la [i]Emerald Sword Saga[/i] de Rhapsody of Fire, aunque ello provoca que eche en falta por ah\u00ed a alg\u00fan Dargor.\n[*]Los personajes son muy agradables, bastante chulos y sus di\u00e1logos muy entretenidos.\n[*]Mucha variedad en equipamiento y habilidades (para ser lo que es).

The game is funny, with wierd characters, and often fourth wall breaking npc dialogue. The three main characters are a sword loving warrior, a tree hugging mage, and an army guy who might be a nazi. Together the three heros go on a journy to defeat an ancient deity, who stole their powers and junk. On the way they slowly gain their powers and stuff back, eventually becoming powerfull enough to once again challange the deity. The game's combat is the best part. It is turn based, like most rpgs, but the characters can use awsome powers and weapons like orbital laser strikes, creating black holes, or causing giant swords to fall from the sky.

Eventually, in Attack of the Black Mages 5, we saw an early form of Natalie in the form of the White Mage. Around this time Matt started making games, with his first being mecha dress-up, which has been used to make several bosses, as well a quick-draw game called Brawl Royale\n     Eventually, Matt made his first turn-based RPG, simply called Epic Battle Fantasy. In it you played as Matt, the series offensive, and Natalie, the series healer. It didn't have much and isn't too interesting, only really play it if you want to understand a bit more history to the series. Then EBF 2 came out with a more coherent story tying in with the last game. It had more mechanics and was quite enjoyable, still worth playing. It introduced the first new party member, Lance, as the final boss.\n     That brings us to this, EBF 3, Matt's first big game. It has a good overworld, plenty of hidden treasure, amusing dialouge, an OK story, and anime boobs. Solid combat with a variety of skills (though not in all elements) and numerous enemies with different weaknesses, as well as many equips with varying effects, making customization strategically useful. It stars amazing music by Phyrnna (then called HalcyonicFalconX) and the final boss is great, with changing elements requiring you to go with an element-neutral strategy or to switch things up throughout the battle. Dialogue FROM Akron was interesting, making him less than flat at minimum. Completing it 100% does require a bit of luck alongside strategy and grinding, but you are rewarded with a bit of unique dialogue from the room behind Death. Overall an enjoyable game and quite good considering the developer's humble begginnings. Most (but not all) of the negative reviews I found were crude and not fair, but this game isn't flawless.

The fact that lessons were learned from game development and applied to an older work retroactively is great and EBF3 gains a lot by the numerous small improvements (e.g. being able to see a unit's Scan during battle), which is especially impressive considering that the game is still free.\n\nThe music is amazing, though sometimes there's some slight dissonance in the world and its music (for example: a sad song during a decidedly not sad snowy town). It should be mentioned, however, that the music direction is better than EBF2 and continues to improve in EBF4.\n\nThe battle system is simple, but never dull. A variety of skills help to set a unique strategy, though here too the trend for greater customizeability continues to EBF4.\n\nThe story is nothing spectacular, which should be mentioned, even if it doesn't try to be. However, the character interactions, while mostly humourous, do give some actual character development. The main characters may not grow out of character archetypes, but their dialogue is enough to keep one interested.

The abilities are very interesting to use, and the status effect system is very powerful, yet well-balanced. \n\nPositives: \n+Astoundingly-balanced battle system \n+FREE \n+Shorter RPG experience (for those who have little free time to play a 60+ hour RPG) \n+Decent soundtrack \n\nNegatives: \n-Almost non-existent story \n-Uninteresting overworld \n\nOverall, while it is my all-time favorite RPG, I can't really justify giving it a 10/10, given the flaws it has.

I haven't played Epic Battle Fantasy 1 & 2, but this game has a solid RPG core.\n\n[+]: \nThe humor is very welcome and goes very well with the game and characters. Turn-based battle style is always pleasing and enemies can sometimes come in waves. Abilities can be learnt on the go as long as one has enough AP through fights. Some monsters have to be cleared to access blocked areas. Status effects disappear right after a fight. Nice soundtrack.  Scanning enemies with a scouting device by someone who knows how to analyse monsters(the guy with the gun) to get valuable information on the enemy and update your bestiary(something that makes sense). Characters comment relevantly when stuff happen, and it does look like special attention was given to this: like when you just learnt an ability and use it to inflict damage on a specific enemy that is weak against it or if there's a secret nearby. Changing equipment changes appearance of the protagonist everywhere, everywhere!\n\n[-]:\nTeleporting between teleport points can be confusing as the portals in the warp zone are a bit confusing and unnamed, but are OK once gotten used to. Equiping equipment is a bit confusing, but enhancing them is very very easy and intuitive. Completing side quests is a bit confusing, as items can be dropped randomly or bought for very different prices, and acquisition of these are not very clear, plus the quest tracker doesn't give any location whatsoever of the quest-giver.\n\nThe GUI could have been more polished, and I'm guessing it is...in Epic Battle Fantasy 4(which I haven't played at the time of writing this), but that's how all the game developers do nowadays anyway.

It offers a very cutesy art style, and can fool you into thinking that this game's battle's are just as childish. Well I can confirm,\n\nThat i've never been happier to be proven wrong.\n\nAfter beating the game on Epic difficulty, I was genuinely ecstatic, and I truly felt like I earned my victories. The Battle system is deceptively complex, with no two monsters created with the same strengths and weaknesses. Although this applies especially to the bosses, it can be said for normal enemies as well that if you mess up a turn, (on harder difficulties), You will be surprised at how many ways enemies can 100-0 you in 2 seconds flat.\n\nThis game never felt grindy, which is something all Rpg maker's should strive for, as it is the golden style they should all strive for. A lot of battles are optional, and I rarely had to \"grind\" at all, even on the higher difficulties.\n\nI beleive this is because the reason i lost battles was because of MY inputs in the fight. I never once thought \n\"Oh, this monster is way too strong for me to kill, it must be like twice my level!\", because the truth is, level does not really matter too much in this game. What matters in this game is YOU making smart decisions in battle. Because even after grinding my *ss off, there was no difference to how fast a boss KO'd me. This is a very unique element in this game that i beleive makes it the classic that it is.\n\nOh and one last thing. \n\nSome of the Music in this game is AMAZING. Be sure to turn it up and give it a listen!

You wander around the world, looting chests laying around the place, speaking to NPCs for quests, and battling foes in turn-based combat.  You gain equipment and skills as the game progresses, and certain enemies are weak against certain elemental spells and weapons.  Finally, you can buff your attacks and debuff your enemies in the ultimate quest to make your percentage points bigger than their percentage points.  However, this isn't simply a game of numbers.  Laid over the mechanics are a beautiful aesthetic design (both musical and artistic) and a light sense of humor.\n\nA common complaint about experience-based games is the grind often associated with them, but this game is designed well enough that you shouldn't have to grind for levels; though, it can sometimes give you the upper hand, especially on the higher difficulties, to go back and fight some of the more difficult battles once or twice to gain an extra level, some skills, and cash and items with which to upgrade equipment.\n\nOverall, I quite enjoyed this game; if I had to pick out one downside, it would be that Epic Battle Fantasy 4 improves upon this game in every conceivable way.

came to steam made me supper nostalgic. but with nostalgie comes some arogace so i wanted to play it just to see if the game was still as fun as it was those years before and i am pleasently suprised that the game is as fun as ever.\nthe game is a classic turnbased rpg with enough dept and custimazation to make it easy to learn but not dull to play. and if you want a extra challange you can crank up the difficulty (if you want your ass kicked by the game). what also is pleasant to see is the artstyle and the writing. the arstile is cute and varied enough to make every place feel like a advanture on its own. the animation is smooth and feels natural. the writing is amazing. it has a lot of good humor, the characters are likeble and the acazinal 4th wall break makes it something very

I even enjoyed it far more than I did when I use to play it (mostly because of the nostalgia factor).\n\nThe best part about this game is just that it looks decently well, for being made by Matt Roszak alone. Not to mention, the OST is truly epic. I expect nothing less from Phyrnna when it comes to releasing the traxks for these games. There are many other positive notes, such as the humor, the gameplay, and much more.\n\nThe only real downside to this game is that its not very well optimized, but then again I do have a sub par computer so running it smoothly should be no problem if you have a well-built computer.\n\nOut of everything in this game, I say I'd give it a 8.5/10. In the end, I highly recommend installing the game since its free. If you don't end up liking it, sorry if I said anything misleading.

Nice, fun JRPG for free. Worth a try.\n\nOut of the 5 negative Steam reviews this currently has, only 1 actually making a point. This point, however, is pretty minor. \n\nThe review said the game was 'a nightmare grind-fest'. That on world 3, he went back and did half an hour of grinding, because the enemies were getting hard.\n\nSounds like most RPG games, to me. You grind to get your characters more powerful, to get better equipment, get more usable items, and the such. Grinding is often a part of RPG games. Even then, he said he spent half an hour doing it. First, doesn't sound that long to me. Second, I didn't have to spend that much time grinding in any one point. Might be becaue I ran back through areas a couple times when I went back to loot search, or might be because I was better equipped or better using my abilities.\n\nOther than that, though, the negative reviews have not pointed out any other flaws. As other positive reviews have said, this game is a downgrade from EBF4 in pretty much every way. Most important part of that is the price. This game is quite fun, and is completely free, which is a great way to show off what is in your later games. Gets people loving what you make and makes you want to see what else they have.\n\nOnly complaint I've got is the extreme difficulty near the end. Enemies that dispell you, then can take off all your health on the very next turn? Right, thanks. And that's on normal difficulty.

The place it really shines is combat and progression. As someone who's played a long line of turn based RPG's, I can easily say the EBF series has some of the best working combat systems in the genre, which has been something that's always had me coming back to it. And while it doesn't really change up the game in any insane ways from other games in the genre, everything here is extremely polished and that alone makes it a great journey. \n\nCombat: You have HP. The enemies have HP. You have a magic knight, mage, a gunner, and a legless cat as support. You attack, use skills, magic, and items until the enemy is dead. It's the tale as old as time, but EBF3 just refined the mechanics very, very well so that the whole game feels pretty smooth. Although EBF3 does include a wave system, so that some battles are actually linked together without a break in between. It's rather neat, and makes you think ahead before you finish off all the current enemies. \n\nProgression: EBF3 does this cool thing where it shows you all the skills you can learn off the bat. You just have to gather the AP to learn them (Something you obtain from all battles). You can learn the skills in almost any order (Some do have prerequistes) and upgrade them as you go through the game. You will feel a definite shift in power as your characters go from what feels like new adventurers to powerful heroes that could take on anything. \n\nEquipment: You know how it kind of bites in most JRPGs where when you equip the next armor level, it doesn't actually change the character's looks? Well, EBF3 is the game where every single armor, weapon, and headgear changes how a character looks. And a lot of the armor sets are pretty fantastic (The Officer's Uniform is a personal favorite). But a big part of the game is how equipment is very important to how battles play out. Resistances will make or break a battle, as well as weaknesses. But the game gives a very, very generous option to change your equipment in the middle of combat in case you made a mistake, or your enemies change and you need to switch to a different weapon. Another very, very cool thing the game does is it's upgrade system. You can upgrade your equipment which provides the standard increased stats as any normal game, but the higher upgrade levels straightup give new abilities to the equipment your using. Example, some weapons gain the ability to counter when hit when you upgrade them higher. One last cool thing it does it how the weapons stats are all balanced with each other, meaning you don't actually obtain better gear as you go through the game, just different gear. No gear is better then the rest, but it depends on the current situation which gear is the best. (That being said, Heaven's Gate is the best sword) \n\nDifficulty: The game is extremely fair with it's difficulty. Because the game increases the amount of experience you get by area, it is very difficult to become extremely overpowered and just slaughter everything early. Not only that, because of how it works, Grinding is something I almost never needed to do throughout the game, save for one period near the end of the game, and even that was only for around 20 minutes. And I played the game on it's highest difficulty, Epic, where the enemies all did 60% more damage automatically. The Bosses are also appropriately balanced, and often require more then a little thinking to defeat. That being said, the game's secret room, unlocked only when have all 60 achievements/medals is entirely unfair and completely evil. \n\nStory: There's a demon which sucks up the powers of the the three protagonists because they needed to be weaker so we could have a game. Story isn't the intent of the Epic Battle Fantasy series, and it's mainly used as an excuse for the game's fantastic combat and several jokes. This does mean this isn't the place to look for a deep story or long running narrative, but this also means you don't need to play any of the other games in the series to be really prepared to play this one. \n\nClosing Statement: This game is pretty fantastic because it achieves what it sets out to do. If you're looking for complex storytelling, look away from here. But if you're looking for a pretty fun time on a game that has a fantastic battle system, a great equipment system, some good comedy, and don't feel like spending any money at the moment, this is the place to go. \n", "timestamp_created": 1473155784, "timestamp_updated": 1473155784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25376660": {"recommendationid": "25376660", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992828613", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1097, "last_played": 1490142905}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a wonderful game for free.

I still need to clear out the monsters in the last hidden area, but other than grinding to do that, I've beaten this game.\n\nIt's a fun, easy, colorful, and well-designed RPG with catchy music and a \"free\" price tag to boot. There's lots of stupid humor, immature jokes here and there, and adorable monsters to smack for loots 'n' levels. And to make things even better, he's added a bunch of useful features that were not there on the web version! I absolutely adore the frame rate buttons, and I love that we can now see monster stats at any time during your turn. And Lance doesn't die so much! Woo! The difficulty is well-scaled so even newbies can play and beat it on lower difficulties, while the Epic difficulty can cause you to actual plan your fights and not be impossible!\n\nSo what's not to like? As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing horrible about EBF3, though there are a few bad things. The game doesn't look nearly as nice on full screen as EBF4 an BH2 do, but it still looks pretty good. There are a few spelling errors here and there, but nothing major. Plus, you likely won't use several of your equips, but what RPG doesn't have equips you never use?

It began as a simple wave by wave RPG, without much reason as to why you fight. It featured many cameos from famous franchises. In this installment and on, this was where the series began to adopt its own identity, saving cameos for mere references (some more obvious than others). I am a huge fan of the series, and I'm excited to see it reach beyond its \"flash\" game status. It may look, sound and play like one, but Matt (aka KupoGames) Rozsak knows to stretch its limits to create a wonderful game.\n\n\nThe customization is wonderful in this game. There are three characters, two of them male and one female. This dictates what equipment they can use. All three have their own unique weapon, and those weapons including their clothes, can be forged to become better. You may find certain equipment just plain better than others, if they essentially give the same resistants. The characters' clothes appear in the pictures of the dialogue boxes, and while wandering on the overworld, and of course in battle. I love when games do this.\n\nThe music, by the amazing Phyrnna (the game explains this in one of the menus viewable from the main menu) is phenomenal. Easy to get stuck in your head.\n\n\nThis is where I shift to comparing this one to EBF4. Obviously, you may think that this one's better because it's free on Steam compared to that, right? Well, I suppose, but...\nI'd argue the fourth game is much better. Menu management was slightly more difficult in this one compared to the fourth, even playing this one before. In EBF4, gone is most of the text walls, and statistics and elements are made into easy identifiable pictures. When seeing enemy weaknesses, instead of percentages (like in EBF4), it is just text in this game. I personally don't find it a problem since it typically wouldn't want to use a resisted element on an enemy, but for those who have a hard time remembering which enemies actually absorb or resist elements it can make it quite a hassle.\n\nYou can always scan enemies to see their weaknesses and resistances. However, in this game, you can only scan one enemy at a time, and only Lance, can do it. You can always flee from the fight and restart to get free scans, but this may be tedious. In the fourth game, the scan becomes a scanbot, and a Summon that anyone can use, as well as being able to scan every new enemy in battle. Obviously I can't be too hard on it, since this one did come out first.\n\nThe game's humor, you could say, comes partly from Internet memes. Obviously not everyone is going to care all that much for it, but the humor doesn't neccessarily stop there. I'm not going too much into detail because well... its a side thing. Humor isn't that important here. There are a few grammatical errors, but that's alright. It shouldn't ruin your fun of the game. Many of them are also probably intentional anyhow, for the \"illiterate\" NPCs. I'm sure I've made a few in this review anyhow.\n\nAt its core, this is an RPG series where the main idea is just having fun destroying foes with sheer numbers, and obliterating them as their waves come. It definitely takes its inspiration from other RPG series, but it's all in good fun, and it revels in its craziness.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you just like having a fun time, and a fairly difficult albeit short game (hey we can't be that ambitious for a previously Flash game) this is the one for you. If you're deciding on this game or EBF4, I would say start with this one, even though I've mentioned the other one is better. This is free, and in case you linger for more than two hours on the sequel only to find its not your style, you should let this one dictate how much you enjoy the battles. Yes, the menus are a bit more difficult to manage in this one, but the battles are what count mostly.

There is so much more to it, that you'll want to come back and play it again and again though.\n\nPlus, with the creator working on EBF5 coming in the future, it's a good filler to bring you back his world of limbless cats, suspicious looking jelly creatures, intimidating sandworms, explosive rocks, and the story of a group of friends who band together for the purest goal.\n\nTo fight, to get glory, and maybe to spend a little more time with your female party members.", "timestamp_created": 1472788970, "timestamp_updated": 1472788970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500685334205627441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25297456": {"recommendationid": "25297456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040306007", "num_games_owned": 662, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1517351055}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun, I have purchased previous games by the creator and I enjoy them.

Not only do the normal enemies become a challenge to beat, I had to look at some guides to get through the some of the later bosses. \nHowever, the game is honestly not hard at all on normal, and hard mode isn't that bad either. So if you're having problems beating normal enemies on normal mode, then you're doing something majorly wrong. Are you upgrading your skills/equipment?

Why is this? Most modern RPGs seem to test the player's patience and ability to continue level grinding and farming drops. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in games such as MMOs, but when I'm enjoying a story-driven single player game, I'd like to feel a little more immersed. \n\nEpic Battle Fantasy, on the other hand, takes the concept of grinding and throws it in the shredder. Most of the leveling you need is obtained just by playing through the story, so the only time you'll find yourself fighting extra enemies on the side is if you want to upgrade some skills with AP, a point system used to unlock new skills and make them stronger. By the end of the game, the player will likely be at max level and have all skills maxed, so being underleveled at any given point isn't really a thing that could happen.\n\nThese points aren't even the greatest part of why I recommend the series, though. As I said, in most RPGs you can just grind for some time and then be absolutely golden for the remainder of the game. In Epic Battle Fantasy, however, no matter how overleveled you think you may be, you'll be on-edge and strategizing through every battle, even the normal encounters (Though ESPECIALLY with bosses, obviously). You need to think about what elements to use, and what elements to protect yourself from with equipment, which you can switch mid-battle in case the enemies vary in type. \n\nWithout proper preparation, you could start a turn with full HP, and end the turn with a game over. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing; in fact, I believe it to be an amazing feeling. Plus, if it's too much for you, you can always just hit up easy mode. There's 4 difficulty settings so it's pretty accessible for anybody. \n\nMy overall point here is that the EBF games give a nostalgic RPG feel that most modern games can't deliver anymore because they all revolve around grinding for success now. Epic Battle Fantasy brings back the concept of ACTUALLY THINKING through your battles, and I absolutely love it for that.\n\n\n...oh, and there's boob jiggles :)", "timestamp_created": 1472758342, "timestamp_updated": 1480115247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572335958480834961", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25291223": {"recommendationid": "25291223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055542088", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1558731075}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking through the reviews to figure out if you should get this, look no further.\n\nFor you should already have this, now scroll back up and get cracking.", "timestamp_created": 1472757334, "timestamp_updated": 1472762289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495687395334243774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25290194": {"recommendationid": "25290194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096555004", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 466, "last_played": 1539204666}, "language": "english", "review": "Just like the 4th installment of the series, this game has great story, detailed graphics, & spot-on hilarious dialogue.

Dont mention my playtime. I have played this game back in the days on the internet. \n\nI hope I can give you an insight about this masterpiece, that is called EBF3. I will go through every possible aspect of this game and give it a final score.\nBut what exactly do you do in EBF3? \nIts a jRPG, where you go through the game and fight bosses, which become stronger and stronger. You start in a little town after a short cutscene. Afterwards you explore different locations, from a forest, up to a volcano and beyond. Every location has a boss, which you have to defeat, in order to continue your journey. Throughout the game are hidden chests. They often contain really nice items, like weapons and armors. At some places you can talk to NPCs and start a quest. They mostly consist of collect x amount of y. The rewards are really useful though. A lot of the quests will reward you with new skills, which are otherwise unattainable. Overall its a typical jRPG. Kill, grow stronger and kill the final boss.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]: 8/10\n\nThe story itself isn't really worth mentioning. Your team consists of 3 heroes which loose their powers at the beginning of the game. I wouldn't say that this game has a serious story. It is rather a funny story, which will yet keep you hooked and will entertain you throughout the game. You will read a lot of puns and jokes about Natalies boobs, but they arent really annoying or childish. Matt (the main hero) is your typical swordsmaster, Lance (my personal favourite) is your typical pervert and arms maniac and Natalie is your typical (hot) magician. You will learn to love each of them. Nothing too bad but also nothing too good.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]: 10/10\n\nThis is where the game REALLY shines. I really enjoyed every second of this game. The combat system of EBF3 is really entertaining and the boss battles are really tough. Beware though that I played this game on the highest difficulty. Even if you level up your heroes, the bosses will still provide a nice challenge. If you approach them the wrong way, you're screwed. Don't get me wrong though. Even though the bosses are challenging even after grinding for xp and materials, they are never unfair. You always know, that you could've done it better and might have saved up your limitbreak for a certain boss attack. As every RPG you level up by killing monsters, after you've reached a certain amount of XP. But other than leveling up, you also got equipment. Equipment in this game is REALLY essential, as it can mean victory of defeat in this game (thats why I said you'll never feel like you have been treated unfair, after loosing a battle). Each equipment part has its own stats. Some have resistances against fire attacks,ice attacks and so on, some apply certain buffs, some weapons deal elemental damage, some equipment parts will increase your resistance to certain debuffs like blind, silence and so on. As you can see, you can prepare yourself for every battle in EBF3. Beware though, there are some enemies who will change their elemental resistance throughout the battle. So you have to change your weapon for example from fire to ice and so on. Every weapon and equipment can be upgraded up to 5 times. Upgrading will cost materials (Materials can also used to complete certain quests). Each upgrade will increase their effectiveness by (most of the time) 10%. Level 4 to 5 will also ocasionally have an extra effect. For example Matts sword Heavens Gate will counter enemy attacks, when it's level 4 and will sometimes cast shine on level 5. \nNow to the skills. Every character can learn skills from a skill tree(Each has their own skill tree though). Usually you are free to pick every skill you want in the order you want. But you have to keep in mind that each skill has its own price. From the skill tree you can also learn your limitbreak. Limitbreaks are special attacks, which are avaivable after your characters have taken a certain amount of damage. These are especially strong attacks, which can be devastating.\nThere are some minigames, which can be REALLY frustrating, if you want 100% in EBF3 and especially if you want to unlock the secret dungeon,which you do once you got every achievement. But if you are patient enough, you will master these minigames too. They also reward you with items and gold.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]: 10/10\n\nEBF3 has one of the best soundtrack I've heard. Every location has a song, that will blow your mind and suits the theme of it perfectly. You can easily listen to the soundtrack, while browsing the net or playing another game. I never got annoyed by any song in this game. Best of all? You get every song for free as mp3.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]: 10/10\n\nI cant speak for the lower difficulties, since I've only played on the hardest setting. But hell this game is REALLY hard. Some might call me noob, but there were a lot of times, I got so frustrated, that I just needed a break. (Final boss reference ;)  ) As I have mentioned above though, you never want to quit the game forever because of the difficulty. You rather want to try again and again and again, grind a little and then try again, until you've beaten the boss. This game has one of the best rpg combat systems I've seen. Every boss has its own weakness and some certain things you have to watch out for. I really loved fighting every boss in this game. They all were a nice challenge and you had that feeling, that you have accomplished something. The best boss for me was the final boss. I remember back in the days, that I had quit this game, because I thought I'd never beat him. Several months later I tried again and again until I kicked his butt. Best moment of my life. Didn't regret anything. So if you're seeking a challenging game, try EBF3 on epic difficulty.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]: 10/10\n\nIt is, what it is. It's not 3d but yet the game and its locations look beautiful. Maps are designed with love, they dont look boring or repetetive. Everything is colorful, lively and well thought. I'm judging the graphics based on what it is. \n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]: 10/10 tl;dr\n\nThis game is a must have, if you love turn based rpgs. Awsome music, awesome combat system, awesome game and awesome dialogues ;). It's for free and has the soundtrack included. You will have a lot of fun with it. The actual playtime is based on your difficulty you play on. The epic difficulty can really take a lot of time to beat. I'd say from 10-30hours, depending on how good you are. \n\nSo for your own sake, download the game already and play it.

Epic Battle Fantasy 3 (EBF 3) is funny, quirky and well made and free. Yes. Quality content for free.\nEdit: Finished the game. Reviews points remain.\n\nThe simple turn-based combat that harkens to a simpler RPG time coupled with hilarious dialogue and references makes for plenty of hours of fun. Plenty of collectibles and medals to satiate the inner-collector, perfectionist and achievement hunter. All of this can be done while listening to the great tunes of Phyrnna, who was responsible for most, if not all, of the music across all the games.\n\nThere were several quality of life improvements made that I greatly appreciate from Matt Roszak, the developer (aka Kupo Games). Rather than simply port EBF 3, it was improved upon, and if the minigames were as I remembered, an increase in easiness is VERY APPRECIATED. The link to all the features he added is below\nhttp://kupogames.com/2016/08/31/ebf3-final-new-features-list/\n\nThe game graphics are as cute and endearing as ever, though its age did show in the full screen mode due to the resolution. I am however more than happy playing it in its windowed mode and give that and its few missing quality of life features a pass. For a flash game released 6 years ago, the game still holds up well in my eyes.\n\nAll in all, a definite recommend to RPG fans. Exactly what it says on the tin, and best of all, there's no need to wait years for its sequel. EBF 4 is already here (free on web only). Just scroll down.\n\nEdit: There is a 2x speed function which I also greatly appreciated since I already played the game before and wanted to speed run it.

This updated version is a great introduction into the EBF series, as it's free and simpler than EBF4. If you're unsure about whether or not you want to buy EBF4, play this game first - while EBF3 is much simpler, the core concepts are the same.\n\nThis game is full of colour and humour, and has a little something for everyone - oversized weapons, adorable enemies, fantastic boss fights, and anime boobs. While on the outside, the game seems cartoony and silly, the actual gameplay is refined and revolves around a lot of strategy, but has difficulty settings for everyone. On Easy mode you can get away with making mistakes, but on Epic mode you've [i]got[/i] to know what you're doing and how you're going to do it. Of course, real men play on Epic mode.\n\nNow, my two favourite parts of the game: the boss fights, and the music. The boss fights in this game are actually quite challenging, but not to a frustrating point. They feel fair but tricky, and each boss has a strategy around it that keeps you on your toes. Each boss is different and brute force only gets you so far.\n\nIf you've read any reviews for any EBF-related game before, you'll have heard about the quality of the soundtrack - EBF3 is just one of several games with a fantastic soundtrack.

Also, disclosure, I got a Steam key a few days early and have been playing, Let's Playing and writing reviews of these games for years so I guess you could argue I'm looking at this through the lens of a rather hyperbolic fanboy.[/h1]\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nSo, what to say about Epic Battle Fantasy 3. On the one hand, it's a silly Flash game, it looks like a silly Flash game, it sounds like a silly Flash game, it's written like a silly Flash game and I suppose you could argue that it plays like a silly Flash game, but it's all put together very well. The art and graphics isn't [i]fantastic,[/i] but the style is very cohesive and the world map isn't so big that it starts to look repetitive. The sound effects and battle animations are cartoony and the characters sometimes exclaim \"kek\" (sic) or similar in battle, but it works because the entire [i]game[/i] has a cartoony aesthetic. The writing . . . well, you're probably not playing this kind of game if you want to experience Tolkien or Rowling, and, say it with me, the silly over-the-top save-the-world plot goes nicely with the silly over-the-top world of menacing giant squid and sentient giant monolith things.\n\nThe battles themselves are a turn-based system where you get to attack first every turn, there is no \"speed\" or \"agility\" stat, so I guess it doesn't toe the JRPG line [i]perfectly.[/i] Anyway, there isn't too much to say about the battles except that they can easily fall into the \"Fire attack, heal and repeat\" pattern and you can probably beat Easy and Normal modes that way, but if you want to strategize a little more there is a bit more you can do with playing with status effects and changing equips mid-battle.\n\nIf you want a full list of differences/fixes between this and the web version, [url=http://kupogames.com/2016/08/31/ebf3-final-new-features-list/]see here[/url].\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nThere are a couple spelling/English errors here and there throughout the game. It doesn't look terribly professional but they realistically don't have any affect on how the game plays so please don't bother complaining about it. I have no idea if they're going to be patched out by the time the game itself is released or anything like that.\n\nThere are a couple places where the music doesn't loop perfectly. But the music's still great so you won't see me complaining that some battle theme is half a measure off at the end or something.\n\n[h1]I obviously have to compare this game to its successor, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/265610/]EBF4[/url], at some point, so here you go[/h1]\n\nEBF4 boasts a longer story, fancier graphics, more to explore, Battle Mountain and a bunch of other things, but in a lot of strange ways I enjoy this game better. The battle system has fewer moves available and feels less overwhelming to start out with, and there are few enough that you could realistically try out all (most) of them throughout the course of a single playthrough. The game and game world themselves are shorter, and the level cap is 30 (I think the final enemies in the game top out at about level 32 or 33), so the end-game battles feel somewhat less long and dragged out. Lastly, while EBF4 overall probably has better music, [url=https://phyrnna.bandcamp.com/track/youll-never-guess-this][i]You'll Never Guess This[/i][/url] is easily my favorite song in all of Flash games.\n\nAlso, the font is in Comic Sans. I personally am in favor of adding DLC to EBF4 and Bullet Heaven 2 that changes all of the fonts in the game to Comic Sans.\n\n[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\n\nGood game, and if you don't believe me it's free (as in it doesn't even cost money) so there really is no downside to downloading it and trying it out for twenty minutes.\n\n[s]If I see anyone reply with \"I hate anime games\" I will make sure to personally strangle you with a small planet.[/s]", "timestamp_created": 1472738071, "timestamp_updated": 1472738071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666345059871673584", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25285802": {"recommendationid": "25285802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104493420", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 752, "last_played": 1606656027}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply wonderful.
