conoce nada de Hololive, algunos detalles y referencias pueden resultar un poco raros (una chica perro que usa un motosierra o puede convertirse en un pixel art de 8-bit de s\u00ed misma, por ejemplo), pero si te gustan los juegos de pelea lo vas a pasar bien. Me result\u00f3 muy divertido y bien hecho, Besto Game Team sabe muy bien lo que hace. La estandarizaci\u00f3n del sistema de combos y habilidades hace que la curva de aprendizaje sea baja (b\u00e1sicamente, aprendes las habilidades de un personaje y ya los aprendiste a todos) lo cual se agradece en un g\u00e9nero que suele ser dif\u00edcil de dominar. Incluso lo recomiendo si nunca agarraste un juego de peleas, es una buena introducci\u00f3n al g\u00e9nero. \n\nComo fan de Hololive, lo \u00fanico que no me gusta hasta ahora es el arte. No voy a dorar la p\u00edldora, las chicas se ven horribles. El lineart hiper grueso, el sombreado en negro o con l\u00edneas y los detalles de los rostros hace que los dibujos se vean sucios, y las facciones las hacen casi irreconocibles para quien ve a estas vtubers a diario. La est\u00e9tica se aleja del estilo anime y se asemeja m\u00e1s a un c\u00f3mic que desentona con el juego y su material de fuente. Quien los hizo es muy buen dibujante, pero personalmente me desagrada c\u00f3mo se ve. \n\nPor el resto, lo que es pixel art est\u00e1 muy bien, se acerca un poco m\u00e1s (est\u00e9ticamente hablando) a la apariencia de las chicas.

The fact that enemies are so aggressive is normal in a fighting game, is just skill issue, but I lost 3 times in a row the whole run after playing decently good 'cause 1-After defeating the opponent, my character got surrounded by an orange aura, literally stop moving (pad worked, it's the game \"feature\"), the opponent got back her HPs and I lost due to timer 'cause my character didn't moved for the next 40 seconds, while the opponent was attacking me dealing no damage. 2-I retried, reached stage 3 again, defeated the opponent, but the fight restarted as nothing happened and I lost. 3-The stage was \"you can't see Suisei in the dark\", after 2 seconds from the begin the screen became black except for the special meter, and after fighting literally in the dark for around 25 seconds I lost due to being defeated (again, I couldn't see ANYTHING, not the HPs, not the opponent, not myself).\nSo again, I understand the skill issue, I love the game in general, but if you're winning it becomes highly unfair and almost unbeatable, and I find that stupid and frustrating.\n\n(I allow comments in case there is somebody that spent 300 hours in the game and can explain that I did something wrong and it's not game's fault)", "timestamp_created": 1700404117, "timestamp_updated": 1700404241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150391619": {"recommendationid": "150391619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367075358", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1700686079}, "language": "english", "review": "Im bullying my friends in this game can recomend 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1700351036, "timestamp_updated": 1700351036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150385920": {"recommendationid": "150385920", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044813695", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1700599333}, "language": "english", "review": "pls fix the servers", "timestamp_created": 1700343879, "timestamp_updated": 1700343879, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150370015": {"recommendationid": "150370015", "author": {"steamid": "76561199183563221", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 124, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1700327297}, "language": "english", "review": "Never played any fighting game more bullshit than this.

I am not big on fighting games in general. My history with them goes all the way back to Street Fighter II: Turbo (SEGA Genesis), MKII (Genesis), Tekken 3 (PS), Soul Calibur II (PS2), Tekken 4 (PS2), Super Smash Melee, Super Smash Ultimate. Never played competitively, and I don't plan to. This means my mechanical knowledge will be minimal, but I can tell where improvements can be made. My issues are primarily concerning the User/Player experience and trying to smooth it out.\n\n1. START button will pause the game, but it will not UNPAUSE the game. Who would've thought in 2023, this would be a missed feature. I can only assume \"Bad Coding\" or something, but I'm assuming this was just overlooked.\n2. Getting back into a match (REMATCH) takes wayyyyyy too long. I don't need to see the defeat screen for 10sec...I know I lost. Remove this and replace with a simple \"RETRY\" button, or cut down the screen time. In 1 hour of playing, I would like to maximize my time Fighting. Either option will vastly improve user/player experience.\n\nI also have my issues with the Arcade boss, but I'm still learning the game and how all the mechanics work. It could be that I am missing or forgetting about 1 or 2 critical mechanics that will let me beat this OP boss.\n- All fighters have 1000 HP...Boss has 1250 HP\n- Boss is a gimmick fighter that uses moves from ALL the other girls. This means you are not fighting a rushdown, zoner, or grappler. You are fighting GOD. \n- Boss access to all girls moves (not every single move in the game, just special moves), the Boss can set up a full screen of projectiles where there is no safe space. It's 2023...everyone deserves a safe space\n\nI wouldn't say change the Boss, but maybe limit the projectiles on screen??\n\n\nMy only request: Add in a way to Grab on block. \nIt's not really there at this time. I can grab right after a MED or HIGH attack gets blocked, but when looking at the frame data we have maybe 4 frames at best to get the grab. Shouldn't break anything since folks can counter out of the throw, but it gives the player another option.", "timestamp_created": 1699854634, "timestamp_updated": 1699854634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150038858": {"recommendationid": "150038858", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101276440", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 90, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1699839784}, "language": "english", "review": "I've NEVER watched a VTuber in my life but i can say this game is a W", "timestamp_created": 1699838206, "timestamp_updated": 1699838206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150029781": {"recommendationid": "150029781", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208192591", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1699818544}, "language": "spanish", "review": "good fan game\nnerf pekora", "timestamp_created": 1699826068, "timestamp_updated": 1699826068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150028295": {"recommendationid": "150028295", "author": {"steamid": "76561199032486642", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "playtime_at_review": 456, "last_played": 1699823876}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es hermoso y digno de jugar", "timestamp_created": 1699824220, "timestamp_updated": 1699824220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150025055": {"recommendationid": "150025055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198877151614", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1699822891}, "language": "english", "review": "This \"game\" isn't a game, it's a piece of art, designed for a species much superior than us puny humans, who can't even begin to comprehend the greatness that is Idol Showdown.

I don't know much about v-tubers but I always love supporting indie fighters. Based on the quality of the art and animation, I wanted to like what was being presented to me, but it does a lot of heavy lifting for the extremely sparse gameplay. People expecting a typical \"anime-fighter\" will be disappointed by the super tiny combos. People expecting a more \"arcade fighter\" will be disappointed by the aesthetics and the fact that inputs are very simple (there is only one motion input for instance - qcf). In trying to appeal to everyone, this is going to appeal to nobody. This evokes Blazblue Cross Tag Battle, if I had to peg it to a game already out. Then we get to the balance, which is absolutely all over the place. You have one character who causes damage over time and another character who needs to spend an entire meter for 5 percent damage.

Despite that, the developers are working hard on putting in more characters and so far put out 1 new fighter along with new assists and other stuff.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect is not amazing, but good, and even has spectator mode now.\nWith the new update, the game has crashed on my friend and I a few times but it's nothing that devs can't fix with time, I'm sure.\n\nOverall, a good game, even

That is until you try to play is at a higher level and you realize that there are serious balancing issues. \nHere are just a few examples: \n1.Why is there no blocking push back on certain moves. you can get locked in a corner if you decide to block. Where as in other fighting games the blocking push back is even increased to insure an environment where the defender has a chance to mount a comeback. Maybe a push back mechanic like in MVC that maybe cost assist meter or some type of reversal attack that would use a normal bar. This leads to the next complaint. \n2. Why are there barely any defensive mechanics? Especially in a game where it seems that chip damage is the name of the game and zoners are king. \n3. Why does it the game eat special move inputs. I could understand if this was maybe just me having this issue, that way it could easily be written off as me needing to \"get good\" but holy cow, i've run into so many ppl that say they only use the special button inputs for their combos because the input system isn't reliable enough to read guaranty they won't drop a combo or even worse, respond properly to a high stress reaction situation.\n4. No comeback mechanics or assist recovery. This might go hand in hand with the \"no defensive mechanics\" I said earlier. Not even a cheeky assist save could help you. A good idea to implement would be to start with one level of assist at the beginning of the game and then once it's used start to rebuild it kind of like the burst bar in Guilty Gear.\n5. No real grappler support. In a game in which the majority of the cast is a zoner, you provide very little in the way of over all entry tools. If all the other things weren't an issue Coco would still be viable. The perfect try hard character, but wow. A jumping down heavy ends up being slower than just landing normally? An air special that doesn't provide any real advantage. You move forward, that's great, but you cant do anything of real consequence with it.

The game offers easy inputs for newcomers with a single auto combo. Meanwhile, motion inputs are available if these newbies want to go deeper or for FG veterans.\n\nMotion inputs give access to the same movements you can do with simple inputs plus new movements that extends the simple ones. \nSo instead of just having 3 special movements and 2 supers like in Granblue/LOL/DNF per char, we got 6 special movements and 3 supers. 8 and 4 supers if the character counts with aerial movements. Also, you can perform an extra assist/collab attack with an extra motion input.\n\nMotion inputs allow Idol Showdown to count with more movements for every char, giving new layers of deepness to the game.\nAlso, these motion inputs are quite easy to perform and very intuitive. Actually, many gamers perform these motion inputs without noticing in other games: Quarter circles, and pressing twice in any direction are very common in gaming.\n\nSprites aren't exactly the best, but decent. \nThe lobby is barebones but the netcode is superb. \nNice music.\nThe lore, I don't know anything about Vtubers, so I can't care less but the character design is cool.\nChar's gameplay is very varied, we got grapplers, rushers, zoners, trappers, etc.\n\nIf you are paying 60$ for games whose every character's command list is so short you can read them in less than 15 seconds, you can try this for free.\n\nIt is funny (and sad) an indie developer can create for free a way more deep and rewarding fighting game than billionaire companies like Nexon/Cygames/Riot. Maybe because this is a free game and not a cash grab(in the case of Riot, I'm quite sure this is about paid costumes), developers are trying to create a real fighting game instead of games whose chars are just simple with a few special movements.\n", "timestamp_created": 1690599700, "timestamp_updated": 1690599700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510897994041442871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142993367": {"recommendationid": "142993367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076857497", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1690599249}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Thank you Megan[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1690598666, "timestamp_updated": 1690598666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142990484": {"recommendationid": "142990484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045757248", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1690070344}, "language": "english", "review": "alright for a free game", "timestamp_created": 1690594056, "timestamp_updated": 1690594056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142951655": {"recommendationid": "142951655", "author": {"steamid": "76561199445743348", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 641, "last_played": 1688429284}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2639\u2639\u2639\u2639\u2639", "timestamp_created": 1690547299, "timestamp_updated": 1690547299, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.380359619855880737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142941798": {"recommendationid": "142941798", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995335515", "num_games_owned": 750, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 541, "last_played": 1690533950}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a really awesome game, Unbelievable how good it is for the price.

If you have a bunch of fighting game options in your library then I guess its much of a muchness, but if you don't then this is pretty good. \n\nDon't really know much about the source material.... I guess its a cultural thing, supposedly some asian influencers. Of course that means I evaluate the game as a neutral. But that being said the aesthetic is fine, they have done well to actually theme the content of the universe around this. \n\nI've been grinding the virtual frontier mode, which is a roguelike survival career mode, pretty fun. The game only has eight characters to choose from and play with, but there are some mechanics that provide a lot of spice and variety to the battles but I'm not so far to tell how much more characters it would need as it takes a while to master a character actually.\n\nIdol Showdown also features rollback netcode for multiplayer, which smooths latency over distance. I haven't seen a lot of activity online in a few attempts, I guess part of this review is to keep visibility up and keep it going strong. I did want to check latency to Africa but anyways. \n\nThere is local multiplayer support and custom lobby options online via code-sharing as well.\n\nThere's just overall a lot of QOL features here, very considerate in development and very charming. I also think there's a high level of accessibility in its fighting mechanic systems. \n\nThis has been a welcome addition and a reason to enjoy fighting games a bit more, even if just for a few hours. I used to rock a lot of Tekken and Mortal Kombat back in the day, but haven't gotten into it as much on Steam so far. \n\nMy perception is that fighting games can sometimes come and go fairly quickly

You join for a few minutes just to type \"shotacon\" in chat before turning in for the night. 3am, you hear a loud crashing sound coming from your front door. A dark figure walks in and into your bedroom. It's Suisei, the idol who you had grown fond of since her debut with hololive straddles you, grabbing your neck with her left hand and punching your head with her right. She whispers, \"Tell me what you said kiddo, or I won't stop until this head splits open~musical_note\" Still dopey, you cannot say a word as she chokes you. As she increased the strength used with each punch, you feel pain shoot through your head, you are struggling to stay conscious as you fight to break free from her grip. You suddenly feel as if you have a chance as you are finally able to push her hand out of the way. Only for her to sink the hardest punch of all straight into your face. You feel your eye sockets loosening, the cartilage in your nose snapping, your jaws coming loose and your skull caving in as the idols bloody fist sank deep into your face. You hear the laugh you once thought was adorable in its own way now ringing in your ears as the battlecry of a true psychopath before losing consciousness there and then. You collapse back onto your bed as the comet continues pounding your mangled head with her fist. Not even a minute passes before her punches break through the skin and split your lifeless head open, spewing mangled remains of brain matter, blood vessels and pieces of skull all over the place. The suicopath grins as she has a taste of your blood on her fist before carrying your now headless body out of your house and into a pickup truck. She drives for hours to a secluded island off the shore and dumps your body into the ocean.

so call zoner is what people call her when sora, aki, fubuki, korone and somewhat susei with better nuetral buttons since there fireball or rekka options safe what does botan have before and after the nerfs 1 somewhat safe option was the grab after 5m rekka our other options just get us punish since the rest of the cast has good nuetral options btw must be nice botan only two options which are both unsafe to do to take back a turn is 2m or 23h since we dont have fast enough buttons to deal with blockstrings thats -2 to -4 since the push blocking in the corner makes it impossible to 5 or 2l yo hit but dont worry she needed nerfs while every other character still keeps there untechable otk, instant overhead that are plus on block and lead to combo on hit, dp that lead to combo and characters with more useful options during blockstrings that leave them plus enough to earn a bar to reset the blockstring that rarely has any gaps if this wasnt a vtuber game this game would be dead with the

not returning to this game i rather play gbvs and sf6 this game took a turn in the wrong direction and it show with the steam chart numbers you aint bringing back your numbers with the simps alone

Keeping opponents at bay with a barrage of attacks\n- Shishiro Botan: Guns at the ready, this lioness is a zoner archetype with explosives and guns to keep them at bay. They also snuck in a heavenly pot buster for strive fans \n- Kiryu Coco: The grappler with a lot of flare. This grappler is one of the better grapplers in fighters being able to get in fairly easier than others to deal her massive damage. Once you close the gap, they are toast\n- Shirakami Fubuki: A unique character with a gacha gimmick her special moves have a chance to turn into stronger ssr variations.\n- Inugami Korone: The lovable all-rounder with a very versatile kit. She is a shoto archetype and has no gimmicks whatsoever.\n- Aki Rosenthal: Strong and graceful, she is able to control the stage with her evasive and clean mixups, while also being able to keep distance. She doens't even need meter to do half of that sweet health bar you have. (Very strong character atm and would probably get your friends tilted but still fun).\n- Tokino Sora- Not soda: She is a set-play / mixup fiend. A good moveset with pressure tools to get her in to do good damage. (This is the character I play, therefore she is the best on the roster).\n- Hoshimachi Suisei: A combo heavy versatile character. She relies on superchat cancels/ a special motion where a pop up notification comes on the side of the screen when done to string multiple specials.\nOverall review:\n9 out of 10 a silly simple game to have fun in with a lot of references to the hololive fans.\nTake care and have a cookie!", "timestamp_created": 1684965897, "timestamp_updated": 1684965897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

Feels very good. A lot of references. Good Entry point without overdoing entry level. Looks great. Lot of heart and soul put into the game. TRY IT, pls.\n\nThis game is SO good. Its an amazing fighter, it feels nice, its not just an entry point, and it is fun to play. The problem I have with a lot of fighting games is that sometimes they are just entry points: Granblue (1st version) and Guilty Gear Strive. Often Times these games are oversimplified and just feel unfun to play after a short amount of time. This game is not that, there are a wide variety of moves and combos, different special cancels, and the fighting game archetypes are nailed in my opinion. I love the background details as there are so many references, the music choices are great, and the characters are so well designed. This game is so well designed. This is a perfect merge of Hololive and a fighting game. The fighting game elements feel great that even if someone weren't into hololive I'd still recommend this game. Thank you developers.

other doujin fighting games, it's got pretty low execution requirements to play decently, and ...uh, I'm not really sure who any of these characters are or why the game uses \"stream on!\" to begin fights and \"Seiso!\" for a perfect no-damage round.\n\nBut it's fun, and there doesn't seem to be anything horribly unbalanced. It's got a bit of kusoge charm, it's got some nice references to other fighting game franchises, its controls are simple for its genre (I think that's a good thing - forcing the focus onto learning and stringing together moves rather than doing a pretzel motion with your stick. Yes, Terumi, I remember how awful your Astral Finish is to pull off), and it's kinda chill once you get a handle on its systems and mechanics.\n\nNot the best fighting game I've ever played, but certainly not the worst, and extremely good quality for the wonderful price of FREE.

It's also free! Even those who don't have a basic knowledge of fighting can easily get into it.\nHere's a little review of the pros and cons\nPros.\n\n1. Easy to use, so new players with no experience in fighting games can get started quickly.\n2. The graphics are simple, uncluttered and well-drawn\n3. The moves are interspersed with some mazes, and the details are very well placed.\n4. Rollback network code is installed, so the connection quality is very stable\n5. The collab system is very interesting and can often create some unexpected effects\nDisadvantages.\nSome characters are really weak and some are really strong, and this has to be applied to the collab characters as well, some collab characters are really disgusting.\nSome of the HITBOX moves are very weird, for example, Hyakki's Dragon Rising, the opening scene is standing still while Hyakki's Dragon Rising can directly roll me, I really don't know what that HITBOX is in Tsung Tsung Tsung. The rest is not much to comment on, please feel it yourself!\n3. Although there is a rollback network code installed, I don't know if it's a server problem, but sometimes when I play with my friends, the game will suddenly become stuck when the ping is not rising.\n4. There is a chance that practicing with the AI may cause bugs, for example, the AI will just get stuck and not move.\n\nHowever, as a fan-oriented game made by a one-man team, its strengths can override the weaknesses, and it can score 8~9 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1684506599, "timestamp_updated": 1684506599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Ayame Vs Botan is an impossible match up. I play Ayame but I dont have any option to get up close and personal with Botan unless I spend meter. To which if I spend meter with 214H and my opponent blocks it, that's it, the match is over. Joewari Da\n\nThere is a problem with resolutions in this game, I get the best performance if I play in fullscreen but the game is stretched to fit the whole screen with no regards to aspect ratio, If I play in Exclusive Fullscreen, the game is cropped and I cant see the characters' feet (Important) and health and meter bars and if I play in windowed, its a stuttery mess that plays anywhere between 44-60 FPS regardless of characters and or stage its not poggers at all.\n\nWhy did I rate this game positive then if I have a bad time with this game? I see potential in it. If they fix the balance and work around optimizing the game, then yes, I will see it as a really great fighting game. and as it is of now, I feel bad for complaining considering the game is free and has more content than Street Fighter V had during its launch. \n\nTLDr: I hate Botan (Not the streamer, the character in this game.

their streams.\n\nThis game is pretty decent for a fighting game. It's fairly well made, you can tell the creators put a lot of effort into it.\nThe sprite work is really good, the sounds are good, the music is great, and it's got good netcode.\nThe game comes with a couple of modes too, which you wouldn't think a free fighting game would come with, including a neat \"rpg-style endurance-ish\" mode where you get items and accessories that change up the fights, and you fight against NPCs with different effects during the fight, like low gravity or having to survive an invincible opponent.\n\nThe combat mechanics are really well done too. The combos feel good, the special moves are nice, the supers are pretty sweet, and you get assists called collabs (but you can't assist spam in this game thankfully!).\n\nHonestly I recommend anyone who likes fighting games to give it a try, it's free~ \n\nThe only issues I have with the game so far are I wish there was a lobby system for online mode, and sometimes during fights my grabs will whiff on grabbable opponents, which sucks because I main Coco which is the grappler. \n(There was even one time where I was standing next to the opponent, I used my grab and it whiffed, and they grabbed me immediately after! Annoying...)\n\nP.S. Don't play Coco during single player games, the NPC cheats like fuck and will cancel every normal grab and jump away from every command grab! This pissed me off when I was playing the various modes to unlock her colors, why play a grappler when the NPC will cheat to not let me grab? Make the command grab a 0-frame grab like in other games so the NPC can't jump out by reading your button inputs!!!", "timestamp_created": 1684135444, "timestamp_updated": 1684135444, "voted_up":

[/spoiler] Overall, a pretty good fighting game for beginners to pick up and play and not be overwhelmed by complex mechanics.\n\nPersonal complaint is that the normal grab/counter grab feels a bit clunky, [spoiler] or maybe that I'm just bad at playing grapplers to begin with lol. [/spoiler] I also kinda wish that there's an option to reduce the some of the details/background details like the Bar Stage, definitely too much going on for me which distracts me from time to time [spoiler] (especially when playing the heavy setup Sora) [/spoiler] and overall lags the game in that stage, but that's just me.", "timestamp_created": 1684025515, "timestamp_updated": 1684025515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138264672": {"recommendationid": "138264672", "author": {"steamid": "76561199482716258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1692117217}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Idol Showdown es un juego hecho por fans para fans de Hololive y sus artistas Vtuber. Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n es perfectamente disfrutable para cualquier amante del g\u00e9nero de los juegos de lucha. El juego presenta controles simples que siguen el sistema [L M H S], tambi\u00e9n conocido como [A B C D], de 4 botones, en lugar del tradicional sistema de 6 botones utilizado en juegos como Street Fighter. Esta elecci\u00f3n de controles permite que tanto los fans de Hololive que no est\u00e1n familiarizados con el g\u00e9nero de los juegos de lucha como los jugadores veteranos puedan disfrutar del juego.\n\nIdol Showdown logra un buen equilibrio entre accesibilidad y complejidad, lo que permite que los fan\u00e1ticos de Hololive que no est\u00e1n familiarizados con el g\u00e9nero puedan divertirse, mientras que los jugadores m\u00e1s experimentados pueden disfrutar de combos m\u00e1s avanzados y una experiencia m\u00e1s competitiva. El juego incluye numerosas referencias a Hololive y sus artistas Vtuber, lo cual es agradable para los fans, pero puede no ser tan atractivo para aquellos que buscan un t\u00edtulo de lucha m\u00e1s tradicional y equilibrado, como Street Fighter o Tekken.\n\nEl contenido offline del juego est\u00e1 bien elaborado y ofrece una experiencia agradable y entretenida para los jugadores que prefieren jugar sin conexi\u00f3n y solo desean pasar un rato divertido con el t\u00edtulo. Este es un aspecto en el que Idol Showdown destaca en comparaci\u00f3n con los t\u00edtulos profesionales del mercado que no son creados por fans.\n\nEn cuanto a los personajes, a la fecha de esta rese\u00f1a, hay solo 3 personajes confirmados por salir, pero logran ser lo suficientemente variados para ofrecer una jugabilidad completa. Sin embargo, el balance del juego est\u00e1 pobremente ejecutado, con golpes con invencibilidad enga\u00f1osa, ataques con un rango de alcance rid\u00edculamente amplio y personajes con un da\u00f1o extremadamente elevado para ataques relativamente simples. A pesar de esto, la sensaci\u00f3n de velocidad, los combos gratificantes y los movimientos locos de algunos personajes logran mantener el inter\u00e9s del jugador durante un buen rato. No obstante, es posible que no sea una opci\u00f3n demasiado atractiva para aquellos que buscan salir de su juego de lucha preferido y experimentar con algo nuevo.\n\nLa accesibilidad no se limita solo al sistema de 4 botones, ya que el juego tambi\u00e9n ofrece un tutorial y misiones \u00fatiles que, sin ser una maravilla, sirven para aprender los aspectos particulares del gameplay de Idol Showdown. Sin embargo, para los novatos en los juegos de lucha, ser\u00eda a\u00fan mejor contar con un tutorial que repase los conceptos m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicos y universales del g\u00e9nero. Adem\u00e1s, en la pantalla de selecci\u00f3n de personajes, se muestra un pent\u00e1gono de estad\u00edsticas junto a cada personaje, lo que ayuda a los novatos a entender en qu\u00e9 tipo de combate destaca cada personaje sin necesidad de recurrir a los arquetipos ya conocidos por los jugadores veteranos.\n\nUn aspecto destacable del juego es el modo de entrenamiento, que incluye informaci\u00f3n sobre la framedata de los ataques de los personajes. Esta informaci\u00f3n es fundamental en los juegos de lucha, ya que afecta en gran medida la jugabilidad. Este aspecto es apreciado por los jugadores veteranos y entendidos del g\u00e9nero, y es una ventaja sobre el promedio del mercado donde todav\u00eda se publican juegos sin framedata.\n\nLa direcci\u00f3n de arte es buen\u00edsima, es posible que algunos sprites se vean un poco simples, pero por lo general est\u00e1n bastante bien conseguidos, los escenarios, a fecha de esta rese\u00f1a, son solo 4, pero tambi\u00e9n son atractivos a la vista, el arte es espectacular y la banda sonora, similar a la de Guilty Gear, tambi\u00e9n contribuye a la experiencia de juego. Se echa en falta la localizaci\u00f3n y traducci\u00f3n a m\u00e1s idiomas, estando solo disponibles el ingl\u00e9s y el japon\u00e9s, ojal\u00e1 ver alg\u00fan d\u00eda una actualizaci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol.\n\nEn general, Idol Showdown es un juego que cumple su objetivo de entretener a los fans de Hololive y a los amantes de los juegos de lucha, pero puede no ser la mejor opci\u00f3n para aquellos que buscan un t\u00edtulo de lucha alternativo m\u00e1s equilibrado y convencional que los invite a cambiar su juego de preferencia. 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1684024818, "timestamp_updated": 1689626932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138264593": {"recommendationid": "138264593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271781434", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1684625628}, "language": "english", "review": "vtubers are awful but this game is extremely great for a fan game.

You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet.

Now, for this being a fan-made game, this is insane! Every single thing is so well done and the attention to detail definitely shows! Art, music, sounds, sprites, ect. are all just amazing and you will see little fun easter eggs if you look close enough! As for the game mechanics itself, it was a bit confusing to learn at first (mostly because there was no initial tutorial explaining controls, although you can check which button does what once you open the settings), and to add to that same topic, I feel there should be a bit more explanation as to what each button does so new players can know what to hit at what time. Maybe a practice round as a tutorial? That's just my two cents. Despite this though, the game is absolute perfection and one can easily enjoy hours of fun on it. Even in AI mode, you can play and actually have a real challenge that feels like a genuine match and not just a computer calculated bot. The online idea is just brilliant, and I can't wait to see how this game grows over time.\n\nDevs, artists, the whole dang team of everyone involved in this masterpiece of a game,, you guys are heroes and we the fans are extremely thankful for what you've put out. Your hard work definitely paid off seeing as you guys have made a real hit.

It's got some niche references which I found pretty funny surprisingly. And a little bit of trivia (should be easy for you nerds), also has a nice unlock system for stuff and some modifiers that make it enjoyable for experienced or beginning players.\n\nMy online experience with it was really good as well, I usually have really bad ping that fluctuates a lot but I haven't had much trouble playing.\n\nDefinitely worth a try if you have a cable and a spare

Play it for yourself. You'll only be out some time.\nTL;DR: Weeb likes the love put in the game, but core mechanics don't feel right for a fighting game.\n\nI've enjoyed my time in the rabbit hole. Been watching Vtubers on and off since Kizuna Ai. And as a whole I can see all the love they put into this. For a fan project? They knocked it out of the park. The personality of the characters really matches up well with their Vtuber. The little details, easter eggs, and voice over really shows a group that is really involved in the community. I also enjoy some fighting games. I'm no master of execution, nor do I have a PhD in mind games where I can read what you are going to write next week. But I know my way around an arcade stick. As a whole this is a good experience. If I paid $60 for this it would have been infinitely more value than Street Fighter 5 on release. More fun too, no cap.\n\nIt's nice there is an arcade mode and a rogue like mode. Online is pretty smooth. Only time I felt lag is if someone had around 200 for a ping, and I don't think that's the fault of the netcode. Training mode has all the bells and whistles you could want. Character roster has all the general niches filled, and is going to keep expanding for free. All of these things are great.\n\nThe reason I can't recommend this is that the core of the game just feels... Disjointed. Like things don't quite mesh together fully. Frame data is all over the place. Certain block strings are easy to get put into, and end without a way to punish and there is no risk. While if a single part hits, you can eat a massive combo. Down down inputs are frustrating, and tend to give you something you don't want. Certain characters (like Kaichou) feel like you need a full closet of leather and ball gags to maintain the level of masochism to learn them, let alone get decent. Grabs are incredibly inconsistent and only feel like they have use on offense, when they should be a good way to break someone's momentum if they overcommit on offense. Anti airs feel about as inconsistent as grabs. Hitboxes in general feel wrong. Movement feels slow since there is no air dash to help punish opponents. There is no block mechanic that helps push someone away so you can punish their long block strings. There are very few special moves that even allow you to mix up an opponent (The only one I saw where I had to even block high against was Suisei's two hit bash.) And for projectiles Botan can actually have more than one grenade on screen at a time. (Never seen zoners like Dhalsim in SF have multiple fireballs on screen at a time, but I could also be wrong.)\n\nThe best part about all of my gripes? They can slowly fix this as the devs slowly learn more and patch the game. There is a lot of love and potential to be found here. So I feel that over time this will become a phenomenal game. But at the end of my time with the game I can't remember ever thinking \"I deserved that win and I know why everything worked out.\" or \"That was a good game from my opponent, they genuinely outplayed me.\" It just felt like people mashing jab into block strings at best, and horrible trades and wonky air recovery at worst.\n\nEdit: After a long time playing online, I can't recommend it to anyone at all. Hitboxes are worse than I originally thought, pressure from certain characters is nigh inescapable, throws are even worse than I thought they were initially, and moves intended to counter projectiles (Coco's Oi oi) don't really give you anything for using them. Opponents recover too quickly from using moves, so unless you are point blank and you duck it, you're just going to eat a long range normal instead and likely a full combo. Unless they really change up a lot of broken shit, which I doubt will happen, this will die as quickly as DNF duel once the Vtuber hype surrounding it slows down.", "timestamp_created": 1683795763, "timestamp_updated": 1684116886, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.424427032470703125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138129293": {"recommendationid": "138129293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003062004", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1683794560}, "language": "english", "review": "Spanish/English review\n\nEspa\u00f1ol:\nNo e jugado el juego siquiera 1 hora y e visto bastantes problemas, 2 crashes y 3 bugs visuales, el juego tiene problemas mayores, se ve realmente bien e interesante pero primero se deben arreglar estos problemas mayores o al menos los crashes s\u00fabitos\n\nIngl\u00e9s\nI didn't play the game more than an hour and I have a lot of issues, 2 crashes and 3 visual bugs  the game have big issues, fairly this seems pretty good but need to fix this major problems, at least the suddent crashes\n\nSpects:\ni7 10700F\n32 gb ram\nrx 580 8 gb\n\nentonces no se si los bugs son causados por la tarjeta de video (que en contados juegoslas tiene) pero de verdad me gustar\u00eda poder disfrutar el juego asi que esperar\u00e9 a los pr\u00f3ximos parches hasta entonces es review negativa.\n\nSo  idk if the bugs its for the video card or something else but I really want to enjoy this game so I will wait for the next patchs until then its a negative review.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1683795057, "timestamp_updated": 1683795057, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455824524164199829", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138128560": {"recommendationid": "138128560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214784359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1688834133}, "language": "english", "review": "Fighting using keyboard is hard (No, I don't have a controller)", "timestamp_created": 1683793055, "timestamp_updated": 1683793055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138128095": {"recommendationid": "138128095", "author": {"steamid": "76561199231419919", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1096, "last_played": 1698886490}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] As someone who isn't a fan of fighting games, this one got me [/h1] While I can't speak for the fighting game community, if your a fan of Hololive, there is a good chance you will be a fan of this game.

However, I do have some minor gripes about the game.  Firstly, I was rather disappointed with the lack of a continue option in Arcade Mode.  From where I'm sitting, that's a staple feature of nearly every fighting game, and it's disappointing that it isn't in this one.  Secondly, not having difficulty options can make the game's single-player content rather hard to get into for newcomers (and no, the faux-difficulty select in Virtual Frontier doesn't count).  Compound this with the fact that you can only get some of the colors through this single-player content, and you have a bit of a barrier for not only casual players, but also completionist scrubs like myself.  And unless another way to acquire these unlockable colors is added in the future (i.e. just buying them outright with the Pekos gained in Virtual Frontier), I can really only recommend the single-player content to those who have a great amount of experience playing fighting games in a competitive setting.  Aside from that, though, I would still recommend anyone, VTuber fan or not, get this game.  It's a heckuva good time with friends, and certainly has the competitive depth that can rival its peers in the genre.\n\nEDIT CIRCA 8/19/2023: While the game has been updated to include difficulty select in Arcade Mode, I still haven't had the urge to play the game lately due to one thing: It runs like ass on my setup.  The absolute LOWEST the game can go to in the graphics department is 1280 X 720, and I can't help but feel like its poorly optimized in that department as well.  My poltato PC should NOT have this much of an issue running a sprite-based game, and until either better optimizations are made and/or lower graphics settings get added, I probably won't be able to enjoy the game as much, much less play it comfortably.

As a (currently) noob to the game, I fell in love after the first match I played. It's also gladdening to see single-player content - offline battles, an arcade mode, and even what looks like a story mode!\n\n[b]But what can make this better?[/b]\n\n[u]More characters[/u], for starters. There's currently eight playable VTubers with three more in development (who knows who THEY'LL be...?) and nine Collab VTubers, making a grand total of 20 included in the game in some playable form. That's already pretty good, but we can go higher. I know the game's, well, Hololive-focused but including even more VTubers in the future - even some from other companies - would be an absolute blast. It'd be the [i]Smash Ultimate[/i] of VTuber-based fighting games, of which there are surprisingly few. (Hey, if that wouldn't work, there's an idea for a sequel...!)\n\n[u]Achievement support[/u] would also be a great addition for achievement hunters such as myself but, obviously, not everybody's into that sort of thing, nor is it always necessary. I feel it would be a great way to not only show mastery of the game, but provide some incentive for people that may not try other modes to, well, try other modes, other characters, maybe even some super-specific stuff.\n\nAlso, [u]v-sync[/u] would be a nice touch, make the game a bit smoother.\n\nAside from that? Honestly, I don't think there's much else. The game's already spectacular - but hey, that's kinda the thing about fan games, isn't it? These people truly care not just about the source material, but the very thing they're making. Sure, for some more experienced experts at fighting games, the game does have some flaws, but [u]I'm not a fighting game expert - I'm a filthy casual[/u] and, despite whatever flaws it may or may not have, there's no denying the overall positive reception it's garnered.

It has a very simple control scheme and I'd say overall the game is easy to learn but not easy to master. \n\nIt's a well made fighting game, so much so that it's surprising to think about how this is a fan-made game. The team behind this game put two years of work into this game despite knowing they would not be making any money off of this project. The game is truly a labor of love, with a very passionate dev team behind it.\n\nIt's hard for me to not recommend this game as for one, it's a free game.

Cause from playing this game it feels like it's main purpose is to appeal to people who actually complain about a game that isn't your standard Tekken or Street Fighter and not getting molly walloped online in ranked. To me it feels like it's a multiplayer fighter that appeals to single player casuals without the aspects of competitive in mind. Is it a bad game? Well...it's 50-50. It's a fun game but at the same time a game with a lot of....kinks needing to be worked on. I'll put pros and cons:\n\nPros: Good graphics, controls are spot on, easy to learn commands, pulling of combos is awesome, cute girls characters who can dish out damage.\n\nCons: the game feels hella stiff and kinda slow especially with movement of characters (though this could be a thing with me and not overall), THERE IS HELLA SLOWDOWN WITH INPUTTING COMBOS (and what I mean by that is the FPS be dropping like mad), I feel like trying to do commands while during combo don't register much especially when trying to string in a Super, roster is lacking in characters, online in beta (just...why?).\n\nGame Rating? 5.75/10.

but it also wasnt baby mode oo oo ga ga me hit buttons me win. just enough of a balance that playing it with friends felt like I was playing the game to just have fun and not solely to win, while there was also enough to motivate me to learn the moves and counters and everything for the great roster of characters!", "timestamp_created": 1683675572, "timestamp_updated": 1683675572, "voted_up":

I should mention that I don't play fighter games, but do play almost every PvP game, just like everyone here. Game doesn't have bugs(many or noticeable, at least) and every character is unique, while multiplayer is day 1 available and pretty fun. Combos are doable, and tutorial is readable but hard to understand. A very fun 1v1 game. And fixes are very quick. Up till now, only positives.\n\n\nSome degenerate mechanics that I cannot understand and leads to wicked gameplay:\n1. Animation cancelling - I don't know how this is valuable for fighting games, but as far as I can see, you can get stunned forever. You can be rendered unable to react to enemy abilities and enemy can use the same ability 3 times in a row. What I believe this does is remove any reaction posibilities from players, and leads to button mashing to stun the enemy into death. One good example is Ayame keeping you in the air until you lose half your health or your burst comes back. You will get combo'd to death with no reaction, since all hits are instant. Can't hit back when you can cancel animation locks and channels.\nExamples: Akirose teleporting 3 times in 1 second and grabbing into stun, Ayame knockups, Botan throwing 4 bombs in 1 second.\n\n2. There is too much damage and too little health. You have characters with abilities that don't use any resources, just require getting close, that deal 20-25% HP. This is wildly unfun, since taking 3 of these spells is enough to die, while all that is required for enemy is waiting with guard up, and then dashing in close range. Even one spell that you cannot dodge(Coco pushing you into the air 'cuz you are too close) will do 30% of your health. You cannot express any skill. You're sitting there for 2 seconds in an animation, lose 1/3 your health to an undodgeable spell, and say \"what could I have done?\".\n\n3. AI not having to actually do the moves necessary to cast, use spells, or grab, is also degenerate. It's hard to train when the AI can react to anything in 0.01 seconds without having to move left, right and press Special. \n\nTLDR: Fun game, animation, art, characters, and it's Hololive. Multiplayer awesome. Degen mechanics predominate with too much damage, oneshot combos, unreactable fights with stunlock, animation cancelling leading to no counterplay and staring at screen.\n\n\nEdit 22-05-23: Some of the issues have been fixed as patch 1.1.1(1.2.3?) with bugfixes: \nissue 3, fixed. You can now fight AI, grab rate(but not escape..) has been reduced and the AI doesn't combo 3 spells in a row, but it still cancels several animations.\nissue 1, reduced. You can combo abilities in an order properly so button mashing + animation cancelling isn't killing counterplay anymore. Animations start sooner so you now can react to most abilities, including the grab.\nissue 2. Damage has been reduced, or the Burst button works, because replying to an enemy is now possible and not dying. \nAll of these fixes and updates are great, and now you can reasonably fight someone without button mashing while seeing what happens before you take enough damage to die, reducing RNG in fights. There is still stuff that I would argue can be more fun or improved - like stuns and animation cancelling being lowered - and more abilities giving enemy windows to jump on them if they mess up - and lowering damage (Botan, Ayame) or overall/buffing more characters' HP(korone).", "timestamp_created": 1683667243, "timestamp_updated": 1684731804, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 7,

Long term I don't expect much in terms of balance because I have no idea what each character is trying to achieve, but  this feels more of a turn your brain off kind of fighting game (that isn't DNF-Duel, thank god), and not a GG or UNIS kind of game. Sure game lacks polish, but for a free game it makes you wonder why the heck you pre-ordered DNF (okay I'll stop lol).\n\nStuff I wanna criticize;\n\n1. Training and tutorial needs a virtual joystick. It is very painful seeing non FGC players hopping in and not understanding how motion inputs work. A virtual joystick will very much help them visualize their inputs and not wonder why they keep jumping or doing crouch normals.\n\n2. UI is unintuitive. I hope this is something that gets overhauled when online comes out of beta, but why is it that I have to wait for someone to join my room to be able to select my character, when I could have done that while waiting? It isn't like the system is in place to make sure players don't get a preferred matchup, since you can't even see the opponent's character until you're in-game. \n\nThat's pretty much all I have to say. Game is pretty, music is great for the setting and overall tone, but tutorial is kinda jank and a lot of Holo girls were confused from it, movement feels stiff, some moves and their inputs don't make sense (like 2H being a launcher while 3H is a sweep) etc. Definitely recommend if you're a Hololive fan, or an FGC fan looking for a decent free to play fighting game.", "timestamp_created": 1683637138, "timestamp_updated": 1683643103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138044463": {"recommendationid": "138044463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198828772856", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 76, "last_played": 1692443192}, "language": "english", "review": "Water in the fire, why?

into weak, depressed coomers that only consume anime content and jerk off all day, doing nothing productive. instead of getting a job, serving in the army, or going to church, they instead watch these vtubers and are saying stuff like \"oh shes so kawaiiii!!!!:3333\" and donate money to these prostitutes, making \"livestreaming\" and \"gaming\" a more viable \"job\" than something legitimate like being a doctor, a truck driver, or a lawyer. american men went from reading the bible with their wives, having a house and kids at 25, to being lonely 30 year old cooming to a high pitched anime girl screaming while playing video games. the biden administration has done NOTHING to help out these american men to do better with their lives, and is instead donating money to the wrong people. people are willing to pay for vtumor branded WATER, and that is outrageous. instead of buying something useful, like land, a gun, or nice clothing, they instead buy WATER with an anime girl on it. most of these vtubers dont even hold american believes! they just show their breasts on stream while screaming like a kid, and people donate thousands to them, and then complain that taxes are too much! anime was already the downfall of the west, making the american youth weak and into FICTIONAL girls. why not get a real, loving christian wife? she would treat you better than whatever these streamers are trying to be. i work 40 hours a week, and most likely make less than these \"entertainers\", even though they just sit around all day playing video games. i have a wife and kids to feed, have no free time of my own, and these streamers make a boatload of money just by doing the same thing my son does! i found him watching one named \"korone\" and it was the dumbest thing i've ever seen, im disappointed in this generation. why dont kids play outside anymore? these vtubers are clearly made for children or young teens, tricking them into thinking anime is okay, with their cute and provocative designs, degrading the brain to the point they have to coom all day to them, all while making money off that scummy tactic. if they taught jesus's teachings, i would be more accepting of them, but they dont. hillarys leaked emails stated that she wanted \"cute anime characters\" to trick children with, and this is just that. if the future generations are full of sexless, depressed lonely american men, i will no longer be a patriot, as it will be the death of america.", "timestamp_created": 1683603512, "timestamp_updated": 1683603512, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2,

more enlightened take on the waifu fighting game that is Idol Showdown\n\nFull disclosure, I'm not a huuuge fighting game fanatic. I've only played a few throughout my life, but I still find them fun to play, especially with friends. Extra disclosure, I am an enormous Hololilve fan, and that's what led to me keeping up to date with the development of this game. It's now been out for a bout 1 month and 2 weeks, and I've got to say, the game is great, but also flawed in certain departments. To its credit, it's an entirely fan made and passion driven project, so rounds of applause to the entire team for making a genuinely well made product with nothing but love for vtubers and fighting games alike. That's essentially what this game is, a love letter that serves a double purpose for both facets of its creation.\n\nCombos feel really fun to execute, they're not overly complicated on most characters, so even a mediocre player like me can learn how to pull off some cool looking strings. Even then, there's mountains of potential that way better players have been able to pull off, so that at least tells me that there's plenty of room for creativity. Character sprites and animations are full of charm and references to various goofs and gaffs to either inside jokes from any of the girls or to other fighting games and their characters. I was initially very confused on the difference between the superchat meter and the star meter, but a bit of playing helped me better understand how to use the two. Superchat cancelling can occasionally feel very hit or miss when trying to input extra moves.\n\nThe only true complaint I have is that of Coco, as she feels a lot less intuitive as opposed to the other girls, but seeing as how she's getting a rework soon, I have my fingers crossed that the devs will know what to do. Which brings me up to the final note of the devs themselves, who have been supporting this game almost nonstop since the beginning of the release, which I find incredibly admirable. They're constantly listening to what the players say about the game and it shows, seeing as how a major update just came out recently, which revamped the burst, superchat, and star meters' gain. \n\nI have high hopes for how this game evolves overtime.

As a long time fan of Hololive (God, it's gonna be 4 years this summer, how time flies...) I am always super stoked to see the amazing fan projects that this community makes get the recognition they deserve. So, about the game now; it has a lot of potential and, most importantly, it's really a TON of fun, despite some small rough edges that I am sure will get ironed out as the game receives more updates. The movesets are actually GREAT but quite limited in size, but in a way I think this could overall be a net positive, as I feel like this game is the PERFECT gateway for someone that is not familiar with fighting games to get into the genre. Despite this, you can still pull off some pretty flashy and complex stuff with the tools you are given once you get the hang of your character. Hitboxes and especially inputs could be improved a bit, but as I said, I am confident everything will get smoothed out with time, and regardless, for the low low price of 0 euros and 0 cents I'd say it's absolutely worth it.\nThe only real downside I can speak of is that the roster is VERY small, only 8 characters. I hope more will be added as time goes on, cause as of now the lack of variety is really the only thing slightly holding it back.

Just looked over some 3rd strike footage and the movement feels much more fluid with less frames(I don't expect 3rd strike levels of excellency in a free game, but some improvements would be nice). This is especially seen on each characters walking animations, they look freakish. Just open up 3rd strike and see how subtle walking animations are in comparison.\nSecond thing that really irked me was the SFX, not sure if the voice effects were ripped from streams, but they feel lifeless and they are not synced well with the attack animations. The decision to use voice every second move over using it on every move seems counter intuitive on a game that is marketed towards fans of vtubers(not one of those, so I might be wrong) and just doesn't feel good when hitting an attack. Just look at some gameplay of Dudley from 3rd strike, it feels so natural when he shouts/exhales every attack. \nThere's also some mixed non pixelart sprites in gun animations(and maybe somewhere else too), it would look better if everything would be pixelart(and doesn't seem like it would be much work to add more pixelart'y sprites for gun animations for example).\nI won't comment much on the gameplay since I only tried every character in training mode as of now. If I find some bad things to say about it I'll probably add it here.\n\ntl;dl fun game to try out(and it's free!), not a masterpiece by any means.\np.s. forgot to add it has rollback!!! that's great!", "timestamp_created": 1683578206, "timestamp_updated": 1683578281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138016731": {"recommendationid": "138016731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001864753", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1683472917}, "language": "english", "review": "Live Support with updated voice lines on Day 2+ and more in the foreseeable future.

I only see a few clips here and there. There are some personalities I like but I don't really watch 'em.\n\nThe game's free so it's totally worth giving a shot. The netcode isn't the best but it's stable enough, better than SFV's netcode. The game's quite clunky and has [u] NO [/u] QOL features whatsoever. I'm a weirdo who plays on analog but they neglected to add a deadzone config so us analogbros are severely handicapped against stick, box, dpad, and keyboard users. It also doesn't have a V-Sync option for those who have monitors with lower refresh rates. The game also has some weird performance issues, not sure what's up with that.\n\nThe balance is pretty awful but maybe I'm just bad, this game is quite unusual to me. It's an anime fighter that doesn't have much emphasis on footsies but it doesn't have air-dashes either apart from Coco Kiryu. Many characters don't have traditional air combos. It's like a very strange mixture of Skullgirls and JoJo HFTF. Fighting Botan feels like fighting Peacock but much worse because there's no way for some characters to close in on her effectively. Skullgirls has air-dashing and super-armour moves to close in on Peacock while she's zoning. Zoning in general is way too oppressive and powerful with the way the game works. It's only really a problem for characters built around zoning though. Sora's projectiles are also quite oppressive, however, Korone's projectiles are manageable and Suisei's projectile is utter trash.\n\nIt's a great game for beginners with its direction-input special button while still having substance for more experienced players by giving a meter bonus for players who use motion-inputs. Many moves feel pretty clunky and it's hard to tell when a character is negative or positive due to the inconsistency of the animations which is something that could be fixed but as of now, it's simply something to get used to. The training mode is really good, it has all the necessary features you'd need when labbing. The single-player content is also pretty good which is great for casuals who don't want to get bodied online (but if you don't get bodied, you won't learn and get better)\n\nI'll recommend it because there's some dumb fun to be had with this game and I believe it can improve overtime, but as of now, don't take it seriously if you're a fighting game fan. It's not bad but it's just not good enough either. As of now, I'd consider this a kusoge. Just look at how messed up and buggy Suisei is.\n\nNeedless to say but please keep up the good work. I'm not a Hololive fan but a free beginner-friendly fighting game with rollback netcode that also awards veteran FG players is really exciting and I hope this game can reach a point where it's genuinely a viable fighting game to commit to.", "timestamp_created": 1683577896, "timestamp_updated": 1683578717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138016347": {"recommendationid": "138016347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116147395", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1683577528}, "language": "english", "review": "best spritework and animations ive seen in ages", "timestamp_created": 1683577551, "timestamp_updated": 1683577551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138015763": {"recommendationid": "138015763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098428658", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1683516904}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't even know who these girls are but my girlfriend is playing fighting games with me thanks to it 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1683576740, "timestamp_updated": 1683576740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138015221": {"recommendationid": "138015221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091215533", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1683405875}, "language": "english", "review": "Rough around the edges but enjoyable", "timestamp_created": 1683575938, "timestamp_updated": 1683575938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138015034": {"recommendationid": "138015034", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995726554", "num_games_owned": 1149, "num_reviews": 160, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1684095555}, "language": "english", "review": "It was alright until I started running into Aki players.

What this is is a surprisingly solid fighting game and all for FREE! The mechanics make it very approachable for newcomers, and the tutorial does an exceptional job of introducing you to the simple yet deep battle systems. The game plays as if you're in somebody's Twitch stream while playing, but it's endearing without being obnoxious. The sprite animations are incredible, and the matches are snappy without being too quick. The online is also incredible, even though the game says it's in its beta version. 2 of my 3 hours were spent in online matches, and I didn't experience any lag against any of my opponents.\n\nMy only critique is the training mode. The options of how to program the AI are somewhat limited, and there's no way to display frame data. This is such a minor point because even Tekken 7 got this wrong for MANY years, but I still hope they expand it later.\n\nI highly recommend this charming, brilliantly-crafted game. There are some genuinely funny and clever things thrown into the game that show this is clearly a project of love made by passionate people who know what they're doing. Now I'm going to post some of my notes about the system below for those that care.\n\nThis is a 4-button game. For those that are unfamiliar with what that means, your attacks are Light, Medium, Heavy, and Special. Certain special moves can be performed by either pressing the special button and a direction or by performing the \"fighting game\" motions on the d-pad: quarter circle forward or back. The reason you'll want to perform with the motions is two-fold. Firstly, you have more control over the \"version\" of the move with motions. Special+direction only gives you a single version of the move, whereas doing the motion and pressing L, M, or H changes the properties: light is quick with little damage, medium is a slow heavy-hitter, and heavy is the EX version. The second reason is that performing the motion fills an in-game resource that lets you call in the assist character you selected at the start of the match.\n\nYou have a super meter and a friendship (I think?) meter, and the game bases a lot of its system on managing the 2 different gauges. Super meter is for all the usual things, like supers and EX moves, but it can also be used to call in your assist or supercharge your friendship meter. Burning a full friendship bar brings in your assist for some persistent effect that varies based on the character, but they're all strong.\n\nThe game also has some of the fighting game staples, like universal overheads and throws. I think the game's depth definitely comes from character combinations and meter managements. However, the game doesn't feel cluttered or bloated. The UI is good, and I really like the pace of the matches. If you read all of this, I hope my review helped and I appreciate your attention.\n\nSee you in the lobbies!\n\nEdit: no universal defense options mean steamrolling is very real. If characters with good buttons get a hit, they'll knock you down into unanswerable pressure. This is a \"win faster\" game. I liked this game initially, but it needs to add some way to answer the CONSTANT pressure an opponent can force on you.", "timestamp_created": 1683564563, "timestamp_updated": 1684163143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138006695": {"recommendationid": "138006695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210487016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 141, "last_played": 1698805802}, "language": "english", "review": "Fans of Hololive and Fighting games will love this.

I doubt the devs will see this but I really hope some of this feedback makes it back to them. I understand its a fan project so I'm not holding to the same standard of official releases, but I do hope the games issues I have got resolved.\n\n\n So let's start with some positives.\n\n\nPros\n\n-[Surprisingly decent single player content.\n the difficulty feels kinda inconsistent. Like i picked harder enemies and the run was a total cakewalk until act 3 where enemies start doing 50% randomly. But aside from that it's a fine mode if a little mindless. I feel if there was a unique boss each act that could help break the repetition.]\n\n-[solid training mode.\n Having a save state feature is rare, and appreciated]\n\n-[Fan game\nObviously a love letter with lots of references. While i don't get most of them, the people who do probably enjoy them.]\n\n-[its free and easy to download.\n It doesn't sound like a compliment, but when you've played a lot of obscure fighting games/mugens that require extra steps just to set up, a simple steam download is appreciated.]\n\n-[The visuals. \nthe pixel art looks pretty good at times and the UI looks clean if a little cluttered at times.]\n\nCons\n\n\n-[ training mode bug?\nThe  training mode will randomly take 1-5 seconds to reload to neutral, and I don't know why because it feels random. Hopefully that gets fixed.](edit: this had been patched, good job)\n\n.[Game feel. \nMy biggest problem is the general feel of the game. The main issue is that the game feels very stiff. things like run jumping not caring momentum, and hit boxes feel off, having ground normal cancel chains but not air normal cancel chains, and many of the animations being kinda jank all makes the game feel clunky. The biggest issue I have is that momentum, it just feels bad.]\n\n-[animation inconsistency.\nGenerally the game looks good. Although this isn't evenly distributed, some characters like Botan look very fluid while others like korrone seem to have been made early or got the short hand of the sick. Additionally I feel many of the moves lack impact, and it can feel like you're throwing around a wet noodle.]\n\n\n-[Unclear balances. \nThis section is less about \u201dX character is busted\u201d and more so that I find the game and characters unsure of what they're trying to achieve. The game generally has very limited combo routes with low damage but has a burst? I understand that newcomers don't like to be combo\u2019ed and you can use the burst to maintain block pressure, but it still feels out of places in this game, with the exception of Botan who is consistently doing 50% combos. while she's clearly a unintended outlier, I ask do you want this game to be a grounded low damage footsie game or a high damage assist fighter, because it's unclear at the moment? \n\nThe assists seemed to be designed for neutral control  rather than combo extension. but considering the meter requirement some seem clearly better and more flexible at that than others. Also the colab supers are not explained well and are unclear how they work. They could have better descriptions\n\nCharacter playstyles feel a bit undefined. Like botan is supposed to be a large, high damage zoner with the grenade damages being as is. But she has, good run speed, fast disjointed buttons, one of the best jump-ins in j2c, and looping close range block pressure(witch currently only loses to Invincible moves with how plus it is) which makes her a better rushdown character than Ayane, the actual rushdown  character.\n\nAdditionally Soras is supposed to be a setplay character which implys shes supposed to get a loping mix of her knockdowns, which is implied by her having a 6c overhead, and an oki fireball. However her 5m,6m, and jm combined with her 2 other fireballs, and projectile reflect makes a way more effective zoner than arguably botan, because Botans full screen guard pressure mostly loses to jump in air block, (aside from the chip you take).\n\nWhile I could go on, what I'm trying to get at is the playstyles could be more defined in achieving a specific goal, so it's easier to understand what each character trying to achieve.]\n\n-[other character bugs? \nHears some of the stuff i found\nKokos otg grab turns the character around for a few frames, the grabs minus but if the player tries to punish too early they get a button that's facing the wrong way. I don't know if that's intentional but it feels jank.\nSoras Oki fireball last between rounds , and can hit round start\n\nNot recommending this game is odd because it's literally free so you're only wasting time if you don't like it.But this game has problems that i would like to be fixed. but I hope for the best for this game and get the polish it needs. It's doing well right now so for the devs sake I hope they can deliver on a great fighting game.

I really like how it can fulfill all those abstract needs. Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too! It's actually so much fun! You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet.

I'm excited and nervous about the online matchmaking getting properly implemented.\n\nOverall - go for it if you are a hololive fan, even if you don't play fighting games.", "timestamp_created": 1683538707, "timestamp_updated": 1683538707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508196711540222168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137990932": {"recommendationid": "137990932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398972750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 313, "last_played": 1683718669}, "language": "english", "review": "Botan squats like a Slav", "timestamp_created": 1683538632, "timestamp_updated": 1683538632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137990931": {"recommendationid": "137990931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040819133", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1691968095}, "language": "english", "review": "yubi yubi", "timestamp_created": 1683538630, "timestamp_updated": 1683538630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137990870": {"recommendationid": "137990870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198449337803", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1691850473}, "language": "english", "review": "chainsaw doggo", "timestamp_created": 1683538512, "timestamp_updated": 1683538512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137990571": {"recommendationid": "137990571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198435887877", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1684322367}, "language": "english", "review": "wonky game ngl gg nt go next", "timestamp_created": 1683537858, "timestamp_updated": 1683537858, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.352291703224182129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137990422": {"recommendationid": "137990422", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966874596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1684445619}, "language": "english", "review": "I can finally start a legal dog fighting ring!", "timestamp_created": 1683537477, "timestamp_updated": 1683537477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137990290": {"recommendationid": "137990290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005240142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1683701922}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite fun and easy to pick up for a fighting game.

From gentle lovemaking to rough fucking, I've run through every fantasy possible hundreds of times. I genuinely cannot stop thinking about her. I feel immense anger whenever someone on /vt/ proposes that she has a boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever, it hurts me more than anyone not in the same situation as me can possibly comprehend. The thought of someone who isn't me defiling Suisei is genuinely worse than the thought of my entire family getting murdered. Her vagina should be reserved specifically for MY penis, and her womb for MY sperm! I don't want that! I don't want her to find another guy! I want her to have feelings only for me! Even after she graduates I want her to hold me in her heart for a long time! I have fapped to almost every piece of erotic Suisei art multiple times. My obsession with her is far beyond unhealthy at this point, it's genuinely debilitating. The worst part is that I know she hates people like me, and would be disgusted if she knew about me. Even worse, I get off to it. The idea of her looking at me with absolute disgust is so erotic that I'm full erect as I type this.

However, it is very buggy, and not balanced.[/i]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Huge attention to detail, many references and voice lines.\n[*]Unique cast of characters. No copy pasted characters from other fighters.\n[*]Lots of room to explore. New tech and combos are discovered every day.\n[*]Good implementation of rollback netcode.\n[*]Robust single-player mode (that I have not touched).\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Extremely buggy. Bugs include things like post-round damage and button lock-outs.\n[*]Extremely unpolished mechanics. The developers do not seem to understand certain fundamental aspects of fighters. The frame data is baffling, throws can only be teched after they connect, and the hitboxes are exceptionally huge. Imagine if Ryu's tatsu covered his whole body and then some.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Mixed:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Asthetics. This game is very anime, and the fighters are all idols. May not be for everyone.\n[*]No ranked mode. Despite having ~6k players on at-the-time, I almost always use the Discord to find my matches, as there is no other way of consistently finding an opponent of comparable skill. The Discord may be found on the Mizuumi wiki for the game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n[i]Idol Showdown[/i] is a very fun game. Casual VTuber fans will find the game's singleplayer content enjoyable, and can have fun mashing online with other newcomers. Veterans will find an uncut gem. There is a lot to like here, and the discovery process can make it feel like you are playing a fighting game from the old-days, where things were broken and gameplay was emergent.

You'll probably get through the arcade mode on the easiest difficulty in about an hour or two if you've literally never played a fighting game before.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1683523961, "timestamp_updated": 1683523961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137985042": {"recommendationid": "137985042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149698334", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1683702071}, "language": "english", "review": "needs more", "timestamp_created": 1683523701, "timestamp_updated": 1683523701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137985015": {"recommendationid": "137985015", "author": {"steamid": "76561199131957298", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1684468703}, "language": "english", "review": "top tier game", "timestamp_created": 1683523634, "timestamp_updated": 1683523634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137984937": {"recommendationid": "137984937", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092518661", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1690545674}, "language": "english", "review": "Gets hit once: Oh I'm Die, Thank You Forever", "timestamp_created": 1683523443, "timestamp_updated": 1683523443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137984894": {"recommendationid": "137984894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198228548696", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1683522943}, "language": "english", "review": "Made me realize that id rather play this than go out and socialize with friends.\n\n10/10 will play all day because im down bad for the vtubers", "timestamp_created": 1683523307, "timestamp_updated": 1683523307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137984827": {"recommendationid": "137984827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031674607", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1683523018}, "language": "english", "review": "Trash game.

I cannot complain about it.   The game is not really a Street Fighter game, but actually a lot SLOWER than normal.  As a fan of playing fighting games for over 30 years, you have to get used to the slowness of it.  This game's feel is very similar to Nitro Blasterz (which EXAMU / Atlus  [ Arcana Heart]).  The sound effects or voice overs were not the same voice actresses, but I've learned Botan provided for the game.  \n\nThe mechanics connect well, and as chaotic as MVSC 2, but for two years making this, it's a real achievement.  I hope to work with BESTO games in the future for an Atarashii Gakko fighting game.  \n\nThere's a learning curve but I would say just try to be patient with labbing the tutorials and make your own combos.  I hope the real Korone actress will fight with me one day since I added her to my friends list.  \n\nBotan I have a feeling will be super nerfed since the actress mentioned her character should be illegal (wwwwwwww) .  I really cannot wait for Gura and Pekora.  This is really good, really happy about it.  I couldn't get my HORI 8 arc to work for this game but I guess later on they'll work on compatibility for it.\n\nI am currently using a regular PS4 controller, but it would be better with a 8 button controller.  I'm looking forward to more characters and fun.  I kept getting beat up all the time, but I try hard to have fun :) \n\nI hope BESTO reads this, and some people find my review pleasant to read.  Not many people would like the game but it is very entertaining and they gave so much more value and care in this game, the hard work is equivalent to Vanguard Princess long ago, and also Eternal Fighter Zero (WHICH SHOULD BE ON STEAM).\n\nI think this is one of the best Doujin games I have played for 2023 as the sounds and the music they got it right and the sound effects !

As a fighting game, it is too focused on offense and provides little support for defensive players\n\nThe game is snappy and doesn't limit the player offensively. If you can think of it, there's probably a way to do it. The game is very loose, and that's a good thing.\n\nI mostly played Aki and was having a decent time labbing her and took her online to get a pretty decent win loss record, although I couldn't tell you what it is because that info doesn't appear to be viewable. The lobbies are horrendous but the actual online feel of the game is pretty good.\n\nI feel some of the characters are mislabled as Aki is labeled as a zoner but has terrible projectiles and weird disjointed attacks. I feel, at least at this time, she is most effective as a mix up character. Her command normals are pretty good and Mukirose buttons feel good and lead to a ton of damage. She has no reversals though, so if you get hit, be prepared to block for the rest of your life, but good news, it won't last long. Her heavy TP is supposed to be invincible but I couldn't tell you when or how long because it's always getting stuffed. That may be a skill issue.\n\nThe game direction seems all over the place at times where sometimes I'm learning and having fun, and the next I'm struggling to understand the game mechanics, or rather why some things are the way they are.\n\nFor example, the game has a burst meter but you have to earn it. You don't start off with it and it's a little frustrating but I got over that pretty quickly. Also for as fast as this game is, I am shocked that there's not a push block or alpha counter of any type.\n\nCurrently this game rewards aggression in such a frustrating way. Defensive characters have to rely on their ability to block because the game does not reward you for good defense. \n\nAssists, or Collabs in this game, are also tied to meter which make them kind of annoying to use and I often just ignore them. Also they cannot be used while other buttons are being pressed so they're mostly being used during wall bounce or hard knockdown. \nThe exception being that your Collabs also have supers and can be used easily mid combo. I think both the regular collab and the super collab cost meter though. I used regular collabs so little that I can't recall if it cost anything.\n\nI didn't touch the single player so I can't tell you here or there on if it's fun.\n\nThe devs seem highly responsive though and are actively looking through streams for feedback which is nice. I might revisit this game down the road when the online gets out of beta but currently I'm not very thrilled with the game mechanically. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1683498569, "timestamp_updated":

The tutorial could use some work. A combo trial would go a long way for honers to practice the most optimal combos and also the online could use two more additions, namely an auto match making system and a tournament mode (with spectator capabilities).\n\nHowever, I do have some minor gripes.

If you're concerned about being able to sell the negative items, then just make it so that ERROR items cannot be sold. Another gripe is the AI bot.

Due to the not knowing anything about fighting games, I am distinctly not good at it and am literally just mashing buttons hoping that I win, but even with that it's pretty fun! It feels very accessible as a beginner, with a \"very easy\" difficulty setting and helpful tutorials that teach concepts that a fighting game that favored its more advanced players may just expect you to know already. It also has options in Virtual Frontier to set you items to auto, which is probably a horrible strategy but, again, as a huge beginner I wouldn't know when to use them and would probably end up ignoring them without this option, so it's greatly appreciated. It advertises its beginner-friendliness and delivers. I was actually able to win fights! I will die before I do an actual PvP battle, though. PvAI for me forever, thank you.\n\nAside from the gameplay, the art is absolutely amazing, the animations do a fantastic job of capturing the girls' personalities and are just lovely to watch, the music and sounds add to the already fun atmosphere, it's just a well-made game by all accounts. And for free! You can really tell that a lot went into this project, not to mention the mach 10 update speed. It's clear that a lot of love went into this and it really paid off in the final product. I just hope the dev team kept [i]some[/i] of their blood, sweat, and tears.\n\nIt's great as a fighting game as far as I can tell and it's definitely great as a hololive fan game. At this price, you'd be remiss not to give it a shot.\n\nalso obligatory yubi yubi", "timestamp_created": 1683451697, "timestamp_updated": 1683451697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137933184": {"recommendationid": "137933184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417969821", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1694694595}, "language": "english", "review": "uuuuuuuu where Fauna", "timestamp_created": 1683451296, "timestamp_updated": 1683451296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137933146": {"recommendationid": "137933146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198796309230", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1683532858}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay is Stellar Stellar", "timestamp_created": 1683451236, "timestamp_updated": 1683451236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137933023": {"recommendationid": "137933023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388387862", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1693893610}, "language": "english", "review": "Meine Mama! hat mir einfach erlaubt das ich Cola Trinken darf wie cool ist das bitte!

I can't say how balanced the roster is for now but gameplay is rather solid and enjoyable. This game reminds me a lot of skullgirls with assists and the way combo is easily extended by going stand L, crouch L, stand M, crouch M, crouch H (launch), jump X, specials and so on. Buttons feel snappy and crisp. Characters have cool/funny moves. It's just good times overall.\n\n8/10. Solid.

Virtual Frontier is amazing.\n\nThe game is pretty approachable with simple controls available, but even the full motion inputs are not complicated (the hardest being a hadoken input). The hardest thing to get down is understanding the resources and their management, as well as general fighting game concepts, but that mostly comes from just playing.\n\nI feel that fans of fighting games and fans of vtubers will both enjoy this game with no previous experience in one of the two areas - there's just a lot for both sides. The personality and charm of the game with the high quality of its assets and design really shine through. It's a gift to us all\n\nI hope that through this, the fg community and vtuber fans can connect and make friends. I would love to see that.

It's very clear that this is a project made with a lot of love, which gives the game a lot of charm.\n- Animations. Beautiful pixel art and effects give each round a very vibrant feel.\n- Sound design. The voice lines and music remixes give this game way more polish than it has any right to have.\n- Balance between depth and newcomer friendliness. I was skeptical of the special button, but it won me over quickly as a good way to help bridge the gap between new and veteran fighting game players.\n\nNitpicks/suggestions:\n- Suisei feels undertuned in terms of frame data. She doesn't need to be a Melty Blood character, but her attacks need either more range or slightly less lag if she's going to be able to compete in the same game as the current top tiers (Botan, Sora, Korone).\n- Burst feels very polarizing. Certain characters get punished significantly harder by having their combo ended than others (cough, Botan).\n- Korone straight up needs more lag. 1/2 additional frames per attack would help bring her in line without ruining her.\n- Botan's damage should be brought more in line. As it currently sits, her potential damage per combo is too high for how safe her gameplan is.\n- Collabs feel clunky, but the system itself is a very interesting take on the traditional assist system.\n\nOverall, for a free fan-made game, there isn't a lot to actually complain about for Idol Showdown. I'm excited to see this game continue to receive updates as the devs seem very in tune with the community. It isn't a perfect package, but any serious balance issues that arise can always be patched later. The systems largely work as intended, and the polish in the package is worth well above the price of admission.\n\nGrade: B+", "timestamp_created": 1683416269, "timestamp_updated": 1683416269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137912125": {"recommendationid": "137912125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359150157", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1700689153}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo, f\u00e1cil y entretenido incluso si no haz jugado fighting games.", "timestamp_created": 1683415544, "timestamp_updated": 1683647210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137912050": {"recommendationid": "137912050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147320118", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 369, "last_played": 1683415403}, "language": "english", "review": "COCO FOR THE WIN", "timestamp_created": 1683415421, "timestamp_updated": 1683415421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137911783": {"recommendationid": "137911783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058512034", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 166, "last_played": 1693271634}, "language": "english", "review": "add ina", "timestamp_created": 1683414993, "timestamp_updated": 1683414993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479066044092178345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137911778": {"recommendationid": "137911778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006555257", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1683480713}, "language": "english", "review": "This game came out of nowhere and impressed me.

All that said, there are some issues that need to be addressed. The lack of combo trials and combos off an overhead attack (medium+heavy) are a letdown. There are also some very annoying bugs like a permanent camera zoom in until restart.\n\nEdit: 7.5.2023 Ayame is very broken so another minus for balance issues.

The soudtrack and sound effects are outstanding. so much so i thought to myself \"Even SF5 has a shrilly earpiercer which i have to mute from the first minute. this is a free passion project. it didn't deserve having guilty gear strive-tier music.\" later i've seen it's deserved.\n\nsecond: The game has a real tutorial. not a \"this is how you block, this is hadoken, this is how you hit, good luck playing Vega\" no. Idol showdown took Guilty gear as an example. every character has the same inputs, every character can cancel, every character has the same base inputs. and the tutorial teaches you everything you need to know for playing the game. you won't necessarily be great (lemme reiterate, i blow chunks, i get folded by AIs on normal) but you'll be able to play the damned game, and learn every necessary input you'll need later from the moment you start playing the tutorial. and that is awesome.\n\nThird: the game is filled to the brim with references. Ayame with her trademark couch-destroying club swing, having a brawl with her clones saying \"Yo Dayo\" (translated by i'm the real one). Coco Kaichou being rude, bossy but loveable, reviewing meme, riding a dino like in Ark, and the reference to Asacoco with the Plug-in type AsaCoCo. Roboco being a cutesy military robot, with a huge gap moe between her smile her \"Hallobo!\" and the 12 ICBMs she just shot directly into your cranium, Miko being an adorable klutz even when playing minecraft. and so many more even in music themes being mostly Hololive song, credits theme being a reference to the cutest miko playing ark.\n\nFourth while some would have thought \"okay i made my passion project, it's good, it's simple enough, it has references\" and call it a day, The dev team looked at tihs and said \"No\" and created Arcade mode. a kind of Rogue-styled gamemode. with unique items proper to this mode (emotional support Plastic ball my go-to), adorable references to the whole hololive roster and world. and even GRINDING.\nthey made skins, called Cosplays here. everybody has 3 besides default. but you can grind in game to recieve another. no one is left out. everybody has some ability to look a bit cooler if they don't particularly like default. but if someone grinds he can recieve a reward to flex a bit? now that is cool. flexers are rewarded, players are not left out.\n\nto conclude, Idol Showdown is a 10/10. the best Fighting game i've played besides Guilty gear Strive which costs 100 dollars for full experience.\nIdol showdown is Free.  it's made by loving people passionate about Hololive. it's the most user friendly fighting game i've ever played, no competition even comes close to its simple and intuitive tutorial and control scheme without 5 hours spreadsheet reading or distractions like Street fighter or Skullgirls.\nSound design is just perfect, nothing to add, hits sound good, themes sound good without distracting.\nand Idol showdown is filled with fun and care, even for a non-hololive-fan player.\nIf ever, in your life, you get a choice to have a fighting game experience to try in your existence on earth, take that opportunity, this one is the one you might want to look at for a fun, simple and tight experience.", "timestamp_created": 1683413383, "timestamp_updated": 1684217918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137910666": {"recommendationid": "137910666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121028521", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1683342101}, "language": "english", "review": "bad", "timestamp_created": 1683413347, "timestamp_updated": 1683413347, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442027032375335693", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137910605": {"recommendationid": "137910605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280344789", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1691891117}, "language": "english", "review": "Please get me out of this rabbit hole.", "timestamp_created": 1683413274, "timestamp_updated": 1683413274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137910552": {"recommendationid": "137910552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144431139", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1684045656}, "language": "english", "review": "Has better netcode and balancing than some certain fighting games out.", "timestamp_created": 1683413203, "timestamp_updated": 1683413203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137910396": {"recommendationid": "137910396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836651531", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1684277988}, "language": "english", "review": "Yubi/10", "timestamp_created": 1683412976, "timestamp_updated": 1683412976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485309720039367676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137910141": {"recommendationid": "137910141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116575402", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1684007867}, "language": "english", "review": "Glasses are very versatile.

Likewise, blockstun needs to be more obvious, add more sprite vibration or obvious effects to show stun and recovery because otherwise, scraps are very confusing and resort to mashing each other until one wins.

That, and the only real defensive options are Burst, certain assists, and characters with Reversal supers, but that runs into the issue of meter not being built on hit/block.

recommend. I don't know much about hololive, but the game feels pretty good. Animations are good. There are definitely tons of references I accept I'm not going to get. \n\nThe Good:\nAnimations are good.\nEverything's responsive.\nGood mechanics like perfect guard.\nI like the assist mechanic.\nThe rogue-lite mode is fantastic, and the bulk of why I am recommending. As a fan of both fighting games and rogue-lite progression, I can definitely see myself playing more of it. \n\nThe Bad:\nThere are just too many functions crammed into the game. It's a four button fighter but it has dedicated buttons for:\n\nBurst\nAssist\nItem (3 options, which map to a dedicated Item button+L/M/H)\nSpecial\n\nYou have throw using either dedicated or two button combo. So you either have to use additional dedicated buttons, or you have to do some jank button combos that don't feel natural. If your game can't fit all it's inputs on 6 buttons, you're trying to do to much. Having to simultaneously hit RT+L/M on a gamepad may be fine. On an arcade stick or fightpad, it's incredibly uncomfortable. Also there are button combinations that don't feel good on pad either, like L+H being on opposite face buttons. Think Item usage could have just been holding the special button and tapping a direction or something, but they decided to make both motion and directional inputs in one control scheme instead of just having the option of simple vs motion controls. So Special is another dedicated button that just doesn't have to be a dedicated buttonm, using precious real-estate in a game that wants both burst and assists. Which is doubly annoying since there are no complex inputs. Everything is a quarter circle or down+down input. So it's not like players have to learn pretzeling or even shoryu/Z motions.\n\nMay be minor issue/early game bugs, but hitboxes seem a bit strange. I used Botan's QCB-M rifle which has a weird angle, and watched the builled go right through the middle of a jumping character more than once with no hit or block animation. \n\nOverall:\n\nIt's free, so nothing to lose, and the rogue-like mode is worth the price of admission, but I probably won't put too much time into it because it physically hurts my button hand to play this on an arcade stick.", "timestamp_created": 1683402134, "timestamp_updated": 1683402134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551735937595367432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137901866": {"recommendationid": "137901866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221753944", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1691539679}, "language": "english", "review": "Suggestion: When Amelia Watson uses Ground Pound Ability have it Flatten the opponent like a Pancake", "timestamp_created": 1683402066, "timestamp_updated": 1683402066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137901713": {"recommendationid": "137901713", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072365842", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1683578399}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't this much fun with a fighting game since mvc2. \n\nthe devs are degenerate as fuck and i love it the games great for all levels and has some of the best use of make a game simple and deep love it.", "timestamp_created": 1683401906, "timestamp_updated": 1683401906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137901584": {"recommendationid": "137901584", "author": {"steamid": "76561199003132569", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1685900830}, "language": "english", "review": "This is absolutely amazing.

combo, forget theirs no kick and then just press the wrong button.\n\nAs the game is still new, it's got a couple bugs, namely if you press certain menu stuff too fast or where your keys don't bind properly, like my down button being changed to G and staying that way for some reason as well as Botan's H gun shot despite there being no gun, but other then these couple of things, there's nothing too buggy.\n\nThe downside though is when you try to fight online, your ping can soar from 50 to 200 before you know it, and before the game inevitably boots you for being too laggy, you'll be experiencing the world in slow motion, meaning two people are fighting in slow motion slowly flying towards each other like they're in a movie.\n\nThe game under normal circumstances is incredibly fast so getting used to both speeds is tough (for me anywayze), so they'll have to fix this part.\n\nAnd finally, the references in this game are, well, a lot, all the maps have a reference and are true (like \"say ara ara\") so you won't be disappointed on that end and more then a few have made me laugh.\n\nOverall, 4/5 stars, missing one for the online thing, would be half a star lower if I

Don't get me wrong; easy as in easy to learn but hard to master since everybody will have an even playing field with the simple control and command input. A bit of info about this game for any newcomer: Idol Showdown is a fighting game project with roster based-on Hololive members -aka Vtubers-  which is popular on social media. The game currently will feature 8 characters that represent certain archetypes from fighting game such as Korone (shoto or the jack of all trade); Coco (grappler); Botan (zoner hybrid); Ayame (rushdown)...and other 4 characters that I haven't learnt properly yet. This create the feeling of diversity in playstyles despite the rather temporary limited roster and this is a plus from me. \n\nFrom the point of presentation; the game stay close with the early 2000s FGs (fighting games) such as King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited match with the 16 bits character design; which is rather simple compare to other modern FG titles. Yet simple but effective; this allows low-en PC can handle this game just fine. Another plus from me.\n\nSince I haven't mention the control scheme I will put it here. The control consist of 6 buttons (not including shortcut buttons) : Light Attack; Medium Attack; Heavy Attack; Special Attack; Collabs (assist) and Burst (GTFO me button). And why do I say it is easy? With any character you can string 3 basic attack from Light to Heavy and/or into Special very consistently; so you dont have to worry too much about the way how to handle combos with each and every character every time; you can just jump in and take them for a spin and still able to pull off decent combos; but that doesn't make the game boring or way too easy; since you can practically cancel a lot of move; this will open for a variety of combos and mix-ups for you to try out; it's just a matter of experiment and testing for anyone who wants to play competitively and get-gud. So it's a good mix for both casual and hardcore players; and that's another point from me.\n\nRegarding the downside of the game I'll put them here in the last part; the online feature which I play mostly is still inconsistent with the ping and packet loss makes playing outside of your own country a problem; for a fighting game this is not good but considering the Devs are not allow to make money from this game due to it being a fan project makes me wonder how on God's name are they able to maintain the server infrastructure in the long run. Secondly; the small roster of characters which is not a problem for me; maybe for someone else and it will be updated overtime. \n\nI hope whoever find this review useful will enjoy the game as much as I do; and support the game however way you can. This is a passion project that has potential to be big.

And it's still free. You can see a lot of love and care was put in, while also making it accessible to non-fighting game players.\n\nAlthough, the game currently on launch did come out with a lot of bugs and possibly even exploits I have yet to see, I am completely contempt and frankly over it, as I expect the game would likely get better and better if the developers give the same amount of care in the future as they did for the game before.

Coco, Ayame, Fubuki, Aki Rose, Sora, Korone, Botan and each one of them have different stats, for example, ayame is really fast and likes to be close to the other player to do alot of dmg and be effective, its the other way around if shes not close enough to her foe.\nthere are even other hololive mems in the game but these arent playable yet, but some of them you can bring as an assist character, even the online mode is really really good, thanks to the rollback netcode, ive had zero input delays so far with all the matches ive been through, even the singleplayer content is amazing, and it does make sure that you will keep being busy with it for a while from time to time. so this game is an absolut must play for any FG lovers out there, even if you haven't heard about hololive

gameplay.\nThe hurdle will be big since each fandom will surely hope for their own playable vtuber, but its obviously not feasible and really hard, so the assists help in that regard. ALSO GREAT IDEA OF SKINS WORKING AS COSPLAYS FOR OTHER VTUBERS!\nCheers to the future comedy- seiso* streams from the vtubers themselves, and hope they do a tournament with this game!\n(Honestly cover

"language": "english", "review": "I've been excited to play this game ever since I saw it in the upcoming section on Steam.\n\nIt's a great middle ground between Guilty Gear and BlazBlue in terms of play.\nAlong with the usual archetypes of brawler, shoto-like, grappler, and zoner, Idol Showdown brings to the table unique character designs that are easily accessible due to the simplistic controls of the game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAmazing. The responsiveness of the button presses as well as the movement are fluid and let me feel like I'm the one in control of the character.\nI love how the characters interact and how hard hitting the moves feel. Korone's 5H, Coco's sweep, and Suisei's 6H feel so impactful.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nCHARACTERS:\nEvery character has the following (at minimum):\n- One QCF/236 special attack\n- One QCB/214 special attack\n- One DownDown/22 special attack\n- Meter EX of each of the previous attacks\n- Super that can be accessed with QCF+S\n- At least one command normal\n\nAlthough all of the characters have nearly the same inputs, there is variety. Kiryu Coco for example has some extra command throws, Tokino Sora has some activate-again abilities, and Shirakami Fubiki has a luck/gacha mechanic built in.\nMy personal favorite characters are: Inugami Korone, Shishiro Botan, and Hoshimachi Suisei (and Coco, but I'm bad at spacing)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nASSISTS:\nFor the assists, there is a wide selection of options. From straight up damage, to debuffs, to forced movement, Idol Showdown brings in good ideas for fighting game assists. HOWEVER, I feel there needs to be a gallery that shows what each assist does. While there is a name for the move, it does not describe the action very well. We need graphics!\n\nMy favorite assists are: Amane Kanata, Roboco, and Houshou Marine.\nI run Kanata for Botan to keep zoning pressure, Roboco for general pressure and Iron Man style laser, and Marine for Coco.\nTo highlight Marine/Coco, Marine seems to prevent backdashing, so she lets Coco get in to Dragon Drop. Very strong combo. Any grappler player should consider this!\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nSTAGES:\nStages in Idol Showdown are works of art. They've got the references, they've got the culture, they've got spirit.\nThe music of the stages are great as well!\nThe unfortunate part of the stages is... the lack of them! There are four stages in Idol Showdown and while they're all great, I wish there were more. It would also be nice to have them randomize per match (like how Dead or Alive 6 does it, where it randomizes with rematch).\nPersonal favorite stage: Midnight Rose\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nNETPLAY and CONTENT:\nIdol Showdown's rollback netcode has worked great for me, although I've only played against one person in the time I've spent. In the matches, we never experienced any issues. One thing I'd like to see is a true lobby system to be able to spectate players as well as queue up with friends. Perhaps a system like Guilty Gear: -Strive- or Mortal Kombat 11 would work well.\n\nFor content, Idol Showdown actually has a decent amount to offer! Of course you can do the standard 1v1 PCP offline and online, but for solo content, there's Player vs AI, Arcade, and Virtual Frontier. \nPlayer vs AI is what you think it is. Arcade is the standard fighting game gauntlet. There's also a training mode with a very good tutorial. I suggest all new players check that out.\n\nVirtual Frontier is the interesting part of these modes. It's a fighting game story mode visual novel that incorporates a unique mechanic, items! These items are seemingly exclusive to the mode, but I may be wrong. You can view what it's like in the trailer. I won't spoil anything about it, but it's definitely worth checking out!\n\nLastly, there are unlockable skin variants. I have yet to get to achieving any of these, but I figure they're accessible through Virtual Frontier.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nART:\nAs expected, the characters in the game are from the HoloLive project. The portraits, pixel art, and animations are done very well. Every character has a unique style based around the individual VTuber.\nI find the animation to be extremely fluid and easy on the eyes. There haven't been many situations where I've felt something just \"came out of nowhere.\"\nThe portraits represent the characters in a fighting game atmosphere well, but I feel there should be multiple artists brought in so that players can choose alternate portraits to represent their favorite characters. Tekken 7 did this very well, especially with the season 4 free DLC that added more portrait art from the community.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall rating: 8/10\nIn it's current state, Idol Showdown receives a strong 8 from me. The things preventing it from being a 10 out of 10 are:\n- Lack of stages (I'm sure more will be added and I'll update my review)\n- Small bugs here and there that cause the game to fail/not load matches\n- No lobby system\n- No clear explanation/visualization of what assists do without testing them in-game\n\nI feel Idol Showdown has a lot of potential as a side event at fighting game majors. I will be pushing to have this game be played at locals in my city.", "timestamp_created": 1683367514, "timestamp_updated": 1683367818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137873621": {"recommendationid": "137873621", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079647436", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1686747775}, "language": "english", "review": "Save my controller from being covered in dust.", "timestamp_created": 1683367513, "timestamp_updated": 1683367513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137873607": {"recommendationid": "137873607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282542579", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1684476170}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes, it works on Windows 7 as well.", "timestamp_created": 1683367485, "timestamp_updated": 1683367485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137873577": {"recommendationid": "137873577", "author": {"steamid": "76561199054887587", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1693840946}, "language": "english", "review": "The Single Player experience is also amazing especially keeping in mind that this is totally a F2P: Arcade is at it should be, a series of fight one after another without dialog or story (this may like or not) plus you have this mode where you collect items with various effects while fighting evil clones of the Idols, very usefull if you like variety.

If you are a Hololive fan and new to fighting games, it's relatively easy to pick up with one button fireballs, easy special move inputs and pretty much every character having some form of light>medium>heavy combo.\nFor more experienced players, the game has a lot of depth and wacky combos to discover.\n\nAbout the game modes:\n\nTraining is very impressive and has most of the features you would expect from a AAA game. I'm a casual player so I can't really point out any features it lacks.\n\nArcade feels like it's easier to beat with some characters than others, or maybe I'm just better at some of the characters. Either way, difficulty select for the Arcade mode would be nice.\n\nVirtual Frontier is very much like the World of Light from Smash Ultimate, with fights having all sort of different modifiers to spice up the usual gameplay. There's a lot of unlockable items and references to find here. It's a nice challenge!\n\nOnline currently doesn't have matchmaking but connecting directly with a friend and duking it out is very seamless. In game, I didn't notice any issues with netcode. That said we were playing on very low ping. The game also encountered an error, but only after about 20 games. In summary, the online works better than in most big fighting game releases on launch.\n\nOverall, the game is amazing. It's clearly a labor of love and way better than it has any reason to be for the price of FREE.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.", "timestamp_created": 1683359819, "timestamp_updated": 1683359819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473841398954391479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137869158": {"recommendationid": "137869158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016857120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1698682037}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego de lucha de hololive", "timestamp_created": 1683359774, "timestamp_updated": 1683359774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137869157": {"recommendationid": "137869157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058002825", "num_games_owned": 3142, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1684103680}, "language": "english", "review": "Kiryu-kai forever!", "timestamp_created": 1683359772, "timestamp_updated": 1683359772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137869152": {"recommendationid": "137869152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137869569", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1694919498}, "language": "english", "review": "suiseggs", "timestamp_created": 1683359768, "timestamp_updated": 1683359768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137869129": {"recommendationid": "137869129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220312935", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1692013176}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\ni never been into anime fighters until this game", "timestamp_created": 1683359719, "timestamp_updated": 1683359719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137869107": {"recommendationid": "137869107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082976728", "num_games_owned": 978, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1683986056}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Mind telling us what are you doing?\"\nDevs : \"Sir, spreading the idol culture\"\n\nIt says Idol Showdown but I see no idols, only comedians.

Ever since this review, there's been so much more added to the game, whether in its singleplayer, fixes to balance, and at the time of writing, PEKORA, THE WAR CRIMINAL, WHO'S GONNA BE MY MAIN NOW REGARDLESS OF HOW BROKEN OR HOW BAD SHE ENDS UP, plus two more characters on the way. The support for this has been constant, both from the devs and the community. Seeing the FGC get into it has been wonderful, and even seeing a few of them fall into the Hololive rabbit hole has been both hilarious and wholesome. This game ain't gonna die any time soon, and all this has continued to keep this up there as one of, if not the BEST fan project I've ever seen and played.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nConsidering this is a fan project, I don't know how much or if it even will expand to have more stages or more characters in its roster down the line, but with the great work already on display here with the Hololive talents they've featured in terms of their design, move sets, and quirks, it's almost criminal that this game's free.\n\nIf you're not a Hololive fan, you're not gonna be lost: what you got here is a solid fighting game with a small but incredibly distinct and fun character roster with a lot of crazy unique moves. And if you ARE a Hololive fan, you're gonna love all the references to in-jokes, memes, the attention to detail in the stages, and the fact that the girls are voiced using what I'm pretty sure are lines taken from streams the vtubers have done over the years. And Suisei going \"Hi honey~\" is probably gonna do things for you. It certainly does for me.\n\nAlso, it's got rollback. Besto Games, you madlads. There's big budget fighting game franchises from well-known AAA developers out there that still somehow don't have functioning online play. But the power of wanting to do right by your Hololive oshi can make wonders happen.\n\nSo far, the only criticism I do have has to do with the tutorial system: doing the inputs for some parts right seems to give you a pass even if what you're asked to do doesn't actually land, which might not be the most helpful thing for folks coming into this without prior experience in fighting games, so hopefully that gets fixed if possible.\n\nI hope we can see more outta this game down the line, because in the short time I've had with it, it's genuinely one of the best fan games I've seen so far.",

Since obviously it's a F2P game, it has its flaws, but overall i think it's a good experience.\n\nPOSITIVES\n*Good Music\nNo lies here. It's got some good tunes, and the vibes really stand out.\n\n*Game has soul \nIt looks and feels like love, care and sweat was put into this project. From the characters to the ambience, it all looks and feels amazing!\n\n*Good use of Vtuber personalities/qualities in gameplay\n Again, since it's a F2P game, we don't expect every single Vtuber to be here. Nevertheless, It's good to see many recognizable faces (Coco, my beloved...) in this game. Looking forward for the extra content!\n\n*Gameplay is fun\n Good gatling combos. They look original and very appealing to play.\n\n\nNEGATIVES\n-Commands/Motion Inputs are too easy...\nSo this is kind of a personal preference here, but the game is lacking in some technical variety when it comes to gameplay. While it looks very easy to pick up, it becomes kind of repetitive and boring. Not gonna lie, I was hoping at least one Charge character. I am used to play Charge Characters since Killer Instinct (SNES) and every time I pick a game, I tend to prefer those characters (i.e. Sabrewulf (KI), May (GG), Guile (SF))\n\n-Little to No air combos\nAgain, personal preference. I was expecting some kind of air combos. I don't know why but I felt it had to be there, you know? Makes the game more fun and exciting.\n\n-Difficulty/Balancing? (To be tested thoroughly)\n So, I tested Medium difficulty while plating with Coco against Korone. Every time I wanted to go a grab, Korone would just jump and avoid it. From 9 grabs i used, at least 1 connected. Not sure if it's the difficulty, but it really felt weird. One thing is for sure. At least, the character I'm finding difficult to play as is Coco. Her grabs are reaaaaaaaally telegraphed. Hoping for some balancing in terms of frames.\n\n-Weird Character Choices/Not the characters I was hoping for\n I think most of these negatives are personal thoughts, but I feel some characters could have been fighters instead of assists. Marine and Mio are the characters I expected to be played. I hope the assists can become playable at one point and viceversa. Also, hoping for more characters from other agencies (Nijisanji, v-shojo maybe?) \n\nConclusion:\n\nThese negative points are made from a constructive POV for the creators to look into them, so that the gameplay and overall game can improve in any way shape or form. As of right now, I haven't tested the Online funcionality of this game, but will do an update on it eventually. This is fantastic F2P Fighting Game in which heart and soul was poured into it. I really recommend it and I'm really hoping for some extra content!", "timestamp_created": 1683354075, "timestamp_updated": 1683354628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137866233": {"recommendationid": "137866233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198431415865", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1684401456}, "language": "english", "review": "Uh, game is too simple, basically Mbtl super inputs but no stylish mode", "timestamp_created": 1683354056, "timestamp_updated": 1683354056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137866214": {"recommendationid": "137866214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024995503", "num_games_owned": 1400, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1683353033}, "language": "spanish", "review": "The game is good but...\nMany errors, like softlocks (lots)\nA bit clunky controls\nSometimes has lag and delay (offline)", "timestamp_created": 1683354019, "timestamp_updated": 1683354019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137866120": {"recommendationid": "137866120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834237806", "num_games_owned": 679, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1683373523}, "language": "english", "review": "I will never be beaten!!...

It\u2019s like you\u2019re enjoying all these kinds of axes at a buffet. I really want Pekora to try some on or Fubuki to try some on to replace her tail. We really need axes to become a thing in hololive and start selling them for HoloComi. Don\u2019t. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Axes? Especially Suisei, who can use them to chop down her Tetris blocks and show off her skills\u2604\ufe0f. Or maybe she can use them to unleash her inner psychopath and go on a rampage. Either way, I\u2019m sure she would look amazing with an axe in her hand, shining like a shooting star\u2728.\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1683352374, "timestamp_updated": 1683352374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489690721035003662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137865312": {"recommendationid": "137865312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198448132826", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1683412459}, "language": "english", "review": "fun fighting game needs some tweeks tho\n\n1.  the ai counter grabs almost everytime even at low difficultys\n\n2. the ai blocks alot, i found a combo that takes half the health on most idols, but like half way through with out fail they block at cancel all the damage\n\n3. it might be smart to put block on some sort of charging meter so its more of a resource then a fail safe\n\n4. im sure there will be more idols soon just with it launched with more then 8 base idols", "timestamp_created": 1683352235, "timestamp_updated": 1683352235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510309278964996338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137865310": {"recommendationid": "137865310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398717520", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 266, "last_played": 1683992342}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1683352233, "timestamp_updated": 1683352233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489690721035003662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137865279": {"recommendationid": "137865279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005377028", "num_games_owned": 781, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1684824805}, "language": "english", "review": "Against all the salt that the FGC can conjure, all the wickedness that noobs can produce, the devs have sent unto us...

I didn't even know this was a thing that was coming until I looked at Steam's popular upcoming section and found this game like 5 hours before it released. I'm not familiar with hololive but I'm not about to turn down a 2D fighter with cute anime girls, are you kidding me?\n\nMain pros: \n- Movesets and animations are cute and funny. Things like characters dabbing or flipping you off with a smug grin as they walk away, eating a burger, sending your manager at someone to make them back off, throwing up a meme of the person they just grabbed, or an assist just straight up holding onto your legs and not letting you go. I especially love the cute hug animation as a throw.\n- I enjoy that the match end screen is a streaming overlay, complete with a fake chat scrolling by and recommended videos shown underneath.\n\nMain cons: \n- Navigating the menu can be a bit clunky sometimes, like I hit down once and it could move down two options. \n- Some things can be explained better, like on Fubuki's moveset her down+down+special has her eat a burger and the description of the move just says it \"increases SSR for her next special.\" That's it. What's the SSR do? My only guess is that it increases the damage.\n- Small roster, but I'm glad to see it'll be expanded. At least there's plenty more as a sub-roster specifically for the assists that can help mix things up.\n- Only 4 stages. Hopefully we get at least a few more. \n\nSuggestions for the devs: \n- Do something about the menu navigation speed. I could barely tap down on the d-pad just once and it'd go down a couple options.\n- Maybe add some curated tutorials for each individual character to introduce players to each part of their moveset.\n- I'd love to see that end-match screen customized for each character. If it's meant to be like they're streaming the game, it feels weird that everyone you play as has the same design.\n- Having player cards you can customize and display for the online portion would be nice. (Something along the lines of how DragonBall FighterZ did player cards, with an avatar, banner, title, stickers, borders...)\n- A stats page for online matches would be nice. How many matches played, show a win/loss counter, track which character is your most played or must successful. \n- I'd like to see a sort of \"Tournament\" mode for players with a group of friends to get in a randomized bracket.", "timestamp_created": 1683340358, "timestamp_updated": 1683340358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53316950798034668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137859000": {"recommendationid": "137859000", "author": {"steamid": "76561199033788100", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1683853824}, "language": "english", "review": "Korone has a DP where she turns into 8-bit Mario.

"language": "english", "review": "Neat game and its free so it's great to pick up but so far I found a few things I don't like about it. Could just be the few characters I tried but I found myself not having fun very quickly. \n\nNOTE: This is from the Perspective of someone who just enjoys fighting games for the combos and single player content. I'm not a hardcore Online versus player. I just enjoy making combos, learning characters, and playing against the Ai to kill time. \n\nNow the first issue I had is the combo system. Its an ABCD system similar to games like Blazblue and Undernight in Birth but it lacks air combo potential. You get one hit in the air and that's it. You can do some cool Rejump stuff where you continue your combo with a delayed hit out of jump, but it left much to be desired in that front. Not a huge issue just for a casual player like me, I didn't enjoy the limitation.\n\nNext is the Ai seems to input read. I know it's very popular to have input reading Ai to make it harder but to me it just sucks the fun out of it. If I get the advantage and go into a little block pressure, I don't want to be instantly grabbed out of delays or punished for trying to block. It feels bad personally but of course this is against Ai. It's to be expected, just a personal gripe for myself.\n\nNow to the moves themselves, I mostly played Sora so experiences may differ. I found a lot of times the range on her moves were really subpar. For an easy to learn ABC Fighter you tend to push your opponent away easily in this game with a simple 5L2L5M2M - At that point I usually couldn't connect 5H or 2H with her. It really messed up the flow for myself but again that is likely intended, I just hate the feeling I get from messing up a simple string like that and eating a full combo after it.\n\nI actually recommend the game and I can't wait to see updates and balance patches. Possibly extra characters? I don't actually know the devs plans but I wish them luck!\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add, I am not a fan of Hololive or any Vtubers really, I just enjoy fighting games.", "timestamp_created": 1683339147, "timestamp_updated": 1683339208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137858310": {"recommendationid": "137858310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198453911432", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1683470818}, "language": "english", "review": "I'M SIMP", "timestamp_created": 1683339077, "timestamp_updated": 1683339077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137858302": {"recommendationid": "137858302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062076352", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1683867432}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm missing all of my fingers now", "timestamp_created": 1683339058, "timestamp_updated": 1683339058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137858244": {"recommendationid": "137858244", "author": {"steamid": "76561199175475085", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1683345895}, "language": "english", "review": "Nene took all my money but it was worth it", "timestamp_created": 1683338975, "timestamp_updated": 1683338975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137858243": {"recommendationid": "137858243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166674166", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1692263110}, "language": "english", "review": "wake up dp trust", "timestamp_created": 1683338974, "timestamp_updated": 1683338974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137858234": {"recommendationid": "137858234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320887925", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1695796916}, "language": "english", "review": "yubi yubi", "timestamp_created": 1683338961, "timestamp_updated": 1683338961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137858208": {"recommendationid": "137858208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063801635", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1688686757}, "language": "english", "review": "needs moar of the waifu Nenechi.
