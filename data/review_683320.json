El juego, en cuanto a escenario gr\u00e1fico, es lo m\u00e1s bonito que vas a ver en un videojuego. Realizado por ilustradores, y m\u00fasicos en un proyecto muy \"indi\".

Despite GRIS has gorgeous art design, I have to confess that sometimes the gameplay is tedious, especially at the beginning of this game... In this game, what you can do is only jump, run, or press K or L... No attack, no boss fight, you'll never die, because there is no HP... Oh this game even doesn't need the mouse...\nSo, generally, If you just want to relax yourself, it's okay.

This indie gem is a testament to the artistic potential of the gaming medium, offering players a unique and captivating experience that transcends traditional gaming boundaries.\n\n\"Gris\" immediately captivates players with its breathtaking visuals. The hand-drawn art style, reminiscent of watercolor paintings, creates a world that feels like a living, breathing piece of art. Each frame is a meticulously crafted masterpiece, and the use of color plays a pivotal role in conveying the protagonist's emotional journey. The environments seamlessly transition from desaturated and melancholic tones to vibrant and hopeful hues as the narrative unfolds.\n\nAt its core, \"Gris\" is a deeply emotional and personal journey. The narrative is told without explicit dialogue, relying on visual storytelling and symbolism. The protagonist, a young girl named Gris, navigates a world filled with sorrow and loss, gradually finding her voice and strength. The game skillfully explores themes of grief, resilience, and self-discovery, resonating with players on a profound emotional level.\n\nThe music, composed by Berlinist, complements the visual narrative perfectly. The hauntingly beautiful score adapts to the emotional beats of the story, enhancing the player's connection to the experiences of \"Gris\". The sound design is equally impressive, immersing players in the atmosphere and emotional weight of each moment.\n\nWhile \"Gris\" is primarily an atmospheric experience, its platforming elements are well-designed and intuitive. The controls are simple and responsive, allowing players to focus on the emotional journey rather than complex mechanics. As Gris gains new abilities, the puzzles become more intricate, adding a layer of depth without compromising the game's accessibility.\n\n\"Gris\" is a relatively short experience, but every moment feels purposeful and impactful. The pacing is deliberate, allowing players to absorb the emotional weight of each stage. The game invites contemplation, and its open-ended nature leaves room for personal interpretation, making it a deeply personal and memorable experience for each player.\n\n\"Gris\" stands as a testament to the artistic potential of video games. It masterfully combines visual artistry, emotional storytelling, and engaging gameplay to create an unforgettable experience. Nomada Studio's debut title is not just a game; it's a work of art that pushes the boundaries of what the medium can achieve. Gris is a must-play for those seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1696958773, "timestamp_updated": 1696958773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147978393": {"recommendationid": "147978393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141742035", "num_games_owned": 618, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1696949693}, "language": "english", "review": "One word, Magical...\nPlease don't go to therapy, Just play this game!", "timestamp_created": 1696949173, "timestamp_updated": 1696949344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667437732219696045", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147978266": {"recommendationid": "147978266", "author": {"steamid": "76561199480288421", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 449, "last_played": 1697032385}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool art and Cool game", "timestamp_created": 1696948996, "timestamp_updated": 1697018614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147952048": {"recommendationid": "147952048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399320217", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1696897684}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es sumamente art\u00edstico", "timestamp_created": 1696897827, "timestamp_updated": 1696897827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147951148": {"recommendationid": "147951148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072110231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1696896166}, "language": "english", "review": "just such a lovely work of art", "timestamp_created": 1696896185, "timestamp_updated": 1696896185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147949245": {"recommendationid": "147949245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037879806", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1697234964}, "language": "english", "review": "Si.", "timestamp_created": 1696892576, "timestamp_updated": 1696892576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147940793": {"recommendationid": "147940793", "author": {"steamid": "76561199231974921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1861, "last_played": 1698184925}, "language": "english", "review": "cozy game", "timestamp_created": 1696879525, "timestamp_updated": 1696879525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147939670": {"recommendationid": "147939670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198929877647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 814, "last_played": 1675128577}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely gorgeous game, literally everything about it is perfect: the music, the art, the story is incredible- and it is very friendly to people who arent that used to more harsh games, or that want a little break from more intensive stuff.

This is the first video game I've ever started and finished by myself.\n\nThat alone should explain why it took me twelve hours to complete a game that my boyfriend and several Reddit threads claim took them about three to four hours, six tops. But, if I'm being honest, most of my time was spent simply looking and listening. I'm not really trying to review GRIS; I don't think I could. I just want to praise it for being an accessible, beautiful story that has completely and irrevocably transformed my view of video games as a whole.\n\nI was born with Cerebral Palsy, and in my case, it manifests itself as a fine motor disability. Gaming is one of those things I've always written off as too hard for me: my brain moves faster than my hands can, I struggle focusing on perspective, sequences, lefts/rights, etc. I grew up around friends and family who loved to game in their free time, and I would watch in awe as they moved through landscapes with ease, challenged bosses fearlessly, used weapons and combos to defeat their foes. Every once and awhile, I'd ask to try, and no one was ever mean to me about it -- my brother was always patient and tried his best to coach me, but it felt like I genuinely could not make the synapses in my mind connect, no matter how badly I wanted to. Eventually, I wrote off video games entirely, even the \"easy\" ones -- To this day, if someone suggests firing up Mario Kart at a party, I break into a sweat. I've accidentally thrown myself off of Rainbow Road enough times to earn Yoshi a Purple Heart.\n\nThat said, I was not particularly good at GRIS. But, between twelve hours and zero pressure, I was able to build up simple platforming skills that ultimately led me through an emotional, evocative game that I am proud to say I completed -- and I had a damn good time doing it! I never believed people when they told me that, just like the books and films I love, there's a game out there for everyone. GRIS changed my mind.

It may be the most beautiful 2D game of any genre I've ever played\n- The visual design of the characters and environments is truly stunning. If you're into soft watercolors, pastel hues, and flowing lines of suggestive of art nouveau, you'll have a great time looking at this one. As a man with a bunch of framed John Dyer Baizley prints adorning his walls, I may be a bit biased\n- The music is quite pretty and appropriate for the game's style and themes\n\n[b]Story & Vibes[/b]\n- The game's story is more of figurative and emotional than it is literal and plot-driven. Don't go in expecting an overt narrative. If there is a defined story here, it's not supposed to be obvious\n- Gris is very chill with a muted range of vibes that run from softly mournful to cautiously hopeful. All that changes with the emotional climax at the end, which feels earned and satisfying\n\n[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]\n- This is not a difficult game. By puzzle platforming standards, Gris isn't going to ask much of your brain or reflexes. That's just fine with me. I was happy to turn my brain down for a bit and enjoy the pretty colors\n- Due to the simplicity, there isn't much to delve into in terms of gameplay. You run, jump, and sometimes sing to make your way through the game's environment\n- It's an easy game to replay due to it's visual appeal and short length. In fact, I played this a few years ago on the Switch. Thanks to a good sale, I was more than happy to pick it up to play again on a bigger screen with better hardware\n\n[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]\n- Not that Gris will tax any system very hard. Gris will look gorgeous on any setup. It doesn't take much juice to run well\n- The game is 100% style over substance, but it just so happens that the style is so good that you care very little about the lack of gameplay depth\n\n[b]Final Verdict[/b]\n- [b]7.5/10[/b]. It's not often that I'd recommend a game based solely on its visual appeal, but I'll make an exception here.

From the moment you start playing, you'll be captivated by its beauty and moved by its story.\nFirst things first, the visuals in this game are absolutely stunning. The whole game looks like it was hand-painted with watercolors, and every scene is like a work of art. It's like playing inside a dream, where the colors and landscapes change as you progress. Even if you're not into gaming, you'd be tempted to just watch someone play it for the visuals alone.\nThe story of GRIS is a powerful one, and what's unique is that it doesn't rely on words to tell it. Instead, it uses the environment, the music, and the actions of the main character, Gris, to convey emotions. It's a story of loss, grief, and healing, and it's beautifully told. You'll feel connected to Gris even though she doesn't say a word, and that's a testament to the game's storytelling prowess.\nGameplay-wise, GRIS is a puzzle-platformer, and it's not too hard to get into. The puzzles are cleverly designed, but it's worth noting that the map design isn't always intuitive. At times, you might find yourself retracing your steps or getting a little lost, but this minor setback doesn't detract significantly from the overall experience. The controls are smooth, making Gris's movements feel graceful and natural.\nThe music in GRIS deserves a special mention. The soundtrack, composed by Berlinist, is a masterpiece that enhances the emotional impact of the game. It's soothing, haunting, and incredibly atmospheric. Trully phenomenal.\nIn the end, GRIS is a game that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming. It's a visual and emotional masterpiece that's more about the journey than the destination. If you're looking for a game that's not just fun but also deeply moving, GRIS is an absolute must-play a beautiful form of art that leaves a lasting impression on your heart.", "timestamp_created": 1694174312, "timestamp_updated": 1694174312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145899208": {"recommendationid": "145899208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044121334", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1694159668}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but absolutely beautiful game and totally worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1694160223, "timestamp_updated": 1694160223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145893599": {"recommendationid": "145893599", "author": {"steamid": "76561199380368562", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 525, "last_played": 1694148405}, "language": "english", "review": "oh my goodness! this video game is 100/100.

The world is divided into 5 parts, from which you collect one special ability.\n\nEach newly unlocked ability provides you with more possibilities to traverse and overcome obstacles. Although there are only 5 in number, they are quite interesting and simple to use.\n\nThe level design is not complex but beautifully crafted, and each area feels different. Your influence in the world impacts some areas of the world, opening new sections and changing old ones.\n\nCollectibles can be found in the world and sometimes offer a challenge, but overall, they can be obtained with patience and a keen eye.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3032092596\n \n[h3] \ud83d\ude04 Fun: [/h3]\n\nIt's not the most fun game, but neither a pain. I had a lot of intrigue in the world and exploring it was the most interesting thing.\n \n[h3] \ud83c\udfde Visuals & Presentation: [/h3]  \n  \nThis is the area where the game earns the most points. It's gorgeous, beautifully designed, and highly unique. Levels are pencil-drawn, as are the cinematics.\n\nIts style changes over time as you progress in the game and unlock new areas through colors, breathing life into the world as you do so.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3032092432\n \n[h3] \ud83d\udd0a Sound & Voice-Acting: [/h3]  \n \nFor some reason or another, I really enjoyed the game's soundtrack, the music sung by the main character, and the most critical moments.\n\nThe main character, Gris, is not able to talk but makes cute and gentle voices throughout the game, with beautiful melancholic and angelic singing parts at the very end that moved me to the point where I almost shed a tear. It's beautiful, and I really enjoyed listening to this game's music.\n  \n[h3] \ud83d\udcd6 Story & Writing: [/h3]  \n\nGRIS is a game about a journey though grief and it's personal growth that comes with it.\n  \nGRIS has a very interesting and sad story about a young girl who sings to a statue. The game starts as she loses her voice for unexplained reasons while singing, and in the process, she loses her powers.\n\nShe ventures slowly into the world, trying to recover what she lost, and through this journey, you explore both the world and the character. Not much is explained, and it's left for interpretation.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3032092032\n \n[h3] \ud83e\uddf5 Length & Difficulty: [/h3]  \n  \nIt's fairly a short game and can be completed in a single playthrough if you pay attention or follow guides.

Love the way they rethought the way things work in the usual platformer mechanics.  Instead of dying and re-spawning -- you never die in this game -- you just fall back to where you were before and then you have to try again.   Also, it is low stress as it never lets you miss anything that you needed.  For example, in other games, I worry that I have missed a path to secret treasure or escape, none of that.  If you need it, you'll just keep hitting walls and you go back and then there's only one way that makes sense.  So now I feel at ease when I hit two ways to go, because the wrong way just circles back, or dead ends, no stress!  Another thing is that the stuff you see in the trailer is only from the first 30 minutes or so.  There are lots of ways you learn to deal with the environment beyond what you see in the promotions -- no spoilers.  The puzzles are fun and mostly easy, but there are times where I have to come back to the game later and let my subconscious sort it out.  :-)  So far I have not needed to seek out any online help.  Many of the puzzles are easy, but there are lot of them, so it it's kind of a speed run of puzzles, which is quite satisfying for me.

It truly is a beautiful game.\n\nAs Gris, a woman who's lost her voice and agency, you confront your inner demons. At first, they're like a tormenting flock of birds, a representation of the fears and pain that hold you back. You begin weak, but with each step, you gain strength, eventually reclaiming your inner power and peace.\n\nThe game's art style is mesmerizing. It starts with gentle watercolors and morphs into a vibrant symphony of hues and shapes. The visuals, like shifting layers of a dream, captivate your senses and elevate the experience.\n\nGameplay evolves in harmony with the art, introducing mechanics that serve as metaphors for your journey. Without spoiling much of the story this game, you learn to stand firm against adversity. \n\nIn Gris, the protagonist uses her dress to transform into a cube, brave strong winds and traverse through various landscapes. It's a lesson in  taking shape to adversities and embracing obstacles, turning them into stepping stones.\n\nAs you navigate Gris, its world interacts with you. It's not just about moving through; it's about feeling connected, understood, and motivated to explore solutions. The game weaves details into its fabric that resonate with you and encourage introspection.\n\nMy time with Gris was short, but its impact was immense. It's a reminder that sometimes, facing our inner fears and transforming them can lead to astonishing growth. It's a symphony of emotion and a canvas of self-discovery, painting a beautiful picture of resilience and renewal.", "timestamp_created": 1692638654, "timestamp_updated": 1692638654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144718228": {"recommendationid": "144718228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313314307", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1692627255}, "language": "english", "review": "Turtle boi saved me", "timestamp_created": 1692627554, "timestamp_updated": 1692627554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144694004": {"recommendationid": "144694004", "author": {"steamid": "76561199266515499", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 536, "last_played": 1692596823}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1692594565, "timestamp_updated": 1692594565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144687080": {"recommendationid": "144687080", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059644101", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1691020617}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1692584728, "timestamp_updated": 1692584728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144669559": {"recommendationid": "144669559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276581951", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1692563115}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't played such a great game in a long time.

Although there is plenty of exploration and a sort of antagonist, you're never in danger of being killed or getting lost. There are puzzles that require some platforming and use of new abilities you gain as you move through the story but they mostly require noticing stuff around you and are unlikely to block your progress for long.\n\nI guess your enjoyment of the game depends on whether it catches you in the right mood.

Equally true.\n\nSo, what's the final verdict on the game?\n\nThe traditional rating systems on Steam does not allow for nuanced opinions and, despite my criticisms, I'm not really panning the game.\n\nThe main issue lies in the fact that \"Gris\" leans more towards being an experience rather than a conventional game. However, even as an experience, it leans too heavily on evoking emotions, leaving gameplay and structure behind.\n\nBeneath the surface, there are certainly layers of metaphorical depth, but on the surface level, it often involves solving relatively simple puzzles. These puzzle segments are interspersed with moments where the player is led into semi-interactive \"emotional\" cutscenes\u2014scenes that give the illusion of control but essentially keep you in a passive role as a viewer.\n\nAdditionally, the game's narrative is saturated with pathos to an excessive extent. The soundtrack is a continuous stream of \"aaaahs\" and \"iiiihs,\" and the themes consistently delve into topics like depression and elation. It's unclear whether this stems from genuine involvement on the developers' part or a hint of cynicism.\n\nIn summary: My appreciation for the creative team behind this game is genuine.

The gameplay is somewhat simple but it doesn't really need to be anything else for the purpose of the game's story and vibe. The art has shading somewhat reminiscent of Supergiant games while also reminding me somewhat of the work of Yoshitaka Amano. I would say that if the art in the previews appeals to you, I would check out the game - its only around 3-6 hours long and has a cohesive metaphorical narrative. \n\nIn terms of the narrative, it is quite simple but gets its point across effectively. The sections with [spoiler] the bird and the eel [/spoiler] felt to me to be a little bit too dramatic for the tone of the game, especially in conjunction with the music. I can see these sections being highlights for some people though so I would say this comes down to personal preference. The same can be said about the music in general - sometimes it is very effective, especially in the more ambient sections. The multilayered countermelody that is produced when [spoiler] you unlock the singing ability [/spoiler] is a particularly good example of this. However, I feel that sometimes the music does a bit too much of the thinking for the player and takes away from the games stellar sound design. Some of my favourite moments of the game were when I was just left to explore with the ambient sound of the game's world as the backdrop. If you want a game where you can quietly sink into a melancholy yet soothing vibe, then I would recommend Gris.\n\nGenres: [i] platformer, puzzle, iyashikei [/i]\nDifficulty: [i] 2/10 - Very easy [/i]\nRating: [i] 7/10 - Great!

What I got, was nothing sort of a masterpiece.\n\nThe creative minds at Nomada Studio set out to develop a game unlike anything I had ever seen before. It\u2019s a puzzle platformer without any combat or fail states. There\u2019s no text or exposition, but there\u2019s a story, and while it may not be immediately obvious, it will still somehow manage to convey to you the intense grief and pain the main character feels. But what will definitely stand out to the most, is the exceptional visual design and soundtrack.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with gameplay.\n\nLike I said twice already, Gris is a puzzle platformer. The game starts very slowly. For the first few minutes I was wondering where everything shown in the trailer went. It felt as though I was just walking around in a barren wasteland.\n\nThat is part of the beauty of this game. As you progress, you collect lights that resemble stars (which later also form constellations that open up new paths). These lights unlock new abilities for Gris, the main character the game is entitled after.\n\nAs soon as you unlock the very first ability, you immediately begin to see that the true depth of this game. It\u2019s not that the puzzles are somehow unique, but they\u2019re entertaining. Very entertaining. I have to say this because you might feel\u2014like I did\u2014doubtful during the first few minutes. Be patient. There are some very smart and fun puzzles in this game, and they get progressively better. In fact, the last level felt like a culmination of it all and was just a lot of fun to play through.\n\nNone of the puzzles will ever seriously challenge you. That\u2019s not what Gris is about\u2014and I appreciate that. I enjoyed playing a game for the sensorial experience, and the excitement of figuring out how to solve puzzles that make me think for a minute, but never frustrate me.\n\nYour first playthrough is going to be linear, and once you finish the game for the first time, you\u2019ll be able to revisit past levels. Don\u2019t worry about leaving anything behind. The game will make it clear where you\u2019re supposed to go. I\u2019m a pretty unintelligent person, and I never had to pull up a guide or anything. This game was very accessible.\n\nI also just have to say that it\u2019s refreshing to play a puzzle platformer that doesn\u2019t include any combat or fail state. I never felt anxious. That\u2019s good. Sometimes anxiety makes games more immersive. Gris managed to do it without the anxiety.\n\nThe highlight of this game though has to be the visual design.\n\nIt\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. I can\u2019t even think of anything to compare it to. They took four really basic environments (what I\u2019d call, a red sand desert, a lush forest, underwater caves, and a \u201cspace garden made of light\u201d), but put an otherworldly aquarelle spin on them, that just completely blew my mind. Honestly. So much of the game could be a painting on a canvas. I showed the trailer to my wife, and even she was blown away. I know that, from now on, every time someone tells me that games aren\u2019t art, I\u2019ll be thinking about Gris. I mean, five out of the eight awards Gris won, were somewhere in the category of visual art. That should tell you something about how good the art style in Gris is (and how great the game is in general, considering all the nominations).\n\nAnd along with a great visual design, came an excellent score.\n\nThere is not a single moment in this game where I felt that the music was out of place. Quite to the contrary. It always knew exactly what emotion I was supposed to feel at any given moment. The music is equally parts epic, reflective, emotional, personal, and fittingly atmospheric. It is so good, all of it, that I\u2019m actually listening to the official soundtrack as I type this out. This is big praise coming from me. I couldn\u2019t write a single word on a notepad while listening to music if my life depended on it. But the music in Gris is just\u2026 it\u2019s something else. It\u2019ll be listening to it for years to come.\n\nMy first playthrough took me close to four hours. There\u2019s quite a few collectibles I missed, so maybe there\u2019s an additional two or three in there. All-in-all, you\u2019re getting your money\u2019s worth for $15 on Steam, and I got it on discount for five times less than that, if I remember correctly, so I got a really sweet deal. And you should too.\n\nGris is an experience. Its simple and fun gameplay never gets in the way of that experience. It\u2019s one of those games you play to see and hear something different and memorable. If someone asked to visualize a painting of a game, Gris would more of less be what would come to my mind.\n\nI give Gris two thumbs up.

It just makes the storytelling more challenging since it is harder to build a connection when you don't have concrete stuff to latch onto. The real issue is that the quality of the storytelling here is just lacking. For example, the pacing is borked from the start. One of the first things that happens is that the game plays over the top dramatic music as she is she is sliding down a hill. This is a thing that would totally work if it happens after I'd actually gone through anything with this character. I've only been playing a few minutes at this point, so how am I supposed to be affected by this?

I think what has ruined this game is insisting on an extreme level of abstractness to the point that renders the game devoid of the potential to elicit sympathy and a touching emotional connection. Even the synopsis reflects this gaping vagueness as the game is described as the story of a young woman who has had a painful experience. What that painful experience was is left to the player's imagination which by the end of the game is sufficiently numbed by the bleakness of the world. \nIt is painful to have to say these things about a game that was clearly made with love and care but it is what it is and despite my best efforts to feel something at the end as the cutscene rolled out and depicted a very predictable eventuality, the only emotions I had were pity for the game as it was trying to make me cry or something watching the final cutscene as the supposedly epic music played while the statue came together, and also a feeling of deep regret for the time I spent playing it. \nWhat makes so many people adore it, I simply don't know. The scarcity of games with original ideas perhaps.

There might be a couple of parts that you get stuck on for a second, but it is fairly easy.\nThe games length is very short as well. I completed it in 3 and a half hours so it is a nice short game. I had no idea what this game was about going into it, but as soon as I started it, it captivated my curiosity and my interest. I could not stop playing it until I finished, and wish that there was more. The creativity in the different chapters is incredible and impressive in different aspects.\nThe emotion that you feel as you uncover more about the story, what happened, and the interpretation for it is amazing to say the least and expresses going through grief in a very creative way. It isn't depressing. There are definitely some moments that make you tense up, but most of the game is a calming experience.\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2611 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2611 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10", "timestamp_created": 1688202772, "timestamp_updated": 1688202772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141028988": {"recommendationid": "141028988", "author": {"steamid": "76561199075522866", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1688195923}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hermoso.", "timestamp_created": 1688193552, "timestamp_updated": 1688193552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141027181": {"recommendationid": "141027181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376122879", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1688319202}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing this game was almost like having a religious experience.

To do this, she\u2019s tasked with collecting light across several biomes. Which is where the theme of color comes in. Gris uses bold colors to both represent emotions and make astonishing landscapes to traverse. From blue-accented underwater caves to windy red sand deserts, each section uses striking mono or dual tones that make exploring the game a veritable treat, all underlit by a serene, contemplative soundtrack that I just had to download after finishing the game. As you progress you\u2019ll become increasingly antagonized by black ink creatures, who serve as the sole foes of Gris, requiring puzzle-solving to evade or outright defeat them. I\u2019m personally a fan of them. They provide brief bouts of tension to show the young girl\u2019s inner turmoil in addition to pumping in a dose of urgency to your actions.\n\nWhether I was escorting a newly-acquainted buddy across lush forests or running for my life through Greek architecture from giant crows, my interest never dipped, nor did confusion or frustration rear their heads. It might not be obvious at first the true goal of the game, but as you near the ending and the young girl regains her voice and thus her ability to sing, it becomes abundantly clear what she wishes for and finally gains. Peace with her mother\u2019s passing. It\u2019s a somber feeling to be certain, yet as the credits rolled and she ascended the clouds, it wasn\u2019t despair I was feeling. It was contentment. The obvious contentment from playing an A+ game, but also a closure for the main character that couldn\u2019t help but leave me hopeful.

And you can always go back to areas once you've completed the game, so nothing is really \"missable\" for completion.

Obviously the game looks absolutely stunning and has a really great soundtrack. As a piece of art, it's wonderful, however at a game it fails in more ways than one.\n\nFirst of all, this should (even tho it is verified) not be played on the steam deck (like I did). The character is increadibly small most of the time, making it hard to to see where you are or where you are going.\n\nThese next parts are not related to the deck however. The game communicates foreground/background and interactable things very poorly from time to time, which breaks your journey and let's you run around a lot, only for you to realize you were in the correct spot before. This goes hand in hand with the fact that most of this game is simply moving. Like a walking simulator, walking into some direction.\nMost of the times, the parkour isn't difficult at all, but here and there some platforms etc. are really really badly spaced, forcing you to either jump from the very last pixel to barely make it or sometimes you will overshoot. That combined with the long walking means if you fall, you will have to go back quiet a bit before you can try again, which makes parkour really infuriating some times.", "timestamp_created": 1687026486, "timestamp_updated": 1687026486, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567782342433929443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140222077": {"recommendationid": "140222077", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963057775", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1687015061}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the prettiest things I've ever played, a real chill experience.", "timestamp_created": 1687015117, "timestamp_updated": 1687015117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140207671": {"recommendationid": "140207671", "author": {"steamid": "76561199218162122", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1686996781}, "language": "english", "review": "Work of art.\n", "timestamp_created": 1686997276, "timestamp_updated": 1686997276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140196285": {"recommendationid": "140196285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198934693513", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1686977511}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute masterpiece.

I had no idea what was to come or anything - only that it would be a platformer game of sorts with beautiful art, I guess. I played for about 40 minutes or so. I understood nothing; I was lost and a little bit frustrated. The only actions the game allowed me to do were walk and jump - and walking was made difficult by a particularly infuriating storm. I stopped and complained a little bit about the game.\n\nI decided to start over and see if I missed something - and boy, did I miss. I had taken the wrong turn at the beginning of the game. I went backwards and saw a beautifully laid-down statue. The girl kneeled, seemingly saddened. I didn't click anything - I didn't want to rush that moment. What was that about? I admired the beauty of such strange melancholy - then she stood up, and an achievement popped up. It was the turning point of all my previous emotions towards the game. Everything I was experiencing while playing it made sense. If you have ever been in the girl's shoes or looked through her eyes, you'll immediately know. You'll know the name and the feeling for the next four achievements.\n\nEverything in the game is beautifully put together. All five chapters, the monsters (or demons), all the colors, and all the pain of existence while the beauty of what was still lingers inside of you.\n\nI do hope you play this game. I hope you feel embraced by it and that it helps you process what you are going through.\n\nMay the empty void of colorlessness never make you stop.\nMay the furious destruction of red make you break only what is bad.\nMay the foolish dealings of green never make you a fool.\nMay the tear-dropping of blue fulfill the clean waters of your mind.\nMay the good memories of yellow times linger forever in your heart.\n\nKeep going for those who kept going for you.", "timestamp_created": 1686894141, "timestamp_updated": 1686894141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863569676876068115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140139809": {"recommendationid": "140139809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198958466739", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 486, "last_played": 1652948259}, "language": "english", "review": "It's soft and gentle, the music is calming and the story is beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1686889987, "timestamp_updated": 1686889987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140137075": {"recommendationid": "140137075", "author": {"steamid": "76561199110830156", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 810, "last_played": 1686884479}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a beautifully made game.

Created by Nomada Studios, this masterpiece blends craftsmanship with exquisite visuals, captivating audio and allegorical storytelling to create a moving experience on a deeply personal level GRIS stands for a testament to the power of video games as an art form, pushing the boundaries of history and the appeal for players in a deep exploration of grief, loss and healing.\n\nVISUALS:\nOne of the most interesting aspects of GRIS is its intricate design. The handcrafted art style brings each frame to life with delicate and meticulous detail. The game\u2019s world is an expertly crafted canvas, evolving and changing as players progress through the story. Each stage is incredibly colorful and bright, conveying emotions ranging from desolation to hope. The graphics alone are enough to draw players in and immerse them in a world that feels familiar and ethereal.\n\nAUDIO:\nThe audio system of GRIS plays an important role in enhancing the emotional impact of the game. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by Berlinist pairs well with the gameplay and visuals, enhancing the experience. Musical composition and ambient sound create a sense of atmosphere and evoke emotions, adding depth and resonance to the story GRIS' audio elements are central to its appeal, and effectively convey underlying themes and connects players to the protagonist\u2019s journey.\n\nNARRATIVES & THEMES:\nGRIS is an abstract metaphorical story about a young woman named Gris, navigating a world shaped by her grief and loss. While intentionally open to interpretation, the piece explores themes of adversity, personal growth, and the transformative power of resilience. The lack of dialogue encourages players to reflect on their experiences and imbues the game with a universality that allows everyone to make their own sense of the story into a deeply emotional and self-inviting journey call for reflection and self-reflection.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nIn terms of gameplay mechanics, GRIS is a relatively straightforward platformer with puzzles and light exploration elements. The interface is simple and intuitive, allowing players to focus on the experience rather than complex mechanics. While the puzzles aren\u2019t overly complex though, they are meaningful metaphors and symbolic images of the protagonist\u2019s emotional state. While some players may prefer more complex gaming mechanics, it\u2019s worth noting that GRIS prioritizes overall experience over gameplay depth.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nGRIS is an interactive masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and emotional engagement in video games. Its stunning graphics, compelling audio and illustrative story combine to create a transcendent medium experience. While its gameplay mechanics may not offer incredible innovation, the game\u2019s true power lies in its ability to resonate on a deeply personal level, giving players a cathartic and poignant journey of grief, healing and self-discovery that GRIS stands for a testament to the power of video games as an art form and indeed it is It is a must play for anyone looking for a transformative and emotionally rich experience.", "timestamp_created": 1686328354, "timestamp_updated": 1686328354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139775529": {"recommendationid": "139775529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151099217", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 284, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1686304845}, "language": "english", "review": "BEAUTIFUL game\nBEAUTIFUL story\nBEAUTIFUL women ;)) jk tehe\n\nGreat game fully recommend probably would go far enough to say its one of the pillars or at least one of the philosophers even i were to personalise it as gaming overall.", "timestamp_created": 1686304769, "timestamp_updated": 1686304769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139768147": {"recommendationid": "139768147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048350823", "num_games_owned": 715, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1686287388}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel like the odd one out leaving a negative review...But for $20, I can't recommend spending that much on maybe 3=4 hours of gameplay...especially when it's pretty much a walking simulator\n\nThe story is awesome but just watch a playthrough of it.

Finding this game was once again a matter dumb luck for me, and I'm sure glad to be lucky! I will try to divide this review into three parts: Art, Gameplay, and Music.\n\n\n[h1] The Art [/h1]\n\nThe first thing i noticed about Gris was the art. Everything is gorgeous, the backgrounds, the atmosphere, the characters; it stood out more than anything else. The use of colour in Gris is immeasurably beautiful in a way i've never seen before. Gris' (the character) design is great in so many ways; it is so simple yet so eye catching, and the way they use her dress for her powers is really clever and i enjoyed unlocking and using every single one! The animation is just as great. [b] Conrad Roset [/b] is the lead artist for Gris. His influence and style are clearly seen throughout, and it is magnificent. If you like his work, this game is for you!\n\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\n\nGris' gameplay as a platformer is pretty solid. There isn't much to say about it other than it's done well (but this is coming from someone who's never played platformers). The powers are well implemented and they never feel useless; i appreciate that even in the later stages they still make opportunities for Gris to use her less recent abilities. None of the powers are super strong or 'OP'. They all have their own uses and will come in handy no matter where you are (note this game does not have combat). The level design is good. I didn't find myself feeling stuck or lost, and i didn't do anything i wasn't intended to. Everything was done the right way.\n\n\n[h1] The Music [/h1]\n\nThe music of Gris is just as special as the art, and the two work perfectly together. Every single track is good (even the unused works!), and i cannot find the words to express just how stunning it is. All i can do is thank [b] Bernalist [/b] for making it, and recommend that [b] YOU [/b] buy the soundtrack.\n\n\n[h1] Extras, The Story, and me blabbering [/h1]\n\nI only played Gris when i felt like it, which for me was about once a month. The game is pretty short in length, so i advise that you play it infrequently; it isn't something you want to rush. Gris' story lacks dialogue completely, so everything is a guess and can be interpreted in many ways. What i believe it to be about i think is beautiful, for you it may be something different, either way, it is a very special experience. Once again i am blessed with a holy game that i frankly would've never found on my own, thank you, lord Cthulhu.\n\n[b] Thank you to everyone who worked on this wonderful game [/b]\n\n.......[b] and thank you!

Luckily, unlike others in its genre, it manages to remain engaging the whole way through, all while remaining true to its choices. \n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Review:[/b]\nAlthough no-one can argue that they don\u2019t look nice, in my opinion the formula for a genre I shall henceforth call the \u201cjourneylike\u201d is both overdone and in need of a change. Many of these games attempt a minimalist approach to gameplay, often giving you one button to press in a world where movement is otherwise your only option. Perhaps this is to encourage players to focus on experiencing the world, but to me this approach to \u201cgameplay\u201d often greatly overstays its welcome in games like Abzu or Journey. This is the reason I avoided GRIS for so long. \n\nAlthough GRIS is certainly cut from the same cloth as the aforementioned titles, at least in my eyes, it achieves so much more. You start the game out with a tiny array of seemingly pointless abilities, but the lengths this game goes to use every single aspect of each one is to be commended. This game actually has puzzles, and although not overly complex, they kept me interested. Even as a self-professed hater of platformers, the relevant sections of GRIS were excellent, fluid, and surprisingly clear given the game\u2019s art style. The secrets in this game are also so well hidden that they managed to keep me interested till long after the game had finished. \n\nIf GRIS had just been a \u201cjourneylike\u201d with more interesting gameplay, I would be happy, yet the title also artistically triumphs over its predecessors. The story told by GRIS is, at least to me, a lot more interesting than other games in its genre, even managing to use gameplay elements as metaphors on some occasions ([spoiler]I\u2019m willing to bet the eel symbolizes rape[/spoiler]). In a stroke of genius, GRIS even weaponizes its own minimalism to achieve its own artistic goals \u2013 the most obvious case being [spoiler]the slow gain in color and visual complexity mirroring the character\u2019s growth[/spoiler]. \n\nIndeed, there are remarkably few issues I have with GRIS, other than its obtuse menu navigation. Yet I still feel like this game is not yet the pinnacle of the \u201cjourneylike\u201d genre. Although GRIS was an enjoyable, and sometimes powerful experience, the game was lacking memorability. The art style sometimes feels too \u201cupmarket coffee shop\u201d, the music, while beautiful, is generic, and few of the puzzles felt truly innovative. Perhaps, like the logo designers for all too many multinationals, GRIS\u2019s pursuit of minimalism led to a purging of the qualities that might make it stand out more. GRIS is like a diamond polished to perfection: instead of retaining its character, it simply blends in with every other perfect diamond in the jewelry box. \n \n[h1]5/6[/h1]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/GentleHoovy/recommended/][b]More of my reviews here![/b][/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1685133724, "timestamp_updated": 1685133938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139026814": {"recommendationid": "139026814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970391856", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 589, "last_played": 1662652567}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game twice, my first playthrough was perfect. \nGame is telling its story without any words.\nWhether like this genre or not, please give it a shot for f*ck sake.\n\nAnd one note, there are no any boss fight in this game, just chill gameplay like walking simulator", "timestamp_created": 1685115575, "timestamp_updated": 1697300345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139026272": {"recommendationid": "139026272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836115988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1685114821}, "language": "english", "review": "i miss the little cube guy from the forest already", "timestamp_created": 1685114901, "timestamp_updated": 1685114901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139010014": {"recommendationid": "139010014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145926524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 680, "last_played": 1685186521}, "language": "english", "review": "love it", "timestamp_created": 1685093451, "timestamp_updated": 1685093451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139006603": {"recommendationid": "139006603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198829483823", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1685147844}, "language": "english", "review": "work of art", "timestamp_created": 1685087014, "timestamp_updated": 1685087014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638709664344787598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138972797": {"recommendationid": "138972797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218887999", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 392, "last_played": 1684728031}, "language": "english", "review": "It is an absolutely beautiful game.

Not only because of the unique art style of Conrad Roset or the goosebump-inducing music by Berlinist, but also in the way that it can make you feel so many emotions, without a single word being spoken in the game. The art and the music complement each other extremely well and are likely to make you feel deep emotions.\n\nThe best way I can describe this game is a platformer with light puzzle elements that plays as if you are watching an animated movie. You're guiding this young girl Gris through her grieving process and all phases of grief are unique zones in the world. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance are all stages in the game that you have to play through and it's beautifully done.

As the game progress, Gris unlocks different abilities that enhance the movement and add to the puzzles but it never gets very complex and the puzzles are easily solved and not challenging from the platforming aspect either. The movement feels ok, it can be a bit slow at times and the double jump is wonky. Another strange aspect of the gameplay is the water dash, for some reason, this ability feels off, it doesn\u2019t seem to have the proper momentum or weight to it and it feels weird to use. There are many seeming paths that can be taken but they all lead the same way, the game is very linear with little room for deviation or side things. There are some mementos that can be obtained with some little side puzzles but these aren\u2019t challenging either. There is basically no way to fail things in the game despite some sequences where it would make sense for this to be the case, this actually takes the player completely out of the game in one section as it is difficult to tell if what the player is doing is actually affecting the game at all.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe story is extremely minimal, it follows a girl(Gris) going through grief which has both literally and metaphorically drained the color from the world. Gris gains abilities as she restores color to the world and seeks to regain the ability to sing. There is no dialogue or text throughout the entire game and it is told through all pictures and some cutscenes, the problem is that non of this is very engaging, the game is essentially never played during the most important moments, the player will sit there and watch a cutscene of Gris doing something important. While this may work nicely in a short film, in a game it does not.\n\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe art style is gorgeous, it is a 2d painted style with great animation work. As more and more color comes into the game it becomes even more pretty to look at as the environments for the most part are well-designed and have unique looks and feels to them. Almost every aspect of the game's art could be used as a good background or art piece and it is clear a lot of passion and work went into making the game look as unique and great as it does. Everything in Gris's meticulously designed environment works well in telling the story, it\u2019s just a shame the story is so minimal and the gameplay is lacking.\n\n[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful and goes hand in hand with the art style. Many of the pieces are gorgeous and convey many emotions with them whether it be an overwhelming sense of sorrow, pervasive darkness, or an accepting joy. Each piece feels distinct and captures the game so well.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nGris is a very strange game, on the one hand, both the gameplay and the story are lacking and make for an unenjoyable game experience. On the other hand, the art and soundtrack create a beautiful piece to listen to and look at. As such the game doesn\u2019t work as a game.\n\n[h1] Score: 4/10 [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1684210717, "timestamp_updated": 1689624701, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138363617": {"recommendationid": "138363617", "author": {"steamid": "76561199445155522", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1700509891}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es, Excelente, una joyita verdaderamente, ame la est\u00e9tica y la banda sonora", "timestamp_created": 1684202493, "timestamp_updated": 1684202493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138359299": {"recommendationid": "138359299", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121983447", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1685216420}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very aesthetically beautiful and I love it.

It not only has a fantastic visual style but it also has a fun moveset, it's refusal to have any tutorials beyond educating you on what buttons correspond to which moves makes solving puzzles feel satisfying. Though frustrating at points, I never felt cheated - the keys to advancing from one stage to another feel justified, I never felt as if it were the game's fault when I wasn't able to solve something right away. It has quite the considerable length, I did not pay for this game but I feel I would've gotten my money's worth even with its price. For as linear as the game is, it does a great job at making you feel as if the world you inhibit is a lot bigger than it likely is, there's considerably no loading screens between stages and it all meshes seamlessly as one giant level. Adding to this vastness is the game cleverly relying on objects to prevent you from going out of bounds rather than cheap invisible walls. Having extra collectibles out of reach not only adds to the vastness but also makes this game ripe for replay value. It has fantastic animation that feels buttery smooth and satisfying to control, this is Nomada Studios' first array into video games and it was a great display of their talent as animators and graphic designers. It looks beautiful, but upon playing it's a lot more than that - I'd highly recommend this game to people already sold on the art style as well as people that are into puzzle platformers.\"\n- Reviewed by ScribbleTV", "timestamp_created": 1684129118, "timestamp_updated": 1684129118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138325337": {"recommendationid": "138325337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001939405", "num_games_owned": 2934, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1684126435}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an unabashed experience.

It took 4.9 hours, with only one initial (red baloon) \"stuck\" moment where I decided to start the game again. The game is so relaxing you will feel the music is playing inside you.\nGris seems to massage your solitude, it makes you smile. I smiled several times, not a sad or nostalgic smile, but an enthusiast happiness, and in a final part near the end it was like a crescendo a ladder of smile, so much I said, \"how much more is it going to surprise me, it always finds a new way to do that\".\n\nThis game is sincere art. When the pro get to it.\n\nI don't like to mention other games if this feels like an offense, I just do it as a suggestion and to make understand my perspectives to others and well, this is a \"beyond game\" as I call these type of masterpieces, and it goes along with HellBlade Senua's Sacrifice and I think also Never Alone. If you check what these games are, you will understand.\n\nBuy this game, gift this game, play it with someone else you love or to feel something together, talk about this unique \"beyond-game\".\n\nUse headphones and I suggest playing with a joypad.

The complexity behind everything is stunning.\nI recommend watching this YouTube video, it explains all those details very well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UD-aW2tpg\n\nBut speaking of the gameplay now: GRIS surely is a cozy game, a platformer that allows you to relax and dive into another world. At some points it might feel like a walking simulator, as there are some passages in which you are just running, but they don't last long enough to disturb your gaming experience, wanting to smash more buttons. While running you can also enjoy the view and it makes sense regarding the grief to have such passages. The jumping und puzzling parts don't come too short, don't worry about that. With each level you gain a new ability to get to new areas.\nWhile I was playing, I feared to miss out some parts, being the discoverer and achievement hunter I am, as I had to choose which way to go. That led to some missed collectibles, but after finishing the game you can select each chapter again to find them.

I highly recommend it. \nThe gameplay is decent with 2 or 3 standout moments. \n\nI have 2 problems with the game: \n1. The game doesn't explain anything to you outside of the level design, so figuring out the next destination and learning how certain abilities worked was a bit confusing/frustrating sometimes. \n2. There's a \"secret ending\" that you unlock by collecting all mementos. I didn't do that and sadly that ending gives a ton of context and basically explains core elements of the game. Since I didn't know about the secret ending and don't usually hunt down all collectibles, I was lucky to learn about it after finishing the game and looked it up on YT.\n\n[b]So if you play this, either make sure to collect all mementos or to watch the secret ending on YT once you finish the game.
