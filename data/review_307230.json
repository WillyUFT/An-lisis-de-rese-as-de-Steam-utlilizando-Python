Except for that speedrunning achievement, or the idea to preserve about every single zombie you create, to achieve more 'stars' per level completion.\n\nSo! It's very short, but also very cheap, and the basic idea of being a zombie in a top-down-view action puzzle game works just well in that small dose.

It was developed and published by Awesome Game Studios.\n\nIt has no story.\nGameplay is very underwhelming. Everything is about trial and error and there is little to no strategy involved. There is usually a single way to complete levels to get the higher grade \u2013 3 stars.\nIt is very frustrating to play more advanced levels. Every time you are shot you get slowed down and you usually end up dying. It really just comes down to memorization and timing 90% of the times. Stars are usually linked to your zombie army too \u2013 if you lose one or two more zombies during a level, you might as well restart the whole thing as you will not be able to 3-star it. It also does not help that sometimes zombies behave differently when attacking \u2013 sometimes you lose one, sometimes you lose no zombies, sometimes you cannot even tell what is happening. It is very messy.\n\nGraphics are charming, I guess. There is not much to it, really. It looks alright for kids.\n\nSoundtrack and sound effects are very basic and forgettable.\n\nIt has a level editor with very basic tools. It is fun for half a minute.\n\nI try not to be too harsh on games, I think. I went out of my way to get this because I thought I would enjoy it. I really did not. It feels lazy, gimmicky and just very boring. Do I think it is the worst game ever? No, of course not. It is just too unambitious.\nI think it is not worth your time no matter how desperate you are for entertainment. Stay away.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1617640873, "timestamp_updated": 1617640873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.365166008472442627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89455595": {"recommendationid": "89455595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353079261", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 286, "last_played": 1617027937}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sencillito y divertido.

I, Zombie has potential, but that gets ruined by it having frustrating level design, inconsistent AI, and just straight up unfair enemies. Said enemies can shoot from half-way across the map, have x-ray vision that can spot you through certain corners, and have powerful bullets that rip your legs clean off and slow you down to a crawl... so now you can't escape their rain of death either. Add to this that there's often 2+ of them camping an area at the same time.

It plays a lot like a web game, with clear inspiration drawn from games like Infectonator.\n\nThe basic mechanics of each puzzle require you to either turn everyone into a zombie, or turn a specific character into a zombie. You accomplish these tasks in two different ways. For the levels where you have to infect everyone, you will generally try to sneak up on easy targets to help build up your zombie army, before taking on the more difficult targets. There are a variety of tactics you can use, although you will quickly figure out the best strategies. You have loose control over your zombie army, but nothing like an RTS game would have. The second type of level, where you need to infect one specific person, has much harder enemies so you can\u2019t just build up an army to win. These are essentially stealth levels, where getting shot once usually means death. They aren\u2019t terrible, but the are definitely less fun than the normal levels. Some of them are frustratingly designed, requiring you to have almost perfect timing, but in general they are okay.\n\nVisually, the game is charming despite technically having \u201cbad\u201d graphics. You won\u2019t find high resolution pixel art or beautiful sprites, but the game has a consistent art style that works for the genre. It gives it a web game feel that some may dislike but overall, it looks solid.\n\nI, Zombie is a decent game with some relatively simple puzzles. It\u2019s great for those looking for a casual puzzle game that you can easily pick up and play. There isn\u2019t a huge amount of content, but if you try to get 3 stars on every level, you\u2019ll stretch out the length quote a bit. The low price makes it a lot easier to justify such a short game. Most people will be satisfied as long as they know what they are getting into ahead of time.\n\n6/10\n[quote]\nVisit our [url=https://www.mmmreviews.com]website[/url] for more in-depth reviews and recommendations\n[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1603576035, "timestamp_updated": 1603576035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558398604393005371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77675371": {"recommendationid": "77675371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152616399", "num_games_owned": 2839, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 111, "last_played": 1602892261}, "language": "english", "review": "Short puzzle game.

action strategy that is complex enough to make you try a level multiple times till you succeed, but easy enough that all levels can be passed without much grinding at all.  You are a zombie.  Your goal is to either reach a scientist who is building a secret weapon against zombies within a certain amount of time while avoiding all soldiers, or to eat all the living on a level such as scientists and guards.  The scientists are easy, they just run from you, the guards, they shoot back and if you get shot you slow down meaning that you will most likely get shot again until you die.  For every person you eat, they become a zombie as well, and they are expendable.  You add them to your army for the level and use them to your desire.  If you die, then you have to restart the level.\n\nYou can control your army by telling them to attack the nearest human, stay, or follow you.  This is very well used if you get the chance to coordinate where you come from one angle for a fight while the rest of your army goes in from another area.  Or, in some levels, you must control a zombie with commands, to get to where you are, maybe even eating a few people along the way to increase the size of your army, and eventually getting you out of a bind.\n\nI thought the game was fun, simple, but overall well done.  The sounds and graphics are all simple, nothing to rave about, but they work perfectly for this type of game.  In less than a five hours, I was able to get all achievements, and get 3 stars in all levels.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun distraction from your everyday gaming, give this a shot.

No, it just means don't expect anything giant or major, but at the same time I think some people don't realize this and are too hard on this game via reviews\n\nBut enough of that, let's break down what I, Zombie is\n\nI, Zombie is essentially what would occur if Infectonator and a puzzle game similar to, for example Chips Challenge, had a baby. The element of Infectonator being that you are the zombie in a puzzle game and need to infect/eliminate all the humans on the map to progress/move on, the Chips Challenge part being that each area is a fixated closed map that makes sure you focus on item and obstacle/structure placements and enemy placements in order to complete the puzzle with the most effective strategy or route, lastly is a TOUCH of Angry Birds, in the form of trying your best to not let any other zombies or yourself die whilst finding the best strategy to get 3 stars (no microtransaction bullshit tho, which is nice)\n\nAs a bonus, the nice part that this and Chips Challenge have in common is that steams workshop functionality allows you to play areas made by the community, which is a very nice touch\n\nDifficulty wise, first few puzzles are easy, but as one might expect, the puzzles later down the road and boss areas may have you stuck for a while and make you need to put your thinking cap on, and your only focus is to get through an area rather than 3 stars\n\nAs short as this review is, this bascially sums up I,Zombie in a nutshell, it isn't exactly the best game ever, but the amalgamations of two different well known games ends up producing something fun, and with this game being only 2 dollars, it may not be for everyone, but if you want a more puzzle approach to a zombie game where your the bad guy, then I Zombie is worth a purchase", "timestamp_created": 1535783628, "timestamp_updated": 1535783628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44311122": {"recommendationid": "44311122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120109043", "num_games_owned": 1304, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1440958250}, "language": "english", "review": "[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/nobody_move/]My Steam,just add me :)[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1534939991, "timestamp_updated": 1534939991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43704011": {"recommendationid": "43704011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153279406", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1532374654}, "language": "english", "review": "I know that I played this game for a VERY short amount of time.

It also means I had to [b]assume[/b] that I'd actually move where I planned or used an action when I'd wanted to and not airballed by holding the movement/action keys slightly too short/long.\n\nFor a puzzle game that (for some reason) seems like it's less about strategy and more about jumping soldiers within a [i]very[/i] specific time window so that you can [b]barely[/b] kill and convert them before they shoot you to death, input lag like this is a dealbreaker and sapped my interest in this game almost immediately.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nWhat otherwise could've been a decent, if short, diversion instead became an unplayable mess which led me to uninstall the game after less than 20 minutes.

Plus, when Infectonator 3 comes out on Steam sometime this year I will guarantee that compared to I, Zombie, that one will be longer, have more content, and actually work as intended.", "timestamp_created": 1515909031, "timestamp_updated": 1516189865, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39292934": {"recommendationid": "39292934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117674830", "num_games_owned": 2519, "num_reviews": 712, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1512040009}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1515797066, "timestamp_updated": 1515797066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196079015731812", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39266150": {"recommendationid": "39266150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379537503", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1515706411}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a horrible game... don't pay for it.. no upgrades, over powered enemies.. repetitive... there are 1000s of games on kongregate that are free and 100x more interesting and better than this.

As the Alpha Zombie, sneak your way into villages to turn its inhabitants into zombie followers.\n\n[h1]\u2699 [u]Game Description & Mechanics[/u] \u2699[/h1]\nYou control your main zombie and attack people by touching them, reducing their life bars to zero to turn them into zombies you can then direct to follow you, attack the closest target or remain put. Humans will usually run away when you're within sight, except for soldiers who will attack. The goal is to turn everyone into zombies with as little zombie casualties as possible.\n\nThere are 30 levels to go through, each with varying success levels (either timed or quantity of surviving zombies). You must remain out of sight of danger and time your attacks. Some will have special condition such as machine-gun wielding soldiers and specific human targets, others will have environmental benefits like snowmen to hide into, or dangers like automatic turrets.\n\n[h1]\u263a [u]What I enjoyed[/u] \u263a[/h1]\nIt's a great casual game with quick 1-screen levels, easy to hop in for a few levels when you only have time for a short play session. The game is easy to understand and learn, allowing you to determine in which order you wish to proceed. The challenge will be in reaching the 3-star rankings, which will become increasingly difficult to do, forcing you to figure the most optimal path.\n\nIncluded is a level editor for you to create your own puzzles. This is coupled with a home-made level sharing system through Steam Workshop. Custom levels can then be rated online by other players directly from within the game, allowing you to access the most popular ones without having to quit the game to use Steam. This adds a lot of replayability to the game.\n\nAesthetic-wise, the style is simple but likable. Zombies are childish-looking and bubbly eyed, adding to the cartoonish level design of houses and obstacles, occasional weather effect of rain for a small change of pace, with the later 10 levels being set in the winter to add variety.\n\n[h1]\u2639 [u]What bothered me[/u] \u2639[/h1]\nThis is an extremely short game, 30 levels averaging under a minute is nowhere near enough for a paid game. Heck, there even are achievements for completing the entire game within 23 minutes. It is obvious the developers relied too much on Steam Workshop for prolonged play, instead of coming up with a wider variety of obstacles and puzzles.\n\nEven though this was a PC and XBox release, the game design feels like one of those free mobile games, I was actually surprised to find out there doesn't seem to be an Android or iOS version of this game. This would've been a free Flash browser-based release if it had come out just a few years earlier.\n\n[h1][b]My Verdict[/b]: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 - [i]\"It's up to you.\"[/i][/h1]\n\n[i]I, Zombie[/i] is a small casual game, but there are many people who are looking for just that. While the puzzles weren't mind-bending, I can't deny I had a fun time playing it, short may that time have been. If the store page's screenshots caught your attention, you might enjoy it too!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n[i][b]This was just my opinion.[/b]\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CJsOpinions/]reviews[/url].[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1505007738, "timestamp_updated": 1523899307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675102293491363525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34787484": {"recommendationid": "34787484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035448788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1504754895}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably would be a better game on a tablet or smartphone.", "timestamp_created": 1504755157, "timestamp_updated": 1504755157, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34432743": {"recommendationid": "34432743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063725468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 152, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1501437659}, "language": "english", "review": "Gets old fast.

Yes my time clocked is not that much but I don't intend finishing a game that doesn't appeal to me. The genre is a zombie game which is to me a hit and miss because there are few zombie related things I like in general. Second, and the main reason, is that the level design aren't that interesting to me. They are pretty short, maybe taking half a minute maximum with pretty boring music. I'd rather have some spooky kind of music. There are community levels which you can turn to when the levels are finished. \n\nThe goal is pretty simple and direct, you have to eat everyone and how lesser zombie friends you let die the less stars you get. When you go near a human you start to eat them they turn into zombies which you can control by giving commands like follow, attack or stop. A losing condition is that when the zombie you play dies you have to redo the level. I think it may be better to then switch to another of your zombies in the field. There are also soldiers in the level trying to kill you when they hit a bullet they slow you. There is a little bit of health regen but it isn't that amazing. The thing I don't like about adding soldiers is that there is no way to counter them. I think they could introduce zombie vomit either disabling their weapon for x seconds, like two seconds, or slowing them on hit or do damage but won't take them over when you kill them with it. I also think it could be less overused when it drained hp if you used it.\n\nThis game is a good mobile game, a sort of puzzler with zombies but I don't think it's one of the best games out there for pc. This is not for me but it may be for you.

Bear with me, because I know it's a weird analogy, but one that holds surprisingly true.\n\nYou see, there's nothing majorly wrong with the game, there's just a steady increase of problems and frustrations that slowly gain momentum, until there grow so large you want to smash things with your keyboard. For one, collision detection on objects is extremely poor - especially considering the amount of times you're expected to get the jump on people around on corners. You'll start to rush forward, only for you to suddenly slam to an abrupt stop on an invisible wall, inevitably dying and having to start the whole charade over again seconds later.\n\nAnother irritant; enemy AI is dishearteningly ruthless and impossible to predict, even though you're expected to do that one ALL the time. Enemies can suddenly start shooting you from the furthest distances and tightest corners, usually leading to your demise. It's also incredibly hard to tell what distance you can stay away from a soldier before they do an instant 180 degree turn and open fire, even though logic dictates that in most situations they simply SHOULDN'T be able to see or detect you. In a game which is all about trying NOT to get spotted until the right moment, having the parameters of when you will be or not as ill-defined as this understandably leads to much hair pulling. \n\nThere's far more tiny things around just to bug you... Turrets are the biggest threat on the levels they appear, but aren't clearly noticeable and blend into the scenery far too much. Another problem - a few levels in, you're suddenly told to avoid the guards completely, only for confusion to reign as the next level returns things to normal with no warning. Such levels make a return again once or twice throughout the game, with very little warning, meaning knowing what you're actually meant to be doing can easily be misinterpreted. \n\nThe level editor is a nice idea, but as far as I can tell there's literally NO way of deleting items you're already placed (Maybe I'm being dim, but since the game doesn't tell you the controls for this mode it'd be annoying either way), and the community level filter just acted haywire every time I tried to use it. There's also very, VERY few good levels actually made for you to play, but since the community for this game is logically going to be tiny, I'll let that one slide.  \n\nAll in all, I just got increasingly annoyed the more I played, up until yet another cheap death made me turn away and not think of turning back. It's a shame, because the concept of slowly building up a zombie army to finally swarm the last well-fortified survivors of a level was appealing to me.

The controls are incredibly floaty, it's like walking on an entire world of ice. Plus, the controls are very imprecise. I end up missing my mark 9 times out of 10. I only got to level 5 before I got fed up with the controls. Speaking of levels, the game is built and runs like an app. Though, a touch screen would probably be more responsive than this. It has a 3 star system, and a total of 30 levels. The interface is also very app-like. The menus look like I should be seeing it on my iPad. Most of my complaints have to do with controls. You get stuck on things, you can't get where you need to be in the time you need, and it's just over-all aggrivating.\nI can't personally recommend this game, but I would say if you're willing to take the chance, to give it a try.

The fact that soldier's shooting and your bitting are animated within same time frame is annoying as hell as no matter that you stepped on the soldier in between his shots, you're still bitting the same speed and moment when he's shooting, which leads to so much moments of you dying the same moment soldier got changed it's beyond depresive.", "timestamp_created": 1464519609, "timestamp_updated": 1483889347, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553878188133239746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23131948": {"recommendationid": "23131948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030065710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1458019755}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it.", "timestamp_created": 1463900665, "timestamp_updated": 1463900665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23089723": {"recommendationid": "23089723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154428178", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1561991650}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy 100% achievement blayts", "timestamp_created": 1463702050, "timestamp_updated": 1463702050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23033115": {"recommendationid": "23033115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029815457", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1442893278}, "language": "english", "review": "It's okay, but remember you get what you pay for.", "timestamp_created": 1463465605, "timestamp_updated": 1463465605, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488197416067123413", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23026264": {"recommendationid": "23026264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013014730", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1519684739}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little game!

A game for casual gamers, where you can control your very own army of Zombies and cause havoc? I am game!\n\nSo, you have your very own little zombie and you are given your first tutorial mission. This mission is just to be sure that you know how to use the directional keys and understand the basic concept that if you are a zombie and try to close to an unarmed human, they will run from you. And if for some reason you manage to stand just long enough next to them, well.... yey, you just made a new zombie friend.\n\nAfter the tutorial and the first couple of levels, you realise what I,Zombie will be all about -  a combination of a stealth / puzzler game, with a brief touch of RTS. All in all, it is a relatively short game, with only 20 levels. However, level design is solid. It has a nice learning curve and level difficulty increases gradually.\n\nThe soundtrack, in its never ending loop combines well with I,Zombie , and the visuals are quite nice for this little game. I particularly like the main zombie design, as it sort of reminds me a Tim Burton meets Simpsons combination. Oh well, Danny Elfman had already set that link before, so perhaps that concept isn't so far fetched.\n\n\nIn short, these are the things I can point out as positive in I,Zombie - The concept, level design, the soundtrack and the main little zombie. Seems like we are heading for a masterpiece!\n\nNow the painful bit....\n\nThe first thing I have noticed after initial seconds of gameplay was that there controls weren't very responsive. There seems to be a lag between hitting a button and the character acting on it, and it becomes incredibly frustrating playing throughout levels of stealth without really knowing where your character's movement will end. I came to realise that as you lower the resolution, I,Zombie will run faster and the commands will become more responsive... but at this point I have started questioning myself if I it was fair to expect having fluidity issues with a Unity based game. However, lowering the resolution will reduce the game window, and if you fall lower than 800 x 600, I would recommend that you play it through with the aid of a magnifying glass.\n\nApart from unresponsive controls, I have often struggled with basic movement. More often than not, my little Zombie would get stuck on the edge of a box or some other obstacle, without being very clear why. \n\nThe combination of broken controls with some movement issues turned almost every level into a trial an error experience. And whereas in the first couple of levels I was still going for the 3 stars rating, the frustration soon took over me and my main goal became powering through the 20 levels I,Zombie had to offer.\n\nEventually I had another go in reaching max stars and beating I,Zombie in less than 15 minutes, in order to complete the achievements. Unfortunately this ended up as another disappointment, as for some reason they still appear as \"incomplete\"\n\nApart from the nice basic visuals, I,Zombie also had a couple of graphic glitches as the constant flickering of white lines all over the place or the glitchy rain effects (which seem completely unnecessary and don't bring any added value to the game).\n\nTo sum up, it is a nice game, with a nice concept and ideas and solid map building. However, the several flaws it has turn what should be an enjoyable game into a frustrating experience. At some point you have to wonder if the fact it is so short is actually a thing for it or against it. \n\nHowever, I do think that the price is fair an is often on steam sales. If you are curious, by all means get it, but don't expect a masterpiece.\n\nNote to the developers: I am quite sure you have put quite an effort into it, please don't see my review as just someone taking a shot at you.

We've seen Blaine commit no small number of horrific acts, yet Anders continues to make the zombie likable. Charming, even. He tortured Major but did so with such swagger and confidence that it didn't feel like torture. Yet, it was still apparent Major was in real danger. It takes skill from the writers and Anders to make Blaine's personality believable without getting ridiculous, and they've pulled it off all season.\n\nBlaine's and Major's arcs stole the season finale. Especially Major. His development has taken the most surprising course over the season, and I'm nothing but impressed with how they transformed the quiet, super nice guy into a zombie killer. It's not an easy change to make believable, but they dug in around the edges just the right amount before plunging the shovel in and sold it. Major even committed to his mission and went back to Meat Cute when he could have ran away. Again, I was caught off guard because he didn't hold back (the choice of music for the sequence, After the Fire's version of \"Der Kommissar\", was spot on). Him being unaware was disappointing though -- it was awfully convenient for him not to notice Blaine.\n\nBut, the arc wrapped up well for both characters and in unexpected ways. Liv giving Blaine the cure rather than killing him was a relief because it's way too soon for Anders to leave the show, and Liv turning Major back (hopefully) was a compassionate turn. The balance of the ways she used the two doses of the cure -- with hate and with love -- was a wonderful touch. This was the most emotional we've seen her. It makes sense. Things have only gone downhill since Lowell died. She's wrecked and by the time she got to talk to Major after she turned him, you could practically see her heart on her sleeve.

This looks to be an almost decent excuse for the game, made for either tablets or consoles, that was directly ported to PC, with no time whatsoever to change anything.  Literally, there is zero mouse function for this game.  I have not in my entire life since I played games on a Tandy not been able to use the mouse in gaming.  You will navigate the main menu & game with only the keyboard.  But as for the game itself...\n\nThe cheeky little intro video has IMO, the best thing about this game, the music.  I am not sure if it was done by the person whom made the game itself, but whoever did, if I was ever interested in working on a game with them, this would be the only area I would like to recruit them for.  The music is absolutely great, it is catchy, although repetitive, you don't get tired of playing it, though the short levels you'll be going through.  Oh, yes btw, every single level in the game is extremely short.\n\nBecause, after about 3-4 of the stupidly simple first few, you'll start to run into the problems of gameplay here.  Your zombie will quite easily get stuck on walls.  As in, NES times levels, stuck on walls.  This game is merciless in allowing you to make mistakes.  Generally getting stuck on a wall, or making a single mistake at the wrong time will cost you your one and only life, and then you restart the entire level.  Now, some of these levels do have some interesting ways you must finish them, so there is a slight bit of entertainment in the figuring out of how to sneak past the guards, and get to the unarmed civilians, which if you can manage to do, you can walk your zombie over to them, their health bars drop, and they become generic zombies under your control.  Now you may very roughly control them with essentially 3 commands: Stay in one place, follow me, go towards the nearest enemy head on and attack it.  These controls are barely good enough to bypass the levels if you are extremely patient, skilled & have a good sense of timing.\n\nSpeaking of patience, however, this game has even run mine out.  I have the patience of a Hindu fucking goat high on mushrooms and weed + Jesus Christ, but this fucking game...let's talk about the final level I am on.  I have looked up a video of how to beat it.  I have seen the man in the video able to do it, but he even had to stop his video, play the game for God knows how long, and come back to it once he had figured it out.  In the game the only enemies, are regular green soldiers, and special forces soldiers.  Now, green soldiers will shoot a single bullet at you, that if it hits, will both damage you, and slow you down.  (Who knew zombies had nervous systems, and were affected by things like getting shot.)  These soldiers after a few missions, aren't too difficult to deal with, as if you get to them, like normal civilians, if you damage them enough you can kill & convert them.  The special forces on the other hand, are a totally different thing.  They not only are armed with machine guns, which will spell almost guaranteed death if they hit you with even one bullet, but they are COMPLETELY FUCKING IMMUNE TO DAMAGE.  That's right!  You could walk up to them, and stand there all day long, with some sort of invincibility cheat/God mode turned on, and they will never die.  They are immortal enemies.  Frankly, this is a total bullshit game mechanic.  It would have been like, having to fight Starman in Super Maro Bros.\n\nIn closing, I do not recommend this game, would not recommend this game, ever.  If anything, a soundtrack to this game should be sold, and the game itself taken off the market.  I bought it for 54 cents, and would not pay one for it now, or even DL it if it were free having played it.\n\nI'd give this game 4/10, giving 3 points for the great music, and 1 point for the little bit of fun had while playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1437656962, "timestamp_updated": 1437657425, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17149802": {"recommendationid": "17149802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063465895", "num_games_owned": 1401, "num_reviews": 415, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1461685269}, "language": "english", "review": "Criminal.

I used to play between breaks at school, do 1 level here, 1 level there. I have to say that this is an extremely rewarding game to play. It causes you to think about all of your actions and strategize about the best and fastest ways to beat the levels. A few goods and a few not so goods to round out this review:\n\nGood:\n- Rewarding Gameplay: Easily the most notable feature. The levels are set up in such a way that it rewards you for your patience and strategy. (or for speed runs: SPEED)\n- Leaderboards: Though just about everyone has gotten perfect stars on every level in this game, it then challenges you to see how fast of a speed run you can do to beat the levels.\n- Challenging enough: The levels are challenging enough that you may get stuck on some for a bit, but they are never impossible, as long as you try to formulate some sort of strategy.\n\nNot So Good:\nShort: It's such a short game. I think I have 3 hours logged onto the game and I've completed it with all the achievements. That's not to say that this should deter you at all. It's a short game, but a really great game.\nSemi-linear completion: Some of the levels are constructed in such a way that you have to comply to the level's mechanics to beat the level, meaning that on some levels, you may be able to have a few different choices of where to go to add to your zombie family first, while some, you will have to follow a set standard of how you beat the level. It's not terrible, but I think it would feel even better to have some more choices. Having said that, it doesn't take away from the gameplay.\n\nThat's really it! It's innovative and fun with really negligible shortcomings. I would definitely recommend this game.

So the game is actually pretty fun- you play as the zombie and your mission is to eat every human and turn them into walkers, like yourself. The levels are designed to make you think and plan strategically- something that I didn't think the game would offer. I, Zombie NORMALLY doesn't have you blazing in, chomping off everyone's face, no, I, Zombie forces you to plan out moves and command your squad of walkers (if you have any) to get the job done. So yes, if you do end up infecting any other humans, they will turn into zombies and you can command them to do things such as stop, attack, or follow you. \n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\nSo even though this game isn't THAT old, it still looks pretty bad, if i do say so myself. Even at the highest resolution I can go (1440 x 900) the game will still look pretty shitty and the game will be out of proportion with my monitor (meaning that there are those nasty black lines on the outer edges of the screen). If you're going to buy this for graphics, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SAVE YOUR MONEY.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nLots of gameplay aspects were mentioned in the review up top, so I'll recap.\n- Commanding your walker squad\n- Planning out your moves\n- Infecting guards/pedestrians to then infect others\nOverall, gameplay mechanics are very smooth and effective. Nothing really seems overpowered.\n\n[u]Soundtrack[/u]\nVery generic, nothing like death metal. It makes the game feel light, nimble, and fast. It made the game seem less violent then it actually should seem like. The soundtrack makes me feel like the game is rated E10.\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\nBuy it- it's lots of fun and not really violent. Get it while it's on sale because it's seemingly on sale a lot and even then, the game only costs $1.99 on a regular day. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1431961421, "timestamp_updated": 1431961421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15881083": {"recommendationid": "15881083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053425906", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1431918093}, "language": "english", "review": "Great concept, with great character.

Early levels are pretty straightforward, the later levels tend to require a bit more planning of where to go and when, plus along the way there are a few tips and tricks you can pick up of how to manage your fellow zombies.\n\nYour resources for each level are yourself - faster than the rest, and you control yourself directly with the cursor keys (or probably gamepad, haven't tried and the keys worked fine for me), and the zombies you have turned in the level so far which can be set to follow you, stay where they are, or attack the nearest non-zombie. Once you learn how to manage your brethren they can be used as a shield to cover your approach to a patrolling soldier, a distraction to let you get in closer before being shot at, or set up to attack the other of a pair of patrolling soldiers that are too far apart to just rush from one side. Your comrades can be a bit annoying and snag on the scenery occasionally, and they are really annoying to try and get past the sentry guns intact when a level requires that, but apart from those things the game plays pretty smoothly.\n\nOnce you have completed a level and survived you can move onto the next level, or replay it and try to find a way to complete the level without any zombies dying in the process, thus earning three stars. There are twenty levels (plus a training mission) to work through, and particularly the last half of them tend to be interesting and may take a while to figure out a good plan of attack, or get the timing right. Once that is done there is also potentially a bit of replayability trying to find a faster route to win each level, but beyond that it is not really the sort of game you will go back to again, as once you know how to do each level there isn't much more to gain from it.

I cannot dissagree with this statement. This zombie game is very unique, as you are a zombie (lets call him BOB), and your goal is to infect all the zombies on the level as possible, only infecting them all will result in completion. However, you need to be very stratigic in this game, as loosing a single zombie may be the difference between getting 1 star, 2 star, or even 3 stars! Time to complete the level may also result in how many stars you get, some level (3?) have stars set to how much time you take to complete it, this may also be a very stratigicly difficult part of the game: one of the achievements of this game is to complete the entire game in less that 15 minutes. So replaying levels over and over to get the lowest time possible will likely happen. Despite many achievements being hard to difficult to get, this game is still easy enough to add to your 100% group. In addition, some cons come with the game, mainly being the length of the game, with 21 levels (including a mini-tutorial), it is short. Nevertheless, the game is only $1.99, and it is frequently on sale, and if it not on sale many coupons for the game from 50% to even 90% are flying around steam. \n\n79/100 Bananas", "timestamp_created": 1427233242, "timestamp_updated": 1427233242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15018801": {"recommendationid": "15018801", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972911511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1425460288}, "language": "english", "review": "this game was not what i expected", "timestamp_created": 1427109933, "timestamp_updated": 1427109933, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14899249": {"recommendationid": "14899249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185338805", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1426413653}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego! para cuando quieres pasar el rato.", "timestamp_created": 1426413523, "timestamp_updated": 1426413523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14838235": {"recommendationid": "14838235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040975292", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1426087570}, "language": "english", "review": ">Bought game for 0.20 eur thanks to 90% discount\n>Starts playing game\n>\"Heh, this is alright I guess\"\n>Gets to level 3\n>Rage quits after many attempts\n>Gets 3 steam cards which each costs 14 cents\n>Sells them\n>I got payed 18 cents for letting a game run during half an hour\n>18/10.

If they run, and has reached the end of the wall. Human character can not run nowhere else, just ran to the side and also it is very slow to run away from us, so the difficulty is reduced in this game.\nSo if the game is recommended for you?

Additionally, I have so far always felt that my death had been caused by me and not some flaw in the game (despite the controls, more on that...); when you die it makes you go \"Shoot, I could have done that better\".\n\nThe only \"flaw\" (not a big deal really), if I could consider it such would be the aforementioned controls. In this game, moving around is done with the arrow keys and your 3 actions are done with 'a', 's', and 'd', this being the only configuration; no changeable bindings. The only issue I have with this is that my more nimble fingers are stuck with the job of triggering actions rather than moving. I have not found any cfg or txt files containing the bindings. The game was created using XNA Game Studio Express so I suspect that the controls are probably hidden deep within some of the .XNB binaries scattered about the game directory.

Rather than an all out assault much of I, Zombie is about positioning and sneak attacks as enemies have a limited field of vision but can still kill you quickly if they spot you far away. I loved getting the drop on patrolling guards and seeing my numbers grow, maneuvering my horde with a limited but effective number of commands as I infected every moving thing in the level. I, Zombie's biggest problem, again, is that it takes this mechanic and tries to do too much too quickly.\n\nWith only 20 very short levels (usually under two minutes if you do things right) there's very little time for the game to capitalize on its mechanics, peppering in different ideas throughout without giving them enough attention. It keeps the hour long experience varied, but I never felt as if the level designs were making much use of the enjoying ideas the game presents, merely showing some basic examples of how they work so you know how to use them before the difficulty catapults upward. Many of the later levels require infuriating amounts of precision to complete, often requiring you to follow an absolute line to get through them, and any deviation resulting in your very quick death. The final level in particular is such a poorly designed embodiment of trial and error that I ended up having to resort to watching a level walkthrough, and even then still had a great amount of trouble actually pulling it off.\n\nI, Zombie is entertaining for what it is, but more often than not its attempts to make more interesting use of its mechanics is simply by raising the challenge in cheap and frustrating ways.
