What I'm talking about here is mostly the gameplay and the scariness of the game. The game itself is not that scary; to be honest, the game pace feels way too slow for me to feel anything was happening. The gameplay is mostly the same as any other modern horror (walking simulators, roller coasters), but due to the problem I mentioned before about the game's pace, the gameplay feels even more bland. Other games in the modern horror genre often have a puzzle to keep your brain active, but this game, from what I remember from my last session of playing, didn't have any puzzle at all, which didn't help with the slow pace of the game. However, I do like the lore that is being presented here; it is quite interesting.\nBut despite this criticism, I really do think the team who worked on it has the potential to make a great game in the future, as this is a great first project. So I wish for the best for the developer to continue working on their next project, whether it is Hololive-related or not. and I also would like them to try another horror project in the future, as I personally will be looking forward to it.\n\nI will mark this review as recommend, but my stance is more like a mixed review.", "timestamp_created": 1691658953, "timestamp_updated": 1691658953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532018363475799561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143728215": {"recommendationid": "143728215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839201256", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1691599623}, "language": "english", "review": "No/Less jumpscare.

So there may well be references in this game that flew over my head. However, I played it because I enjoy a good horror game, and I definitely recommend it. I'll give a link to my playthrough on Youtube below for anyone who wants to see a sample of gameplay, but to give some thoughts...\n\nThe visuals are smooth and work well for the general tone of the game. The sound design is fine, and the game did have an atmosphere that kept me engaged. Overall it was only a short experience (you can probably reach your first ending in around 1 hour or so), but that's fine by me - sometimes it's better for a game to keep things short and snappy rather than overstay its welcome. Speaking of endings, there are three of them in total, though you may need to consult guides in order to work out what steps are needed to find them.\n\nAs for the story, it isn't served to you on a plate; there are different threads that the player is left (to an extent) to weave together. Pretty standard fare in many horror games, I'd say - so nothing wrong with it. Where the Hololive aspect comes in is that the characters in the game are played by Hololive Vtubers. As far as I can tell, despite my earlier point about there potentially being references that might have gone right over my head, I don't think it matters whether you're a big Hololive fan or not - you can still follow the game's story regardless.\n\nNot much else for me to say other than I definitely recommend it!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2pdNLbJH1w&list=PL05Yc3_TEBpMtkJvTVG53YypsSDa9Yh8p", "timestamp_created": 1676457174, "timestamp_updated": 1676457174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644965231418609619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132776193": {"recommendationid": "132776193", "author": {"steamid": "76561199217257528", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 134, "last_played": 1676295273}, "language": "english", "review": "Da girl going spooderman scared me the most", "timestamp_created": 1676298840, "timestamp_updated": 1676298840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132348951": {"recommendationid": "132348951", "author": {"steamid": "76561199106743115", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1675877719}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta decente con suerte asusta aunque muy poco PERO aun haci esta para pasar un poco el rato y al menos no esta caro deah xD", "timestamp_created": 1675736271, "timestamp_updated": 1675736271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132169275": {"recommendationid": "132169275", "author": {"steamid": "76561199210222439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1695539589}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game and horror atmosphere.

This game is almost linear with 3 endings effected only by adjustments to how you progress, similarly to other Japanese horror games. The story hardly tells itself and exists alongside the original mini series from YouTube. It's not a re-telling of the series, but rather it's your player character getting swept up in the events of the mini-series by accident while investigating it. \n\nThe inability to sprint makes the game a painfully slow journey and there are some moments of the game that lag and lower the FPS to below 10. This includes the cutscene of the true ending. Only a beefy super computer seems to be able to run it lag free. (My machine may not be top of the line anymore but it's still good enough to run most high end games at max settings at 60FPS.) The game didn't do well scaring me much but it did nail the creepy atmosphere, especially early into the game.\n\nYou might be wondering how I can still recommend this, even to a niche group, with the problems I've listed. The reason for that is simply the fact that the game accomplishes what it sets out to do. It gives you a relatively enjoyable experience with Some of the Hololive talents you love, mostly Sora, that exists along side the popular horror mini-series they produced on YouTube.

Was I scared playing through the game the first time? Yes, but I'm also a wimp so that doesn't say much. It was mostly an atmosphere thing in the beginning, along with a few good jumpscares. There wasn't much tension building for the rest of the game.\n\nThe game is locked to 60 fps, but even on a 3080 it would start dropping down into the 40s and even as low as 15 fps when there were more than one character model on screen.\n\nThe artstyle is confusing. It seems to go for a 3d anime style, but doesn't seem to be able to decide whether it should be stylized or not. There are also a lot of cases where models are clipping through each other, low resolution textures or shadows, etc.\n\nThe gameplay is very basic. It's a walking simulator with a few collectibles. Emphasis on few. No puzzles or anything other than walking forward is needed to progress. \n\nThe story is confusing with no resolution. At almost no point do you get any sort of explanation of who anyone is or what they are doing there. The setting also doesn't make a ton of sense, as it's supposed to be a ghost town but has a multi-floored high school and a hotel?\n\nThere are multiple endings, but none of them explain what is happening in the game. When you get to the end, the title screen updates with a link to their animated series of Hololive Error. That series has an actual story, although it seems almost loosely based on the game rather than a companion piece.\n\nIf playing a game and seeing your Oshi on screen makes you happy, go ahead and buy it.

(Although some of them are funny)\n- A combination between Chillia\u2019s Art game (Although it\u2019s inspired), Silent Hill, and Fatal Frame.\n- Jumpscare is alright.\n\nCons\n\n- Bugs and glitches occurred sometimes.\n- Ragdolls are being weird.\n- Lighting on the flashlight doesn't seem accurate and not bright.\n\nNote: Even though there's already some patches, there's still a lot of things that need to be fixed.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall the game is great but it would be nice if they polished it more for better experience. Regardless, I really like it and I would recommend it for those who like Japanese school genre, horror stories, and especially Hololive simp.\n\nMy final score for this game is 8/10.

course, Japanese style horror elements. The entire atmosphere is overall pretty creepy and the sounds and music play a pretty decent roll in the atmosphere as well. Wear headphones when you play as well since there are a lot spatial sounds to immerse your experience. \n\nThe game is semi short with my first ending coming in at around 45min. The game could use some optimization, mostly in the graphics and some UI options as well as character animations. Be sure to select your language on the main menu, this only affects the text.\n\nI'm not really a fan of horror games, but it is from Hololive, so I gave it a go. I personally think it is a decent game overall, obviously not the best on the market, but it plays well and lands the horror aspect. There isn't any jump scares as everything is all mostly suspense and build up with a chilling payoff. \n\nThe talents also voice their respective characters and clicking on their names in the credits will take you to their specific Youtube channels.\n\nMy view is pretty biased though considering it is Hololive.

I don't know if they're planning on adding further content to this game, but if not, I would say the price is probably more like $5 worthy than $10. This is only a 3 hour experience, and thats if [spoiler] you go after the other endings [/spoiler]. The animations and art are relatively nice. I came across a bug where I fell through the floor at one point, and had to restart, but it's not that big of a setback thanks to the chapter select. Even though I play on a high-end PC, the levels, [spoiler] the shrine in particular [/spoiler] lag pretty badly for about 10 to 20 seconds at the beginning of the level. That's nitpicky though, overall this is a fun experience for Hololive fans and I recommend it.
