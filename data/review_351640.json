There are three, the canon one is the third, as it leads into the second game.\n\nNow as for the mechanics, they are pretty simple but effective. There is a steady progression, with crafting and all. As for the battle system itself, it steadily unfolds with plot reasons being how Senia learns her skills. Basically, everything has something to do with the story. It isn't a long game, and that is fine. The devs set out for what they wanted to do, and they nailed every part.\n\nFor those wondering on the second game. I highly recommend it.

After all, it was free and basically forced onto me. My parents were happy to see the back of the bloody thing too. Now imagine our shock when the crowd around us parts slightly, turns their heads, and our starts a slight murmur. We turn to see where these sheeple are facing and imagine our shock when we see a skinny methed up fellar rushing his way through the crowd, into the open road, stopping cars, and diving to grab the balloon. To our horror, he then ran up to us from afar with the balloon in his methy clutches. The superman type figure went ahead and handed me the balloon and the crowd around us gave him a half-hearted clap. Meanwhile my family and I are horrified as this man dove into traffic for a piece of plastic blown up with some poor losers lung air. Anyway I think I let go of it again 10 minutes later lol I didnt even want it anyway. \n\nWrist effin hurts g(od) damn \n\nI apologise for this review. It was poor, frothy, just shit really. Kind of feeling a little ashamed of it, idk, like the anecdote was a true story and I guess interesting but it was just dead weight of a review in total honestly. Probably gonna knock this whole review thing on the head. Now i'm just reviewing games I havent even played? Nay, heard of? Idk I just feel kinda sick. Genuinely just boring too, like actually pathetic. I have family that might read these, what the F word are they going to think of me? Actually stick to my stomach.\n\nGoing offline for a while.

The combat is very well done and the bosses are really creative, in both gameplay and design (seriously, they look great)! ...and the bosses are hard as nails on hard mode.\n\nThe OST is also super catchy and contains some really chill songs. Could definitely see myself listening to the OST outside of the game. Annnnnnnnd the story is super compelling! Ending 2 is honestly one of the darkest endings to a game I've seen from memory, damn. \n\nAll in all, a SUPER well made game! It's not everyday you see a free Steam game live up to this kinda quality. Solid 8/10 from me. Only complaint really is the wonky translation at times, but my tolerance for that kinda thing is pretty decent, so it doesn't bother me too much. \n\nMIGHT play the mobile sequel at some point, but not too sure... went to look up gameplay after finishing this and boooooy does it look rough in comparison.

In the beginning you just run into enemies to deal damage to them (and take some damage in return) but by the end you have a handful of abilities you need to use to take enemies out quickly enough while dodging AoE attacks. The bosses are very well designed to have a certain rhythm to them. Other than that there is a simple process of collecting materials to upgrade weapons and armour. It\u2019s complex enough that it feels fulfilling while not being too much of a chore. \n\nThe plot is\u2026 ok. You\u2019re going through levels of a tower (dungeon) to find your sister. A surprisingly decent background is revealed through flashbacks, but it\u2019s nothing too deep. The worst part of the game, in my opinion, is the dialog. I think the designer is Taiwanese so English might not be his first language. But beyond that, the dialog just seems like a first draft. Lots of \u201cEh?!\u201d, \u201c\u2026\u201d, and most annoying, simply \u201c!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s about 4 or 5 hours to finish, depending on how much you grind. The last two boss battles took me a few attempts. They were surprisingly challenging, but satisfying to beat because it was my own skill not my character\u2019s stats that was needed for victory. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for an old-school RPG feeling that is simple enough to pick up for a few hours and still feel like you\u2019re making good progression and getting powerful, I  would recommend this.", "timestamp_created": 1677646092, "timestamp_updated": 1677646092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551569521427154541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133384764": {"recommendationid": "133384764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398977881", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1678460418}, "language": "english", "review": "firstly gameplay hours much greater than what is shown. the game has a good 5 hours of entertainment for anyone looking for a short but enjoyable game. the gameplay is lacking and that may detract from the game for some but it didnt bother me all that much personally. while gameplay could be an issue the music/sound track and story of the game is amazing and very heart felt. short but get under your skin with its powerful story and well set up music for the emotional moments. the game is free so it wont cost you to try it out but i really do reccomend it for anyone looking for a fun heartfelt game. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1677105633, "timestamp_updated": 1677105633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133313802": {"recommendationid": "133313802", "author": {"steamid": "76561199010510684", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1664820371}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game", "timestamp_created": 1677012554, "timestamp_updated": 1677012554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133275890": {"recommendationid": "133275890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879033066", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1552184250}, "language": "english", "review": "ive played this game multiple times on random free accounts before i was old enough to buy games, and its still really good! i liked the story a lot :)", "timestamp_created": 1676957026, "timestamp_updated": 1676957026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133275597": {"recommendationid": "133275597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981792164", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1677742782}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally, a new type of RPGM game that I now wish more of 'em existed.", "timestamp_created": 1676956526, "timestamp_updated": 1676956526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133016884": {"recommendationid": "133016884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089276178", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 582, "last_played": 1676621186}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE SENIA!!!

At the end of the game, you can get something good for having synthesised everything to that point to legendary, but if you forgot something, it's either give it up or restart from the beginning.\n\n2) The ending is not really an ending, so much as it is a \"to be continued\", no matter which ending you go for. They want you to grab the sequel, which in of itself is fine, except the sequel is an entirely different game. It's not a simple JRPG, it's a button-mash clicker mobile game that forces you to grind quite a lot, as all mobile games do. If that's cool with you, dive right in.

Rate: 06\\10\n\nSo you're looking at reviews trying to see if this game is something you may enjoy? well you have came to the right place. Let me have a moment of your time and you can read my experience about how i felt as i played through this game and then you can compare with other players to gather all the information you need to make your choice.\n\nI will separate my experience into categories to give you the best look at what playing the game may look like.\n\n(NO SPOILERS)\n\nFirst impressions - My original feelings about the game were quite all over the place, being that my only experience with a game like this is Dragon Quest nine on the old Nintendo. That being said i thought i would try it out and see how i would feel as i have not played a game like this in some time.\n\nStory - The story is quite average when compared with most other games on the market, you learn more of what led you to where you are the more you play through the game rather than it being a present story which i did find underwhelming if i am honest. I found that i did not have much care for the story until the ending where the game did invoke some emotion in me and that i am pleased with but other than that i found the story to be tiring.\n\nGame-play - The game play was put at a disadvantage i think as it does not have a full-screen mode in the game or at least mine did not meaning my enjoyment was not what it could have been and made the game feel less immersive. The combat felt very satisfying in some parts and the movement at a nice speed. When the game makes you fight a clearly stronger enemy than the grunts you did to get to that point, it seemed it happened too often which seemed quite repetitive and left the battle feeling less intense but i do commend them for having a difficulty changer before you do start battling and the save feature is placed in good locations and is easy to use. I will mention what i previously stated in the story is that you already know your mission from the start meaning everything in-between felt like a long journey, personally that is not to my taste but i understand other players do enjoy that way of playing.\n\nCharacters- The main characters i do like and feel they are made well, they have their own personalities and their own priorities meaning you get to know them more as real people. You can understand the way they think and why they think those things, the same cannot be said for any other characters i am afraid, in my opinion they felt quite lifeless and empty. You do not learn much about them and understanding them is practically impossible. You may learn what they do or how they may help you but besides from that i feel the only two fleshed out characters are the protagonists.\n\nArt design - The design of pictures and the game itself are nice and look polished, i felt the colours went along with whatever moment setting i was in. The picture design i can't say is to my liking due to the fact i am very specific when it comes down to something like that.\n\nControls - The movement controls are standard and easy to use just like your crafting control, interacting and cancel controls but he combat controls do feel a tad straining and i got them mixed up at points. I would often not use one or two attacks to keep it simple but this could be my lack of experience in this type of game.\n\nMusic - The music suits the game, i must admit i did not pay much mind to it but in some scenes i did and felt it was just right and pretty at times. It never felt out of place or over-bearing so i liked it and thought it added feeling to the atmosphere.\n\nReplay aspect - The replay ability in this game is obvious, i can see someone enjoying it and doing over again. \n\nFree to play- It is a free game so there is no reason to try it out for yourself as your experience might very well differ from mine or any other player review you may read.\n\nAchievements - There are no achievements in this game and i do think it would be nice to have some as you don't feel that you are rewarded other than the fact you complete the game.\n\nMultiple ending - There are multiple endings which i am glad it has, i felt it made my experience that more exciting though it is disappointing as it is not like you do things differently from the start or take a different path. It is a different outcome at the same end. You get a little bit more of a different experience but even in that there was a level of repetitiveness of what you had to do. There are three endings but one is playing the game normally, second is being right near the end and playing about 10- 20 minutes longer in a different area to end up in the same place where you make a choice. That choice of two things is your second and third ending which is a shame but i am glad it is there even if there is not much of it.\n\nDuration - The duration of play time it takes to complete the game and get all three endings is around four hours and thirty minutes (4 hours 30 minutes), thirty minutes of that (30 minutes)  more or less was for the other two endings.\n\nMy experience - Now i know i have said a lot and there is a lot of negative things i may have had to say but that is just me reviewing my experience and my time playing. This is how i felt and i would be lying if i said i did not enjoy it, at the end i just felt a bit short handed with the time spent. As i stated beforehand, you could play the game and feel very differently to me but the only way to do that is to try it put for yourself. If you are bored and need to kill time then i would say this game is perfect for it!\n\nThank you for reading about my time playing this game and in doing so i hope that i have helped you come even a little bit closer to a decision of what do to with this game.

Beat it, 100%'d everything, got all endings, and visited the bonus dungeon in 6.4 hours using a keyboard.  Difficulty is easy.  \n\nGameplay - This is an action rpg like the first YS games, where you bump enemies to death.  You can also cast special moves on the side.  Everything ran smoothly more or less and fighting the bosses is extra fun.  Bosses have an easy and hard mode, and easy was way too easy for me.  But the final battle was really hard in hard mode.  There's no penalty or benefits to either outside of challenge.  \n\nControls - The controls were a little weird but were easy to get use to in time.  I sorely wanted to use a game controller and it's not really a realistic option.  There's no way to change the controls in-game.  Another weird bit is how the game doesn't remember the screen size I wanted (every time I started it up I went into settings to redo it).\n\nGraphics - Classy RPGMaker graphics.  AWESOME character art and scene pictures.  Also awesome boss art.  \n\nMusic - Classy RPGMaker music.  Unsure if it's all pre-set rpgmaker music or if anything unique had been composed in the bunch.  \n\nPlot - The plot really makes Eternal Senia.  I Loved the plot.  Many others in the reviews have as well.  I love the endings, and I love Senia.  \n\nTranslation - The creator is not a native English speaker.  That said, the English translation could use some work or updates.  \n\nFree - It's Freeeeeeeeeeee!!!  And it shouldn't be!  Give me a donate option!  Curse you, let me support you for such a good game!\n\nBugs - I experienced a number of weird bugs.  Some involved movement or the character sprite seizing up, and Q-ing through doorways into cutscenes crashed it so don't do that.  There were a few other really random ones that I don't remember offhand.  But none of it really got in the way of playing.  \n\n\n\nEternal Senia is free, fun, and fast for an rpg.  It's the least stressful arpg I've played in quite a long time.  The characters and loveable and bosses are great to fight.  If you want to get away from life for all of five or so hours and need a safe spot to chill out, this is a great game for that.  I want to replay it.  Chances are I will in the future.

As many people know, RPG Maker games can be very hit or miss.  When I first started this game, the translation through me off a bit and I was unsure if I was going to like it or not.  I'm glad I gave it a shot!\n\nI'm not entirely sure if the music was bought or made by the developer, but the music is fantastic.  I really enjoyed the \"if you touch the enemy, you instantly hit each other\" mechanic.  This means there wasn't a point where the enemy was moving faster than I could keep up, and I was getting whooped because of it.  Basically, if a baddie bumped into me, we hit each other.\n\nThat being said, there are still four simple skills you can use to help yourself out, including one that is used in puzzles.  You can level these skills up with points you get along the way.  The monsters respawn, so you can grind to your heart's content.\n\nI also enjoyed the \"procedural\" mini-dungeons within the areas that you could go to and grind even more, or find other items that may not be in the normal game.  \n\nAnother HUGE benefit this game had that I wish every game had was the NPCs at the end of each area.  One NPC gave you rewards for obtaining each upgrade, one for killing an amount of each monster, and the last for finding each treasure.  These NPCs made sure you didn't miss anything or leave anything behind.\n\nI wish there had been a way to \"hide\" items I've already crafted, because finding where I left off was a bit of a pain.  The crafting system is basically your only way to get upgraded equipment.  It isn't too hard to use...but it felt like a chore to unequip everything I was wearing so I could go to the crafting menu and scroll past all the stuff I already made and then upgrade my current equipment and then go back and reequip it.  This may have just been a limitation of RPG Maker.\n\nAll in all, I'd love to see what this developer could produce with a team and more resources.  I suspect that they had a lot of ideas that never got used.

I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this game is. I just finished the game completely and saw there's a sequel coming [i] (Or already out not sure) [/i] , but I am very excited to play it when I can. Like a said before, an excellent game, and for free to, it's insane! \n\n[b] Now a basic review from a first time player: [/b]\nEverything in Eternal Senia is wonderful, the story, characters, bosses, upgrades, and all of the endings. I'm not the best with reviews since I don't really do them, but here we go-\n\n[b] Game Controls: [/b]\nThe game controls are very easy to get a hold of and you should have almost no problem with them. I will say I wish there was an option to change your controls as even I was slightly confused when first playing. But like I said very easy to get used to, so even if you have trouble you should be fine.\n\n[b] Difficulty: [/b]\nNow the difficulty wasn't actually too hard for me. I had an easy grasp on the game and got used to the attacks damages. If you're like me then you will grind out mobs and constantly upgrade, so that might have been why the game was easier on my part. If you forget to upgrade your gear then the game will most likely be a lot harder. The bosses also have an easy and hard mode, I haven't clicked either and just did the normal difficulty so I'm not sure how hard or easy it is.\n\n[b] Story: [/b]\nNow the story is very simple, but it's a nice story. The whole story is about Senia going after her sister to find her, and on her adventure Senia grows mentally while staying determined. It shows the devotion of how far will you go to protect the ones you love. If you love angst and the feels, then I recommend this even more.\n\n[b] Graphics: [/b]\nThe graphics are beautiful and visually appealing. The little sprites of the characters, the visual novel feel to the game, the backgrounds, the bosses, and all attacks. Everything is nice to look at and you don't have to feel like you're being overwhelmed by colors. You can also change the brightness of the game so if the game is too bright for your nightowl eyes, then you can turn it down.\n\n[b] Soundtrack: [/b]\nFinally the soundtrack, which is amazing. I love the soundtrack in this, even if I have to listen to it for a hour or so, I don't really get bothered by it. Most of the time intense music will only activate if you're in a certain area like a boss fight or a new area. But even then there's still music playing constantly but it's not as prominent which I really like. \n\nOverall this game is lovely to play, and I couldn't recommend it enough.

(why do we only have a Yes/No option instead of a score system ?)\n\nAnyways, Eternal Senia is a small RPG that could probably be considered a light novel, the main focus here is the story.\n\n[h1]+Positives:[/h1]\n+Good story with some good characters\n+Good art (at least during cutscenes)\n+No bugs encountered\n+I guess being free should count as a positive\n\n[h1]-Negatives:[/h1]\n-Bad gameplay\n-Too easy\n-No worldbuilding outside of the 'dungeon' that the main character is in during the whole game\n-Made with RPGMaker\n\n\n[h1]+Story:[/h1]\n(I will not spoil the story, but just in case I will put the finer details in spoilers)\n\nYou play as Senia, a [spoiler]orphaned[/spoiler] young girl who was raised by a young woman of faith. Senia finds herself in some sort of dungeon filled with monsters with the objective of finding her dear sister [spoiler]whom has left her to the Tower of Eternity in search of the powers held within. As Senia ventures throughout the tower she learns more and more about the terrible nature of this thing Magaleta yearns for and why she left her.[/spoiler]\n\nIn my personal opnion I think the story was good with a very bittersweet/sad ending and good characters, only citicism I have to give is that we aren't really given any info about the world outside of this dungeon.\n\n\n[h1]-Gameplay:[/h1]\n Oh boy, this is going to take a while.\nI'll be honest, it's absent. Unlike most RPGMaker games that are normally either turn based RPGs or completely devoid of combat and instead are filled with puzzles, Eternal Senia tries to well... kind of mimic the gameplay of the older Zelda games (top down view, enemies roam the screen and you walk up to them to then attack them and you have a dash that reflects projectiles and an AOE attack) however there is one major difference, instead of having a button for normal attack you have to directly run into an enemy and you'll deal damage to them while also recieving damage from their attack.... The whole gameplay is touch damage. Of course there are the AOE and Dash skills however these consume mana so you end up with 2 problems; either the game is too easy if you've been farming and keeping your gear up to date as enemies that you walk into deal literally 1 point of damage OR the game is impossible if you've been rushing because you [b]have[/b] to take damage in order to deal damage which ends up degenerating into you avoiding enemies until your mana refills so you can use skills to kill enemies without taking damage.\n The AI of most enemies also is rather absent due to the system I previously mentioned, since you must walk into enemies to harm them they'll simply wander around the room not really chasing you or anything except for spellcasters or enemies that have a charge attack. Enemy variety is also very lacking as it can be summed up to 4 categories; Grunts that can only walk into you to deal damage, Chargers that are the same as grunts but have a charge attack that renders them immune to damage and will guide them towards you, Shooters same as grunts but will keep shooting projectiles in front of them (not neccesarily aimed at you) and Spellcasters which have a ranged AOE attack.\n\nWhile I do respect the fact that the developer tried something different, RPGMaker just isn't the right engine for this kind of game.\n\n\n[h1]+Art:[/h1]\nI do like the art at least the one during dialogues and cutscenes, sadly the sprites outside of the cutscenes aren't very impressive but that's a limitation of RPGMaker (it isn't exactly known for it's stunning triple A graphics)  the colors are very soothing and the characters look adorable.\n\n\n[h1]+Bugs:[/h1]\nThankfully none were found while I was playing, although it is reported that sometimes exiting a room by dashing might glitch the game if there's a cutscene that triggers in the next room.\n\n\n[h1]-Final Verdict:[/h1]\nIf I had to rate this game I'd give it a 6,5/10; good story but bad gameplay.\nIf you have a couple of hours to spare and want a nice little story I'd recommend playing, if you're looking for a game to have fun playing with then probably not. All in all it's free and somewhat short, nothing to really lose by playing it (we all know you are going to lose that time procrasinating anyways.)", "timestamp_created": 1635522482, "timestamp_updated": 1635522702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101483763": {"recommendationid": "101483763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052508726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 419, "last_played": 1634958989}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't realize a game like this could end up being as deep as it was.

I was ultimately super challenged by the final boss (i did every boss on hard mode) and took like literally 1.5 hours to beat that.\n\nIn the end, it was super worth it, and the music was super great and memorable. Though I think a lot of it was copyright free? I also recognized a generic RPG Maker song in there but I didn't really mind.\n\nI ended up collecting everything in each chapter and doing every boss on hard mode. It was a great experience.\nHere's my playthrough if anyone would like to check it out :)\nhttps://youtu.be/-wrpyKkiqIo", "timestamp_created": 1634980750, "timestamp_updated": 1634980750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101469999": {"recommendationid": "101469999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138551522", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1609705633}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a game alright.

I feel bad about the game being free, I'd throw money at it if I could just to support the developers. I loved the game so much that I was keeping up with the progress of their sequel.\n\nI initially installed this game based on the gameplay, I was in the mood for such gameplay and I stumbled upon this game and thought, if it's free then I've got nothing to lose except time. As you can tell, I did not install it for the story, but lo and behold, I got captivated by the story, who would have thought.\n\nThe music, the goddamn music, I loved it. I can't tell you that every OST slapped, but the majority did, and I remember chilling at the title screen for who knows how long, because I just kept listening to the music, the music was so good that the negative reviews still call the music \"a redeeming point of the game\".\n\nThe gameplay is fun, this is the first and last time I've seen the use of abilities in this game genre, and being able to level your abilities with resources instead of EXP was also a very fun and innovative decision. Then there's the fun boss fights and sort of dungeon-like entrances, that allowed you to farm and also battle bosses outside of the story, it appealed to my MMORPG heart.\n\nIf I absolutely have to mention a negative point to this game, it would be the constant promotion of their Facebook page to claim a code, but the issue was that the Facebook page was nigh impossible to find with English characters, so I had to find the code through a fan-page, but the fan-page was run by a suicidal individual, it made me very uncomfortable, I was a kid back then mind you.", "timestamp_created": 1627472494, "timestamp_updated": 1644177121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96299171": {"recommendationid": "96299171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832700785", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1627135058}, "language": "english", "review": "great story and music", "timestamp_created": 1627141879, "timestamp_updated": 1627141879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96148729": {"recommendationid": "96148729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281260319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1626907650}, "language": "english", "review": "This adventure game is really fun and simple.

As a result of the real-time, arcade-like combat, this is one of the best indie JRPGs I've played, and the fact that it's free makes it all the more enjoyable. There's a few mechanisms that add a little hint of complexity as the game continues: inventory management, item crafting, and using up to four special attack powers. It's not complicated, but there're enough additional things to do that it spares the gameplay from being exhaustingly repetitive. There is a fair amount of repetition, still, but the game doesn't use it to drag out the gameplay and I never felt like I had to linger in an area or repeat anything to grind for more power or equipment. It's just the right length. You can play through [u]Eternal Senia[/u] casually over the course of a day, or you can try to find all the chests and upgrade all the equipment in each of three worlds/zones for an extra challenge that adds up to a few hours.

Things were usually straightforward, but there was a learning curve on the bosses that provided a really fun challenge. I will note that my game ended up glitching during the \"King\" mini boss battles 2 dungeons through, but even with the issue, I was able to strategize to account for the glitch and play through. \n\nI wasn't expecting much from the story, but I feel like I underestimated the game in doing so. I was really moved by the characters and wanted to learn more about them with each cutscene. I'm a sucker for a story about family, and this hit me where it hurt. I was so moved by the dynamic between the sisters. This game made me cry!\n\nI also want to say that I absolutely adore the maps here. I don't really like the RPG Maker VX/VX Ace art style, it looks too blocky for me. It tends to have two impacts on me: 1) looking REALLY fake, and 2) feeling like you're stuck *inside* of something, like a diorama.

No. Is Eternal Senia the best RPGMaker game ever? No. Is Eternal Senia a lovely experience in which the passion of the creator clearly shines through? Absolutely yes. \nEternal Senia is a short but very enjoyable game that I highly recommend. It's not that grindy, especially if all you want to do is \"finish\" the game. The game is thankfully very forward about how to get the most enjoyable experience; the creator at one point tells you what to do, haha. \n\nI personally 100%'d the game, with the help from a guide. If you are stuck don't take shame in using a guide, one of the chests is in my honest opinion incredibly hard to find. \n\nI found the battle system simple but satisfying, and the weapon/armor system, which is necessary to use for progress, was never too annoying other than the interaction between upgrades and equips. Remember to unequip your armor and weapons if you want to upgrade them!\n\nThe game is relatively easy until the last boss. I can't believe beating that on the highest difficulty is even possible, but if you're a masochist give it a go.\n\nThe story is really enjoyable in  my honest opinion and despite the simplicity it's very effective. I felt pretty invested in the main story focus and by the end, I was pretty satisfied with it. \nSome might find the story inconclusive, if so, Eternal Senia has a sequel! It's a tapping mobile game which I have also played. Do I recommend that game? If you really liked Eternal Senia give it a shot, but it being a tapping game gets tiring.\n\nI really like Eternal Senia. I find it unique among other RPGMaker titles, and I find it very approachable in both gameplay and story.

The plot is simple and sad. The paths through the enemies are boring, there's nothing for me to do with extra items after I've made the right armor (within exception to a hard to find item which can be converted into common items!) I find that every time I finish the level the fourth wall break is too much for my preferences. Getting the alternative endings is harder then it should be- I did what it recommended, and the beginning cutscene of it had changed, so why does it still count as ending 1? Oh well, I tried to find ending 2, but I didn't really like the game in the first place. I appreciate that it passes the bechdel nicely. I do tire of the whole \"sister raising a sibling thing\", and when she's not even her own sibling, but a replacement thereof, I get it, but I just want to kick the priestess and tell her to be an adoptive mom instead.

definitely enjoyed this more than trashy films like cars 3 or skyfall or dunkirk or emoji movie or anything by adam sandler (except 50 first dates, i don't mind that one).\nthe story follows a young girl named senia (hence the title) who ventures into a dangerous tower to try to rescue her sister magaleta (who is a nun for some reason) who has also ventured into this dangerous tower for reasons that you'll eventually learn about. she meets some friends along the way and along the way learns about her sister's mysterious past. i know it's a simple premise, but the end also hits hard with a message once you get there. oh, speaking of which, there are multiple endings. how to get them? that's something you're going to have to figure out yourself :^) senia's love for her sister is truly admirable. but how she expresses so is also part of the game's experience(TM) -  senia's really quite sweet. she also has a subtly distinct personality (unlike ANYONE adam sandler plays). there are also hidden secrets throughout the map and rewards for achieving certain things ;)\n\ngameplay-wise, this game appears to have been designed to be accessible to all players, though seasoned RPG veterans will also find the game appealing. you attack enemies by walking into them, and press certain buttons to use special moves that are useful for both solving the puzzles in the game and defeating tougher enemies. there's also collectible items and upgradeable weapons, but what i appreciate about it is that there are pretty linear upgrades and equipment to achieve, meaning that you don't necessarily have to explore all these weird \"different but not necessarily better\" weapons that plague other RPGs (i'm looking at you, nier automata and final fantasy). the character equipment customization is simple and straightforward. \n\noh something important to note: once you leave a section of the game's world, you can't go back to it, so make sure you've done everything you've wanted to do there before leaving. this was an interesting design choice, as it really adds to the mystery of the tower and lostness that senia may feel as she's walking through the levels. the game revolves around an overall theme of locked-in fate. it also plays like a dream - we watch senia progress through all these surreal places and yet once you leave one part of the \"dream\" you can't return to it. overall, it gives the game a demure and surreal atmosphere that will have you thinking about the game as you fall asleep that night.\n\nthe graphics? they're quaintly retro, if i must say myself. they also feed into the overall feeling of surrealness, what with their dreamlike representations of the forest, etc. the maps in this game are kind of cleverly structured in that the rooms' design never feel FORCED - like do you ever play a game where it's just a big room and there are just enemies randomly scattered throughout the room for no reason? (again, looking at you final fantasy. you introduce this big library or something and for some reason there's this random big room with like 10 chimeras and 5 bats and ZERO books. that doesn't make sense. also, pokemon ruby and sapphire. why are these 10 year old pokemon trainers all standing in a row waiting for you to enter their line of sight? it doesnt make much sense. eternal senia actually makes sense in this regard).\n\nthe game also is appreciably not very long. i finished it in about 5.5 hours. grand theft auto 5 is to 3 seasons of some korean drama as eternal senia is to a spin-off anime movie about, idk, some high school kids who swap bodies or something. you don't need a whole lot of commitment to finish this game, so if you havin' trouble committing to your significant other or don't have a significant other there to waste your time with, then this game should be some great fun.\n\ni hope u are able to find the secret room ;) \n\ni rate this game an 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1611128868, "timestamp_updated": 1611128868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581601202487945557", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84927124": {"recommendationid": "84927124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060754770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1610998127}, "language": "english", "review": "(L)", "timestamp_created": 1610998152, "timestamp_updated": 1610998152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84595550": {"recommendationid": "84595550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411218339", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 511, "last_played": 1610520802}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple yet amazing", "timestamp_created": 1610519455, "timestamp_updated": 1610519455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526066362857818604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84530659": {"recommendationid": "84530659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085145356", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1602038722}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game", "timestamp_created": 1610424614, "timestamp_updated": 1610424614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84283953": {"recommendationid": "84283953", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023870668", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1610105817}, "language": "english", "review": "I like how the combat works in this game.

So I needed to finish it.\n\nAs a forerunner - the game is not bad. Has ups and downs, and a lot of lukewarm mish-mash ...filler-quality stuff to it. Knowing what the game is I'd never have added it to my library. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends because it lacks a solid backbone to enjoy, it's more like a timesink. If you have more time, different taste - you may like it.\n\nSo, about the game:\nI liked the music. Despite being super short and looping, the menu theme is pretty cool. Again, sorry - but a tune this catchy would deserve a game with more content. Other music during the game were quite distinct (especially the ones played during boss fights) and the sound effects were pretty good as well. Combat sounds effects OK.\n\nGraphics is a bit of mixed bag, feels better than standard RPG-Maker sprites, but nothing really outstanding. I don't know if the spell and lightning effects were original, but they were used pretty well for the most time. Environments were varied (3 different chapters) but really barren at many points, and there is just nothing much going on. It's an ARPG with 2-3 characters that you don't fight with, and it was made with RPG-Maker as the dev's first game project, \n\nAnd for that, they did a pretty good job, with the tools they've got. The combat is a real YMMV thing - it's grindy but easy, so it's either laidback and chill (I felt this way) or repetitive and meaningless, as others felt. The item system was sadly pretty horrible, upgrading a worn item can require up to 30-40 button presses because it needs to be unequipped, then in a submenu of a submenu of a menu you need to scroll though a list of all possible recipes to upgrade it, then go back and re-equip it. \n\n As I said, it feels weird to criticise someone's first attempt, but as the game is on Steam and in public, it can't get a universal pass. My main issue with the game is that it's - feels like admittedly, based on its description - a fanfiction-game of some characters from an MMO, and even ignoring the grammatical problems (It was painful to read \"sis\" a few hundred times, like a reminder if you'd ever forget who is the girl the protagonist nonstop talks about, despite never being present), it's a repetitive, cringey, anime-tropey story. There are barely any dialogue to be found, only monologues. \nThere are I guess multiple pages worth ramblings about \" I relied on you, but I want to help, I'm independent, where are you\" from a character who's avatar is constantly blushing and/or crying. \n[spoiler] And in the true ending she does her  best to convince her sister Magaleta - from not sacrificing herself - that she needs her because not mature or independent enough[/spoiler]   I... feel like the dev wanted to make a damsel in distress waifu-character from the MMO the strong protagonist of the  game, but also keeping her original, timid personality because that's what they originally liked. I may be very wrong about this as I did not play Ragnarok Online, but the representation and the personality that is \"presented\" is jarringly different.\n\nSo, all in all I am quite baffled how this game has 97% review rates, and in a way I feel super cheated by the premise of this game being *that* good. It's okay, but it's a far, far cry in quality from the 95+ % games that people actually paid for.\nLooks like it being free really gives a lot to it review score, I think it's in league with other games that are in the \"mixed\" review category.

The combat system is a great novelty.  It's gradually developed with the addition of extra skills and monsters with new abilities.  Some may find it repetitive, but I think this is mainly because each dungeon is structured similarly and the plot is quite simple.  I'd happily play a longer game still based on this mechanic, just with more variety in the storyline.  As well as fighting monsters and solving a few puzzles, you can craft new equipment by using the items you collect - it's a simple system but still satisfying. \n\nThe game has its flaws.  The translation is full of grammar mistakes, but you can still work out what the sentence was meant to say.  The endings weren't great, since the characters' motivations for acting as they did weren't really clear.  Upgrading equipment is a little clunky because you have to go into a different menu and unequip the item first - but I've seen a lot worse.  For a game that is both short and free, these weren't big issues.\n\nWith a price tag of zero, the game is definitely worth a look.

It's obviously a passion project, and the dev should be proud of seeing it through to completion. Making it available for free is very generous. I particularly liked the soundtrack. It's a great accomplishment, and the dev should feel proud.\n\nThat said, I don't recommend it because I don't think it's worth the time. If you don't have anything to play, sure, play through it - it's fine. But if you have a backlog, I'd go through that first.\n\nThe writing is full of typos and grammatical errors - and while I can overlook a little, having them appear in almost every single conversation becomes distracting. \n\nThe inventory system is cumbersome - as an example, upgrading an item requires having to go into a sub-menu, un-equiping the item, backing out to the main menu, going into a different sub-menu, scrolling to find the item, upgrading the item, backing out again, going into the first sub-menu, and finally equipping the item again. Same for having to combine pages into a book and getting kicked out of the menus, such that you have to go back in to actually read the book.\n\nThe combat, while initially novel, quickly grows stale and boring in everything besides boss fights - and even most of the lesser boss fights are just spamming one button over and over. Levels likewise become really repetitive.\n\nAnd the story is... acceptable? The writing was needlessly repetitious, re-stating the same thing over and over, and I found the characters to be very flat. The ending was the best part, if predictably melodramatic, but getting to the ending was kind of a chore.

I tried it, and beat it. I must say, for a free game, this is pretty good.\n\nThere is a couple things that could be polished, especially on the graphical side, a couple of characters seem to have very different styles. The big bosses are cool though, even if they don't fit at all with the other small character's style, I think it's a good effect and I accept it as variety. \n\nThe scenarios were kind of cheaply done however, some I feel were pretty much copy-pasted, and some were just blatant extensions to a couple parts of the game (like in the final area, you see no corridor between two zones, but try going to the right and a magical long boring corridor comes into existence).\n\nThe story was good, it wasn't super spectacular but it was more about the characters and their relationship. I'm not much into moving stories but I think they feel believable and I like them. I feel some of the dialogues sound a bit weird, probably due to the translation, which is overall good enough, but yeah a couple of sentences sound very weird (I must say, I'm not a native English speaker either, but since the game is in English I prefer to do the review in English too).\n\nNow, to the good things, because yeah this has some. The art of characters is super cute, it really outshines even some of the other probably standard assets the developer used. The menus also look very good, and are simple to use. I actually think some menus could have a facelift too, like the equip and inventory screens, since they seemed to have a slightly different style to things like the main party screen and the skills screen. But anyway this is me being picky.\n\nAnother thing I felt very solid was the gameplay. The game is on the easy side, might even be on the very easy side. This is the author's intention anyway as they mention somewhere in the game the game is intended to be playable by anyone, and there is also a couple \"challenges\" thrown in the mix, I beat one of the bosses in that challenge mode, and I enjoyed it, it wasn't frustrating neither easy. If you like hard games, you might want to just beat all monsters in the hard mode though, and see if that's enough for you.\n\nOne problem on gameplay I found though is that some enemies feel like filler. They do irrelevant damage, and alone they can't do anything to you either. They are greatly outshined by other enemies with more interesting skills, such as ranged, charge attacks or spell casting, who can actually be a treat to you and ask you to do something. The other guys are just dead meat to farm the items for the crafting system. Which by the way is there, it's fine, nothing great but it's at least straight to the point.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a nice little game, I enjoyed playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1604895635, "timestamp_updated": 1604895635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594166874885559082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78911420": {"recommendationid": "78911420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800071418", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1605137778}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1604792882, "timestamp_updated": 1630718183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78636408": {"recommendationid": "78636408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051782741", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1604487202}, "language": "english", "review": "title screen theme is the best part of the game", "timestamp_created": 1604386484, "timestamp_updated": 1604386484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547511279582977295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78340532": {"recommendationid": "78340532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036923751", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1603981214}, "language": "english", "review": "For a free to play game, this is amazing.

Yes, I realize it's a free game, but most free games either have long grinds, pay-to-win, obnoxious ads, poor pacing, etc. This game has none of that. The grinds are short, never more than a few minutes at a time, no ads or required DLC, just a simple story to be told at a decent pace.\n\nThe graphics are well done, the music is great, though not always suitable to the situation at hand, and the game's story doesn't get complicated or unintelligible; it's not a story about saving the world, just saving the one person that means the most to you. The translations need help, but are still able to be understood, so it's not \"All Your Base Are Belong To Us\" level of translation problems.\n\nThere's a rare bug, where if you kill certain elite monsters that drop a finite quantity item at the same time they kill you, the drop despawns and you have no way to get the final weapon and armor as a result, and you'll be short at least one other final tier upgrade. This happens because these creatures do not cause Game Over, but instead continue you back at the nearest entrance. It's easy enough to just reload your game, but make sure you don't accidentally save while in this condition.\n\nAside from that, this is a short game, so there's not a lot of content, but the amount of content feels right for the amount of game that's here. You'll be getting new armor and weapons on a steady pace, about 4 weapons and 12 armor about every 90-120 minutes, so it feels pretty constant. Same with the skills, you get one with about the same regularity as the weapons and armor.\n\nIf you're looking to kill a few hours, this game offers enough to be satisfying at least once though. This game shows that the developer has a lot of potential, so I do hope that they decide to assemble a small team (including an English speaker) and make a larger project. I imagine that with a few more people helping, the Senia universe could be expanded and made in to a grand adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1601852432, "timestamp_updated": 1601852432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76824201": {"recommendationid": "76824201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210535864", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1590084154}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Lovely Sountrack", "timestamp_created": 1601489730, "timestamp_updated": 1601489730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76736358": {"recommendationid": "76736358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412647453", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1502884744}, "language": "english", "review": "Liked:\n- Story\n- Combat\n\nDisliked:\n- Short length", "timestamp_created": 1601334328, "timestamp_updated": 1601334328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76458407": {"recommendationid": "76458407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045722499", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1600911105}, "language": "english", "review": "really enjoyed the game.\nEven if the gameplay is not that great, I liked the story and art", "timestamp_created": 1600911199, "timestamp_updated": 1600911199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76330378": {"recommendationid": "76330378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119198058", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1600695136}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best free games on steam with great music, story, and and some eh gameplay.

Its simple but at the same time too linear so I don't want replay it multiple times because it is also grindy even though they have created a system to lessen the time of farming up: The Arcade.

En cuanto a personalizaci\u00f3n del personaje, es m\u00e1s bien escasa, ya que tienes unos atributos predefinidos que se pueden mejorar con libros que se consiguen en cofres o venciendo a enemigos.

Good solution.\n\nIn the end Magaleta realizes that and also tells Senia she has matured a lot, but instead of accepting that, Senia claims she hasn't over and over demanding her sister to keep protecting her... and then Magaleta dies.  And to make that meaningful, Senia swears to try again (how??) to save her... even though she knows Magaleta wouldn't want that. I mean, mourning a loss would be fine, but she clearly can't get over it. It's not \"determination\".

I decided to give it a shot since it said it was an overwhelming positive game and that it was an RPG game. The story is about a girl named Senia who goes to the Tower of Eternity to go search for her sister, Magaleta. Now, one thing I can say about this game is that I really ended up enjoying it! I don\u2019t regret playing it one bit! It was really fun and there were a lot of things I enjoyed about it, which I will now mention.\n1.\tThe music! From the beginning when I started this game, this was one of the first things that stood out to me. Just the intro music felt so relaxing yet so upbeat at the same time, it felt like the type of music you would listen to in order to give yourself some motivation. As the game progressed, I liked how the soundtrack sounded. I felt like the music matched what the ambience was portraying, and it made me feel my emotions intensify with the feeling coming across. \n2.\tCharacter design/the art pieces: This also stood out to me around the time I started the game, I really like the character designs for the characters (for both Senia and Magaleta). Like I really like how cute they looked without taking it too over the top that it\u2026couldn\u2019t be taking seriously (?) The design for the bosses were also pretty cool, and I especially liked the art pieces of Senia and Magaleta that were done for endings, I thought those looked amazing and it just made my emotions accentuate while looking at them.\n3.\tHow the layout seems pretty direct. You know those types of games where you are just left confused as to where to go, where most of your time is spent finding where to go? Well, that\u2019s not the type of game this is. I really liked how the layout was pretty direct. You were either going in a straight line, or there were certain moments where you had to look around, but finding your way was still pretty easy. And it was nice since it helped progress the story way faster by doing that.\n4.\tHow they tell you that they recommend you to save before the final boss. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re probably the type of person who rushes into things to the point that you forget to save sometimes. With this game, they actually give you a warning when you\u2019re about to face a boss and that they recommended me to save. It made me stop and think, \u201cOh wait, I should probably save before going on ahead\u201d. \n5.\tThe fact that they give you the option on what mode you would like to use for each enemy. Before facing the enemy, you are given the option of what mode you would like to use. Depending on how you confident you feel, you can either go for easy or hard. In my case,  I really liked this since it gave me an opportunity to beat the story without stressing too much (I played mostly on easy, and though I did try hard mode, I didn\u2019t get very far, but I think for players who want more of a challenge, that is the way to go). \n6.\tSimilar to the previous one, I also liked that they didn\u2019t force you to fight all the enemies if you didn\u2019t want to: Sure, there were some enemies that you had to face, but for example, going into the Arcane realm was more of a choice. If you wanted to upgrade your gear and get all those materials, but if you didn\u2019t want to, you didn\u2019t have to. You could also evade some of the enemies you walked into if you didn\u2019t feel like facing all of them which was nice as it felt like I could choose my own battles (and well, in my case, it was nice I wasn\u2019t forced to face the King enemies, cause the times I tried were pretty annoying).\n7.\tThe different endings. Well, one thing that usually impacts a lot on a game is how good the endings are. With this game, I liked how each ending gave a different feel. While ending 1 did feel kind of sad with a little sense of enjoyment to it, I liked how you needed to do more (and see things you didn\u2019t see before previous to getting ending 2 and 3). Ending 2 added a bit of a hopeless touch to it (Seeing the more negative emotions), and ending 3, while being really sad, added a more hopeful glint to the story, which was really nice (And to be honest, ending 3 was the one who almost made me cry).\n8.\tThe last thing I would like to bring up from the things I like is the character development. While it wasn\u2019t something too major, it did felt nice to see how Senia changed (growing stronger from the beginning of the game). Like especially when you see the ending, you see how her personality and how she views Nia also changes, as she comes to accept how Magaleta views her. I also like the personality of Magaleta, how you see all she has been through, being so hopeless at trying to save people she loves, yet failing, and how it comes across that she really does care about Senia, but not being too overly dotting, as you do see her scold Senia when she does something bad.\n\nBut well, even though I really liked this game, I cannot say it is perfect (To be honest, I don\u2019t think any game can be truly perfect). So now that I have mentioned all I like, now I am going to mention the things that I didn't like:\n1. The game's story/the plot: Now, especially with what I said before, it may seem contradictory that I say something bad about the plot. I did like how they progressed the story, but i just feel that the whole thing of a character going to save a loved one is a bit cliche and it feels overused. Like when I saw that in the beginning, I was like \"Another game like that?\" however, they did make up for it with the turns, but still.\n2. The enemies and how precise your positioning had to be sometimes for an attack to go through: Now this doesn't have to do with normal enemies you encounter, but with the bosses. I didn't like that you had to be in an exact spot in order for the attack to hit, I felt that was rather stupid, since in the end, you would still be able hit an enemy even if you are a little bit more to the left (logically speaking)\n\nBut yeah, overall, I really enjoyed this game. It had a good story, nice characters, the battles were also nice (the fact that it wasn't just about offense, but you also needed to evade attacks, as well). The bosses looked pretty nice too! The game is not too long either, so it's worth looking into.\nSo, final thoughts? I would definitely recommend this game to anybody who likes a bit of fighting, and especially considering its free, I would say, give it a shot! In my opinion, you won't regret it, at least for me it wasn\u2019t.", "timestamp_created": 1588979617, "timestamp_updated": 1588979793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542483627796173096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68805854": {"recommendationid": "68805854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370489014", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1520, "last_played": 1589289391}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a very in-depth story and is well made.", "timestamp_created": 1588964078, "timestamp_updated": 1588964078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496064037084579468", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68801287": {"recommendationid": "68801287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060378371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1588960102}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR I like it a lot.\n\nThis is probably one of my favourite F2P games on Steam so I'm going to come off a bit bias.\n\nTo be fair, I was sort of off-putted by the game's graphics in a couple of the game's screenshots. The clipped images in the attack animations and the static bosses were ehh... But while playing through the game, I got used to it -- in a good way! It's charming and gives off that mid-2000s flash game feel.\n\nEverything else though... where do I start?\n\nThe combat is simple, yet satisfying. Though there is no \"basic attack button,\" I don't think that oversimplifies gameplay or make it boring at all. First of all, the game makes use of the standard 3 normal abilities, 1 ulti that you pretty much see in every game nowadays, and for good reason -- it works. Second of all, your auto attack is animated and there is a slight buffer between finishing a swing and moving. So in that sense, there is actually some micro management involved. That is, feeling for her attack animation delay, properly using her abilities at the right time, etc. etc.\n\nCrafting and equipment upgrades are pretty straightforward too. You enter a stage, collect some craftables, make some stuff, upgrade that stuff, then toss it aside when you enter a harder stage with better craftables. It keeps to the theme of simplicity, and makes it super satisfying to progress.\n\nYou'll either at most really like the gameplay for how simple and standard it is, or at least feel indifferent about it for the exact same reasons.\n\nSimilarly for the plot, at most you'll love it if you're a sap for simple, \"trying not to reinvent the wheel\" anime plots, or at least you'll be cringing/indifferent because it's one of those run-off-the-mill shonens. (I'd read it if it were a light novel.)\n\nHowever, I think the OST and the art speak for itself. They're undeniably beautiful.\n\nIf you're an anime fan, definitely try it out. The game's simple enough for anyone at any \"gamer level\" to experience the story/art/OST. Plus, there's an easy difficulty (though I haven't personally tried it myself).\n\nBut that isn't to say the game isn't hard. I spent a good deal on the \"final boss,\" and the final boss. I can't imagine what it'd be like on hard difficulty.\n\nAlright, that's it.", "timestamp_created": 1588957950, "timestamp_updated": 1589592900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68764514": {"recommendationid": "68764514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198860015954", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1700593343}, "language": "spanish", "review": "*", "timestamp_created": 1588901212, "timestamp_updated": 1588901212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68547696": {"recommendationid": "68547696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215799276", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 346, "last_played": 1588589964}, "language": "english", "review": "EPIC STORY\nDecent Gameplay to keep you from being bored\nEPIC SOUNDTRACKS\nEPIC SEQUEL on Android (Play this first before the sequel if you want proper storyline)\n...

I think I figured it would be like most indie RPGs in that style and simply prioritized other games for a while. But once I clicked on it again the other day, I had to play through the whole thing. It's just so much [i]fun[/i]. Now, my opinions are coming from a place of someone unfamiliar with which assets were made from scratch for this game and which were borrowed, so keep that in mind.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] The action gameplay. This is the game's strongest pillar and it holds up all throughout. When I first laid eyes on this game, I didn't expect it to be an action RPG, nor did I expect it to be so fun and simple. It's definitely easy, but not in a bad way. It's straightforward, easy to learn, smooth and keeps evolving further in as you discover more attack patterns and skills. Considering the graphic and movement limits of a game like this, the dev did a stellar job on this battle system. There's also some crafting involved which was pretty fun to grind for.\n\n[*] The music. This is a sad game and the soundtrack really helps strengthen the emotional aspects without being too overbearing. It's not just \"here's the sad music that's telling you it's time to be sad,\" it's genuinely good music as well.\n\n[*] The art. The portrait art is quite good but especially so are the boss visuals. Whenever a big boss appeared I loved looking at the sheer size of them and the details on their designs.\n\n[*] The characters and narrative. It's not a complicated story nor is it in any way long, but I felt for the protagonist and wanted her to succeed. At no point did I feel like it was getting boring or uninteresting, but rather wanted to know more about the characters the more I played.[/list]\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]The grammar. It was in no way a deal breaker for me as I could perfectly understand the dialogue and what it wanted to convey, but it did leave some hiccups here and there in the overall experience.

I love the intro song and all the songs throughout make the game bearable.  That, for me, is where the positive credit ends.\n\nThe game mechanics were a good concept: simple, intuitive, smooth.  However, the implementation missed the mark.  That is actually how I feel about a lot of the aspects of this game.  It is like the creator had all these great concepts kicking around in his head and he got really excited about getting them into a game, so he just threw everything out there and didn't take the time to refine it. \n\nThe story line is a bit cliche and predictable, which is okay for the style game, but honestly the poor translation to English really made it hard for me to feel immersed in the story.  I'm not talking small, simple missed words.  The whole game is stiff and garbled, making it nearly impossible to even figure out what the characters are trying to say at times, let alone causing me to feel any empathy for them.\n\nThe leveling system is straight forward, but a bit tedious.  You only gain 1 attack, 1 defense, and some HP every time you level up, so it doesn't really feel rewarding.  Leveling the skills up definitely scales the damage they do, though, but the SP required ramps up a lot so you eventually hit a point of diminishing returns.\n\nThe combat system was a cool idea, but it isn't very well implemented.  Sometimes your Area of Effect attack will hit the enemies in front of you, sometimes it won't.  It seemed like the hit-box was determined by where the sprites were located at the end of their movement rather than the beginning.  So the attack may have already hit, but since your attack animation is still up, if a monster walks into it then it will still count it as a hit. Not very well polished, but forgivable to an extent for a free game. I think what bothered me the most, honestly, is that there was not enough variety in boss attacks and even just regular monster attacks.  The indicators were nice, but some attacks did damage the entire time the sprite was active while others only did when it first appeared.  Some did damage if you moved around while being hit but not if you stood still, and others did the opposite even with similar attack types.\n\nThe developer started to introduce fun little puzzles (kind of like in Lufia II for SNES) but then just... stopped.  There were maybe three in the whole game and they were all solvable without any effort or intention put into the problem.  One of those \"If you aren't going to flush it out to its full potential then just get rid of it\" situations for me. \n\nOn a scale of 1-9 I would say this game gets a 3 for me. I feel a little conflicted, as I said, because it is obvious that the creator had a lot of passion and care in creating the game and I DO appreciate that, but I am reviewing the game, not the creator's heart. \n\nto Holy Priest: let me know if you are interested/willing to redo the English translation. If you can send me a file that has all the different speech sections in it, I don't mind going through and fixing the grammatical errors to make it more appealing to your English speaking audience.  \n\nKeep up your efforts and don't be dissuaded by my review.

Almost all the assets were base RPG Maker assets except the sprites of the major characters, and the \"battles\" had absolutely no strategy and became incredibly tedious as you just run into enemies over and over again and hope for the best.

Of course, I didn't finish the game, but the translation was so stiff and unnatural and the characters so two-dimensional and cliched that I don't think I would have gotten more into it even had I powered through the tedium and reached the end.

Presumably it was recommended to me as one of the better free-to-play JsRPGs on Steam. But, well, if that was the case... I can't say I agree.\n\nMy time with Eternal Senia has not been long, but I think I've got a sufficient grasp of the combat system\u2014and it's very much not my thing. It's not really turn-based or real-time combat, not in the traditional sense. It's more like a shallow imitation of the infamous \"bump system\" of Ys I and Ys II: you simply walk around the world and bump into enemies as they deal damage to you, and you them.

Though it did still tugged at my heart-strings a few times.\n- Bland, static-feeling environments due to being RPG Maker-based.\n- The crafting system's progression was boring. You have different weapon/armor slots, each of which had a few sets of armor with different tiers you could craft your way up to (with each tier requiring the previous-tier armor as a crafting ingredient), but progressing your armor was all about grinding ingredients from mobs. It also got tiresome having to take off a given piece of armor before being able to craft with it. And it didn't help that most of the armor categories used the same sprite, making everything blend together.\n- A lot of the game felt like it was using stock RPG Maker assets. For example, many enemies feel like generic JRPG enemies, and the bosses in the game are just giant, static sprites that don't really feel like they fit in with the rest of the game.\n- Later portions of the game started to feel a bit wacky to me, suddenly introducing stuff like a Pac-Man-ish minigame.\n- As I progressed in the game, I didn't have any interesting decisions to make: I attacked enemies that could barely damage me, I grinded for crafting goop, and I did janky and rudimentary puzzles and increasingly just felt wacky and out-of-place.\n- Character development didn't work for me, and I found myself questioning if any of the characters' motives or disposition towards me was believable.\n\nAll in all, it looks and kinda feels like a SNES RPG, but it lacks the magic and production values that make me love the genre.\n\nEDIT: To name some names, anything by Zeboyd are good examples of contemporary games that both capture the magic of older JRPGs while at the same time also introducing their own twists.

The final boss for endings 2 and 3 are pretty hard, and it'll take a few tries (with maxed gear) to get down the attack patterns. The low overall difficulty of the game makes it easy and not frustrating to power through in one sitting which is what I did. It also helps to keep the story at the forefront of your attention during the game, without feeling like a visual novel.\nAgain, I can't recommend this enough.

Even the description in the Steam page of this game says that it is inspired directly from Ragnarok Online. I don't know if this is considered plagiarism or not seeing that it was made by a fan of Ragnarok, but I still certainly love this game no matter what. Its kinda like those \"Flash\" fan games you find online, there not official and are simply made by fans, yet are still fun to play. I am a huge Ragnarok fan myself. I have watched my sibling play the original online game as a kid, and going back to to play it myself really feels nostalgic. I've also watched the Ragnarok anime, which is an old anime, but still a great adaptation of the game. So far, my favourite Ragnarok game is the spin-off game called \"Ragnarok Odyssey Ace\" for the PlayStation 3. I'm getting off-topic here, but the point is I love the Ragnarok series, and this game really feels like one. I'm not very good when it comes to strategy, but thankfully this game is easy to play.

As you would expect I was a bit sceptical. When I first loaded into the game I had no idea what to expect and was a bit off put when I saw the graphics and screen resolution. However, after playing for 20 minutes the style definitely grew on me and I came to really like it. The plot was sweet and it felt really nice to finish all the endings and get all the items. There is a good balance of difficulty, especially with easy and hard options. If you're expecting Dark Soul level difficulty then this probably isn't the game for you. Hard mode sits in a spot where it can take a few (or many) tries to beat a boss, but it's not gonna take you hours for one boss. Overall everything in the Eternal Senia was amazingly well-rounded, with nothing feeling crazy good nor bad. It's a fun game to play when your tired or burnt out of other games. Not to mention the brilliant OST! Everything in Eternal Senia hits the mark dead on for a great game.\n\nPros:\n~Simple mechanics\n~Amazing OST\n~A feel-good plot\n~Good balance in difficulty (+options for easy and hard)\n~Decent play time (~4 hours)\n~Good artwork\n~Multiple endings\n~Translation for English (Huzzah!)\n~Good power progression. There isn't really a point that you feel too undergeared or too overpowered, but when you do craft a new item you can feel a difference.\n\nCons:\n~Graphics and screen resolution might be a turn off for some, however, I would recommend at least seeing if you get used to it after a bit.\n~Occasional crash (I had about 2 while I was playing)\n~The English translation is a bit choppy throughout, but definitely not unintelligible at any point.\n\nOverall, Eternal Senia is a game that almost anyone can enjoy.

That was cool, especially when there were actually puzzles built around it. Sadly, I don't think the other abilities were as well thought out - particularly the last one.\nAbilities aside, I liked the gameplay. I do wish the lower-leveled stat-boosting book pages were available on higher floors, and that there was something to do with all the leftover stuff I had by the end, but it didn't drag the thing down too much. A shop would have helped, though.\n\nThe translation had issues - I don't think it was edited by a native English speaker. The only times I had a real problem with it were at the boss fights (where the oddly-organized difficulty levels aren't entirely clear) and the heavy emotional moments, where the overlong text robbed some of the art's impact.\n\nThe art was serviceable for the most part, interesting for Senia herself, and unpleasantly sexual for the Fairy Queen, the Succubi, and a couple of other things.\n\nI mostly liked the writing, but I did have a few issues.\n*Incest vibes showed up late in the game, without warning or acknowledgement. I found this considerably less comfortable than facing them outright would've been.\n*The fairy helper didn't have a story role after Floor 2.\n*Bad Ending Two contradicted Senia's apparently unique ability to control Eternity, which had been established repeatedly throughout the game, and had been one of my favorite parts of the plot. (Extremely low curse resistance granting the power to safely channel dark magic was just a really fun idea to me.)\n*The \"true\" ending was a sequel hook which undermined practically everything I'd been working for - and this was not a short game in terms of playtime, regardless of what Steam managed to record.\n*The sequel apparently does exist, but it's switched both genres and mediums. I don't /want/ a phone game right now, so I probably won't play it.", "timestamp_created": 1552099158, "timestamp_updated": 1552100297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49327553": {"recommendationid": "49327553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440169902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1551582453}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it!

If you haven't played the game yet or plan to, don't read this. I will also put spoiler boxes just in case.\n\nWhen I first got this game, I'm not going to lie, it was just to pad my game count so I could get the 50 game badge. But I was bored, so I launched it up. My first impressions were kinda iffy, the story seemed cliche and the mechanics of a regular rpg weren't there(Like parties and such) But I kept playing. And eventually, I found myself sucked in. It's a short story, sure, about 3-4 hours long maybe, but man did it captivate me. I wanted to just keep playing. And the soundtrack, oh the soundtrack was phenomenal. It plays right when it needs to for maximum enjoyment, or sadness for that matter. The combat system was simple, but it was good. The difficulty was perfect. The replayablity seems to be good for another 2-3 ish hours.\n\nFor a free game, I'm very surprised at how well done this is. CG's and an expertly crafted soundtrack almost make it seem as if it were made by professionals. The translation is very well done, with minimal translation errors. It's almost like a visual novel, without being one. (Can I hope to get a VN for this too?) The characters are great, and you can feel the connection, however cliched between them. It's quite lovely. I reminds me of when I was young and the anime I used to watch, how hopeful they were. \n\nThe only complaints I have about this game are probably the powercreep as soon as you enter a new dungeon, and maybe lack of materials, where I was only able to get the 3rd tier items for each weapon and armor without running through levels over and over(I've only played this game once so far). I also wish the game were longer, so we could see more relations built up(mainly between the fairy and Setnia, as the only interaction after the forest is mostly Setnia throwing her) but I can already see the amount of work put into this 3-4 hour game, so maybe I'm asking for too much. \n\nNow let's get into spoiler territory. About the ending.  [spoiler] The game builds you up for three hours to hit you with the first ending. You feels betrayed. You play for the second and third ending. The second is worse than the first by a long shot. The third gives you despair at first, then hope at the end. It's beautifully crafted, and bittersweet.  [/spoiler]\n\nThis game in absolutely a must play. It's at the low cost of free and only 3-4 hours long, not too big of a commitment. I'm buying the sequel immediately. I cannot get over how this game absolutely kicked my expectations to the ground and began beating them to a pulp.\n\nAlso, the sequel was released on mobile. It seems to be a standary grind-gacha game, so please be wary. I'm really hoping for an VN or a RPG port of the sequel story.

Minor flaws that are over-lookable will have little impact on score. Overall Personal Score is calculated by the impact of each category on the first category. If Visuals are an 8 and Audio is a 6. the overall score so far is a 7.and the rest are calculated from there.\n\nVisuals- It is PRG Maker, but damn the visuals were not subpar. Effects and environments look and feel great. Nothing extraordinary, but also nothing to complain about either. Im subtracting only because there is nothing truely gripping here. But still more than i expected from this type of game. 7/10\n\nAudio- Man Holy Priest really needs to release the soundtrack. Suited the mood perfect. Other effects were nothing at all bad, but pleasant. solid 8/10\n\nPresentation- Story telling was on point. He wrote a nice story, and told it well. Honestly for what this game is, This makes the game for me. 9/10\n\nGameplay- Simple, to the point, its satisfying, and it works perfectly. No imbalances here at all. Nothing above and beyond here though either. 6/10\n\nFun Factor- Directly to the point gameplay and narrative makes progressing this game entertaining. I wanted to continue my playthough. I didn't get bored. Honestly isnt that what we want from a game? Wasn't A top tier game. But above average for my expectations. 7/10\n\nOverall Personal Score- 7.05/10 Its free, but it very well could at least be a 1 or 2 dollar game.

But it is also not a good game. (At least not as good as the overall reviews suggest..)\nIt's nice that it is free. If it wasn't, I wouldn't want to pay much for it.\nYou can play through the whole thing 100% in 5 or 6 hours. Maybe even less. That is ok.\n\nPretty much all of the game is running around, \"attacking\" monsters (by running into them), finding some switches and occasional dialogue (or monologue).\n\nSince there are many monsters to fight, I like that the game has its own battle system and not the default one from the RPG Maker. The game would have been horribly tedious to play. All you have to do is run into the monster to attack it. Most monsters need 1-3 hits. Sadly that means the battles are pretty easy and there's no challenge at all. No tactic when to use skills or when to retreat. Boss battles are mostly the same except they have more HP and stronger attacks which you should dodge.\nAnother thing I liked however: If you run out of HP (you don't die), you simply start from the last waypoint keeping the EXP so if you really need to level up you don't have to start over since your last save.\n\nThe story is pretty basic. The idea isn't bad but I think it could have been much more. You barely get to know the characters which is sad because all the way through the game and even in the endings I didn't really care about them. Nothing really unexpected happens. Most of the story is told in flashbacks and not happening \"now\". That is not bad, but it doesn't help. At some point I nearly wanted to skip through the scenes because there wasn't really new information, just another scene displaying the already pretty clear relationship between the two main characters.\n\nSince it's free I would have liked to give a neutral rating, not a bad one. Try it if you like the RPG Maker style but don't expect much. The game is nice for a day when you're lying in bed with a cold and can't do much but don't want to sleep all day... :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1543405717, "timestamp_updated": 1543405717, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.416978746652603149", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47160989": {"recommendationid": "47160989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073105284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1480224801}, "language": "english", "review": "Very emotional story.

The Sewer Rats are infamous for beating and sexually assaulting the transsexual people(s) of Willows, Wisconsin; they have an interesting way of humiliating their victims; this is accomplished by forcing as many sewer pickles up the victim\u2019s anal cavity. \n\nBarbie\u2019s three sisters; Skipper, Stacey and Chelsea help her out this magical journey as they all bring a unique skill set to the table, Stacy for instance comes from Japanese heritage and is very good at kidnaping the dogs and cooking one or two of them up if your hunger meter gets too low. Chelsea comes from African heritage therefore she makes a very good distraction when the police inevitably come after you. And Skipper, who has one of the most interesting skill sets, is a Jew so she is extremely good with finance and handling the money you get from selling the dogs.\n\nThe story is set in Barbie\u2019s crime-riddled home town Willows, Wisconsin; which is very similar to Detroit, USA. Willows, Wisconsin is a city which is populated mostly by African American people, and packed full of crime. On just about every street corner you come across you will find at least one meth addicted homeless hooker. This adds a dark tone to the game which completely sucks you into the story line leaving you wanting to play more.\n\nAll in all \u2018Barbie and Her Sisters: Puppy Rescue\u2019 has been an absolutely amazing play for me because it doesn\u2019t hesitate to touch on dark tones such as prostitution and drug abuse. And hopefully one day when people recognize how great of a game this really is, it will reach an E-Sport level. But in my honest opinion my only \u2018huge\u2019 problem with the game is not playing it sooner, and I hope that all the people that are smart enough to pick up the game have their own extraordinary and eye opening experiences.\n\nThank you all for taking the time to read this and I hope everyone has a great day, also remember my dudes, stay positive aha that\u2019s crazy.", "timestamp_created": 1541503836, "timestamp_updated": 1541503875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448613375425338745", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45610367": {"recommendationid": "45610367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253436663", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1541281431}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will play with your emotions, be ready.", "timestamp_created": 1541282374, "timestamp_updated": 1541282374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67306816577911377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45610351": {"recommendationid": "45610351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061848774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1541280725}, "language": "english", "review": "There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said by others.

Once you defeat a final boss from a level you can't go back & you won't be able to get those crystals unless you make a new save to just start it all over. I highly recommend getting those crystals, but you can play the game without it if you chose. I just think its better to have the best gear.

Easy mode is easy enough that they aren't required at all and you can probably skip most equipment upgrades until the final area.\n\nI've got over 11 hours in this game and at least ~3 hours of that was spent grinding for those damn 'critical buff' books in the astral zones.", "timestamp_created": 1527593167, "timestamp_updated": 1529365135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455922633409500122", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42353085": {"recommendationid": "42353085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345071302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3437, "last_played": 1497033273}, "language": "english", "review": "*crying sounds in the distance*", "timestamp_created": 1527565254, "timestamp_updated": 1527565254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42352304": {"recommendationid": "42352304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255270831", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1675196547}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game, very adorable MC, story is really good, art is terrific, great music too!\nI give it 5/5 everyime!\nAnd the best part is it's free!\n", "timestamp_created": 1527560918, "timestamp_updated": 1527560918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42345478": {"recommendationid": "42345478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198837084507", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1527533544}, "language": "english", "review": "the story took a bit to pick up but it was totally worth it i should have had to pay to play this. if your liiking for a great arpg with decent graphics and easy enough game play. this one is the one you want.", "timestamp_created": 1527534109, "timestamp_updated": 1527534109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42336773": {"recommendationid": "42336773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053852957", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 474, "last_played": 1527510697}, "language": "english", "review": "-Top notch soundtrack. \n-Ok story.\n-Fun journey.\n-Good endings.", "timestamp_created": 1527511608, "timestamp_updated": 1527511608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42325994": {"recommendationid": "42325994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197854194", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1526352030}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall I really enjoyed myself playing this game.

The boss fights are unique and the bosses sprites are pretty good too. The fighting is simple but not too easy and not too hard depending how you play through this game. (If you grind the game is easy, if you just go through without grinding the game is moderately hard)\n\nNot to mention the story and characters. My god every time I play through this game there is still someone cutting onions next to me for some reason. Honestly, I did start to tear up and I did shed a couple tears due to what happens. This game plays with your emotions very well.\n\nWith my latest play through I used a mod called \"Emperium\" which fixes a lot of bugs, translations, sprites and most important adds a new ending. Though I would recommend going through all the endings I can saying that ending 4 from this mod is truly what most us wanted and was a great new ending to the game. No matter if it is your first time through or maybe looking to replay it I would highly recommend this mod as it really adds to the game without completely redoing it and losing the original game.\n\nThough this game is pretty popular I do wish it received even more love than it already has gotten.

However, I'm giving it a negative review based int he fact that it does not lives uop to the spectations that such a high ranking in steam generates. Many of the deficiencies left me without the sensation of achieving something after finishing the game or even the desire to replay the game to have all the ending.\n\nStory 3/10:\nWhile most praise its plot, it was a little too dramatic to my liking. The \"gotta save my sister\" tale just told me it was just another cliche rpg story which made it hard for me to get into it or sympathize with any of the caracters. While not being too boring, it just didn't  made me want to play more to know more about the plot. All of that made me not even sorrow at the tragic end.\n\nMusic 7/10:\nIt was most certainly the redeeming feature of this game. While the songs won't be something I download to listen over and over again. It set the atmosphere just right and wasn't distracting at all. \n\nGameplay 4/10:\nI'm a bit salty about this one. It could have been so much better. The mages and bosses fight were so good, you had to position yourself well and know when to attack it made those fights really entertaining. The minibosses and most melee monsters, however,  just stood there waiting for you to kill them. That was so boring, it didn't feel like a fight at all. Moreover the decision of the team to not have an attack botton made the controlers a lot worse than they could have been. Your character sometimes attacked automatically a nearby enemy when alll you were trying to do was dodge. Is was a real mess. What's more, the leveling balance was really off, you could destroy all the bosses except the last one just by sheer force because there is just no balance in that sistem,\n\nOverall 5/10:\nIn conlusion, while it is certainly not a masterpiece, as its ranking will have you believe, it is worth a go if you want interesting boss fights and a free steam game.", "timestamp_created": 1519878663, "timestamp_updated": 1520051842, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459927797317504883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40474445": {"recommendationid": "40474445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314216899", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1519862695}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a jewel among Steam RPG's.I gladly would've payed 5$ for this.It was amazing and I loved.A sequel would be nice if you could.It could have Senia much older and found a new dungeon where Mageleta may be and she finally finds her and battles Eternia again.", "timestamp_created": 1519862848, "timestamp_updated": 1519862848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505747139453887939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40450046": {"recommendationid": "40450046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797922807", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 879, "last_played": 1558899166}, "language": "english", "review": "great game, absolutely loved it.", "timestamp_created": 1519778654, "timestamp_updated": 1519778654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515800356864929199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40434680": {"recommendationid": "40434680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242415202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 707, "last_played": 1463210567}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple gameplay and the storyline is great, hopefully there is a part two", "timestamp_created": 1519726193, "timestamp_updated": 1519726193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515800356864929199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40431477": {"recommendationid": "40431477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070236943", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1519712720}, "language": "english", "review": "The best part, for me, is that there are only four skills in this game.

There are a few tougher boss battles but they can be played on an easier difficulty level if you wish (I played on the Normal difficulty without problems).\n\nThere is also a crafting system which is simple but effective. There are a few mini-games; for example one is a spoof of Pac-Man. There are also some very easy puzzles to add variety to the combat.\n\nGraphics are not AAA quality; this an indie game made using RPG Maker. I know a lot of people immediately dismiss RPG Maker games (because, let's face it, so many of them are bad). But in this case it's probably the best, most innovative use of RPG Maker I've seen, and the graphics are more than suitable for what the developer is trying to accomplish.\n\nThe game is mostly linear so it's basically impossible to get lost. \n\nThe plot is one of the game's strongest points. At first it seems to be a pretty straightforward quest in which a young girl (Senia) is looking for her missing sister. But as more of the plot is unveiled through short cutscenes and flashbacks things get a lot more sinister. Eventually you start to question the very basis of what you thought was your quest. At the very end the plotline branches (with savepoints nearby being nice enough to warn you!) and there are three possible endings. It took me about six hours to complete every optional quest and get all three endings. \n\nUnfortunately English is not the author's main language. So expect some spelling and grammar issues with the translation. \n\nFor some reason the game starts out in windowed mode.

That the best short summary I can give without going into spoilers.\n\nLets get the bad out of the way, I think it needs a better translator. What story that was translated is good and I\u2019ll be saying good things later, but there some little bits here and there that bother. I shouldn't care that Senia calls Magaleta sis but sometimes it just doesn\u2019t sound right when I\u2019m reading it. And second is the fairy. Now there isn\u2019t anything  wrong with the character itself but outside of gameplay, she barely does anything to the story and I forgot she was around.\n\nNow for the good. While we don\u2019t know the full relationship between the two leads, we do get flashbacks that explore how they meet and why they care so much about each other. I was getting pretty invested in by the end of the story.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game is an action RPG with a very simple battle system where you just have touch an enemy to kill them. you can get four moves to help with combat and two can be used to find secret with one being a dash and the other being a range attack and the other two are useful attacks that hit lots of enemies.\n\nNow while these are fun to use, the enemies are ridiculously easy to beat and you might not get a dent when you fight them, which is a shame since some of the enemies are pretty fun to fight like the magic users and the ones that charge at you. I think this clip from SAO abridged some up the combat perfectly\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5qZgjDBSY\n\nBut the worst fights are the king fights. There\u2019s a side quest where to get the best equipment in a level and to get the gems for the most powerful stuff, you have to kill one of the four kings in a level which look like bigger enemies. I thought these  were going to be harder fights with regular enemies but they turned out to be literal punching bags. All you have to do is use you rush attack until you\u2019re out of MP and wait till you have enough to hit them again. Sure you can die if you too careless of hitting them with your face but the penalty for death so just to go back to the last save point try again once you realize the boring tactic of waiting works on all of them.\n\nNow you might be think that the combat is a boring slog but I think its more underwhelming than anything. But I do one subject of praise are the boss fights. These are some hectic battles where they will just shot different attack or spawn enemies to deal with and these were the funnest parts of the game. The moment I fought the King Slime I saw how good this combat can be and stuck around not just to see what happens next in the story but to see what\u2019s the next big fight.\n\nPresentation:\n\nNot much to say as most of the art since most of them are just RPG Maker default sprites but the sprites for Senia and Magaleta look cute. And the original artwork looks pretty good and really give a emotional punch. And  while I don\u2019t know if all the music was from free sources, I thought it was used  pretty well.\n\nVerdict:\n\nWhile the gameplay could be a bit boring at times, the story and boss fights kept me interested.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1511953296, "timestamp_updated": 1511953296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485106378793716431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37909751": {"recommendationid": "37909751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162227157", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1511896472}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Genial!\n\nRecomendable para los que quieran pasar un buen rato, con una buena historia.", "timestamp_created": 1511897623, "timestamp_updated": 1511897657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37865805": {"recommendationid": "37865805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208963135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 361, "last_played": 1511861805}, "language": "english", "review": "Got all three endings.

The dev worked hard to make this game both smooth in gameplay yet challenging, and I was not disappointed. It doesn't take extremely long to play, around 5 or 6 hours, but those are 5 or 6 hours you wil not regret.\nOne of the big things that stood out to me was the regular enemy battle style. I like not having to enter sepereate battle scenes every time I run into an enemy but just running into them until they die (It's more satisfying than it sounds). Some enemies are fairly static, but others have special abilities or moves that require you to strategize as well. Despite not having a full-on RPG-style battle mode, armor and weapons are still important, and I enjoyed trying to gather enough materials to collect all of them. I think having a hierarchy of making one piece of equipment require the next one down allowed for actual progress in the game as opposed to just getting the highest-ranked equipment from the start, which is a smart move. \nThe boss battles were challenging, too, and are different than regular enemy encounters. They do have a battle mode where you are trapped in one area, and they are the most challenging parts of the game. This game also had multiple endings, which I always like in a game. Each game ending was special, and in one of them you get an extra boss! All I can say is that I died a few times trying to defeat her. The rest is spoilers. ;)\nThe plot was not shabby, either. It starts out giving you a classic plot line, but more is revealed as the game goes on, which leads to interesting plot twists that create a unique story from the lost-person-must-save-them archetype. The plot also leaves the endings alone, in the sense that there isn't a bias over which choices you should make at the end. Either choice is acceptable, but they lead to completely different endings, as opposed to them not mattering. It's relieving after playing some games where the choices lead to generally the same ending.\nI HIGHLY recommend this game to the casual gamer or the general RPG fan. Someone looking for hardcore Final Fantasy- style gameplay will not get that here, although those people may still enjoy the game. This is a beautifully well-rounded game that, in my opinion, has an almost perfect balance of everything.

Again, it's around 3 hours long.\n*IT'S FREE TO PLAY.*\nMost parts of basic attacking is running at the enemy, although some parts require you to press Z/enter/whatever.\nNo complicated features.\nPretty good story.\nSome endings hurt. Feels.. ouch.\nSoundtrack's pretty nice. The main song feels pretty odd in this game though.\n\nCONS:\nBosses/some minibosses' graphics aren't very well made. But it doesn't really matter in the long run, you're gonna avoid a bunch of crud in the later stages.\n\"King\" monsters are way too easy. And by way too easy, I mean they have no AI and are basically punching bags. Do look out for reflect damage though.\nTypos here and there, but easily forgiven.\n[A certain flying character] needs more screentime imo.\nWhen you try to backtrack at some parts in the first few scenes in the game, it tells you that she can't go back. ..in Chinese.

It really makes you realize how important music can be to the overall experience.*\n\nThe game and story are both short and sweet.  The story itself hits a soft spot for me, so I'm probably biased, but all things considered it's not especially unique or noteworthy on it's own.  It's good, but not unique, let's say.  \n\nLikewise, the base combat is also incredibly simple; run into enemies to deal damage.  Unfortunately, this means that you're spending a lot of time doing essentially very little, just moving from boss fight to boss fight.  The boss fights are much more spectacular, and legitimately challenging, considering how the rest of the game plays, but are also where some of the problems with the combat design present themselves.\n\nThings like hit stun, lingering hitboxes, and occassionally hard to read attacks can make some of the fights frustrating, especially on hard mode.  The boss fights frequently morph into a psuedo bullet hell style of game, but the game doesn't necessarily handle well enough to prevent you from dying to things in ways that don't feel particularly fair.\n\nHowever, all that being said, I do think that Eternal Senia was a lot of fun, and I definitely enjoyed the experience.

Emphasis and the MUCH. \nGREAT character development, wide variety of monsters and monster art, GREAT artwork, AWESOME storyline, AMAZING soundtrack, and a simple yet VERY CLEAN combat and upragding/crafting system. The game flows well enough to the point where you're actually trying to find flaws with it as someone would a $60 game. The only couple falws I'd complain about are the run-into-enemy combat, and mini bosses (that drop upgrade shards). Running into the enemy is a great idea for a simple pixel-game but debris/destrucible objects should be included. There were times I didn't know when to simply run into something, or smash the spacebar. Mini bosses should also be mobile within their area, and given an attack pattern. Same as their smaller versions would be fine but going the extra mile to give them a totally different arsenal would be the cherry on top. You could kill it by simply using skills, and waiting for your mana to refresh without taking damage. THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IS MY EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TOWARDS THIS GAME AND NOT EXACTLY PART OF THE REVIEW FOR THIS GAME.\n\nI say all this in retrospect to the fact that THIS GAME IS FREE. Not the buggy/glitchy, hardly-any-content kind of free game, but the kind of free game that makes you want to personally thank the developer(s) for pouring their heart and soul into such a masterpiece and sharing it with the rest of us. All this becomes apparent as you delve into the game with the developer(s) as you explore the bonus area they leave behind for players that finish the game. It's obvious that a lot of passion went into this game and that the developer(s) loves what they do. It's games like these that rekindle my love for gaming and drive my appreciation for it. Games like LoL, R6S, and even GW2 have become my go-to games that have left me feeling stressed, and empty afterwards. It's games like these that adhere to the very aspect of gaming; filling their players with joy, tension, sadness, guilt, sympathy, curiosity, and a sense of purpose.", "timestamp_created": 1508155555, "timestamp_updated": 1508155555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546877562999725342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35748204": {"recommendationid": "35748204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149349514", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1550954845}, "language": "english", "review": "I am absolutely blown away by this game.

I played every single boss on Hard, and the only difficulty I had was on the 3rd boss.\n\nFor a free game, I can't complain about anything. Naturally I believe assets were used from something else possibly, but the developer did the best with what they had, and gave us a masterpiece.

Se agradece que tenga un modo de crafting para desarrollar tus propias armas, pero cuidado, porque a veces necesitas materiales que estan en otro mundo y no podras regresar (recomiendo leer guias para que puedas armarte muy bien y no se te complique el juego mas adelante). El dise\u00f1o de personajes es muy colorido como sus etapas, puedes llegar a encari\u00f1arte con ellos facilmente.\n\nLo recomiendo mucho por su historia, su forma de juego muy simple pero adictivo y por su musica.

If you enjoyed the Ys I & II Chronicles (the ones with the bump system), then you'll enjoy this game as well, despite four-directional movement.  This means that whenever you bump into an enemy, you take damage as well, but since you regenerate health over time, having good armor and utilizing your combat techniques will help you last longer.\n\nSpeaking of combat techniques, they actually provide puzzle-solving opportunities.  The first one you get allows you to dash over gaps as well as providing a short burst of speed (allowing you to use as a dodge).  The third one is much more obvious, as you throw a fairy that can activate switches at a distance.\n\nThe boss battles of this game are pretty interesting.  I think that, because this game was made with some form of RPG Maker, they're sprites that are supposed to be in a turn-based combat system, because they're immobile.  Despite this, area attacks, barriers, and summoned mobs help spice up boss fights.  Not only that, before each boss fight, you have the option of selecting the difficulty.\n\nThis game is divided into a tutorial area and three major areas, each providing you with upgrade materials for different tiers of gear and stat upgrades.  Just before each area boss, there are three NPCs that reward you with items for achievements such as killing a certain number of monsters, finding all of the chests, and creating the area's legendary equipment.\n\nLast but not least, this game has three endings.\n\nThe story is a sad one about kinship, the loss of siblings, and of sacrificing one's humanity to get their ultimate wishes granted.\n\nLike the earliest Ys games, this game takes from 3-6 hours to complete, depending on how much of a completionist you are.

Essentially, you don't press any keys to trigger an attack, but rather you just run your charater into them and she will automatically swing her sword at them. After 2-3 hits tops, the monster is killed and you go on your merry way.

I love RPGs and have fun with JRPGs so I gave this a try.  The recipe for a great game is here: the game is familiar because it's in the JRPG style, but new because of the mechanics.  The mechanics are intuitive for anyone who has played action RPGs.  The story, while a little bit emotional, is really well written and the three different endings are great too.  Even more important is that everything is pretty well balanced.  There isn't only one thing that is super powerful.  The secrets are well done.

She then ventures into the tower of eternity, hoping to find her sister there. The story then flows along and we see more about their pasts, which provides more background for us to emphatise with the character.\n\nBGM : 9/10\nThe music is well put, and fits well with the scene/situation.\n\nSFX : 9/10\nthe sound effects are clean and appropriately used.\n\nOverall : 9.5/10\nI enjoyed playing it, and the only thing I am not satisfied with is how short it was (I have 100% completion in 5 or 6 hours). definitely recommending this game and looking forward to its second installment!", "timestamp_created": 1499531647, "timestamp_updated": 1511484202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33369092": {"recommendationid": "33369092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349140942", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1527259443}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE THIS GAME PLZ MAKE MORE!!", "timestamp_created": 1499507421, "timestamp_updated": 1499706280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477941185235977173", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33357952": {"recommendationid": "33357952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210083499", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1471594652}, "language": "english", "review": "When I played this game, I had fun, it was one of the first couple of games I got on steam.......

I love the good old RPG-Gamestyle and also the art style that you can see through the game. The characters develop in a wonderful way and I like that there is a little bit of a stereo type in both characters (the protective and the strong little sister). The monster have wonderful sprites and are really not hard to fight (there are some minor challenges). Good job on achieving your goal Holy Priest!\nOne of my favourite things is the music. It was emotional. Like really emotional. It made me feel happy and sad at the same time and almost no game manages to do that.\nI also really like the backgrounds and the different stages in this game.\nThen there are the endings. My favourite one is ending #3 because (SPOILER!!!)\n\n[spoiler]even though we don't really know what happens to Magaleta, I love that Senia survived (at first I thought she died lol) and is now trying to rescue her sister another time.

Easy gameplay, just \"died\" two times in a fight because I didn't pay attention to my health bar, but if you improve your skills and equipment, it won't take too much effort to beat this game. Therefore it is really relaxing, but also entertaining. I like the artstyle for Senia and Magaleta and I really wish that I could see more \"cutscenes\". \n\nSo I expected a good, fun game to play. However, after finishing the first boss and seeing more and more of Senias background story, I wanted to keep on playing it. Not merely because I wanted to level up, but to experience the story and see how it will end. Will Senia be able to find her sister Magaleta and bring her back home? Or will she forever stay in the Tower of Eternity? And the main reason, why I just have to complete it, is, that I can feel for the characters, thanks to the background stories of Senia and Magaleta. \nEternal Senia is heartwarming and yet sad, with (at least for me 'cause I'm dumb) one unexpected plot twist at the very end. It is a story about the love of two sisters, about loss, and about maturing and resolve. \nSo yeah, I was kinda overwhelmed to get such a beautiful game experience from a FREE game.

Therefore, I designed this ARPG battle system which requires no attack button to play. The simplicity brings a fluent and interesting gaming experience.\n\n\u201cFluid\u201d is definitely a good way to describe this game. It moves forward steadily, but still requires thought. The boss battles and puzzles increased in difficultly without ever becoming frustrating, which I thought was a pretty big accomplishment for such a small game. A completionist run is entirely doable without a guide thanks to the logical way in which things such as the locations of hidden chests are designed, which I appreciated. And true to the designer\u2019s intentions, it is indeed a game anyone can play.\n\nThe game is also just the right length for what it has to offer. Another dungeon would have been boring, while one less would have been really, really short.\n\nThe game follows the titular Senia, who has entered the cursed Tower of Eternity to rescue her sister, Magaleta (I spent a large part of the game wondering if this was a botched translation of \u201cMagdalena,\u201d since it\u2019s such an unnatural name linguistically). As the game progresses, Senia flashes back to the setup of their lives together and why Mag entered the tower in the first place.\n\nThe most glaring issue with the game is that the translation is very bad. The dev is Taiwanese, and it looks like he may have tried to translate it into English himself. This was a mistake, as while it\u2019s still understandable, it doesn\u2019t at any point resemble proper sentences. There were a few times I really had to guess at what he was trying to say. And worst of all, it annihilates any atmosphere the dialogue might have built and none of the characters have unique voices.\n\nI also wasn\u2019t a big fan of the true ending, since you basically end up right back where you started having accomplished nothing. It was too much of a sequel hook and not enough an actual conclusion. I\u2019m shocked at the amount of games that have this problem, actually. To me it seems obvious that when writing even a basic story you should also include an ending. I suppose the issue is that inexperienced writers don\u2019t know how to conserve interesting but unnecessary information \u2014 they see it as all-or-nothing, where the game either lays bare everything or hold all the cards close to its chest in lieu of an actual conclusion. This is one of the reasons I always tell people who want to write to read ravenously \u2014 seeing how sequels are properly set up goes a long way in not botching your own endings so badly.\n\nI also have been led to understand the game uses a lot of basic rpgmaker assets, but that doesn\u2019t really bother me and I\u2019m always confused as to why people get so high and mighty about it. Surely there\u2019s something impressive in and of itself about creating a unique-looking world from the same building blocks everyone else has. The character art, meanwhile, was clean if unremarkable.\n\n\u201cClean if unremarkable\u201d describes the whole experience pretty well, actually (except for the translation, which is entirely remarkable in how dirty it is). It offers a unique plot and relaxing gameplay, but not much else. I don\u2019t regret playing it, but I won\u2019t be watching for the sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1496258915, "timestamp_updated": 1496258915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.422943234443664551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32076066": {"recommendationid": "32076066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214078405", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 471, "last_played": 1497154531}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, would recommend this fs", "timestamp_created": 1496196696, "timestamp_updated": 1661693201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32068347": {"recommendationid": "32068347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027095128", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 371, "last_played": 1496168345}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good and free.

Every enemy is the same, except the occasional archer, which, instead of having to dodge the arrows and go in when it's safe, the game immediately gives you a special ability to deal with it thoughtlessly by using MP which the enemies give back immediately. The only enemy in the first hour of gameplay which has any thought or skill required, heck, the only one who even requires you to DODGE AN ATTACK, was the first boss, and even he takes a day and a half to charge for the only attack he really does, which changes its properties randomly halfway through the fight with no indication, and then releases slimes for you to kill and get your health back, taking away what little challenge the boss had anyway.\n\nThe story feels stock and unimaginative, and the game crams it down your throat. The main character's primary, and only, motivation throughout what I've played is to find her sister, which is shown in two ways: (1) unskippable flashback cutscenes prompted by the most contrived plot device in a video game which fail to engage the watcher in any way and end up being little more than a roadblock in the way of what little gameplay this game has, and (2) moments in the \"gameplay\" in which the main character says that \"it's dangerous to go ahead\", but she \"can't give up\" because she has to \"find her sister\", which tries to make the player sympathize with the main character, but instead only makes the character's one-dimensionality even more obvious than it already is.", "timestamp_created": 1494103387, "timestamp_updated": 1494103387, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470339506864547729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31587123": {"recommendationid": "31587123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310759141", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 818, "last_played": 1501586419}, "language": "english", "review": "good story eh gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1494095253, "timestamp_updated": 1618107705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31578611": {"recommendationid": "31578611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122882355", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 594, "last_played": 1494068928}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really great.

Normally, you would get something of this quality from something you paid around $10, $15 for. The grammar isn't the best, but that's easily something to overlook.

Until you unlock magic attacks, there is no variation in attacks at ALL. Fans of games like EverQuest and Warframe, that are used to and enjoy the larger amount of variation may not appreciate this as much as they would appreciate previously stated games. But that's not what the developer was aiming for. This isn't a game based on combat. It's very story-rich and full of puzzles. It's not very long, maybe only 6 hours if you want to get all three endings (I was lazy, so I just watched them on Youtube), and the story really does give you the feels.

It goes over and beyond the level of just something free. \n\nGAMEPLAY: Simply inspired- this was basically done to make it easy for people not really proficient in playing. I would have liked it if there was a more... immersive gameplay mode for those who wanted it, but what it has is already very good. And to think this was done in RPGMaker... gotta practice my skills there even more. Heck, in the bonus room, we see parts of the creator's process in making this and you can feel the effort, with comments on how he fine-tuned this, and test-played, making changes as needed. Still, I would have liked more detailed equips, more skills, or even a skill tree...\n\nSTORY: Story is what you would expect for such a game- short. However, unlike most free rpgs I've seen, the story here is good! No, it's not on the level of the usual RPGs I play. The game's too short, and the cast too small for that. HOWEVER, this would be a very good backstory game for one such character in a larger cast in a bigger RPG. So no complaints here, really. I'd like to see Senia in a party with going back to the tower as her more personal motivation in joining the group.\n\nMUSIC: It was pretty standard, I suppose. Not monotonous, but nothing super amazing either. Few tracks, but the short gameplay makes them stand out a bit without getting repetitive. One thing I would have liked is if the piano cutscene actually played a piano-only mix of the track...\n\nART: For most of the map sprites, it's the usual run from rpgmaker resources and other peoples stuff. Good enough, especially with the longer height sprites, but nothing much to be said. The conversational 'VN' sprites were somewhat lacking for me. They could have been done better. Plus, it would have been nice if the side characters (chest, slime, sheep, and Nia) would have conversation sprites while they talk. Same for the bosses. Speaking of which, the boss arts were pretty good, and the parallaxed maps were as well. The only thing that could have improved there was perhaps if the boss battles had the arts changing subtly, or moving like a GIF of sorts, but slow enough to keep the art quality.\n\nOTHERS: Nice autosave system.
