Minesweeper is a basic formula with a few tricks to keep it interesting, and that's all it needs to be almost endlessly entertaining. Nonetheless, it has one main issue--and unfortunately, it is the natural result of its most important asset. That issue is the random puzzle generation, which permits countless levels, including the ones that cannot be solved without the occasional random guess. Any amount of reliance on luck in a logic puzzle is frustrating, because it can make all your hard work irrelevant. \nThis is why Hexceed is an improvement on the Minesweeper formula. Every level in this game is hand-crafted to be solvable, no matter how difficult. The tradeoff is a limit to the amount of levels in the game, but.. trust me, it's nothing to worry about. Here, let's have a quick math intermission...\nI currently have 30.6 hours on record. I have completed 249 levels. That's an average of 7.23 minutes per level-- most likely skewed to be lower since I played every one of the tutorial levels (even though they were completely optional). Without purchasing any of the level packs, you are provided a total of 435 free levels (plus 36 bonus levels if you check out their social medias), or somewhere around 65 hours of free content depending on various factors.\nThis does much to establish Hexceed as a largely superior version of Minesweeper, but there's still some more things worth mentioning. As a reminder, this game is not identical to Minesweeper-- the puzzles may be similar in structure, but they are still completely unique to this game. There are special tiles and special tricks, so it provides a fresh experience to anyone who might have felt Minesweeper was getting a bit stale. Since the levels are hand-crafted, this also results in some really uniquely designed levels that creatively use all these unique tiles. And to top it all off, they added toggles for a hardcore mode, a hint feature, and a tile range highlighter, so that the difficulty level can be customized. All of this adds up to quite a lot for a completely free experience; honestly, I consider the inclusion of level packs as more of a feature that allows me to support the creators.", "timestamp_created": 1698984455, "timestamp_updated": 1698984455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149291144": {"recommendationid": "149291144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241350064", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 269, "playtime_at_review": 462, "last_played": 1700713662}, "language": "spanish", "review": "simple to play, yet addictive", "timestamp_created": 1698813201, "timestamp_updated": 1698813201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149238963": {"recommendationid": "149238963", "author": {"steamid": "76561199051494251", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 419, "last_played": 1698740661}, "language": "english", "review": "for killing time", "timestamp_created": 1698739670, "timestamp_updated": 1698739670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149177203": {"recommendationid": "149177203", "author": {"steamid": "76561199017042209", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 427, "playtime_at_review": 868, "last_played": 1700765311}, "language": "english", "review": "I would recommend adding a timing feature so there would be more challenge and fun", "timestamp_created": 1698646740, "timestamp_updated": 1700299412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149030561": {"recommendationid": "149030561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092542213", "num_games_owned": 2462, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 5144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "playtime_at_review": 3508, "last_played": 1700584940}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is a good logic game.

The base game is free, with only a little more than a hundred levels, but the developers are releasing new DLC level packs a few times per year, adding both new levels and new and interesting mechanics.\n\n[b]How hard is it:[/b] Easy to moderate, but the overall difficulty is up to you. By default the game is very helpful and forgiving, making the wrong move simply highlights your mistake and rolls back a few tiles, but to completely master a level pack you have to enable hardcore mode where a single mistake resets the whole level, not use the highlighter, not use hints, and finish the entire pack in one sitting. Still, even with all these restrictions, the vast majority of the levels are straightforward, most of the time you just use one or two rules to figure out the next move.\n\n[b]How long is it:[/b] 20+ packs of around 100-200 levels each, with new ones being added a few times per year. Most levels can be solved in 2-3 minutes, except for 5 \"milestone\" levels in each pack which require around 10 minutes to solve. Thousands of levels to finish, for a few hundred hours of playtime.\n\n[b]Level design:[/b] Good. Each level requires only logic, no guessing, many are very interesting, yet over thousands of levels they are sure to get repetitive. Thankfully, new mechanics being added every few packs add variety.\n\n[b]Quality:[/b] Good. Intuitive controls, plenty of settings, progress achievements, responsive, no bugs encountered.\n\n[b]Worth the price:[/b] Yes. The base game is free, and each level pack is around 1$ for 4-8 hours of gameplay.\n\n[b]Most positive aspect for me:[/b] Relaxing levels with interesting mechanics.\n\n[b]Most negative aspect for me:[/b] The timed flipping mechanic is bothersome, it flips tiles just as I click them which can be a mistake, and it keeps me waiting while doing nothing just to see what's on the other side. I would like it controllable, with a button to pause and a button to flip now.\n\n[b]Also consider:[/b]\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1121530/Globesweeper_Hex_Puzzler/\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/bundle/3331/Logic_Puzzle_Pack/", "timestamp_created": 1687812614, "timestamp_updated": 1687812614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140748684": {"recommendationid": "140748684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337755763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1687805372}, "language": "english", "review": "Even with the instructions posted in steam - this game does not act like instructions say.

It's free and I gladly spent a dozen hours just zoning out on it while binging a podcast in the other tab.  But just putting it out there that what you're getting for your zero dollars is a very large package of trivial by-the-motions puzzles that will probably not stretch your brainpan.\n\nThe game is basically just an expansion of Hexcells.  Mechanically, it had every right to be a direct improvement.  There's a lot of great usability options in viewing clue areas, resetting the puzzle or not if you mess up, and generally just customizing the experience well.  The additional mechanics lend themselves to the potential for very clever level design, with plenty of ways to control how you uncover the board, gate your progress, or suddenly reveal loose threads on faraway sections.\n\nBut unfortunately the actual levels rarely use them well.  In short, there's typically an extreme overabundance of clues on the board, far more than are necessary to solve things.  When you uncover a green ring or blue triangle area clue, it's about 50/50 if you'll even have to acknowledge its existence at all.  A good deal of the walls between cells don't actually constrain the logic because most of the time you approach them from completed directions that immediately uncover [i]both sides of the wall at once,[/i] and often just blow right past it with a long string of zero-cells that uncover a quarter of the map without having to apply any thought at all.  Red line and multiline clues are used only in the most basic way possible, and are never used to intersect or have any sort of consequences to each other.  Every once in a while you see a level with a decent use of the board's geometry where these clues are used to navigate split-off sections and bounce around a bit.  But most feel like someone drew a basic board shape, randomly populated it by machine, and then algorithmically verified solvability.   In any given level probably a third to half of its features more complicated than basic number cells are totally superfluous and neither assist nor impede the logical path of least resistance in any way; you'll run into several clues or walls every level and ask \"why do you even exist?\".

Since I did, I've finished the main game and the first two maps of the DLCs (bought them all IMMEDIATELY after finishing the main), and I absolutely love this game. It's challenging as heck, but thankfully not too punishing (it rewinds your progress if you accidentally click on two bombs within a certain number of clicks) and - also thankfully - not timed (I hate timed games). If you need a greater challenge (like playing it in hardcore mode - a la the original Minesweeper), there are numerous options you can set. I do have one thing to say in response to some of the other reviewers who are claiming that sometimes logic only gets you so far and there are maps where you end up having to click on random hexes to move forward. The greater majority of the time I thought I had to do that, I ended up realizing afterward what key clue that was already revealed that I failed to make the connection for the next safe move.

there was even a point where they added the symbol of a mechanic to all sides even though trough walls blocking things, it would've provided exactly the same clue as if it was the same number but using a regular clue)\n\nThere's also the way the game handles wrong clicks, you're allowed a wrong click, but another wrong click shortly after rewinds your progress a bit (but after a couple of right moves, you're out of the danger zone again and can make another mistake at no cost); I suppose that's intended to be more forgiving to mistakes whilst still punishing completely random guessing, but it doesn't work well. \nOn the one hand, because the map is designed rather than generated, it should be possible to design levels in a way that can be figured out without mistakes, thus not needing any forgiveness of mistakes (where regular minesweeper can sometimes get you in a situation where you have to guess, and thus there some forgiveness would be useful), \nwhilst on the other hand, the idea of rewinding your progress just feels annoying (although replaying the level due to a mistake would just as well be), which in regular minesweeper is no biggy because if you fail you can start a brand new randomly generated level to try and thus it would stay fresh. \nMeanwhile, because it is forgiving, it does mean that when you're stuck (even though a well designed map should always have a next logical move and no guessing) you can just guess your way out (maybe somewhat strategic as to what guess might get you the most info) and forgo the logic.\n\nEven though levels are designed, it seems like \"difficulty\" is mostly introduced by just forcing you to guess at some points (if anyone has managed to play the tutorial campaign in full based purely on logic without guessing, please let me know, because it certainly seemed like I was forced to guess at some points, but I can't guarantee that I didn't overlook anything), and by just making the levels really long (and also no QoL from original minesweeper where 0/empty cells automatically reveal all cells they pertain to, so you painstakingly have to open them manually and don't get that satisfaction of hitting a field of empty squares/hexes) even though in many cases the linearity of things means that the longer levels could've easily been split into several smaller levels.\n\nFinally, there's the way they've decided to monetise this, and instead of just having one finished game that is worth a few bucks, they have a little bit of free content followed by various DLC packs which each individually seem cheap enough that you might just buy them, but together they're more expensive than you should be paying for a game like this; even the year 1 pass which would have all the packs that were released up to that point costs more than I think a game like this could ever be worth.", "timestamp_created": 1633113940, "timestamp_updated": 1633114689, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507073462009429932", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100249972": {"recommendationid": "100249972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800393447", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2399, "last_played": 1698208097}, "language": "english", "review": "hgrghk hexagons...", "timestamp_created": 1633029784, "timestamp_updated": 1633029784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469681888818740845", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100064706": {"recommendationid": "100064706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416966822", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1689565269}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1632789259, "timestamp_updated": 1632789259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100033932": {"recommendationid": "100033932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033149268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15985, "last_played": 1688071317}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game.

I really thought I would like this one, but there's a HUGE difference between them which makes this game extremely less enjoyable. This game does not have randomized levels.

This game doesn't do that. Each level is handcrafted, which in many situations is good, but not here. There is pretty much one path to take, and you're just supposed to find the right thing to do, then do it. You can \"kind of\" fail, but it just takes you back a bit, so you need to do the thing you just did, all over again (how was that a good idea?). There is minor problem solving, and the new mechanics are actually super cool. The problem is the extremely linear aspect, and the lack of level generation.

The base game includes more levels than the average player will probably make it though, which makes it a great game to return to after some time. I definitely get cravings for time-wasting, yet engaging games to sink some time into, and this game always scratches that itch. I beat Hexcells awhile back and I have to say, this free game stacks up surprisingly well. While not as challenging, the pace of these levels is steady, and it's very satisfying to make progress at a constant rate.\n\nCons:\n\nWish there was little more diversity in level difficulty... the game seemed to start easy, increase to a medium level, then kinda just plateau. Hardcore mode basically takes on minesweeper-like cruelty, causing you to start over from scratch with a single error, which can be a fun challenge, but gets old very quickly and offers no benefits (achievements or otherwise).\nMusic is nice and very lo-fi, making it easy to get into the zone and immerse yourself in the puzzles. Only issue is that the soundtrack is very limited (4 or 5 songs at only a couple minutes apiece) so it can begin to get repetitive and (at times) grating.\n\nPros:\n\nAs I mentioned before, this game is very satisfying to steadily progress through. Most of the rewarding moments I experienced playing this game were completely intrinsic; times where I found myself zoned in and playing with a new speed and instinct as a result of practice in these puzzles.\nThe music (while limited) is very nice and a gentle backdrop to a focused puzzle session.\nBest part: THE GAME IS FREE! With its few flaws, the game is still completely free, and offers so much to those who give it a chance. I prefer it to Hexcells, a paid game. I ended up beating 100% of the base game levels and took a break from it. Came back a few months later, and they had released several new DLCs, which I ended up purchasing with the year pass for $9 (a small price to pay for extra content in a game I enjoyed completing so much).

There are also \"walls\" which block you from knowing whether there's a mine on the other side of the wall - except through inference or some of the special tiles.  Some of the puzzles can get really subtle through the interplay of these special tiles.\n\nNow, I was originally planning on suggesting that the game was changed to \"sudden death\" mode like original minesweeper, but on reflection, to avoid gaming some of the special tiles, you have to make mislabelling a mine an error as bad as stepping on a mine, which makes sudden death a bit less defensible.\n\nThe other suggestion I have is recording the time taken to complete a level & having a world leaderboard for each level - but, to prevent abuse - only make the first run through count for the leaderboard - otherwise some folks will just sit there endlessly running through levels until they get some unworldly score.  Also, instead of sudden death, add a few seconds (5?) if you make an error.\n\nAnyway, great job by the devs this is a really fun puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1618030328, "timestamp_updated": 1618030328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90039722": {"recommendationid": "90039722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211891019", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 654, "last_played": 1693203964}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game but I wish there was dark mode included", "timestamp_created": 1618021793, "timestamp_updated": 1618021793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90033556": {"recommendationid": "90033556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099276256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1753, "last_played": 1697230667}, "language": "english", "review": "Really addicting.

You will always have a valid move.\n\n\"This is Hexcells!\" - This is closer to the truth, but still not quite accurate.\n\nHexceed is a Minesweeper/Hexcells-like puzzle game, that features an few interesting mechanic changes, and generally benefits from them.\n\nFirst of all, one of the most notable things to me is that Hexceed has figured out how to handle guessing correctly.  Under Hexcells, if you guess a tile and get it wrong, there's very little cost to you.  You have an unlimited number of guesses, and in any event, once you guess wrong, you know the solution to that cell.  In Hexceed, incorrect guesses start costing you. You get a few free, but get too many, and it will start resetting parts of the puzzle, causing you to have to go back and re-figure those tiles.  It's VERY effective, and neatly solves a problem I've always had with Hexcells.\n\nThere are a few new clue-types, like multi-direction counts, and sweeps.  The former is one or more little arrows that point off in the six directions.  The number of mines in each of the directions totals up to the number in the cell.  This, I don't think, was well explained.  Sweeps show the number of mines in a triangular sector pointing out from the cell. Lastly, there's a 'wall' feature that will break off a rule.  \n\nThese new clues can be tough to get the hang of, and the game doesn't have the line- and section- marker feature that Hexcells has.  Instead, it has a single highlighter tool that will show you all the tiles that are impacted by a single clue.  That's probably the most effective teacher, so learn how to use it quickly.\n\nThat's also sort of the problem, though.  The game is constantly watching you and counting everything you do, and while it won't yell at you for using the highlighter, it will KNOW.  You aren't told until you've completed the quite long and intricate tutorial level that it has noticed that you're not perfect.\n\nThe configuration options on the game are broad and varied, allowing this game to be the right game for a broad range of people.  I think if you enjoyed Hexcells, then you will enjoy this.  If you're new to this style of game, this might not be the best place to start.  There's almost no text and nearly zero explanations of how to get going.  There's a 'clue' button, but I honestly haven't yet seen how it works.  I think the intro in Hexcells was much more gentle.\n\nBut I'm actually quite curious to hear if you find differently.  The game's tutorial levels are VERY well designed, I'm just not sure if it is enough to get started from first principles.  Regardless, it's currently free-to-play, and I've put two hours into it and have yet to be hit with an upsell.  I'm not sure you can go wrong with this one.\n", "timestamp_created": 1615431553, "timestamp_updated": 1615431553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88213735": {"recommendationid": "88213735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120154359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1647977855}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice little minesweeper game, can't complain.", "timestamp_created": 1615415163, "timestamp_updated": 1615415163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88213087": {"recommendationid": "88213087", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994154086", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 386, "last_played": 1676981849}, "language": "english", "review": "A very simple puzzle game with the perfect difficulty ramp.

Hexceed is a game so close to being a great casual timewaster, but some amateurish stumbling blocks make it more annoying than relaxing.\n\nPros:\n- You aren't exactly ripped off as the game is free.\n- Quantity. There are a lot of levels for sure.\n- It's basically hexagonal minesweeper. Not exactly a novel concept, but it's fun\n- The artstyle is pleasing for the most part.\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes you simply have to guess. And that's horrible, because even if your guesses are educated, sometimes you will mess up and feel like it's your fault even though it's not.\n- The mechanics get old really quickly. Everything is introduced very-very fast and then nothing changes.\n- Quality. The puzzles aren't very \"clever\" so to speak. You just play by the algorithm, popping hexes that are obviously safe, guessing when that's not the case. I don't really have any \"aha\" moments.\n- The size of some puzzles. I suppose this belongs in pair with the previous point as I feel like instead of clever puzzles the creators rather opted for huge puzzles. Popping 500 hexes isn't inherently harder than 50, just more time consuming.\n- The weird clue system. I get that you can choose not to use it, but to me it sort of feels like a duct tape solution to puzzles that can't be solved by logic alone. A \"Get out of jail\" perhaps. \n- Having to press auto-expand on every solved hex. Having to manually keep tab of what hexes are finished an which aren't is artificial difficulty not even the original minesweeper did. Just give us an option to automatically reveal other hexes if the conditions are met.\n\nMeh:\n- The music. I don't really care about it. It's not bad, but I usually just put in third-party music.\n\nAll in all: Yeah.. It's a free puzzler, you might get some hours on entertainment.

The biggest improvement is not being able to flag an empty cell, therefore you never have to go back and think about your past markings. Also you can go really fast, which is a lot of fun. Secondly you NEVER have to guess. And you should know that if you are doing some guessing you are missing another obvious tile. Guessing also ruins the fun and impacts the whole level if you're right or wrong so try not to that. Look further, or go into another level for awhile to clear your head. \n\nMy biggest problem with previous hexcells games was the bug that made the hexagons tingle when you hover over them and had them show their content for a split second. It ruined the whole series for me, even though I and some others wrote it to the devs, it didn't change. Thankfully we don't have that issue here.\n\nAnother mystery for me is that how some commentators thought these levels are generated by a computer. I'm not so sure about that as the game always keeps you one clue away from progressing and even if it is a computer-generation it is so expertly done.\n\nAnd of course there are some room for improvements:\n- Why some mechanics from hexcells are left out? (mines around are next to or apart from eachother) \n- Why is there sooooooooo many levels with same mechanics?\n- There can be a better UX on the menu, settings etc. \n- There should be an option to reset a level.\n- Do we really need the hints? Because when that option lights up I know that I should count the remaining mines and it kinda ruins it. \n- Also we can do with some less repetitive music.\n\nKeep up the good work guys!", "timestamp_created": 1614153989, "timestamp_updated": 1614153989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87334695": {"recommendationid": "87334695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970405069", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1654982540}, "language": "english", "review": "why not. simple, frustration free, non-railroad puzzle fun.", "timestamp_created": 1614149461, "timestamp_updated": 1614149461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481927722692489624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87325202": {"recommendationid": "87325202", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971779224", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1643410233}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it, haven't played as much, but it still managed to have me play for a couple of hours today.

Black tile thing makes this game feel even more linear and easy. And on top of that THE GAME GIVES YOU CLUES FFS. There's no risk,no sense of confusion,you don't need to think about one tile's surrounding more than maybe 5 seconds. There's no connection to other far away tiles that you must look for. Just zoom in on a particular area side scroll while you open new tiles,that's not what makes Hexcells so genius. \nAlso the 2D graphics seems very off,like when you zoom out a little bit the numbers and texts become pixelated. It feels cheap and kind of lazy.\n\nYou can try this game because it's free\nIf you're gonna buy the Year Pass DLC:don't\nHexcells Infinite is much cheaper than that even without a sale.

I felt a slight difficulty increase in world 1 and 2 but further on... nah. Most of the time you'll be revealing cells like in a medium Minesweeper game without much thought. There is also a lot of redundant information, even in late levels - very often I thought \"Oh, there's information there! ... I really didn't use or need that actually...\" There even is some Clue function I never used - you're solving stuff at 5 cells per second and the game's trying to give you clues - what?\n- Not punishing. You can make 50:50 guesses at every couple of moves and get put behind by nothing or only a couple of moves. No real incentive to think hard if you can just go by trial and error.\n- Quantity over quality. Yes, there are lots of puzzles but the general ideas behind them are rather repetitive (jumping between separate clusters, solving a puzzle from left and right, solving in a circle,...).

Every map is exactly the same every single time you play.  This means you absolutely can just guess and memorize the map if you want to suffer through that.\n\nThat said, the developers had at least enough sense to recognize this kind of blows the value of the game to just let players memorize the map, so they made the game have a system of just having a warning rather than a game over for a single wrong answer (flagging a safe area as a mine is also a wrong answer and hits you with the warning or penalty - there are no \"?\" marks you can place), and the second time you get a wrong answer, there is a penalty of a half dozen or so tiles unmarked, making you backtrack if you're blindly guessing to just ram through quickly.\n\nIf this were all there was to the game, it would be fairly good as a casual puzzle game.  The problem is they felt the need to ruin all this with scoring on different challenges designed to waste your time.\n\nOne of these is the obvious - just don't make a mistake.  There's also a \"hardcore mode\" that makes you restart from the beginning if you make a mistake, and playing with \"hardcore mode\" on is also a challenge that pairs easily with no mistakes.  Just keep in mind that some of these maps are absolutely endurance matches that have 200 mines in a map with over 1,000 tiles, and a single accidental click makes you restart.  Another challenge is not to use \"clues\".  I have no idea what \"clues\" are supposed to do, because all they do is make the unexplored grey tiles turn white, which isn't helping in the least, so just don't use the clue feature that doesn't help you, and another challenge down easy.\n\nNext revolves around not using the \"highlight\" feature that helps players see the range of things like the blue arrow arcs.  Because if you thought that a vague mechanic could use an interface to help players deal with it, it's always a good idea to just make it a \"challenge\" to make the game harder to understand!  Also, this is something you fail just by accidentally double-clicking or accidentally clicking on a hex while trying to click-and-drag to move the camera (which always starts too zoomed in).  There is an options menu to turn this off, but I didn't see it until looking after having to restart a few missions that wasted hours of my time due to misclicks...\n\nBut then there's the big one.  The challenge that is so wrong-headed it completely ruins all the fun I had with the game and means I can't enjoy going back to it any longer.  This is the challenge that says you have to play an entire chapter (with over 100 missions, each of which can take like 10 minutes, and a final mission that can take half an hour) in a single session.  If you want to go through this without repeating missions needlessly, you'd want to do all five challenges at once, of course, so if you make a single mistake, you have to repeat the whole board.  This is something that basically exists to punish anyone who turns their computer off at night, as it turns the game into a 15-hour endurance run through a chapter.  It stops being a fun distraction you can pick up and play at your leisure, it's a chore to be overcome that takes a full day's devotion.\n\nNow, I can't even go back to the game without that feeling returning even if I wanted to just play a single map and quit that I'm basically playing the game wrong by not trying to play the boring, frustrating, grueling do-it-all-in-one-go method.", "timestamp_created": 1612747753, "timestamp_updated": 1612747753, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.44350278377532959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86173479": {"recommendationid": "86173479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030240736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1698246854}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little puzzle game.

Basically, if you misclick, you get put on a cooldown counter, and if you misclick again while on cooldown, you lose progress on the puzzle.\n\nHowever, one thing I dislike about the control scheme is that if you place a flag incorrectly, the game immediately informs you of this and treats it as a mistake. I prefer the \"traditional\" minesweeper experience where you can place flags incorrectly, but only get penalized when actually click on a mine.\n\nThe levels seem to be computer generated, or at least built with computer-assisted design: while the layout of the grid was probably designed by a human, the place of mines and special tiles don't seem to have any aesthetics behind them, probably focusing solely on ensuring the level is solveable. Aside from the first one or two levels that introduces each mechanic, there doesn't seem to be much attention paid to crafting a specific intended eureka experience in the player.

Starts off easy enough with only regular cells displaying the number of neighboring 'bombs'. Fairly quickly adds a couple more and even employs a 'wall' section that prevents two adjacent cells from being treated as neighbors. I hadn't seen that in a similar game before, so thumbs up for that little innovation. Unfortunately the implementation is rather lacking. Often the wall could have been left out, not doing anything for puzzle difficulty. This also applies to other 'specialty cells', e.g. a cell displaying the number of bombs in a larger area. Quite often you don't need the extra information at all, as the regular cells provide sufficient information about the bombs in the area.\n\nThat is basically the one big complaint I have for this game: it is too easy. Difficulty never ramps up. The sheer number of puzzles will still keep you busy for a while, but puzzle design seems to have been more with quantity than quality top of mind.\nSo why do I still recommend it? Because there are probably a lot of people who enjoy the casual, easy puzzle game play. It is great for getting into the minesweeper type game.

Plus there are additional mechanics and clues to keep things interesting.\n\nWhat takes this beyond a normal free to play puzzle game is that they really refined the mechanics and puzzles to be satisfying. There is instant feedback if you make a mistake but it doesn't lose you the stage (unless you set it to hardcore). Instead it gives you a warning, and if you make another mistake within the next 10 moves or so it just undoes your last dozen moves or so. So it removes the incentive for guessing but does not set you back much at all. As you get good you may start flying through the puzzles but there is usually a few moments where you have to stop and think in each puzzle, which I really enjoy. Even 18 hours in the puzzles are never trivial.\n\nLastly, the music is really good. It is relaxing and perfect to puzzle to. There is a reason they sell the soundtrack.

There isn't an explanation to the various different rules. They don't tell you what the different tiles do, you have to figure it out on your own. This wouldn't be such a bad thing, its good to have to use your mind. But honestly they aren't strict or specific enough for a puzzle of this type. The special tiles don't have set rules for what goes around them besides their own special thing. An example, the numbers tell you how many 'bomb' tiles are around it, if it says 1 then its only touching one bomb tile, but if its a special tile that says 1 then it might not have any touching it or more than one. And more than a few times playing though the tutorial section and about half though the first area I found areas that had a couple different solutions. This might not seem like a big issue but it means the game will be more guessing than actually solving the puzzle using the games own logic. The game has achievements for perfect rounds, but you can't get perfect in a puzzle when you are only guessing the solutions.\n\nI think this is a fun variation of the old minesweeper game, but I think they need to put a little work into making sure their puzzle rules are better used and a little more obvious (such as the special tiles).", "timestamp_created": 1611814965, "timestamp_updated": 1611814965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85477249": {"recommendationid": "85477249", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998455537", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 796, "playtime_forever": 1283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1614340804}, "language": "english", "review": "hexceed is a modern twist on the old classic Minesweeper.

Save your money, and just enjoy the free version.\nPros:\n-Tutorial is easy to learn\n-There are no time limits, allowing you to play at your own relaxing pace.\n-Music is relaxing and compliments the game nicely\n\nCons:\n-The levels, while challenging to an extent, plateau in difficulty after you finish Tutorial Isle. Solving the puzzle doesn't get harder, necessarily, just takes a little more self control so you don't click too fast and lose hexagons.\n-Not enough new elements/obstacles added to the game.

An instant classic that redefines puzzle mechanics? No. Absolutely not. But is it a worth-while distraction for being a free game? Absolutely. \n\nIn short, the easiest way to explain Hexceed is \"It's hex-based Minesweeper with some extra rules on top.\" The extra rules are relatively easy to grasp, particularly if you 'discover' the feature that allows you to click and hold a hex you've already flipped to see what exact area is being calculated in the tiles number of bombs. \n\nUnfortunately, while it adds some nuance and variety to the Minesweeper formula, it still keeps one of the biggest sins of Minesweeper in regards to it being a puzzle game: Sometimes, you just have to guess. The good news here is that it's not a one-shot game over like Minesweeper, but with all the extra mechanics, I would have loved more ingenuity to completely eliminate that guessing game, rather than perpetuating it, even if they do have a sort of 'lives' system that simply removes tiles you've flipped rather than giving you a game over. While Hexceed does provide an avenue to give yourself the best odds on a guess (for example, if one area of the board has three tiles that can't have more than 1 bomb and another area has 1 bomb in 2 tiles, you have better odds flipping one of the three tiles rather than one of the two), again, I'd just prefer if there were in-built ways to always guarantee that I know what I'm flipping through clever board manipulation. \n\nA blessing and a curse is how many levels there are. I've had no major difficulties with any of the levels. Never have I gotten stuck or slowed down substantially, but I'm still only a little over a quarter of the way through the game at 4 hours of game time. THAT is a lot of content for free, which is good. The problem, though, is that it seems that all the new mechanics are introduced in the first part of the game. It's still very possible I could be wrong, but if there's no new mechanics to introduce after the first 'area', then this seems like a real slog to get through and gets really boring over any length of time longer than 10-15 minutes a day. \n\nSo if you like Minesweeper, but want something that has a little more structured variety to play for some short daily sessions when bored, Hexceed is an easy recommend.

In any other minesweeper game, when I click a cell that is a zero, it is almost a reward and a relief that more than one cell is getting removed and puts a bit a smile of satisfaction on my face.  With hexceed, you will get lots of 0 hints though out doing a puzzle, so it is less of a reward to see if I get two cells for getting that one click and instead is, how many more cells do I have to pointlessly click to get to hint where I can start marking something again.\n- This game does the cardinal sin that I cannot stand: if you click on a hex that contains a mine, you get a bad tone to tell you did wrong, this is normal   If you mark a cell that does not contain a mine, bad tone, you marked a spot that wasn't a mine, this is not normal.  Suspecting something to be a mine, and marking it to work out the thought process on some more difficult things, you cannot do that in this game.  Every click or mark you do is either right or wrong, nothing in between, requiring every click you do to be complete perfection, which almost always drives me crazy.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a novice or a beginner to these type of games, you will likely have an enjoyable time with hexceed, assuming the vast quantity of levels you find to be rewarding to do.  For people that are used to this gameplay and have moved to enjoying games far more difficult like Tametsi,  hexceed will play more like a Hex Minesweeper Jr. and will quickly lose interest.", "timestamp_created": 1611348640, "timestamp_updated": 1611348640, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538526475429534912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85159780": {"recommendationid": "85159780", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997537239", "num_games_owned": 701, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 155, "last_played": 1611342572}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice little hexcells clone, a genre of puzzle I love and am glad to see more of.

Rage-quit after about 20-25 levels.\n\nSo this is a minesweeper clone which has four basic changes:\n\n1. The levels are curated, not random, and you're given a sort of overworld \"progress\" map.  (This is cool.) \n Since levels aren't random, it doesn't make sense to \"blow up\" if you make a mistake so instead it will just roll back progress on the current level depending on the class of mistake you make.\n\n2. Levels are a hex grid, so you're evaluating 6 neighbor tiles rather than 8.  This reduces complexity a little, which isn't good or bad, but it did take me a little time to get used to the different feel.\n\n3. There are multiple extra puzzle mechanics.  I saw about four through the levels I played, and I can see how they add some extra depth and complexity to the levels.  Good!  These are inadequately explained - there is literally zero direct explanation of anything in the game beyond the controls subpage, so you have to figure out the mechanics by faffing around until you work out what the different symbols and tiles do.  The tutorial levels attempt to illustrate the mechanics in a sort of learn-by-doing way, but it's easy to miss nuances.  I can see what they were aiming for by doing it this way, but I personally don't like this style.  YMMV.\n\n4. The more advanced controls and the auto-open features from minesweeper are removed.  In minesweeper, if you chord-click (L+R) on a tile with the correct neighbor bombs marked, it opens all of the remaining neighbor tiles.  (Or you get it wrong and you blow up.)  If you click on a tile with no neighboring bombs, it clicks on all neighboring tiles for you automatically, auto chaining open all neighboring zeroes and getting you to the next fun part of the grid.  Neither of these mechanics have made it into this game, which means to solve a puzzle you must manually click on EVERY TILE.  \n\nOn a small map with 20-30 hexes, this is not a big deal.  The maps get a lot bigger than that, very quickly.  And you're left clicking on all those zeroes and their neighbors.  One.  At.  A.  Time.  I did not find that fun.  There are a lot of zeroes.  Just look at the samples they show.\n\nUltimately games like this are simple time wasters.  Puzzles give a sense of accomplishment when they can be efficiently solved, or solved in the face of real difficulty.  There may be difficulty deeper in the game than I got (honestly the puzzles were reasonably interesting) but the sheer amount of drudgery excavating the puzzles out of the filler has no interest for me.  I'd rather go grind an RPG, or wash dishes, or maybe go to work.\n\nIf they ever fix the control scheme to at least do auto-open, I might come back and really get into hexceed.  In the meantime this is a [b]solid pass[/b].\n\n(I note that a lot of the other negative reviews of this game call it out for lying about never needing to guess.  There are a couple of spots early in the tutorial where it seemed like that was the case, but after the first star level I felt like ultimately everything could be properly analyzed.  I'd take off a few points for apparent sloppiness but it did not seem to be a major problem.)", "timestamp_created": 1611204867, "timestamp_updated": 1611204867, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561911642551422119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85060773": {"recommendationid": "85060773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036978480", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1611272579}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the most addicted I ever felt while playing a puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1611188696, "timestamp_updated": 1611188696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85060633": {"recommendationid": "85060633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302545184", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 1374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1673235083}, "language": "english", "review": "Right. Well.\n\nI can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone because the game lacks a purpose. It provides so little challenge that I am unsure whether the levels are AI-generated. On the other hand I'm posting this review after solving a puzzle where I suspect I was forced to guess 3 times (bonus continents puzzle). You spend 95% of your time clicking hexes and 5% actually thinking, and that might be generous. Contrast this to a game like Tametsi in which the exact opposite ratio is true.\n\nThe developers' other game in which you literally paint by numbers is more rewarding than this by an order of magnitude as you at least have a picture at the end to show for it. The mechanics seem cool but are not used in ways that make the puzzles more challenging enough to be justifiable. As they are, it's just contrived ways of highlighting different regions with a clue. You can't even go fast through the levels because of the walls and these added mechanics so in a way they actively make the game worse, as they remove another potential way to enjoy what you are playing. The end result is pure tedium.\n\nThis is a real shame as the developers clearly put in effort and wanted to make something relaxing and enjoyable, but for me it turned out more frustrating than anything. On the (very) rare occasion that I did get stuck for more than 15 seconds I was met with the overwhelming urge to guess, as there is so little penalty for making a mistake that you can just skip through the entire game.

Each hex is numbered and offers a hint based on arrangement and hexes that came before it about which squares are safe and which are to be marked as unsafe. Click on safe to reveal more, mark unsafe to build information and work your way across the map. There's a pleasing logical loop to it all, sweeping aside the easier hexes until crunch time, where you need to deduce that if this square is marked and that hex is 3, then clearly this hex can't be marked. Or can it? Or you can take a leap of faith and click wildly. Being kinder than the actual Minesweeper hexceed won't end your round for clicking on a hazard, instead granting you a few mistakes before undoing your progress slightly. Repeated frustrated misclicks will undo more and more of the level, the game encouraging you to calm down and work your way back through things to get your mind back in order and restoring your allowance on mistakes as you do things right for a sustained period of time. Admittedly this does mean you could brute force every level with pen, paper and misclicks but hey, it's your free game, enjoy it as you like.\n\nhexceed also has a few advanced indicators, like \"X marked in this area/line\" making it a touch more sophisticated than the Minesweeper.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline broken. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1611062840, "timestamp_updated": 1611062840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417506963014602661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84975294": {"recommendationid": "84975294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037173301", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1611060071}, "language": "english", "review": "Just get Hexcells instead.", "timestamp_created": 1611061633, "timestamp_updated": 1611061633, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517434120178222656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84974090": {"recommendationid": "84974090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046234510", "num_games_owned": 2403, "num_reviews": 393, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 68, "last_played": 1688815989}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just so simple, and so it's really effective at making me realise...\n\nI might be a little stupid.", "timestamp_created": 1611059981, "timestamp_updated": 1611059981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84973445": {"recommendationid": "84973445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048996533", "num_games_owned": 507, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1681292818}, "language": "english", "review": "its minesweeper with hexagons", "timestamp_created": 1611059101, "timestamp_updated": 1611059101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 155, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.901984572410583496", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84971698": {"recommendationid": "84971698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274623088", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1692533516}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like minesweeper, but without any of the random bulls***", "timestamp_created": 1611056604, "timestamp_updated": 1611056604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84968972": {"recommendationid": "84968972", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989834659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1679069212}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth a download, its basically a different take on Minesweeper. plus you get a good amount free to try.", "timestamp_created": 1611052182, "timestamp_updated": 1611052182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84963250": {"recommendationid": "84963250", "author": {"steamid": "76561199081783541", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1641624500}, "language": "english", "review": "Its preaty fun when your bored and ive been getting bored a lot recently and would be nice on google play and/or app store 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1611042898, "timestamp_updated": 1611042898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553571403026580811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84957122": {"recommendationid": "84957122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198862924307", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1643704384}, "language": "english", "review": "CORE GAME!

While starting out the tutorial area it seems to lean a lot closer to Minesweeper, it quickly introduces unique rules that bend the standard formula back toward Hexcells while still keeping its own unique identity.\n\nUI is pleasant and - incredibly important in a puzzle game with unique rules like this - everything you need is easy to understand and within easy reach. New rules are also cleverly introduced without a written explanation and (at least across the tutorial area) ramp up gently enough for probably most to keep up with it. Clicking and holding with either mouse button on a completed tile shows you its area of effect, which makes things easy to keep track of as well.\n\nIt's probably a personal issue so I'm not going to nitpick it, but for some reason clicking to mark each tile isn't quite natural to me yet. I know what I need to do to complete each puzzle, but for some reason I'll infrequently mix up which mouse button is which. I'm more than willing to accept that is on me though.\n\nThat in mind, punishment for mistakes is very lenient and (IMO) quite clever; rather than requiring you to start over, using an intimidating scoreboard coaxing perfect performance, or allowing you to mindlessly click every spot to brute force your way through a puzzle, it sits somewhere in the middle of this tri-circle venn diagram. After a few mistakes, the most recent portion of what you filled in is removed. Obviously if you're determined enough to memorize the solutions (or just follow a guide) you can still do so, but it's not *as* easy as some other puzzle games and gently encourages you to actually learn its mechanics.\n\nAnd - at least through the tutorial - there really is no guesswork involved as the developer promised. So that is definitely a positive as well. I'm hopeful this will keep up through the whole game.\n\nMusic isn't my cup of tea, but that's also not a negative; I generally prefer to play puzzle games like this either listening to my own music or to a podcast. If anything I guess that it's easy to ignore and turn off is a positive, but I wouldn't say that in a mean-spirited way to whomever composed it. It's just not for me, and that's alright.\n\nI will definitely be seeing this through to the end, and I'm already hoping for Steam Workshop integration.", "timestamp_created": 1611030657, "timestamp_updated": 1611030657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528985500335693359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84956696": {"recommendationid": "84956696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119626184", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1611028368}, "language": "english", "review": "This game really makes me appreciate Hexcells more than I already did.

Unless I'm doing a lot worse at this than Hexcells (and I am open to the idea of missing something very obvious lol), I found myself seeing some early blind guess scenarios. That strike me as foreboding for the rest of the game, considering I only recall that issue being encountered in random generated Hexcells.\n\nThat said, this IS a free game. There are also a number of neat ideas this game brings into play that shakes up the normal Hexcells formula in interesting ways. Perhaps if I played this game to completion, I would see some great puzzle design utilizing that.\n\n If you give it a try and don't have an issue with the earlier points I brought up, you may well like it much more than I did.

Puzzles are basic and the goal is to make you feel like you're getting a lot of content so you don't think twice about dropping money for the DLC. I would recommend this for children or casual puzzlers but not for those who like putting their brain to work.[/i]\n\nTo start things off, this is a ripoff of Hexcells but instead of including a level generator with the game like Hexcells Infinite did, this game packages them up into paid DLC. That being said, there are a few things that set this game apart from Hexcells.\n\nFirstly, this game is MUCH easier. The puzzles in Hexcells felt intelligently crafted, frequently requiring you to examine multiple clues at once and think \"if I marked this hex here then one couldn't go [i]here[/i], so--aha, it would have to go [i]there[/i]!\"There are no such revelations in this game; all puzzles are braindead simple. I played through the entire tutorial set and skipped immediately to the final puzzle set and the only increase was in tedium--puzzles got much larger but without any real increase in difficulty. Matthew Brown has proven himself a skilled puzzle designer but ToastieLabs seems to have copied the puzzle concept without a real understanding of what makes a good puzzle. One telltale sign that these are simply randomly generated is the fact that puzzles will oftentimes have many clues which are completely useless; natural progression of the level will lead you to uncover all the hexes they could possibly help with and you'll never even use them. This was never the case with Hexcells; every labeled clue was an important step in the solution process. (Further supporting the idea that this developer doesn't really know what he's doing is the size of the game--there's no way this game should take up 3.5 GB).\n\nThere is no real tutorial for this game; it assumes you are familiar with the concept of Minesweeper which in 2020 is a bold assumption (and even the people who grew up with Minesweeper included on Windows probably didn't all understand the game). I'm not a big believer in hand-holding (especially for puzzle games) but I don't think it's too much to ask that the game at least tell you the objective and give some hint text explaining the controls (e.g. that you can hold down on a cell to see which cells are affected by the clue).\n\nThere are a few mechanics present here which Hexcells didn't include such as walls which block clues from affecting the adjacent cell. Ultimately, given the simplicity of the puzzles it hardly matters since these new mechanics end up pretty underutilized but it's nice to have variety. The pacing of the game is pretty bad though since rather than reveal a new mechanic with each world, it throws them all at you during the tutorial world so there isn't a whole lot to look forward to in the rest of the game.\n\nAll in all, I [i]would[/i] actually recommend this game for children or people who just want to click buttons and relax without thinking too hard. But if you're looking for a challenge, I suggest looking elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1610927901, "timestamp_updated": 1611439384, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 170, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875550389289855957", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84863256": {"recommendationid": "84863256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036836152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1628026037}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun!", "timestamp_created": 1610904337, "timestamp_updated": 1610904337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472972989082336426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84862292": {"recommendationid": "84862292", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121889511", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1617712836}, "language": "english", "review": "a very fun puzzle game that i definitely recommend and i mean its free so give a shot", "timestamp_created": 1610903220, "timestamp_updated": 1617712859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472972989082336426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84861296": {"recommendationid": "84861296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986702634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 146, "last_played": 1640733438}, "language": "english", "review": "Great puzzle game to chill to.\n\nI just finished the tutorial world.

This company has already proven to be one of the companies that has provided the best value with their paid DLCs, especially the ones they're released for Coloring Pixels.  \n\nWhile some of the paid DLC for Coloring Pixels aren't the best, the overall quality of them has been pretty good, and so this doesn't cause me any concern that they are going to be releasing a lot of paid DLC for this game.\n\nHere's the pros and cons for this game:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Unique puzzle mechanics - There are many new unique puzzle mechanics that really make this game interesting and fun to play and learn the new mechanics.\n2. Puzzle difficulty - There are many puzzle games out there (FEZ, Tametsi, Baba is You, La-Mulana) that all have puzzles that are so abstract and difficult that they aren't very fun to solve.  This game, on the other hand (so far), has had puzzles that have all been enjoyable to solve, and haven't been too difficult to solve (so far).\n3. Simplicity - This game is simplicity in and of itself.  All new mechanics introduced (with the exception of one) are very simple to figure out the new rules for and even with the downside of the game not explaining them very well, those who are already versed with these kinds of puzzle games should be able to pick up on the simplicity of the new mechanics very quickly.\n4. Full year of DLC already planned/Replayability - With each DLC adding a new world the size of one of the ones already included in the game (110-140 puzzles), this means that this game will never grow old.\n5. It's free - This game is free, and the free content offers up between 10 and 40 hours of content, which is a TON of content for a free game.\n\nNeutral:\n\n1. I'd like more puzzles that are really, really large and take a while to solve.  Currently, the puzzles are a bit too small for me to like.\n2. I'd also like there to be a possibility for some harder puzzles.  While I enjoy the puzzles and the relative ease that I am able to solve them, I'd still like there to be some puzzles that are harder.\n\nBoth of these are things that I am not going to count for or against the developers of this game as they aren't really problems with the game.\n\nCons:\n\n1. There is one mechanic in particular that can be confusing at first: The numbers with the lines on them.  I don't know how to easily fix this mechanic to make it still work as intended in the game, but this is definitely one of the mechanics that needs an explanation of how it works OR a change it how it works in order to be able to work properly in the game.\n2. Paid DLC - While I said that the paid DLC are some of the best values on Steam today, the addition of paid DLC that add achievements to the game means that you have to buy the DLC in order to 100% complete the game, and I dislike games that require you to do so.\n3. Graphics/Audio - The graphics, sound effects, and music in this game leave something to be desired and are definitely not polished in any way shape or form.  Even though they are primitive, this still isn't a big detractor because you can just turn off the sound effects and the music, and the graphics are passable for this type of game.  I just wish all three of these areas were a bit more sophisticated.\n4. Some commons mechanics for these kinds of games are missing, including: the ability to grey out information no longer relevant, the ability to pan the camera with the WASD or arrow keys, the ability to restart the puzzle if you make a mistake or just want to start over, and the ability to rebind the primary solving buttons (left and right mouse buttons).  All of these features need to be added to the game.\n\nOverall, this game is a solid puzzle game that will keep people entertained for a long time to come with its' new mechanics, number of puzzles, slight replayability, and sheer joy of solving puzzles.  While there are some things that they need to address (mainly the numbers with lines mechanic and the missing mechanics), the pros heavily outweigh the cons and I can definitely recommend this game for those that love puzzle games, especially since it's free!", "timestamp_created": 1610823193, "timestamp_updated": 1610837872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584041953086853027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84802672": {"recommendationid": "84802672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285645438", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1610917692}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome puzzle game by the creators of collouring pixels.

I also regularly purchase Nikoli's puzzle books from Japan.  In short, I'm a puzzle nerd.\n\nhexceed is a puzzle game in the vein of Hexcells and Tametsi.  It's a descendent of Minesweeper, played on a hexagonal grid; the starting clue type is exactly the same as Minesweeper's, although the game quickly introduces additional mechanics.  I won't spoil any but the first: [spoiler]walls that block \"visibility\" from nearby cells.[/spoiler]\n\nAs a puzzle type, this is well-worn territory, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I love Hexcells and Tametsi.  So far the puzzles in hexceed are much easier, and that's [i]also[/i] not necessarily a bad thing; I'm a pretty smart puzzler, but the last few in Tametsi were too difficult for me to find fun, and there's always room for \"chill puzzle solving\" in my life.\n\nThe interface is minimal but competent.  I found myself sorely wishing for Tametsi's off-by-default features, though, like cells that count down when you mark mines and the ability to doodle on top of the grid while you work out deductions.  Particularly the former.  The game also seems to run surprisingly sluggishly despite being, well, a puzzle game; I was surprised to see a secondary loading screen, and the fact that there's a frame rate option implies to me that there's something a bit odd going on, CPU-wise.  It all feels like a first, relatively polished attempt at a puzzle game by a team that hasn't done a bunch of puzzle stuff before, where customization and quality-of-life changes are pretty integral to the solving experience.  And, hey!  That's exactly what [i]hexceed[/i] is.  Hopefully it'll get there over time.\n\nAll of that said, there's no question in my mind that this is worth checking out, even here on day one when there are still bugs and interface issues to work out.  It's free to play, and there are more than enough (possibly [i]too many?[/i]) free puzzles to satisfy most folks even if they never put a penny into the game.  The mechanics are tried and true, the interface works just fine, and the relaxing music is... well... relaxing.\n\nNow if you don't mind me, it's time to solve some more of these...", "timestamp_created": 1610745127, "timestamp_updated": 1610767212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75022202730178833", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1126, "total_negative": 152, "total_reviews": 1278}, "cursors": {"AoJ4hYT5g/cCdOmlwwI=": "Thu Nov 23 16:43:51 2023"}}
