First, the story actually is very weak. Second, I knew to expect no gameplay but you still have to interact with the game quite a lot to move it forward and that part sucks terribly here.\n\nPeople are crying over a love story full of massive plot holes, zero character depth and no love expressed between the characters. They have nothing together and shouldn't have been together in the first place. It didn't move me or affect me deeply in any way.\n\nThe dev bamboozled the players and possibly even himself with time travel, recurring items that symbolize things (every artsy fartsy movie director's favorite) and a few table spoons of confusion. It gets praise in part due to the way the story is told in that it keeps the player guessing despite being told backwards - and that IS clever - but in terms of tying everything together correctly the ball is dropped pretty hard and right from the start of the game too, confusing you through no fault of your own. Even though half of it made no sense, in the end the game plays sad piano music, the normies start crying and presto: best game ever. Puhleaze.\n\nAutism spectrum disorder could and should also have been represented better with a lot more care. Players unfamiliar with it may well get the wrong idea.\n\nI had to google how to progress at one point despite having been trying to do exactly what the game wanted me to do to progress, but it hadn't worked because of the bad interface, leading me to waste my time repeatedly re-exploring the area with the belief that there must have been something else to find. The game puts you on a horse with no ability to dismount. Then to be able to click an NPC to progress you have to get right on top of him, horse and everything and click in just the right spot. Movement in general is awkward. You frequently have to click the same object 6 times in a row, this is by design. Obviously that's bad design. The game will make you wait a second after every click before the next click can be registered. Why not let the player hold the button down instead of clicking over and over?\n\nI did appreciate the overall creativity, the beautiful piano music, the witty dialogue and you do get the sense that the dev tried to get the most out of RPG Maker, creatively going as far as for example portraying a day/night transition where the sky turns red when the sun comes in. In a game with a 3D engine the engine can generate the lighting transition for you in realtime. In this case you have to appreciate that it's done with hand made pixels.\n\nLater in the game however, the dev takes getting the most out of RPG Maker XP a few steps too far. While the story builds, so does the frustration. A confusing looping action sequence with enemies, floor spikes to avoid and 'shooting' is thrown in, something that the engine isn't suitable for, causing a climax in the frustrations just before the actual story's climax where it does the most damage. It felt out of place in a game that outside of this part is like a walking sim all the way through.\n\nThere's no settings and that's bad because the music is so loud and the graphics are too pixelated for fullscreen that it defaults to. You have to figure out on your own to press Alt+Enter to switch to windowed mode and the window you then get is far too tiny. You then drag the window's edges to make the game an acceptable size. When you relaunch the game it's back in fullscreen mode and after Alt+Enter the window is tiny again.\n\nI don't always necessarily [i]regret[/i] playing a game that I write a negative review for. In this case I do and I wish I could get my 6 hours back. The majority of Steam users are casuals with low end systems and on average they are suckers for easy to play games with a \"cutesie\" 2D art style that will run on a potato. That factors into the overall rating quite a bit. If what you're looking for is a story that'll make you cry then pick up Highway Blossoms. It kicks like a mule compared to this.\n\nAfter finishing To The Moon I thought: \"What the hell, dev.... did I miss something here?\". Looking for the answer to that question I found this video uploaded 5 years ago. Huge spoilers so only watch it after you've played if you're still interested in playing. \nhttps://youtu.be/67npeQIRVLU\nI didn't miss anything. The one on the left is an actress who is generally more emotional and emotive than I am and probably has higher emotional intelligence.

Back then, I was taken aback by how good the story was. \n\nI decided to buy this game and its next 2 installments (which I am yet to play so I will reserve the right to change my opinion on this depending).\n\nMy thoughts are:\n\n- Gameplay - RPGMaker just does not produce an interesting gameplay, and this game is another example of this. Gameplay heavily requires story to do the carrying. Gameplay is also fairly linear, you do get 'hey, you gotta do this soon or bad things are gonna happen' but it does not feel said bad thing will ever happen.\n- Music - I thought it was excellent throughout, they capture feeling of melancholy and dread well through out the game, and I did get anxious when the 'dreadful' music would start.\n- Storytelling and story - Admittedly, story had significantly less impact on me than it did back when I watched the playthrough. I like the job the main characters have, and it still feels as somewhat unexplored topic, which was certainly much more the case back when the game came out. The main love story is touching, albeit I preferred the real thing over the 'wish' in the end. \n\nOverall: I think it is a good story, worth exploring in case you are one of the rare people not to go through it already.

What was supposed to be an emotional journey through an old man's memories to fulfill his final wish turned out to be a horribly offensive and inconsistent story that isn't subtle about its hatred. There isn't much gameplay, but I didn't mind that as the focus of the game is supposed to be on the story. The tone is all over the place. It aims to be a heartbreaking game, but the constant unfunny commentary from the two main characters (one of whom makes blatantly sexist remarks to his partner throughout the game) ruins any tension the game would otherwise build. This is one of very few games that features an autistic character (the game never directly tells you she's autistic, but it's heavily implied), but she is treated as a soulless husk whose abilities and limitations are wildly inconsistent. Every other character treats her as a problem to be solved, so it wasn't surprising to find out the developers have donated to Autism Speaks which is considered by autistic people to be a hate group. This game boasts its representation of neurodivergent minds but strips its character of her autonomy and turns her into an animal to be studied and ogled, and these are dangerous stereotypes that real autistic people already have to fight. I don't think any real autistic person was involved in the making of this game.

Gameplay was another fail, clunky mouse clicks here and there and thats about it; not even mentioning meaningless and annoying act 3 chase scene in the scholl halls. \n", "timestamp_created": 1698635102, "timestamp_updated": 1698635102, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458333343267440796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149159193": {"recommendationid": "149159193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093498119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1698615395}, "language": "english", "review": "If you don't mind the simple graphics and controls, this game is worth playing for the touching and unique story alone.", "timestamp_created": 1698616960, "timestamp_updated": 1698616960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149146804": {"recommendationid": "149146804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304863036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1575792303}, "language": "english", "review": "masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1698604439, "timestamp_updated": 1698604439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149112408": {"recommendationid": "149112408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349445098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1698569393}, "language": "english", "review": "When I completed To The Moon, one of the first things that I noticed was simply how underwhelmed a lot of people seemed to have felt with it. If such be from the puzzles being bad, or the story simply not being enough to touch them; and to those I can two things. First it is true that the story wont touch everyone, as while I thought is was a fantastically moving piece, I can understand some situations, or real life events/feelings that could lead an individual in a direction that this story will simple not touch. Things of which I believe are 100% okay, not everything is made for everyone and that is okay. The second point I have however is in the puzzles. To which I need to say that those are not the point. To The Moon does not need to have fantastic puzzles. If I am being fair I was surprised when the \"puzzles\" that are in the game came up, because I really did not expect anything like them at all. Something I can say because I believe that To The Moon should not be understood as a typical game perhaps, but a interactive book. A sentiment I can hold simply from one of the first thoughts I had when playing the opening section to the game. A moment wherein I  stopped and thought \"Wow, this game is almost like a visualisation of what it feels like to read a book, and imagine what I am reading in my head.\" because it truly does, and I am not sure if this is perhaps just my own personal experience, but the design, colours, music, everything, perfectly recreated a no-imaginary feeling of thinking about what I books words would look like. With the only difference being that fact that I could control and characters in the book, and could use them as a outlet for my emotions regarding the path set out for me. A feeling even stronger then that of which I have had with any other interactive media ever. Regardless however, I do understand that not everyone will feel that same regarding this game as I did, which is fine. But as for my personal take, I think To The Moon is brilliant, and one of now two pieces of media in my life that have truly made my cry. I felt sew attached to its story, and hope that people who are hesitant just give it a try.

I just finished the game, I bought it because all of the reviews were really good and I'm a fan of indie pixel games, so I thought that I'd definitely like it 1000%... but I felt kind of underwhelmed, not saying the game is \"bad\" in the slightest though. \n\nHmm.. the soundtrack is nice, and it did trigger some emotions for me while playing it.. but for me it was just the gameplay that really messed up my experience, maybe it's just because I'm not used to point and click type games but I swear whenever I'd click stuff to navigate the map sometimes the character would just NOT move until I started spamming a few times. The puzzles were fun though.\nAlso, the game just kept kept FREEZING it was so sad, and at some point my game crashed a few times and assets wouldn't load. I was playing the game while the background/floor tiles weren't loading and I was just walking around thinking that the ground was deliberately meant to disappear lol, I was thinking \"man... isn't the floor meant to be made out of grass? where's the grass?\".\n\nIn terms of the story.. it was interesting, it wasn't a BAD story, it was good! Just a little bit boring.. Like, I felt like I could understand what was going on, but I just couldn't get too invested even though I tried really hard to like it as much as I could. The characters were okay, I couldn't get too connected to them either because they didn't feel \"interesting\" enough but I think that's just personal preference. (Neil pissed me the fuck off lmao, but he was annoying in the funny way so I guess he's my favourite in this game.. he's a silly billy in a good way.)\n\nI saw a lot of people say that they cried during this, but I didn't feel emotional enough at the end of the game to really start sobbing - and I'm the kind of person that cries over eeeeverything, so I shocked myself with that!\n\nOverall, I'm really sad to say that I didn't like this game as much as I thought I would. I feel like the only thing I can say about it is that it was \"okay\", I don't regret buying and playing it though! It was a nice experience and I always like playing things made by indie developers... but I think it just wasn't my cup of tea, or coffee (reference to the game har har). Maybe the crashing and buffering just made me too annoyed to really immerse myself into the game, maybe if it didn't do that I would've enjoyed it more but alas... \n\nPretty ok game!", "timestamp_created": 1696137767, "timestamp_updated": 1696137767, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6067047119140625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147378052": {"recommendationid": "147378052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193328010", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1696691027}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1696099366, "timestamp_updated": 1696099366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147376796": {"recommendationid": "147376796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185096074", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1696063672}, "language": "english", "review": "do you want to go to space young man?\ndo you want to see the stars?", "timestamp_created": 1696098171, "timestamp_updated": 1696098171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147373699": {"recommendationid": "147373699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303969515", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 261, "last_played": 1696398567}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow", "timestamp_created": 1696095459, "timestamp_updated": 1696095459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147334435": {"recommendationid": "147334435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152068806", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1663193431}, "language": "english", "review": "boring", "timestamp_created": 1696056212, "timestamp_updated": 1696056212, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.403278708457946777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147318974": {"recommendationid": "147318974", "author": {"steamid": "76561199165391572", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1695642662}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best video game stories I've experienced.", "timestamp_created": 1696034928, "timestamp_updated": 1696034928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483870983123779297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147313379": {"recommendationid": "147313379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820842617", "num_games_owned": 578, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1696077763}, "language": "english", "review": "What an absolute masterpiece.

The first time I played it however, I remember I couldn't get into it (roughly had played it 10 minutes) and I dropped it. But recently, I decided to give it another shot. And boy, am I happy that I did. The game is more of a relaxing pace than other games I am used to, but the story, the characters, the music, are simply amazing. There were a lot of scenes were I felt I was tearing up.\nIt's not too long either so it definitely is worth it. So if you want something calming, sweet (in a bit of a bittersweet manner), with excellent music, I would definitely recommend.\n\nAnd now, I plan on trying out the others of the franchise :)", "timestamp_created": 1694172188, "timestamp_updated": 1694172188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145893402": {"recommendationid": "145893402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799625933", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 235, "last_played": 1694151018}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Simplemente hermoso", "timestamp_created": 1694148746, "timestamp_updated": 1694148746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145887670": {"recommendationid": "145887670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153145805", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1692310419}, "language": "english", "review": "I just have to say that this developer became one of my IMMEDIATE favorites. The price tag is well justified and I would encourage anyone who likes a great story to jump on this one - and the others (Finding Paradise, A Bird Story, and Imposter Factory) IMMEDIATELY. This is a series you NEED in your library.\n\nThe thing that makes these titles so special is the fact that they're very thoughtful and have complicated storylines, and they run the gamut of content - from light and funny, to dark and serious, to hopeful, heart-broken, upset, happy, and everything in between. This series is one of those that when you start one of the games, you just won't be able to stop until it's finished, and each one has a lot of content/story. Once you start playing, you'll be gripped by it and just HAVE to know how things turn out.. and you'll probably sit there playing until it's done. AMAZING, AMAZING stories.\n\nBasic concept (which, I don't think this will be a spoiler, but I'll hide it anyway): [spoiler] Ever had something you know you're going to regret on your deathbed? Maybe you wish you had done this thing, or made that choice. Now your life is over, and you're regretting how things turned out. What if there was a way to truly believe you HAD done that thing or made that choice? The company Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene work at does just that - on your deathbed, they burrow into your memories, find out what makes you tick, and implant a series of new memories into your head - overwriting the old memories - so that as you pass away, you do so happy with the way things turn out.[/spoiler]\n\nThe great thing about each story is diving into it, figuring out what makes each character tick, finding out all about them... and it's told in such an amazing way. I can't tell you enough how fantastic this developer is at telling stories.\n\nMy recommendation is to play them in order. While each episode is a \"self-contained\" episode, it really benefits the player to play them in order. Kinda like how if you watch different episodes of your favorite TV show... sure, each show might be a self-contained story, but you don't get the full context unless you watch them in order.\n\nTo The Moon\nFinding Paradise\nA Bird Story\nImposter Factory\n\nSome folks might disagree and say A Bird Story should come before Finding Paradise, since it sorta comes chronologically before FP... But one of the things that makes each story great is \"getting to know\" the people involved... and I feel like \"A Bird Story\" is better viewed as the \"deleted scenes\" of a movie, rather than as a prequel. If you watch the deleted scenes on a DVD first, maybe it won't \"spoil\" the movie, but it just doesn't feel right. Play FP first, and then dive a little deeper with ABS.\n\nGet all 4 of these immediately. This is one of the few storyline games that got me a little choked up. I absolutely LOVE the characters and every bit of these stories was phenomenal. I couldn't possibly recommend them any more. They are well worth the full price. I had... SO much fun, and I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting the next chapters from this developer. STUNNING story. Easy gameplay.

'to the moon' seems to have inspired some aspects of the hit indie game 'stardew valley'. the sprite of younger john's head, the size of the elevator, the proportions of the people to the buildings etc. are uncanny.

This review embarks on a meticulous exploration of the game's multifaceted layers, unraveling the delicate interplay of storytelling, mechanics, and design that establishes \"To the Moon\" as a seminal gem within the genre. While it beckons players to traverse the poignant corridors of memory, it's imperative to illuminate both its resplendent virtues and the occasional shadows that mar its brilliance.\n\nNarrative Poignancy and Aesthetic Prowess:\n\nFreebird Games' visual opus underscores its minimalist aesthetic with an indomitable narrative prowess. The pixelated vistas serve as a canvas for the multifaceted emotions and nuanced characters that populate \"To the Moon.\" The pixel art, seemingly modest, conceals a wealth of detail that underscores the theme of reminiscence and the dreamlike quality of traversing memories.\n\nThe game's narrative luminary is a tale of profound resonance, interwoven with themes of love, loss, and the irreversibility of time. The character arcs are meticulously constructed, evolving with an elegant subtlety that reverberates long after the final credits. While the narrative gambit of \"To the Moon\" revolves around rewriting memories, it is the authentic and emotional undercurrent that catapults this endeavor into a realm of timeless storytelling.\n\nMechanical Subtleties and Evocative Gameplay:\n\nThe gameplay of \"To the Moon\" is an understated orchestra, wherein the symphonic mechanics resonate in harmony with the narrative's emotional cadence. The core conceit of navigating backwards through a character's memories is an ingenious fusion of exploration and puzzle-solving, leveraging the interactive medium to yield an introspective journey.\n\nThe puzzles, albeit not overly demanding, mirror the sentiment of traversing memories \u2013 a blend of familiarity and enigma. They manifest as interludes within the broader narrative symphony, never overshadowing the storytelling's primacy. However, some players might find these puzzles somewhat simplistic, a quirk that underscores the narrative's predominance over gameplay intricacy.\n\nAudio Enchantment and Musical Alchemy:\n\nMusic, in \"To the Moon,\" transcends mere accompaniment, becoming a character in itself. Kan R. Gao's spellbinding composition maneuvers with graceful precision, punctuating the emotional crescendos of the narrative with melodic resonance. The minimalist piano-centric score is a testament to the transformative power of music in eliciting emotions and embedding players within the narrative tapestry.\n\nThe soundscape, nuanced and sensitive, resonates deeply with the game's emotional core. The sounds of rain, lapping waves, and rustling leaves entwine with the music, forging an auditory realm that amplifies the immersive experience.\n\nPacing and Narrative Rhythm:\n\nWhile \"To the Moon\" luxuriates in its deliberate pacing, it could present an occasional hurdle for players seeking a more kinetic experience. The introspective exploration of memory warrants patience, allowing the narrative's emotional reverberations to permeate the consciousness. Yet, this narrative luxury might deter players seeking a more immediate engagement.\n\nFurthermore, while the game's narrative tugs the heartstrings with grace, there exist moments where dialogue seems forced, temporarily suspending the immersive illusion and grounding players in a sense of self-awareness. This occasional discordance, though minor, merits acknowledgment within the tapestry of the overall experience.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\"To the Moon,\" a symphony composed by Freebird Games, converges interactive mechanics, narrative acumen, and emotional resonance to craft an ethereal odyssey through memory's labyrinth. Its minimalist artistry, soul-stirring narrative, and evocative score stand as testaments to the potential of games as a medium for storytelling. While its gameplay is intentionally unobtrusive, its mechanical subtleties dance in harmony with the overarching narrative cadence.\n\nThe game's journey, though basking in its deliberate pacing, might not harmonize with players seeking rapid gratification. Nonetheless, \"To the Moon\" is an exceptional testament to the artistry and emotional potency of interactive storytelling. Its narrative and themes transcend time, weaving a celestial narrative tapestry that persists as a beacon of the medium's potential for poignant, introspective exploration.", "timestamp_created": 1692485846, "timestamp_updated": 1692485846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144596680": {"recommendationid": "144596680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211855223", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1690049419}, "language": "english", "review": "!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1692482421, "timestamp_updated": 1692482421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144587880": {"recommendationid": "144587880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099267916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1692472653}, "language": "english", "review": "Try it, it's worthwhile.", "timestamp_created": 1692473189, "timestamp_updated": 1692473189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144583039": {"recommendationid": "144583039", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984606500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1644172133}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have a heart, you will be crying it out at the end.", "timestamp_created": 1692468377, "timestamp_updated": 1692468377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144578377": {"recommendationid": "144578377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146022884", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1692463872}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing story.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

On the surface, the game appears simple - the retro graphics, straightforward point-and-click gameplay, and lack of action or combat don't hint at anything profound. However, To the Moon delivers one of the most emotionally impactful stories in gaming through its brilliant narrative, multifaceted characters, and exploration of complex themes.\n\n[h2] Pros and cons [/h2]\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] \ud83d\udfe9 Positives [/th]\n[th] \ud83d\udfe5 Negatives [/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]\n- Emotional, well-written story and characters that made me cry many times\n\n- Beautiful soundtrack that enhances the storytelling\n\n- Unique premise of traversing memories to fulfill a dying man's wish\n\n- Charming pixel art visuals that match the nostalgic tone\n\n- Thought-provoking exploration of themes like love, grief, regret, and meaning\n\t[/td]\n\t[td]\n- Gameplay is very limited, mostly just dialogue and basic point-and-click\n\n- Puzzles are simple\n\n- Short playtime of around 4 hours\n\n- Some technical issues like resolution\n\n- No options menu\n\t[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\t\n\n[h2]Story[/h2]\nAt first, the premise seems straightforward - Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts exploring Johnny's memories to implant a fabricated one. But an incredibly moving romance emerges as players slowly uncover the tragic history between Johnny and River.\n\nWe start at the story's tragic conclusion, Johnny's unfulfilled wish to go to the moon before death. Working backwards heightens the mystery and creates natural dramatic irony as players know Johnny's fate before learning what befell the couple. As they explore his past, a tragic love story unfolds. In his youth, Johnny met River, a blunt but charming woman with Asperger's syndrome. Though their personalities clashed, they fell desperately in love. But when River fell ill, refusing treatment, Johnny constructed a house by a cliffside lighthouse hoping to fulfil River's dream.\n\n[h3]Story Structure[/h3]\nThe game only reveals Johnny and River's backstory in fragmented snippets, parsing vital details through memory flashbacks. Interacting with meaningful objects like Johnny's mementos or environments from his past provides satisfying detective work piecing together his relationship with River.\n\n[h3]Character Design[/h3]\n[b]Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts[/b]\nOn the surface, Eva and Neil seem like insensitive doctors just doing their job. But as the story progresses, glimpses of their personality shine through. Neil uses humour to cope with the problematic nature of his work. At the same time, Eva tries to remain professional but can't help getting invested in their clients' lives. Their cynical banter gives way to quiet reverence as Johnny's tragic story leaves them profoundly impacted.\n\n[b]Johnny and River[/b]\nAt first, Johnny seems like a curmudgeonly old man longing for his lost love. But through the memories, we learn he has a quiet tenderness beneath his gruff exterior. Meanwhile, River's Asperger's makes her logical and literal. Still, she has an astute emotional intelligence, knowing the right things to say to comfort Johnny when distressed. Their quirks complement one another, making an unlikely but perfect pair.\n\n[h2]Music[/h2]\nThe serene piano chords especially move during memory scenes as players explore poignant remnants of Johnny's past. These contemplative pieces evoke nostalgia and longing, transporting us into Johnny's mindset as he reflects on happier times with River.\n\nMeanwhile, the subdued technological sounds accompanying present-day investigation scenes nicely reflect the scientists' clinical, emotional detachment as they routinely purge dying peoples' memories. Yet slight warmness breaks through at moments, hinting that even the jaded doctors are invested in Johnny's plight. Finally, the ending song \"Everything's Alright\" provides a bittersweet closure, combining gentle piano with lyrical vocals and strings. \n\n[h2]Art Style[/h2]\nVisually, To the Moon adopts a straightforward 16-bit graphics style. Sprites move stiffly through flat, low-detail environments. However, this primitive aesthetic complements the emotional narrative rather than detracting.\n\nThe visual simplicity creates an ironic contrast with the story's sophistication. Johnny initially appears as a stereotypical grumpy old man but secretly harbours profound romantic devotion. The doctors look detached but care deeply. The deceivingly emotive pixel art style embodies the dissonance between superficial appearances and inner complexity.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\n\"To the Moon\" utilises its interactive medium to tell a resonant tale of love and loss through its unconventional reverse chronological story structure, melancholy soundtrack, and deceptively nostalgic pixel art visuals.

Not only are the controls clunky, the characters obnoxious, and the gameplay tedious at times, but it's also grossly ableist. It's made very clear that River is autistic, but the game never even uses the word \"autism\" and makes it seem like it's a bad word. They keep referring to it as \"her condition\" and going on and on about how hard it is for her husband, John, to tolerate her. Mind you, these two are supposed to be in love. He explicitly refuses to learn about her \"condition\" when given the opportunity, and also makes it clear that he only started going out with her because she was \"weird\" and \"unique\" and he didn't want to be \"boring\" so he uses her to make himself appear more interesting.\n\nI found out after playing that the creator has donated to Autism Speaks in the past. It seems he has since learned about the criticisms against Autism Speaks and no longer supports them. I think it's great that he acknowledged his mistake in supporting them, but he still has a lot to learn about autism. It's clear that he did not reach out to the autistic community during the development of this game.\n\nIt's very problematic, and honestly even if it wasn't, it's still a terrible story. It tries to be funny, then romantic, then heartbreaking, then creepy, round and round again, failing at each. By the end of the game, I hated all but a few side characters and River. I felt little more than annoyance during my playthrough. The ending was so unsatisfying, and there were a few loose threads that are never acknowledged (perhaps in a sequel but I'm not sticking around to find out).\n\nI did enjoy the soundtrack and the visuals, and I liked the idea of going through someone's memories in reverse order.

It's truly confusing seeing how they are both professionals.

While it is unique and quirky, I was drawn in by the characters and had some crazy revelations as more was revealed. The dialogue is well written, and a solid amount of the humor lands. While it can move slowly at times, the overall experience is short, and I'd say the payout is worth it.

Anyway, without spoiling the video game plot, I will simply say....it is like Pixar's 'Inside Out' mixed with that 'About Time' movie (the one with Rachel McAdams in it); you get into someone's mind and you go through a series of events back and forth, trying to link one to another, and gathering pieces of evidence here and there to overall form this main part of the video game (which involves a man's passion for space and the moon), all while dealing with various people's different emotions. Definitely have a tissue or two by your side though if it tugs at your heartstrings.

The only issue I had with the game (*or maybe the narrative-rpg genre?) is the lack of variety in gameplay. \n\nThe game had two main actions: \n1. exploring the map and interacting with artifacts and NPCs \n2. finding mementos that trigger past memories.  \n\nI feel like RPG games in general fail to give players autonomy in the narrative. Many games like To the Moon tend to rely on dialogue-based story telling instead of incorporating the narrative in the game environment itself and letting players figure things out themselves. There had been many instance where I felt like the explanatory dialogue made the game \"too easy\" and gave me no challenge as a player. In my opinion, it would have been better if I had discovered that piece of information through game artifacts or through other means. Games like in IB and Yume Nikki succeed in telling complex stories through the use of interactive items and environmental storytelling and do an excellent job at involving players in \"piecing the story together\". I am not saying that To the Moon should have followed the structure of those games, but I feel like a similar gameplay structure could have added more challenge and excitement to the players. \n\nWith that aside, I enjoyed the banter between Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts and found myself quite attached to those two when I finished the game. I felt like these two characters being there really helped brighten up the overall vibe of the game (***would just be a REALLY sad story w/o the two).\n\nI also loved the soundtrack by Kan Gao and the songs by Laura Shigihara. The OST helped me create a bigger emotional connection to the game and immersed me in the story. \n\nOverall, I'd say it is a great short game to play.

Number 2: I knew what was coming and was expecting to be hit in the feels. Number 3: I tend to overthink, and assumed that because I was now expecting to be hit in the feels, I would no longer be hit in the feels. Number 4: I was most definitely wrong. \n\nThis game was just absolutely lovely from start to finish. Right now, I'm also playing Hogwarts Legacy and even though I have 70 hours on that game versus about 6 on this, I will remember To the Moon much more vividly. It is the perfect balance between excitement, emotions, and humor. Know from the start that every moment is important. Think of it like a book and take your time. \n\nI will say that prior to playing I read reviews where the writer was disappointed in not feeling anything. I don't think the bar is very high, but you must be the type of person who enjoys (and understands) symbolism. I'd recommend watching the Pixar short Float if you have any doubts, and if you are not struck in your big squeeky center, then this game is not for you. \n\nI'm also just going to add that I am a Psychiatrist (okay... so I may have left that out when talking about my burliness). Although never stated directly, Autism is very well represented in this game. It never judges and also presents both sides of what can happen including the downsides of social training (and benefits). It is not over the top and I would not call it a mental health or Autism specific game, but it was nice to see representation done tactfully. \n\nI am soooooo soooooooo soooooo glad I got the bundle with everything including comics. This is a top notch writing crew and I know my fragile ticker is in good (and sometimes cruel) hands.\n\nADDENDUM: After writing the initial review, I felt compelled to read negative reviews. The main argument appears to be that this is not a game and the format it is presented doesn't contribute to the experience. My response (since no one asked for it) is this. \n\nQuestion 1: Is this a game? \n\nAnswer 1: Yes. Specifically, there is basically only 2 game elements. The first asks you to find important objects in a pixel setting. This largely involves either using your keyboard to walk around a scene or your mouse to hover over items looking for icon changes. Is it a masterwork in game design? No. Does it serve its purpose? Yes (more on this in question 2). The second game element is actually a rather fun puzzle presented after finding the aforementioned important items. They give you an unimportant, but still enjoyable challenge of letting you know how few clicks an ideal solve would involve. This permitted me to sit and think through 6 or so steps in my head prior to solving the puzzle. Not for everyone, but I enjoyed this as a game element by itself. That said, LET ME BE CLEAR... the game elements are very clearly secondary to the narrative. Know what you are getting... it is not Halo, Tetris, or Mario. In those games, gameplay is first while narrative second (except for Tetris which is the perfect balance between both). This is clearly story over game, and as long as you know that you are in for a cozy read with interactive elements and puzzles to break up the experience, you will have a lovely time. \n\nQuestion 2: Does it being a game add anything to the experience? \n\nAnswer 2: Yes. By actually having me engage with the environments and think about what may be important about each item highlighted, I was able to connect much more strongly than if I just watched someone play on YouTube or if it had been a movie/graphic novel. If I had been presented with story... story... story (meaning without any pauses for the game elements), I think I would have not had time to stew on what was being presented. I suppose you can read a graphic novel page or watch a video and take pauses here and there to reflect, but I personally would likely never do that. The creators use those elements to pace the experience and enhance engagement.

It starts off odd, slowly explains some parts and then hits you with a couple of emotional twists. I got the feeling as it progressed that this story could make a very good book or movie.\n\n*However* it does not make a good top-down side-scroller that looks like it was made in RPG Maker 2010.\n\nThe gameplay lets this game down so hard that I'm amazed it still has such fantastic reviews. I was so extremely bored within the first couple of hours of playing that I almost gave it up. I'm a parent without any other games to play when my kids are sleeping, so yeah I almost chose just staring at the wall or going to bed early instead of playing this. Movement, like other top-down dated RPGs, is slow, with no environment to look at while you yawn your way to the next screen. The graphics are what you'd expect to have seen 15 years ago, but I guess people just call that \"indie\" these days. The \"puzzle\" that you have to solve is repeated, over and over, and you can't avoid it if you want to progress the story. It's not a clever or new kind of puzzle. It's just the same one, getting slightly harder each time, over and over.\n\nThe dialogue, and especially jokes, included in this game are ridiculously cringe-worthy. I'm not sure how the devs created such a decent story when they don't seem to know how actual humans interact. This detracted from the story so much that it was almost completely ruined. If the story hadn't been as good as it was (in the end, anyway), then the game would be absolute garbage. Thankfully the story carried this game and raised it up to simply a slightly memorable waste of time instead.\n\nI usually love games in this genre, but normally they have some kind of atmosphere that actually helps tell the story instead of hinders the experience. Take Stories Untold, or Outer Wilds for example. Both very good games with deep, intricate stories which are [i] enhanced [/i] by the engaging gameplay. I'm not sure if anyone ever told the devs of TtM that games were meant to have at least some discernible level of fun.\n\nI cannot actually recommend this game to anyone, unless you have a bunch of time to kill with nothing else to do, and for some reason you actually like mind-numbingly boring gameplay with a single repetitive puzzle thrown in.\n\nGo read someone's synopsis of the story instead, there's gotta be some people out there with decent writing skills that are willing to type it up.\n\n\nOh yeah... and [spoiler] the Anya thing is so bloody stupid. Sure she thought they were stars when she was a kid, but she's an adult now. Letting herself die for it is insane and not a \"cute mental health thing\" as they tried to dress it up as.

Sure, it'll give you those fun SNES vibes, but it's not a visual buffet even by those standards\n- The music, however, is really enjoyable. It provided a nice background layer throughout\n\n[b]Story & Vibes[/b]\n- The story is really well done. The entire concept of implanting false memories to grant a dying wish is a fascinating idea and a philosophical can of worms, but I like how the main game sets that aside to tell you a sad story about an old dude who wishes he would have been an astronaut\n- The world building is excellent, especially if you play the two bonus episodes. As you may expect, society seems a little iffy on the concept of the technology Drs. Watt and Roselene are peddling\n- The actual dialogue is a bit of a letdown. It's got that forced wackiness to it in some points that really just comes off as trying too hard. It's a shame that it kinda takes the shine off of an otherwise fantastic narrative\n\n[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]\n- It's an adventure game, so you're mostly just walking and talking. The central gameplay loop (finding items to power a portal to the next memory) doesn't really have much appeal other than advancing the story\n- Thankfully, there is a little variety. There's puzzles from time to time, and the game throws a few loops at the player like having them chase down people on a horse or avoid computer zombies\n\n[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]\n- I'm pretty sure you could run this on anything\n- Although it played well on the Steam Deck, I'd recommend just playing it on a mouse and keyboard. There's one part that requires WASD and the arrow keys, so if you're using the M+K controller layout, that's mapped to the left stick and d-pad. It felt pretty awkward\n\n[b]Final Verdict[/b]\n- [b]7/10[/b]. I loved the story and world-building, but I wish the dialogue didn't make me roll my eyes so much.

This exploration can be slow and is often limited to only a handful of places and people, with very few side areas and 'secrets' to uncover.  At some points a puzzle mini-game will crop up - while not difficult (unless perhaps going for the 'perfect' score) these do little to add to gameplay.  There are only a few moments of player choice in the dialogues, and they have little to no impact on the story as a whole.  \n\nSimple, clean, and well-animated pixel art and sprites are able to express emotion and setting well - there is never a question of 'what is that?' when looking at the various assets.  A beautiful mix of piano and vocals are the main leads for the amazing soundtrack, with other fantastic sound design scattered throughout.\n\nAll theses criticisms and praise are connected to the same central point - they tie directly to the story.  \n\nThe people and objects that are available to interact with show and flesh out the main characters, showing their struggles and joys bit by bit.  The puzzles are there for a narrative reason, and offer a reward of another clue towards deeper insight.  The moments of choice allow the player to chose what window of perspective they want to view that moment in time from.  The music and sounds highlight key points and directly add to the plot.  The art is simple as to not distract from what should be the focus. \n\nBecause the story is the heart of this game, and it beats strong.  The emotion is incredible, both for the characters and players.  It is human and relatable, without shying away from the harder parts of life and celebrating the beauty of the better moments.  It is also willing to pose unique questions, theories, and philosophies, if one looks closer and examines the nuances and undertones of the dialogues and actions. \n\nThis is an experience best done organically and untainted by spoilers, so it is hard to say much more, but an exceptional narrative should make the audience feel, think, and question what is within.

The game seems to want to use her autism as a reason for why she doesn't ever bring it up directly but it doesn't make any sense for her demonstrated level of social function and just comes off as kinda insulting, painting her as childish and sometimes rude.

All aspects in this game is beautiful and enjoyable. But to be honest, I think it depends on which game you play first when it comes to comparing \"To the Moon\" and \"Finding Paradise.\" The premise of each game is quite similar, and if you've played one, you have a general idea of where the story goes. Since \"To the Moon\" is the first and oldest in the series, people can dive in without any expectations and enjoy the story, discovering this game has better story etc compared to later games. That being said, it's still a great experience even if you've played other Freebird games.

At its core, it's a story of love, loss, and the power of memories. But what sets it apart is the incredible connection between the two main characters, scientists Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts.\n\nFrom the moment you meet them, it's clear that Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts have a relationship that goes beyond just being coworkers. They finish each other's sentences, they bicker like an old married couple, and they have a level of trust and understanding that can only come from years of working together. It's a joy to watch them interact, even as they're dealing with the heavy subject matter of the game.\n\nBut what really makes the connection between these two characters so special is the way their stories intertwine. As they explore the memories of a dying man, they're forced to confront their own pasts and the choices they've made. And through it all, they're there to support each other, to pick each other up when they're feeling down, and to remind each other why they started this journey in the first place.\n\nWatching these two characters grow and change over the course of the game is a truly beautiful experience. They start as two strangers brought together by a job, but by the end, they've become something more - friends, partners, and maybe even something akin to family. And it's all thanks to the way their stories are woven together, creating a tapestry of memories and emotions that will stay with you long after the game is over.\n\nIn conclusion, To The Moon is a masterpiece of storytelling, and a large part of that is due to the incredible connection between Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts. Their stories are intertwined in a way that is both poignant and powerful, and their relationship is a testament to the idea that sometimes, the people who help us through the toughest times in our lives are the ones we least expect.

I say puzzle, singular. because its basically the same puzzle every time, just a different picture for the most part. t would have been nice if they would have had different puzzles for each level, just to have some variety.\n\n3rd thing, i didn't like was the music, it got annoying after a while, i played most of the game on mute because of this. \n\nanyways overall i don't recommend", "timestamp_created": 1681632249, "timestamp_updated": 1681632249, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136779464": {"recommendationid": "136779464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107039115", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1642472546}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't care for it", "timestamp_created": 1681614163, "timestamp_updated": 1681614163, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463813722133636475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136720447": {"recommendationid": "136720447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198976870706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1681533721}, "language": "english", "review": "oh my god im in so much pain download this right now", "timestamp_created": 1681534334, "timestamp_updated": 1681534334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136719345": {"recommendationid": "136719345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076291640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1681534854}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply beautiful!", "timestamp_created": 1681532495, "timestamp_updated": 1681532495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136707882": {"recommendationid": "136707882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842118337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1681517898}, "language": "english", "review": "With one of the best story games I've ever played, \nabsolutely emotional and recommendable.", "timestamp_created": 1681513112, "timestamp_updated": 1681513112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136687206": {"recommendationid": "136687206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202473796", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1679257618}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story", "timestamp_created": 1681486642, "timestamp_updated": 1681486642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136676592": {"recommendationid": "136676592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856020605", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1681572089}, "language": "english", "review": "THE ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTIONS THAT I GONE THROUGH THIS GAME \nYES YES I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME\n\n10/10 GAME\n", "timestamp_created": 1681473424, "timestamp_updated": 1681473424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136635925": {"recommendationid": "136635925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362116917", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1681407425}, "language": "english", "review": "I experienced nostalgic pain.

As they delve into his memories, they uncover fragments of his past and piece together a touching story of love, loss, and missed opportunities.\n\nThe game is filled with moments that will make you laugh, cry, and feel a wide range of emotions as you learn more about Johnny and his life.

He started making his first game, \"Quintessence: The Blighted Venom\" in September 2006. He would go on to make \"Do You Remember My Lullaby?\" in 2008, an unfinished demo of \"Lyra's Melody - The Song She Whispered to Me\" in 2009 and \"The Mirror Lied\" in 2011. Kan Gao would release \"To the Moon\" a little later on November 1, 2011. He used \"RPG Maker XP\" as game engine. \"To the Moon\" would become Kan's the most popular work.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nOne of the best story games I've ever seen.Sigmund Corporation uses a technology that can create artificial memories. They offer this as a \"wish fulfillment\" service to people on their death beds. Since these artificial memories conflict with the patient's real memories, the procedure is only legal to do on people without much time left to live. Sigmund Corp. employees Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts are tasked with fulfilling the lifelong dream of the dying Johnny Wyles. Johnny wants to go to the moon, although he doesn't know why. The doctors insert themselves into an interactive compilation of his memories and traverse backwards through his life via mementos. We play the game as Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nMusics of the game are really good. There is already a piano scene at the beginning of the game and you hear a lot of \"For River\". The tracks \"Having Lied\", \"Lament of a Stranger\" and \"Moonwisher\" are also very good. And hold on tight.. Kan Gao composed the music for the game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThere isn't much about gameplay, but sometimes when I clicked somewhere, I saw the character go to ridiculous places. The gameplay is not very good. I attribute this to the fact that it's an old indie game, but like I said, it's not a big deal. Already after a while you get used to it.\n\n[h1]In conclusion[/h1]\nThe game made me sad. One of the best games I've played recently. I probably won't forget the game in the future. I think there are very few games that can convey emotions so well. It's an original story that I have not experienced before.

[i]To the Moon[/i] explores a brilliant concept in a simple medium. Set to a modest soundtrack and accompanied by pixel art visuals, this is more like a visual novella. A novella that will pull hard at your heartstrings, but leave uncomfortable questions. \n\nI really feel for the main characters in this story - they fill a thankless and downright impossible role assisting a helpless clientele. They champion themselves as righteous, but modifying memories is a curious business whose ramifications - medical, judicial, or just plain ethical - are [i]boundless[/i]. But who among the living advocates for the dying when the dead have so little to say? Tombstones provide no testimonials and crematoriums cannot speak, so who commends you for a job well done?\n\n[i]To the Moon[/i] is a beautiful story with the shell of a game around it.

Released in 2011, just when indie games were exploding, I had never played anything like it before or since. It's an RPG, but there's no combat. It's kind of a visual novel, but there's some interactivity. The main draw is the story.\n\nYou play as two scientists, whos job is to allow dying people to relive their entire lives - and fulfill their dreams - inside their head. Our patient here is Johnny, a man whos final wish is to go to the moon. What follows is an emotional journey full of simple puzzles where we slowly piece together the pieces of Johnny's life. It's a tragic tale, sullied a bit by dialogue that at times can be \"cringe\", but on the whole the story on display here is nearly unmatched in gaming - maybe because the developer focused entirely on the story in lieu of any gameplay beyond very simple puzzles. This is fine, and exactly what the developer intended, but be warned that this game is more of an experience than a game.\n\nOne thing I have to mention is the soundtrack. This game has maybe the best soundtrack of any game I've ever played. I first played it in 2013, and while the details of the game have faded in the decade since, the soundtrack hasn't. I'm not normally one who listens to video game music outside of playing games, but I made an exception for To The Moon. When I first played this game, I downloaded the soundtrack and listened to it for months. Simply incredible.\n\nThe developer has released a few games since To The Moon and while none have had quite the cultural impact To The Moon has, they're all similarly well-reviewed and are on my list to play eventually.", "timestamp_created": 1678643946, "timestamp_updated": 1678643946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134527154": {"recommendationid": "134527154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084714761", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1678788442}, "language": "english", "review": "tears falling down", "timestamp_created": 1678612779, "timestamp_updated": 1678612779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134513149": {"recommendationid": "134513149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076345369", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1678580161}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a charming game.

Unfortunately, a lot of my thoughts on the game will come across as vastly negative. To get this right out of the way: I recommend people play this game and form their own opinion on it. To some, the story and characters may strike a cord, but to others such as myself, they fall flat and leave the story feeling hollow and empty. My issues start with the game's characters. Right off the bat we are introduced to two scientists/doctors who are tasked with delving into an old, dying man's memories to grant him his final wish: to go to the moon. These doctors' personalities are rather quickly established: Dr. Rosalene is a straight-laced individual who seems to have more empathy for the patients compared to Dr. Watts, who is seemingly largely uninterested in the patient's life and affairs and simply wants to get the job done as quickly as possible. These characters' personalities stay consistent throughout the entire game... except for one sequence. For the sake of preserving the story, i will not go into details as to what the sequence im talking about actually entails, but we as the player see a rather drastic change in these two characters' personalities and motives. Rosalene acts as though she doesn't truly care for her patient, and is instead focused only on getting the job done. Watts protests this, as he doesn't want to mess with something their patient clearly treasured. It's hard to see this swap as anything other than a need for conflict and an attempt at deepening these two characters, but it just falls flat. Instead of seeing these peeks behind the curtain and seeing this change as a logical path, it comes out of the blue. My second point of contention is , of course, the way this game handles Autism. The patient's wife, River, is shown to be autistic (as is her friend, Isabelle). Unfortunately, the game seems very dated in its portrayal of Autism, as i found that it danced around the subject as much as it possibly could, preferring to refer to it as \"Her Condition\" (cue threatening music). River's autism is even used as an explanation for why John even wants to date her in the first place, stating that by dating someone who is different, he feels as though he will be different as well. It is due to this fact that i had difficulty in becoming invested in their relationship. Though i believe John truly came to care about River, it simply became difficult to see their relationship as anything more than something built on lies and John's perceived personal gain. There's another aspect of John's character that feels vastly underutilized, as the scene where this information is relayed takes about 10 minutes to get through and is never expanded upon or explained properly. The message this game attempts to tell is very muddy and unclear to me. I genuinely cannot tell you what this game was trying to get across. My best guess is grief? If that's the case, i wholeheartedly believe that there are games out there currently that explore this theme and message infinitely better. \n\nTL:DR - This game has unfortunately become quite dated in the years since its release. However, I still recommend giving it a shot and trying it to see if it's for you. If you do decide to try it, i suggest playing it with a friend! It keeps the down-times between events entertaining :)", "timestamp_created": 1677614848, "timestamp_updated": 1677614848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133789292": {"recommendationid": "133789292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075899273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1677569943}, "language": "english", "review": "Perhaps the game's largest flaw is how lacking it is in the gameplay department. \n\nIt's a very story - focused game, and the sporadic slices of interactivity involve very basic and uninteresting environmental exploration. Yes, certain story beats and dialogue scenes can be very moving, and the music is excellent, but it's not choice - based dialogue; I'm just clicking M1 over and over, to get to the next line. Also, in an experience that's over 4 hours long, the occasionally beautiful dialogue scene isn't enough to consistently engage me.\n\nThe story has a sci - fi element of looking through someone's memories (similar to 'Inception, 'Reminiscence' and 'Maniac'), but I don't think the rules or mechanics of this technology were well - explained, and I found the plot hard to follow. This is perhaps the first time I've ever played a game that I felt would actually work better as a film or television show, since it's so focused on story and so light on gameplay. Alternatively, a 'Life is Strange' - style experience may have also been beneficial, with 3D environments and voice acting, where you can properly see the characters' faces, and read their emotions. I found the 2D top - down style unengaging.\n\nComing back to this game always felt like a chore; the roughly 4 - hour story took me 2 months to finish. Overall, I didn't think its strengths were enough to make up for what I found to be a mostly dull experience.\n", "timestamp_created": 1677573636, "timestamp_updated": 1677573636, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438246995210647583", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133779050": {"recommendationid": "133779050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171575121", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1677554441}, "language": "english", "review": "cried a lot", "timestamp_created": 1677554502, "timestamp_updated": 1677554502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133755381": {"recommendationid": "133755381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003502073", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1677700903}, "language": "english", "review": "play this game without crying challenge (impossible)", "timestamp_created": 1677522828, "timestamp_updated": 1677522828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133741212": {"recommendationid": "133741212", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960772895", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 409, "last_played": 1397431333}, "language": "english", "review": "T_T So good <3", "timestamp_created": 1677507019, "timestamp_updated": 1677507019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133661425": {"recommendationid": "133661425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041981588", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 276, "last_played": 1677332378}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was a roller coaster of emotions to play, although I feel that may in itself be a massive disservice to how impactful it as a story.\n\nTo give a brief synopsis: You play the role of two employees of a company, Dr Rosaline and Dr Watts, who's job it is to give dying people a wish that they desire to see before passing away, this particular story centering around this man, called John, wishing to go to the moon. \n\nIn order to grant this wish however, Dr Rosaline and Watts must travel all the way through John's memories until they reach his childhood to plant the idea in his head to become an astronaut. \n\nThe whole entire journey backwards through his life is full of moments of tragedy, despair, fun, love, all the sorts of things you'd expect from a person's life, with it's various twists and turns all throughout.\n\nThis game has a remarkable cast of memorable characters, all with their various quirks and personalities and interests to make them stand out and add to the story in their own unique way.  Some of which result in very funny moments in the game that gives much welcome reprieve from the heavier stuff that this game loves to throw at you.\n\nThe soundtrack is beyond beautiful, I'm not lying when I say it practically lives in my head rent-free after playing this.  These pieces do excellent jobs at adding to the scenes they're in, as well as occupy a tab on my browser when I need something to chill to.  When I'm able to, I'll definitely consider supporting the soundtrack with a purchase, I strongly recommend you do too if this OST touched you as much as it did me.\n\nThis game isn't particularly long, I managed to beat it after 4 hours of total play, but it's well worth paying \u00a38.50 for this game.  \nI'm not ashamed to admit that, despite me personally having a heart made of pure onyx, this game absolutely broke me.  I was in tears by the third hour in.

The game follows Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene as they work with patients to fulfill their desires or correct any regrets they have while on their deathbed. The case in To the Moon follows the life and story of Johnny, a man who wishes to go to the moon but can't remember why. \n\nJohnny's story starts out as a regular case for Watts and Rosalene as they progress through Johnny's life. That is until they get to early childhood which is cut off and inaccessible. The two figure that the memory isn't needed and that they would proceed with the procedure as follows but unfortunately, no matter what they do nothing seems to be working. When it seems that all hope is lost and they aren't going to be able to help Johnny with his final request they learn new information that could save the day. With time quickly running out, and Johnny in his final hours the two must make one last ditch effort to make Johnny's dream come true.\n\nThe art and music that accompanies this somber tale is both light and heavy. It mixes the light-hearted moments of childhood with the somber tones of our darker hours. There isn't a single sound that feels out of place, and each sound adds to the emotions presented by the characters' actions and musical track. The final sound truly ringing out among the final moments of Johnny's life presents both a feeling of relief and great loss. \n\nOnce again the walking speed at times seemed a little slow, and unlike in the second game where all the walking restrictions made sense, there were moments in this game where I thought otherwise due to the larger maps at points. The puzzles in this installment of the series were also fairly easy but could be harder for some due to the nature of them being flip based to reveal an image. Despite this however, I finished 90% of all the puzzles in the minimum moveset possible, and didn't find any one of them to be particularly difficult.\n\nWith that said To the Moon is a great starting point in the series, but as someone who has played the series out of order, stands alone as it's own game just fine. The idea of reliving a lifetime at the end of one's life can bring many emotions and feelings to mind. Some of these flowing back to the idea of who's truly capable of deciding who gets to play god, and the ethical nature of an artificial life being the only thing a patient will remember upon death. To the Moon made not have had the emotional impact on me that the second game had, I can see how this title if played by the right individual could evoke incredibly strong emotions. This series is best described as bittersweet. At the end of the day the patient passes with a smile on their face, but you have traversed these people's lifetimes and made artificial changes to create that smile. There is something to be said for the jobs that few appreciate, for those jobs are often the most needed.

While a handful are signposted okay with visual cues that guide you toward them, the vast majority are just senselessly chosen and placed to pad out the already painfully slow pacing of the \u201cgame.\u201d In addition to this, there are randomly scattered puzzles, many completely unrelated to the plot and with poorly designed arbitrary solutions (For example, there's a random Animorphs trivia question that doesn't even have the correct answer).\n\nBut, let\u2019s be real, none of that matters, right? To The Moon is about the AMAZING story that sets a NEW STANDARD for what games should be, right? Wrong. Wrong in a million ways. There is hardly a story here to tell, despite what the reviews will tell you. The first three quarters of the game is a mindless slog with zero substance and the least likable or interesting characters you will have ever seen. You have the two \u201cwitty\u201d scientists who serve only to undercut any even slightly serious tones the game comes close to building. The main character (the old man in the bed, not the playable characters) has zero discernible personality. The main character\u2019s wife, aka the OTHER main character is a caricature of someone with autism; she\u2019s totally incapable of expressing herself in any way (unless the plot calls for it and she all of a sudden does a complete 180), and her whole personality is just being a rude smartass because she has autism; a complete spit in the face to anyone who actually has ASD.\n\nThe game is a disjointed collection of the main character\u2019s memories, as he has asked the player to enter his mind and implant fake memories of being an astronaut because he wants to go to the moon. About three hours in, the developer must have realized he\u2019s done absolutely nothing productive with the story, because out of nowhere the final quarter of the game turns sharply into an ending almost completely disconnected from everything else. The last hour of the game is another, faster-paced series of random events, but this time with poorly written and repetitive emotional music playing over it. The game is so desperate to claw an emotional response out of its audience that it\u2019s honestly laughable, and does not earn a single one of its attempted emotional moments, though I assume the general melancholic tone of much of the game is what drives people into thinking it\u2019s deep when it\u2019s really not doing or saying anything at all. \n\nOverall, the game is just a mess, and has virtually zero redeeming qualities. I cannot recommend it for anyone to be honest, and especially today there are dozens to hundreds of well-written, beautifully crafted masterpieces that respect your time, money, and brain much more than this garbage ever could.", "timestamp_created": 1675320641, "timestamp_updated": 1675320641, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.360557228326797485", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132045716": {"recommendationid": "132045716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313439527", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1672311085}, "language": "english", "review": "Good 3-5 hour game.

That moment of realization is a powerful, pivotal part of the game.\n\nTo the Moon has been on my wishlist for years. At least five people have recommended it to me, and they all said it was a tearjerker and that I should ready some tissues.\n\nI was afraid the game would be overhyped.

The controls were frustratingly imprecise at times, but I chalk that up to its age.

"review": "I didn't really know what to expect going in; I'd just seen this game on a list of \"cozy steam games\" and liked the art style and blurb, so when I saw the sale price I snatched it up. Just finished after two sessions. Just finished after two sessions. My take:\n\nWhen it says story-driven, think \"visual novel\". You walk around and interact with people and objects, and in Act 1 (the longest act) there are several incremental simple mini-puzzles to solve. In Act 3 there's also a nifty little 'run & gun' style segment, but other than this, the game is basically reading. I wasn't into it at first, as much as I enjoy story, but I think that was cause I wasn't totally enamored with the pacing in Act 1...but when it was time for 2, man I was enthralled. All the set up was worth it, and that's all I'll say.\n\nThere was some spotlighting of neurodivergent characters which was pretty neat (and for a game over a decade old, pretty ahead of the game). I suspect someone in or related to development is in the camp given how non-existent these kinds of things are even in today's media. I mostly liked how the characters each had fairly distinctively written personalities; it helped animate the streams of text and made things feel a bit more alive.\n\nMy main gripe was also with the writing; when we catch up with the child versions of certain characters, they use some vocabulary that is absolutely unnatural for kids, and I'd been so immersed up to that point it felt [i]really[/i] jarring. It was if they were still young adults, and it was just...weird. Pretty inconsequential overall, but in a game that's all about dialogue and emotions, it hit disproportionately hard.\n\nThe other issue for me was that the game doesn't seem to support controller play. Why? This is basically a SuperNES game! It would've been much more physically comfortable for me to play with a controller than hunched over my trackpad/keyboard, just moving up right left down and interacting with things with spacebar or clicks.\n\nIf this is really your kinda game, I'd say buy it no question. If you're on the fence, I'd say the sale price is definitely worth it; as I said I'm not a huge point-and-click type, but I really enjoyed my time with this one.", "timestamp_created": 1673068783,

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

It might be a relic of this game's age, but you don't talk about someone being autistic behind doors like it's an incurable disease. It gave me *gasp! she's infertile* type of vibes.

It's the silly-bordering-stupid character and the smartass-serious character duo.\n\n It's a shame to have to say this, but this game isn't worth its normal price. I could have enjoyed the story so much, and as a tear-jerker enjoyer, reading the comments I expected to at least be fulfilled on that side. Sadly, I was constantly distracted by annoying gameplay and incoherent bits that pulled me out with a \"wait... what?\" It breaks my heart to give this a negative review because you can feel the passion and the love the devs had for this game.

It's the kind of game that each time I play it at different points of my life, there's something new I notice, new pieces I pick up and carry as I grow up. I've played it for at least the fourth time yesterday. I still cried a little.\n\nIf I were to describe the To the Moon series, it would be that they're very, very human stories about life and all the little things that make it worthwhile. It's bittersweet and tragic and messy at times, but amidst all of it are moments of hope and happiness and laughter and love, a whole lot of love.\n\nTo the Moon has a gift of storytelling that I haven't quite seen before. It has a beautiful soundtrack weaved along with the narrative, lovable and fun yet realistically flawed characters that I've grown to care so much about, and an emotional roller-coaster of a story that asks important questions and makes you take a step back and think.\n\nIf you're looking for a gem of a story you'll carry with you for years to come, please please play it. Let it take you on a ride, and don't forget to enjoy the scenery. To the Moon is my treasure, and I'll recommend it to everyone a thousand times.\n\nP.S.

But in my opinion, the plot I was presented with was incredibly lazy and frustrating to play through, to the point where I would suggest not going into the game at all if you're primarily interested in the story.", "timestamp_created": 1671892137, "timestamp_updated": 1671950263, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129173718": {"recommendationid": "129173718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130279483", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1657097022}, "language": "english", "review": "no this is not a game but it will fuck u up", "timestamp_created": 1671889461, "timestamp_updated": 1671889461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129163290": {"recommendationid": "129163290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083923735", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1671879308}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1671878918, "timestamp_updated": 1671878918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129160371": {"recommendationid": "129160371", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970237665", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 227, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1671832489}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][u]General Thoughts/Overview:[/u][/b]\n\nTLDR: A walking simulator that guides you on a cruise around an existential horror if you actually pay attention. \n\nOh boy. This one is a lot to unpack. Its odd review time again, because this is\u2026 this is something. So let\u2019s dive into it. \nFramed as a romantic and heart-warming short story, To The Moon is a pixel walking simulator interjected with a tile flipping mini-game that adds literally no value, and a couple of other poorly controlled minigames that just aren\u2019t very interesting or fun. You play as a pair of doctors for an end of life service that go into dying people\u2019s brains and alter their memories, so that they achieve a single dream they had throughout life. \nThe idea, the potential, the protagonist doctors, and the way the story is told and unpacked are all so well done that they make the experience quite pleasant\u2026 but there is something deeply wrong with the story in and of itself that I will get to.\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] Deep characters that are well thought out, have their own motivations, unique personalities and relationships, and stay true to their world views. \n[*] Emotive story that is well told, with fitting music, and decent pixel art to go along with it. It made my cold dead orbs glisten once, brought a sad smile to my face, and made me laugh my brittle, dusty, laugh out loud at least once.\n[*] The potential for this to become an *actual game* is huge. There were clearly plans for expansion throughout and I guess it was cut down to meet what was possible. I hope someday they\u2019re met.  \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] The mini game is pointless. It plays out like it might do something and ultimately doesn\u2019t. There is no consequence for taking 100 turns if you want, nor 1000. Nothing changes or is added.\n[*] I felt like the game promised the moon (hurhurhur), teasing me with mysteries to unpick, paths to follow, and a time based mechanic that would only allow me a few actions per session so everything would count. \n\nIt delivered a spam click and move around using poor controls mixed with minigames that also use poor controls. Were the story not so powerful this would be a major problem. \n[*] The lack of agency. \nThis expansion deals with this in detail, it unpicks the ending of the game as well as character develoments, so be warned. \n[spoiler]Firstly, let\u2019s look at the ending. We get no say in whether or not River should be erased in her current form. This is problematic in the sense that I agreed with Neil, not Eva.\nSecondly, let\u2019s look at what that eraser [i]means[/i]. They completely erased his life to allow him to build a delusion. It was to fulfil a last wish, yes, but does that make it morale? Was it even his actual wish? What if they were petty or vindictive people? Could anyone have known what they really did? What happens with the data of the constructed person? Is the Johnny that\u2019s a read only program, really read only? What does it mean to be sapient? Is that facet just a program? Or is it real? Could it tell? If the program is a construct using brain base data to create a reality around itself to make a life, what separates it from a biologically constructed person? The morale implications are quite vast.\nFinally. Let\u2019s talk about River. The beauty lost in this is more tragic than anything else. [i]River knew. [b]She. KNEW.[/b][/i] Through their entire lives, she knew who he was. Exactly who he was. But he didn\u2019t. We\u2019ll never know if she knew he was a twin that lost one, or if she accepted the Joey/Johnny grandma link. We\u2019ll never know if she worked that out, or pulled together [i]why he\u2019d forgotten her[/i]. But she spent years building a constellation of rabbits to try and bring him home to her. To show him that she remembered the first times, that it was more than just teenage angst. She chose a spot with its own fucking light house for Christ\u2019s sake, trying desperately to signal to him, to remind him of who he was. And she kept the platypus for what? 60 years? Eva missed the point. And destroyed it all because of wording. No delusion could have ever been as powerful, or meaningful, as John remembering, understanding, and appreciating the beauty of what River tried to give him, in her own way. Neil knew this, and understood what \u201cI want to go to the moon\u201d really meant. Robbing us of the chance to take him to the moon he wanted deep down was an absolute travesty, and swaps the story from being a touching and sombrely beautiful tale of missed opportunities and missing connection into an existential horror where the person who loves you most and is desperately trying to bring you back to yourself is erased, their efforts ground to dust and then thrown in your face as a fa\u00e7ade of merriment so you can die without the guilt of not understanding them [i]when you could have changed it so that you did in the first place[/i] \n[/spoiler][/list]\n\n[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]\n\n [list][*] Remove the minigames that add absolutely nothing to the game. \n[*] Expand on the mysteries and puzzle solving stuff. There\u2019s an entire house to explore in the present, and an entire life to explore the history of, it would have been a lot of fun if you could jump in and out, forward and back, and use the things around the house and his memories to try and unlock the passages to the next sections by filling in his memories with the data around them\u2026 possibly making mistakes along the way, changing the outcome of the story. \n[*] Provide multiple endings, based on spoiled changes. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]\n\nThe thing is, this is well worth buying and playing. It only cost a couple of quid while on off, and even though it only took me 5 hours, including stopping for dinner, putting the kids to bed, and while chatting with folks through the power of the internet (though the steam overlay didn\u2019t work, which I suppose should be a con). In terms of raw value, this gives way more weight than it costs for the feels alone.\nBut the lack of agency, the spoilerd issues, and the teased potential\u2026  \nIf you can appreciate the beauty in tragedy, then this is for you. If you don\u2019t really think philosophically, and take it at face value, it\u2019s absolutely for you. But if you think deeply, consider morale implications, outright dislike walking simulators, or are concerned about having an impact within a story, it isn\u2019t.", "timestamp_created": 1671875664, "timestamp_updated": 1671876002, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129156226": {"recommendationid": "129156226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123422809", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1672040883}, "language": "english", "review": "try not to cry challenge: impossible edition", "timestamp_created": 1671870641, "timestamp_updated": 1671870641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129148806": {"recommendationid": "129148806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198999376613", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1671932411}, "language": "english", "review": "i am currently shaking in my non-existent boots", "timestamp_created": 1671860923, "timestamp_updated": 1671860923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129146707": {"recommendationid": "129146707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398958302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1577802955}, "language": "english", "review": "Good!", "timestamp_created": 1671858211, "timestamp_updated": 1671858211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129135346": {"recommendationid": "129135346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394555577", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1671843455}, "language": "english", "review": "i have FRICKING aspergers so it took me 6 hrs to complete the game fricking getting lost and stuff but holy frick what a fricking good game..i didnt understand the story but i fricking enjoyed the music and gameplay and googled it instead ! it was a fricking good way to kill some time", "timestamp_created": 1671843911, "timestamp_updated": 1671843911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129131552": {"recommendationid": "129131552", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971204681", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1671838241}, "language": "english", "review": "I was promised crying.

[/h1] \n\nI was baited by the \"overwhelmingly positive\" reviews on Steam and it needs to be acknowledged that the story is emotional and deserves all the praise. But that's about the only positive this game has. Despite being a story-driven game, it's not justified if the game play is clunky and if the protagonists (that have 80% of dialogue) keep interrupting an otherwise smooth immersion into a heart-gripping tale. \n\nThe puzzles are repetitive and get monotonous rather quickly as little is to be achieved from tile-inverting minigames. The pixel graphics may be good to look at, but with invisible barriers everywhere, it's a dumb click-fest just to get your character to move where he/she needs to so the story can progress. \n\nThe protagonists are apathetic and constantly taking a jibe at the journey of the man whose dream they are supposed to be fulfilling which defeats the whole purpose of the story. The music is decent but the negatives of this game outweigh the positives which makes it impossible to recommend that someone pay money for this lackluster excuse of a video game. If you want to buy, make sure you pick it up during a sale, full price is undeserved. \n\nI may be in the minority in not recommending this game; I have no hesitation in paying for a 5-hour game focusing on a good story but if I had to drag myself just to get to the end and if the game itself feels like a chore, the payoff is not worth anyone's money or time no matter how good the story is.\n\nEdit: Typos fixed.", "timestamp_created": 1671434852, "timestamp_updated": 1673753203, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492307692766189575", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128832254": {"recommendationid": "128832254", "author": {"steamid": "76561199071574734", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1671421912}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't", "timestamp_created": 1671422068, "timestamp_updated": 1671422068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459290176630020142", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128829105": {"recommendationid": "128829105", "author": {"steamid": "76561199188263973", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 286, "last_played": 1692303034}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not [b] crying [/b]!

I looked up the game itself, and I initially thought this was going to be an homage to JRPG's from the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis era, like Undertale. The game itself makes a small joke about that, pretending to start up a turn-based battle, but then they just move forward.\n\nI will say, first and foremost, that I enjoy the narrative and presentation. The graphics, while simple, use a lot of muted colors and a low resolution to create a realistic atmosphere; the music is beautiful, especially the main theme, \"Everything's Alright.\"\n\nThe premise is an interesting idea, where two scientists, Eva Rosalene and Neil Watts, work together to alter a dying man's memories, to fulfill his wish to travel to the moon. As the game goes on, you see what sparked this motive, and the life he and his family had over the years. There's also several unexpected turns that leave you guessing how this man dealt with tragedies and grief that occurred in his life, and what the scientists will do to achieve their mission. I was about to HATE the ending when the female scientist went off by herself to alter the man's memories in a certain way, because it meant the man would completely forget about a huge chuck of his life, one that he should be able to remember; but then I see how she replaced his memories, and the payoff at the end, as well as her actions, felt justified.\n\nSo what's my problem here? The gameplay, or lack thereof. As I mentioned, this is not an RPG like I was expecting; it's an adventure game where you solve puzzles and use the man's memories to, in a sense, travel through time. You can't go all the way back to his earliest memories in one \"memory hop\", you have to perform numerous backwards hops over the course of the man's life. You do this by finding a \"memento\", a concrete object from the man's memories, which have to be activated using 5 \"memory links\", other objects and small details in the background found by combing over a contained environment. When you take the memory links to the memento and activate it, you solve a simple puzzle, which is flipping all the tiles to form a picture of the memento. You have to do this process at least 7 or 8 times, while watching the story play out; it gets just as repetitive, and sometimes confusing, as finding a certain number of magical glowey things in a 3D platformer to unlock the next stage. Once you've done this process enough times, you have to link the mementos together in a chain so the scientists can go back to the man's earliest memory, alter it, and set a butterfly effect into motion, thus fulfilling his wish.\n\nBut that's just Act 1! The second act of the game involve the scientists finding alternative methods to go all the way back to the man's earliest memory, which they can't immediately access; the third act of the game is watching the earliest memory, followed by a disjointed climax where Dr. Watts has to chase down Dr. Rosalene who goes off on her own to alter the man's memories, without explaining the plan to him. Throughout all of this, there's 5 or 6 detours that the scientists have to take to solve problems, and the solutions they come up with are sometimes nonsensical. \n\nAgain, I like the narrative of this game, but that's just it: this story doesn't work as a video game! The gameplay, while interactive, is so minimal, that a single playthrough just becomes a tour through set pieces, automatically moving forward in a straight line at a certain pace. The most freedom you get is talking to NPC's and looking at certain objects in the contained environments. This should've been a graphic novel or an animated movie, because it feels disjointed and bogged down as an interactive medium.\n\nEven the two free \"minisodes\" are just really short epilogues where you're wandering back and forth through the building where the scientists work.\n\nSpeaking of them, another problem I have is the two scientists as characters. Dr. Rosaline and Dr. Watts spend the WHOLE GAME constantly bickering and trying to one-up each other over the course of their mission. It's fine if they're not best of friends, or they disagree on how to go about the mission, but they don't even act professional or civil with each other; it's just mindless fighting and word games between these two. They obviously need to be there as protagonists, and they shouldn't just be blank slates, but when I follow a pair of grown adults acting like children fighting on the playground, and I have to watch the story unfold from their perspective, it ends up bringing down what's otherwise a beautiful story about seeing a dying man's dreams come true. Imagine going to a large, elaborate wedding, and you have to sit next to your two friends who spend the whole ceremony yelling at each other in the back of the venue; that's my metaphor for the scientists in this game.\n\nSo I unfortunately can't recommend this game. Watch a \"Let's Play\" on YouTube to experience the story, and then buy the soundtrack on the developers' Band Camp page, instead.

(expect [b]EVERYTHING[/b] from them).\nThe only flaw is that the game is a bit old, so there is a lot of lag, especially in the dialogues (most of the time they scroll very slowly; I even accidentally skipped some sentences because the dialogue animation was too slow).", "timestamp_created": 1669516370, "timestamp_updated": 1669517869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127141133": {"recommendationid": "127141133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262213408", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1669516241}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy conmovedor.", "timestamp_created": 1669516293, "timestamp_updated": 1669516293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127131616": {"recommendationid": "127131616", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026654328", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1694098689}, "language": "english", "review": "Muito bom", "timestamp_created": 1669511078, "timestamp_updated": 1669511078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127094844": {"recommendationid": "127094844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145151372", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 91, "last_played": 1514678611}, "language": "english", "review": "I cried, did this thing need more explanation?", "timestamp_created": 1669494409, "timestamp_updated": 1669494409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127073719": {"recommendationid": "127073719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198920437517", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 346, "last_played": 1669484503}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Banda Sonora, Historia, fue muy lindo.

He essentially became a different person and his new River was a different person as well.\n\nThis also makes me think about the scene at the doctor's office, where John declined to read the book about River's condition. Could it be that his words to Nicolas were true? Did he just like himself around River, but never really cared to understand her? That's why he was ready to overwrite the memories of real River just to be happy with a more convenient version?

In this review I will be breaking down the good, the great and the rest. Despite my praise, I believe this game is not necessarily for everyone, and I will explain why later in this review.\n\n\n- The Good -\n\nI want to start with the basics. This game\u2019s engine is a double-edged sword. For now, I will cover its merit. The engine works excellently for what this game requires of it. RPG Maker is a fantastic engine for basic game mechanics and efficient storytelling. This game just so happens to have extremely barebones game mechanics and a whole lot of story to tell in its short playtime. This game could arguably be viewed as a playable movie to an extent. What few mechanics there are boil down to movement, item collection and some small gimmicks. These gimmicks are utilised to great effect, giving the game a unique identity, despite limitation. These mechanics exist solely to serve the purposes of the story, and that is perfectly fine.\n\nThe RPG Maker engine gives the game a timelessness that allows it to remain intentionally retro in style, excusing its bare mechanics in exchange for them being utilised for storytelling. This means that despite the game being quite old, the engine\u2019s simplicity makes it feel as though it could have been released last year.\n\nThe pacing in this game, on account of its minimalistic approach to gameplay, revolves around its story. While this game\u2019s story is incredible, its pacing could arguable be seen as a little slow in some places, yet remains engaging enough throughout to be classed as \u201cgood\u201d.\n\n\n- The Great \u2013\n\nHere\u2019s the elephant in the room. The story. This game\u2019s story is what everyone should be here for. The aforementioned minimalistic game mechanics only serve to facilitate the efficient delivery of this brilliant story. While the pacing isn\u2019t perfect, the concepts, character, dialogue and overall execution of its themes more than make up for it. You will laugh, you may even cry, but what\u2019s most important is that this game will most certainly make you feel SOME way, which is sadly somewhat of a rarity in the age of the Battle Pass.\n\nCharacter development in this game is pulled off to great effect, which is done in spite of its unconventional temporal structure. I won\u2019t go any further on this in the interest of avoiding spoilers. Characters are built throughout this story, which are expanded further in the equally brilliant sequels. You will come to love these characters with time. They are given imperfections, goals and habits which make them relatable and enjoyable to experience. You will leave the presence of these characters wanting more. Some of them are the kind of characters you would be thrilled to watch buying their groceries.\n\nThis game takes a simple, yet engaging premise and expands it to the point at which it becomes something of a masterclass in emotive storytelling. This premise is not necessarily entirely unique, yet is spun in a unique enough way to push the story and its characters into positions in which they become the player\u2019s entire focus during gameplay. This game is beautiful enough that it has changed my perspective on life and death itself and helped me feel a sense of peace. I cannot say exactly how it did this without spoiling the story.\n\nThe music is incredible. Every single track will stick with you, with some of the signature tracks bringing tears to your eyes every time you hear them after the game is over. This is the kind of soundtrack to make you feel nostalgic over a game you just finished playing 10 minutes ago. Brilliant and emotionally composed - this soundtrack is a smash hit.\n\n\n- The Rest \u2013\n\nI spoke of the game\u2019s engine being a double-edged sword. This is where I describe the other edge. While the basic engine makes for great storytelling, its limitations mean this game might not be what everyone is looking for. Some people simply are not interested in a story-centric gaming experience, as they would rather just watch a movie and avoid having to walk through it themselves. This game is not for those people. If you are looking for intricate gameplay and engaging mechanics in a video game, then this is not for you.\n\nOn top of this, the RPG Maker engine has a very iconic look to it that not everyone may find appealing. Some people simply think the game looks ugly, and that is fine since it\u2019s a subjective thing. However, I would still recommend this game to those people despite that. The game\u2019s story is brilliant enough to outweigh any visual grime viewers may feel is off-putting.\n\n\nTL;DR \u2013 If you have even the slightest bit of interest in a good and engaging story, and can spare enough to pay for this game\u2019s small price, then I believe there is no better use for your money on the market.\nIf you are ONLY interested in intricate and engaging game mechanics, then look elsewhere.\n\n\nThis game is a timeless classic. Giving it a 10/10 would not be enough.\n\n\nMasterpiece/10", "timestamp_created": 1668125286, "timestamp_updated": 1668125479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125270662": {"recommendationid": "125270662", "author": {"steamid": "76561199293267373", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1668123445}, "language": "english", "review": "Ever wondered how emotional a bunch of colored squared can make you?

I assume these are common annoyances with stories/games told through the RPG Maker engine, which I haven't played many of. But I believe that gameplay and story progression speed need to be weighted against the story impact. Hence, my overall score being dragged down more than others who seem to be focused on the latter. I didn't give it too much time, but I also couldn't seem to get my gamepad to do anything in the game. I felt the need to hop to my third-party software instead of Steam Input to map KBM to gamepad and start playing from my couch in any sort of decent time.\n\nI'm glad my family member dropped out of watching around 3 hrs in, because while we can be patient for thorough world-building or storytelling (which this game somewhat did), we're also both fast readers bored by EVERYTHING being slow with this game engine. Now I can show them the last bits of impactful storytelling before jumping to the ending we've been painfully waiting and \"playing\" for. Honestly, the ending did (almost) move me to tears like many other people, and that was even with preparing and steeling myself after warnings by other reviews. The characters were a bit too casual and the jokes a bit weak for my taste, as well as the art and audio seeming average for this type of game, but the thorough look at the concept and this one man's life was impactful and well-executed.\n\nScore comparison:\nHLtB:        8.3/10 (1,501 votes)\nMetacritic: 8.8/10 (1540)\nSteam:      96% positive (48,099)", "timestamp_created": 1667760210, "timestamp_updated": 1667784279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125063283": {"recommendationid": "125063283", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072319679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1639103735}, "language": "english", "review": "The story of this game is amazing, the way your questions slowly build and build until everything is answered in one of my favorite scenes from any game ever.

Because I don't hate this game, but I also don't love it either.\n\nI was a bit oversold on this game. I think for its time it would have been brilliant, but nowadays it's a bit dated in its writing. There are a lot of antique references, some of which I'm pretty sure were old even at the time. The protagonists are inconsistent and have baffling moments where they act in such unlikable ways that I had to really hold on to like them, especially when the game's earnest and hopeful nature is frequently lampooned by their need to wisecrack. They conflict with eachother in an initially amusing way but it gets grating and even unnecessarily comes to a conflict by the end. There's a balance to be struck with that, and here it's too much for me. \n\nThe gameplay is non-existent, the puzzles are just decorative and I didn't get why they were there if they had no bearing on the story, the ending or even just for score chasing. I frequently got stuck on parts of the scenery like flowers and rocks and bushes because they've littered every scene with these decorative pieces with collision. Traversing in a top down RPG style should be much more intuitive than it was here. Every time I got placed in an outdoor environment, I let out a sigh. In fact, it's games like this that have me raising a suspicious eyebrow, questioning if they deliberately added all the walking around to pad out the length of the game. It doesn't serve the experience effectively.\n\nI'm someone that holds film to a higher regard than video games, so I have a distinctive preference between the two when it comes to certain things. For me, I need to feel my own presence in the game or have some kind of influence over the story in some shape or form, even if it's in the most minuscule way. That can be as simple as fourth wall breaks, or just some freedom to explore the environment around me. This game is aggressively linear and you have very little sway over what happens. And when the presentation is as lo-fi as this and yet requires just enough input from you to keep it moving forward, it feels like a concerted yet unnecessary effort to push the story forward and I found it hard to immerse. I didn't get the point of mashing interact on random sprites in the scene to try and unlock another memory point to progress the story. To this effect, it's very much a product of the time where Lets Plays were the preferred way to experience a game so you didn't have to do that kind of minimal interaction yourself.\n\nAnyway, all that aside, I really did enjoy what this game tried to do. It's practically a Charlie Kaufman love letter and I dig the hell out of that. But it's bogged down by its dated engine, poor gameplay and questionable character direction. I wish I'd gotten to this one back in 2011 when it was a novelty. I know this game was one of the big champions of not only independent games as an industry, but also the whole 'Are video games an art form' debate. And while I wholeheartedly agree to that notion, this game is ironically not one I would point to for this.

The memory of it is so perfect, after all, that you can't help but wonder if reliving it might spoil it in some way.\n\nI'm still working up the courage to replay Morrowind. Meanwhile, here's another one that's pretty close to my heart.\n\n[h2] What Would the Story of Your Life Look Like? [/h2]\n\nThe story follows doctors Eva Rosalene and Neil Watts, employees of Sigmund Corp. The company describes itself as a \"life generation service\" - they create and implant artificial memories in dying clients, making them believe they've lived a perfect life in which all their dreams came true.\n\nEva and Neil's latest assignment leads them to Johnny Wyles. Johnny is a widower, living with his caretaker and her two children in a cliffside manor overlooking an abandoned lighthouse. Johnny has one final wish - he wants to get to the moon. The only problem is, he doesn't know why.\n\nThis presents a unique challenge for our protagonists. Without knowing the root of Johnny's desire to go to the moon, any memories they craft risk being rejected by his dying mind.\n\nThis is the framework the entire game revolves around. Controlling Eva and Neil, your job is to relive Johnny's memories and discover why he wants what he wants. Only then can you reconstruct his life story and make his new memories convincing and satisfying.\n\nTo discuss the plot in any more detail would only amount to one huge spoiler. To the Moon is more of a narrative experience than a game, one you have to try for yourself to fully appreciate.\n\nSuffice it to say that the story deals with difficult themes such as love, loss, otherness, and the ways we inflict and process trauma. The characters and situations are nuanced, and they leave room for interpretation without telling you how you should feel. And even though the writing sometimes leans on some pretty well-worn tropes, the sheer sincerity of the way it's presented makes it work for me.\n\n[h2] Pretty Basic, But That's OK [/h2]\n\nIt's not an exaggeration to say that To the Moon barely has any gameplay. This is, of course, by design - the gameplay is simply there to service the unfolding story.\n\nYou control either Eva, Neil, or both, depending on the scene. You'll mostly be using the mouse, with the option of moving the characters using the arrow keys. The moment-to-moment feel bears a strong resemblance to old-school point-and-click adventures, while avoiding some of the frustrating features inherent to those games, such as illogical puzzles or pixel hunting.\n\nIn fact, there aren't really any puzzles to speak of. Each scene represents one of Johnny's memories that the main characters can witness and interact with. While doing this, your job is to find 5 thematically significant \"objects\" in each scene.\n\nThe \"objects\" in question can be actual objects, but also persons, situations, or even environments you move through. These will act as keys to unlock the sixth, final object, which gives you a brief minigame to solve before transporting you to the next scene.\n\nThe game was made in RPG Maker, and is thus rendered in a familiar pixel-art style. The art design makes good use of the limited graphics and creates a cozy and inviting environment to explore. The sound design is completely adequate, mixing fairly generic sound effects with a few well-crafted score tracks.\n\nThere are a few minor moans with the gameplay and graphics, though. Until about two-thirds into the game, pretty much every object you can interact with is one of the five keys you need to find to proceed. It is only much later in the game you get some non-essential objects or flavor dialogues. With this in mind, I can see some people wondering if this even had to be a game, as opposed to a visual novel.\n\nAlso, due to the limitations of the game engine, the display resolution is stuck at 640*480. The screen scrolls pretty fast, and the fairly strong color/VHS distortions in some memory scenes can cause a lot of eye strain.\n\n[h2] Still Got It [/h2]\n\nTo the Moon is an indie game in the best sense of the word - a clear creative vision brought to life by a team on a limited budget. It knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers on it with aplomb.\n\nIt also has the dubious achievement of being the only game to ever make me cry, so there's that.\n\n[b] TLDR: [/b] An indie narrative adventure about life, death, and everything in between.\n[b] Pros: [/b] Excellent story and writing.\n[b] Cons: [/b] Very limited gameplay and graphics.\n\n[h3] Final Score: 8/10 [/h3]", "timestamp_created": 1666295357, "timestamp_updated": 1666295666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124116082": {"recommendationid": "124116082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090840142", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1647734135}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Y se reunieron en la luna, una vez mas.", "timestamp_created": 1666277544, "timestamp_updated": 1666277544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124051038": {"recommendationid": "124051038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095526552", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1666141298}, "language": "english", "review": "The feels man...", "timestamp_created": 1666141333, "timestamp_updated": 1666141333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124046195": {"recommendationid": "124046195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337001290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1666131006}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not exactly a 'great' game (not a 'bad' one either), but it definitely is a great story. \n\nPlay it, it's short.", "timestamp_created": 1666131423, "timestamp_updated": 1666131423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124012887": {"recommendationid": "124012887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062324355", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1666070203}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent, but ultimately unfocused, clunky, and just not very gripping.

I bonded with my husband over the main song in it, hoping it and the game had made him think of us, which years later I found out it did. At our wedding our first dance was to the main song in this game and I'd consider it to be our song. I think it'll especially hit close for people with mental illness of any kind, as I often feel misunderstood, but this game makes me feel seen. It makes the concept of love itself feel seen.\nThe only downside I'd say is the little puzzle parts of the game, I honestly don't think it needs them, to me it's a perfect story game with random pointless small bits of uninteresting gameplay that feel tacked on to make it feel more like a \"game\". To me though we're way beyond that in the gaming world and it's okay to just have an immersive universe that takes you into it without adding in gameplay elements. The game touches on perfection many times but then loses itself trying to find it's place in a Steam storepage, when really Steam is the one that should be begging to have it there.\nIf you're okay sobbing at the screen and yearning to hug a romantic partner then pick up this game for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1666061495, "timestamp_updated": 1666061495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123941059": {"recommendationid": "123941059", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995587167", "num_games_owned": 707, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1665891898}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a very good idea and story concept, but trips over itself the whole way. My wife and I sat down and completed it in 2 evenings, and it was a marginally enjoyable (while emotional) experience. The thing that really got in the way of this being a great game was, unfortunatly, the petty and combative characters. Almost every conversation or interaction between any 2 characters was colored by spite. Especially the 2 protagonists you control throughout the game. They seem to hate each other, take every opportunity to cut each other down, and do not grow or develop noticeably throughout the story. The only characters that don't seem to have a terrible attitude toward other people are the characters that have almost no speaking role in the game. To have such petty and spiteful characters essentially narrating the deep emotional story of a dying man was jarring and distracting. I ended up hating the 2 'protagonists' (player characters), and only somewhat sympathized with the man on his death bed, more because of his circumstances than his character as a person. Additionally, the 'Grand Conclusion' that the game rewrites for this man in his memories (the point of the game) seems only to be superficially better than the man's actual life as a whole, leaving me to feel as though the end result is generally valueless. Though I could have accepted the ending if the characters that brought it about weren't just occasionally (or accidentally) compassionate.\n\nI genuinely hope the writer of this game has known much kinder people than the ones in this story.", "timestamp_created": 1665947681, "timestamp_updated": 1665947681, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587717115879058838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123923211": {"recommendationid": "123923211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295277235", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1642716282}, "language": "english", "review": "A really great game if you want to take a little break and experience a story with depth and heart.

This allows the scientists to give dying people a chance to live out their final request. This game is the first installment.\n\nTo The Moon tells the story of Johnny Wyles, an old man on his deathbed whose dying wish is to go to the moon. He can't remember why he desires to travel there, he's not sure why he's so passionately drawn to it but he finds deeply that he must. So it's up to the scientists to craft and decipher his true desire of why to help his dying wish come to fruition.\n\nThey have to traverse his memories, all of which are cheerfully happy, bittersweet and full of tragedy. \n\nMemories are messy and how we perceive them can develop how we carry ourselves. The game heavily revolves traversing Johnny's innermost thoughts and his most personal moments to implant the memory of him visiting the moon.\n\nThis game is beautiful. It promotes the provoking exploration of love, loss and desire. The game also covers various topics that touch the hearts of many, the very complications that make life ever so beautiful. Mental illness, death, heartbreak, tragedy, all covered in such a charming and captivating way.\n\nThe story is enchanting and the musical scores hold such a closeness to my heart that I can't help but find myself NOT to share the experience with others, I give this game to everyone I enjoy being around, I find it to be a piece of me now and I can't help but want to share these moments with others. It's such a lovely game.\n\nBuying this game on the Freebird Games Website allows you to purchase the soundtrack, a purchase that a percentage of course goes to aiding various mental health charities.

Watch the trailer with the sound on, from the beginning and without skipping. If it becomes unbearably bittersweet at around 2:00-2:30, you feel your throat clamping up and your eyes watering, then yes, this game is for you. If not, then the story might not resonate with you; and the gameplay isn't exactly a reason to play this.\n\nI never managed to watch the trailer in its entirety. This game is, in a sense, like a horror game; you're constantly anxious about getting hit with a rocket of industrial-grade feels. And when they come, they hit you hard. Now, I'm a rather sensitive person and crying in games isn't something that is [i]that[/i] unusual for me; I got my eyes wet at the end of Dear Esther, and during that moment in Mass Effect with the Geth and the... you know. Outer Wilds and OPUS: Echo of Starsong also got me emotional. Now, with that said...\n\nI [i]ugly cried[/i] FOUR TIMES during this 3 hour game. And one more time in between sessions. It feels like this game was made by disassembling me to my very basic elements, carefully isolating the most vulnerable of them, and designing a formula that would trigger them all at once. This is of course very personal and there's no way to tell if this will hit you the same way, but that trailer test I mentioned before should be a good starting point.\n\nNo, I won't tell you what the game is about. The trailer says all you need to know. All I'm going to say is that the story is well paced and well written; there's foreshadowing, thematic consistency... but also some mood whiplash which I believe is intentional. One character is a gigantic dork that will make your eyes roll multiple times, but... in the end, it somehow makes sense. I think.\n\nOh, and the controls are freaking antediluvian. You can either point-and-click and watch your guys get stuck on walls, or walk... using arrow keys and the spacebar. I guess WSAD wasn't that well established in 2011. Would make more sense to play on a controller, but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nTo wrap things up... this is a game that will make you sad. The good kind of sad, but sad nonetheless. It touched me so hard, I'm getting a Pavlovian reaction to this game - listening to its music instantly brings me close to tears. It's embarrassing, actually. Do you want to feel this good kind of sadness? I'd say those tears are a nice shower for the soul. But I wouldn't blame you if you said there are plenty of other, more real things to cry about.\n\n(PS. The minisodes aren't as good as the main game, but still decent)\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988/]Curator page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1665224170, "timestamp_updated": 1665224170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588679850101470947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123527796": {"recommendationid": "123527796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120204339", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1665223641}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good story.

You play as two doctors, who are tasked with helping bring people's dying wishes to life, and in this case your patient is Johnny, and his wish is very simple. He want's to go to the moon. Throughout your 4 hour journey, you travel through his memories, watching him live through his life, and discover a tragic tale of love, loss, and tragedy. As you take this journey, you discover secrets and must come to a decision. Do you change the past so that you can give him the life that he wanted? How does this affect his life? How does this affect the people he loves? How does this affect the people around him? Is it even worth the risk? These are the questions you face in To The Moon, and it creates one of the best stories I've had the pleasure of playing through. \n\n[h2] Narrative [/h2]\n\nThe pacing in To The Moon is great. You never feel like the story is being dragged down by filler, and it's constantly moving along. While some games might rush certain aspects, not giving characters time to develop and become fleshed out, especially in a shorter game like this, To The Moon allows you to get to know each character, and become attached to them. The two doctors you play as have amazing chemistry, and are quite hilarious, something I wasn't expecting from a game as emotional as this one is. The game also knows when to be serious though, and show the human side of them as well. You see them struggle with choices, and question if what they're doing is ultimately the right thing to do. You will see Johnny throughout all stages of his life, from childhood to death, so you really get to know him as a person, as well as his friends and family. Its a gut wrenching story that is both painful, yet inspirational, and it gave me a feeling that's hard to describe. As emotional and sad as the story is, it didn't leave me feeling sad as I would have expected but gave me hope, and looking up, not down. It's a story you truly need to experience for yourself.\n\n[h2] Presentation [/h2]\n\nWhile graphically it might not have the latest and greatest HD 3D models, or even the best pixel art out there, there's something special about To The Moon's graphics. The pixel art still looks great, and the use of lighting at times is absolutely stunning. The way the colors become muted in some sections, while in other's they're vibrant and glowing is breathtaking at times, and always fitting of what's going on in the story. The music is also phenomenal, setting the atmosphere perfectly. There is one song in the game that has actual words that are sung, and this is the only voice acting in the whole game but it doesn't even matter since the song fits so perfectly with the sequence and the singing is so well done that it will most likely bring tears to your eyes. \n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\n\nTo The Moon is one of those games that will leave you thinking about it long after the final credits roll. If you're a fan of story driven games, it's absolutely a must play. There isn't tons of \"gameplay\" in it, with there being some quick puzzles and that's about it, but everything is so polished and well pieced together, that you can't help but be glued to the screen as the layers of this man's life are slowly peeled back piece by piece, with each layer exposing more and more. It's a game that will make you think, not only about Johnny's life but your own as well. Would you want to change the past to make a dream come true? Would you risk everything including those that you love for a chance at a dream? Would you want to look back at your own life in your dying breaths or would it be too painful to see the mistakes you've made? To The Moon is absolutely a game that you should play, and one that you won't want to put down. For more reviews, follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40795588/] curator page.

Johnny, the patient they visit in the featured game, desires to fly to the Moon as in the title. Except\u2026 he doesn't know why! This is a big impediment since our doctors need to know which aspect of life they should change in order to trigger the wish to happen. So there's nothing else for them to do than to traverse ALL his memories, from the latest to the earliest, until they reach the right part.\n\nIt is best and totally worth it to experience the story all for yourself. It is touching and will hit you hard but in a good way. And I must mention the music because it is phenomenal and makes a greater impact.

I'd never heard of it until last year, when RTgame played it. I watched the entire thing, then bought it for myself despite already knowing the story, and still loved it.\n\nI love any story that toys with the concept of memories, and trying to put something so abstract into a tangible and understandable form. It's why The Giver is one of my favorite books. And I love the way everything is set up here. I love the characters, the story, the MUSIC! God, I've listened to this soundtrack so many times. It's beautiful. Everything Is Alright still makes me emotional, even if I've listened to it enough times that I don't cry anymore. \n\nAm I saying \"love\" too much? Sorry. I just can't think of a better word to describe it.\n\n...Despite the fact that I only played this last November, this game is still incredibly personal to me. I had been questioning if I was on the autism spectrum for a long time, but never really went to get it tested. I always just assumed it was ADHD symptoms, or that I was being overly paranoid. However, while playing this game, I saw so much of myself in River. And the second verse to Everything Is Alright - the part that reflects River's thoughts - it was like hearing my own thoughts that I'd had all my life sung to me. Relatable and validating aren't strong enough words to describe it. I ended up getting an autism testing appointment several months later, and was diagnosed shortly after that.

Moon Review[/h1]OK, now, this review is from someone who strongly dislikes RPGs. Whether it be the slow grind or confusing objectives, they are generally rather boring for me. To the Moon didn't truly change my perspective, but it is one of those games I can't give a bad review. The price, coming from a soul that played Portal 2 at the same price, is around twice what it should be (unless if you can afford $2.50 an hour for a short game). The graphics, well, you can't judge because of the size of the development team. In the store page, it says there is no combat whatsoever, which technically isn't true (Zombievas!). The gameplay is, well, what you would expect in most indie story-based games. The puzzles are easy and nice. Now, the story is obviously what the game is about, and it's the reason the game didn't flop. It's pretty good. I suppose I'm a heartless monster [spoiler](much like the old dying guy)[/spoiler], because I didn't cry my eyes out. More emotional people would, though. Perhaps another nice facet of To the Moon is the lack of any fillers, which make me tear my brains out. \nOverall, don't buy if you don't like RPGs and their narratives. Do buy if you like stuff like that.\nStill probably wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1658902499, "timestamp_updated": 1672796144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119541814": {"recommendationid": "119541814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160697480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1658879703}, "language": "english", "review": "\u5609\u5e74\u534e\u7684\u90a3\u665a.....\u592a\u611f\u4eba\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1658880041, "timestamp_updated": 1658880041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119540702": {"recommendationid": "119540702", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070745690", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 276, "last_played": 1630127269}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been in love with this game ever since it was released, but never got the chance to buy it until a year and a half ago.

And I avoided them for the longest time until I took a chance at To the Moon, interested in unique concept of a plot. No regrets.\n\nTo the Moon's two protagonists are funny, charming, and heartwarming, and have the weird ability to cheer up any player. And even if you're basically Hitty, the emotional aspects of the game don't flood the story enough to hurt it and Neil will jump in to complain about how sappy the situation is anyways. Even if you are sappy, though, gross, but also, you'll still find Neil funny. There's never a dull moment with him.\n\nTo the Moon isn't a game easily narrowed down to just someone who likes crying until they die of dehydration, or someone who likes games about being nosy. It's an interesting game with unique concepts that anyone who likes a good story can enjoy. In a game like this, you aren't just being told the story or being played a movie. You're being thrown into the shoes of the protagonists (ew?) and forced to endure the realization that this game capable of running on a Samsung smart grass seed easily outshines games with RTX that lack a memorable and meaningful story.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[*]Runs on an abacus\n[*]Amazing characters\n[*]No wasteful dialog. Every single line has meaning and is enjoyable\n[*]Freebird Games explores unique concepts and thinks outside of the box, and it shows in games like this\n[*]Good moozik and art\n[*]Games that force you to think through difficult ethics are awesome. This is one, by the way. Finding Paradise is even more of one.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]No real settings menu. (Press F7 to change your language, then restart the game to avoid the bug where the momento prepare dialog stays in the old language. I wouldn't say the game is buggy at all, though)\n[*]Sometimes, an interactable object important for progression will be right next to another one, making it hard to spot. Since the only way to identify them is by the cursor, it isn't immediately obvious that the object next to it is interactable and it's way easier to miss. It's a bit annoying, so keep this in mind while playing to avoid frustration\n[*]No diagonal movement. I recommend moving with your mouse.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Wishlist[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Eight movable directions beats four (strength in numbers and all)\n[*]Some visual hints at the objects needed for progression would be really handy. Finding Paradise had this but even then I don't think it applied to all progression objects.\n[/list]\n\n[b]In conclusion:[/b] There's nothing like playing a game that takes you through a unique story with unique concepts guided by two of the best characters ever. This game is a S-tier example for other studios to follow when coming up with their own adventure games. Not that they should copy the story or concept, but the choices of when to use dialog and what it should contribute, creating characters that have very different but very cool personalities, and a constantly-evolving and engaging story. The lack of settings, diagonal movement, or item indicators isn't nearly enough to ruin the story experienced through the game.\n\nLinux users: You may need the Linux runtime.

Luckily, there's the internet to fill in the gaps in case you hurried through the game.\n\nThe game starts with two doctors going into Johnny's mind before he dies to try and review his memories to give him his final wish.  His wish was to go to the moon.  Throughout his memories you go backwards, from his oldest years down to his youngest years, which is a cool concept since you hear about events that happened in the past, but you haven't experienced yet, and then you do.  Eventually you learn who Johnny is, who is wife was, River, and about his family.  To say more would be to spoil it.\n\nIn each era of his memories you have to find things that trigger his memory so that you can move on to the next world.  Almost like finding the keycard that unlocks the next level.  So each memory level requires you to find 5 memories links that allow you to move on to the next level.  It is easy, and does not require much thinking or problem solving at all.\n\nThe game's graphics and sound are very simple almost like RPGMaker style graphics, but better.  However, it's not about the visual or sound effects in this game, it truly is about the world you explore and the story that you find unfolding backwards in Johnny's memories.  The music is good, not great, but King's Quest 4 type of good.  There are no voices, nothing special here, but simplistic pixel graphic gaming with simplistic controls.\n\nWhile I expected a very emotional story that was meant to bring me to tears, as I read from other reviews, I found the story sweet, good, and easy to follow, but not something that hit me in the feels.  Still though, a decent idea for a story and well executed too.  So why not recommend the game.  If you like casual adventure games more a la exploration than puzzle solving, then try this, it'll only take you a few hours to complete and the story is worth a single playthrough to at least know that To The Moon is all about.", "timestamp_created": 1657398503, "timestamp_updated": 1657398503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644736170768737793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118528307": {"recommendationid": "118528307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120757859", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1657263191}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic RPGMaker game that everybody gotta play.\n\n it's funny, wholesome and just a complete emotional rollercoaster.

I've read it was made with RPG-maker, which has arguably simple SNES-like graphics. I usually like 3D games with lots of freedom of movement so this game was something different than what I normally would play. But I heard it was well written and emotionally moving, especially for a game made with RPG-maker so I was intrigued. I've played triple A games that looked incredible but had no soul to it, no meaningful story or uniqueness to them. And I've played older games with simpler graphics that really made an impact on me. \n\nSo basically I wanted to play this game to see if such a 'simple' game could have a profound effect on me. I wanted to experience if this game could tell a story as powerful as some next-gen HD cinematic games can. And the answer is yes! The topics of this game (family, autism, dreams) really spoke to me and the story felt relatable. At first I thought that some themes in the game were a bit random or clich\u00e9 but later in the game these themes recur and get more weight to them. I've played the game 2 times (about 3 years apart) and I'm only just now getting a rather clear picture of the whole story. There's still one or two questions unanswerd but maybe I'll play it again in another 3 years and I'll get the whole story then. Since you go through the whole story backwards and are traversing through memories and virtual constructs of one's mind, this game will peak your interest if you like movies such as Memento, Inception and maybe even The Matrix. It's not a real sci-fi game but has some of those elements in it, without them becoming gimmicks. At first the story is simple but later on you r\u00e9ally start connecting the dots and that makes the whole story more meaningful. \n\nI've played this game to experience something. I don't think a game is just it's graphics or gameplay. It's also the experience you get from it while playing it. I think if you're an insensitive son of a &#%&$ you might resonate less with the themes of the story. But if you like somewhat romantic stories about growing up, family, love, dreams and destiny you might really like this one. I feel that particularly older games with simpler graphics have something that next-gen really graphical games don't have: they leave room for imagination. Because the characters in this RPG are simple pixelated sprites, my imagination automatically thought they looked like people I know in real life. And being able to project something of your own unto a game is only possible if the game uses relatable themes and dialogue. And it does. So that also made the game much more personal to me. Also the music is very atmospheric and the piano theme that's featured throughout the whole game will probably always stay with me. \n\nI think the only gripe people could have with this game is that it's relatively short and you could probably speed run this game in a few hours. But since the game probably costs even less than $10,- at the time you read this review, I'd say, go for it. Take the time to let it all in and saviour the experience. Triple A games can learn from the storytelling this game offers and I wish more people will discover this gem of a game!\n", "timestamp_created": 1654951213, "timestamp_updated": 1654951213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116807227": {"recommendationid": "116807227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198959700858", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1655468269}, "language": "english", "review": "Just play the game.
