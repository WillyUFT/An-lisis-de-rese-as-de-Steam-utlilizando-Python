Takes Co-op Cooking to New Heights[/h1] \n\nPlateUp! is the culinary circus you didn't know you needed, and it's flipping the co-op cooking genre upside down! As a seasoned Overcooked chef, I initially wondered if any game could match its kitchen chaos, but PlateUp! matched it and left me hungry for more.\n\nWhile Overcooked might have the edge in the graphics department (we won't talk about the characters), PlateUp! compensates with its addictive and downright zany gameplay. The addition of gadget upgrades and kitchen blueprints adds a strategic twist to the chaos, turning each level into a culinary showdown where communication is key\u2014unless you want your kitchen to resemble a food fight gone wrong.\n\nIt's chaos, but it's the kind of chaos that makes you want to hit that replay button for one more round of culinary madness.\n\nIn conclusion, PlateUp! is the co-op cooking game you never knew you needed in your life. It may not boast the flashiest graphics, but who needs that when you're too busy planning the best kitchen blueprint to pair with your menu? If you're a fan of Overcooked or just want a game that sprinkles in an element of planning to your cooking, PlateUp! is your ticket to a hilarious and tasty gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1699855034, "timestamp_updated": 1699855391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150042085": {"recommendationid": "150042085", "author": {"steamid": "76561199100743319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 766, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1700716205}, "language": "english", "review": "I only have 3 hours in but man is this game fun!

"language": "english", "review": "My honest review with too many hours in the game.\n\nThe game was great at launch, it was pretty fun and getting updates at a decent rate.\n\nBut after awhile the updates started to become few and far between with alot of them just being garbage and most updates just broke multiplayer for people and some still cannot play multiplayer without issues.\n\nThe roguelike element of this game really isn't all that great and the replayability is lacking.  What I mean is there is little to no variance between runs,  A run basically boils down to: Did I get X appliance?  Did I avoid the bad cards which are complete RNG?  Will my layout work?  Did I get early copy/blueprint/discount desks?   If any of these are no then you are more than likely just gonna struggle and have a bad time which is no fun.\n\nThe only good building layouts come from a website that you can make your own in which is really weird that this is STILL not implemented into the game.\n\nThe card system is quite garbage imho because there are so many cards in the game that will literally just game over you and you just have to accept it.  There is alot of recipes that a sane person would never accept such as soups because they require too much for how little they give.\n\nThe only saving grace for this game for me is mods which have had alot of drama revolving around kitchenlib with the creator having backdoor access to anyones game at any time and the devs didn't really seem to care that someone could literally come into your game without permission and do whatever they wanted to it.  \"We are not responsible for the content of mods, and players are downloading mods at their own risk.\" Despite the fact nearly every mod on the workshop relies on kitchenlib, but the devs response to all this was \"We are not responsible for the content of mods, and players are downloading mods at their own risk.\"\n\nThe game literally does not get significant updates or meaningful ones anymore and this has been going on for almost a year.\n\nThere is alot of things they can add to the game but probably will never like a drive through which was talked about a long time ago but never happened.\n\nDid I get my moneys worth? Sure, but I still cannot recommend it because it feels like the game will never receive meaningful updates and the only things that get posted are \"Plate Up is on sale\", and of course the drama that you can google \"plate up kitchenlib drama\" and will find any additional information you would want to know.", "timestamp_created": 1697500360, "timestamp_updated": 1697500360, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449826985597610474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148358426": {"recommendationid": "148358426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064217762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 12250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12250, "last_played": 1693188036}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun cooking automation game.

Yes, PlateUp! I can't wait to play it, oh no, not at all! It's like this twisted carnival in my mind, spinning and spinning, with colors that don't even exist. The plates, they talk to me, you know? They whisper secrets, secrets only I can understand. They giggle and laugh and taunt me, saying, \"Play, play, play, you must play!\"\n\nI can see the plates now, lined up like soldiers, ready for a battle, a food fight of epic proportions! Oh, the food, the glorious food, it dances on those plates, each morsel a character in the grandest play ever written. And I'm the director, the mastermind, the puppeteer of this culinary circus.\n\nBut don't you dare underestimate the gravity of it all! No, no, no, you see, the plates have personalities, complex and devious. They're like actors in a Shakespearean tragedy, each one vying for the spotlight, trying to outshine the others. The steak, it's a brooding, melodramatic Hamlet, while the mashed potatoes, they're the comic relief, always ready with a witty quip. And the broccoli, oh, the broccoli, they're the conniving villains, plotting to overthrow the meaty monarchy.\n\nI must strategize, plan my moves, choose my utensils wisely. I'll wield the fork and knife like a sword and shield, slicing and dicing my way to victory. Or maybe I'll go wild, unleash the primal beast within, and use my hands, fingers covered in gravy, smashing through the resistance, asserting my dominance over the edible battlefield!\n\nAnd as I take that first bite, the flavors explode in my mouth like fireworks, like a thousand whispered confessions. The textures, the tastes, they mingle and merge, creating a symphony of sensation that drowns out the world's madness.\n\nPlateUp! It's not just a game; it's a descent into delicious madness, a culinary opera of chaos and control. I can't wait to play it, to immerse myself in this gastronomic theater, to revel in the insanity of it all! PlateUp!

The game really isn't that hard unless you have an uncoordinated team your working with or the card gods that issue you rewards and challenges every days is working against you.

[/h1]\n\nA year ago I bought this game, because I thought it looked fun.\n\nIt is fun. But I have no idea why.\n\n[h3] Plate Up: The Survival Horror Game [/h3]\n\nHaving worked in restaurants, this game evokes the terror of missing an order, of moving too slow, of making even the tiniest fraction of a mistake and the whole world burning around you.\n\nThis isn't actually what it's like in a restaurant, customers are rarely so ruthless as they are in this game. But that's what you're afraid of. This game recreates that fear perfectly.\n\n[h3] Plate Up: Tower Defence [/h3]\n\nThey come in the day. A steady trickle that grows into a dreadful yellow tide that threaten to take everything from you.\n\nThey are weak to different weapons, and the combination only becomes harder as the game goes on.\n\nDuring the night, you build your defences.\n\n[h3] Plate Up: Factory [/h3]\n\nIn order to have everything you need to survive, you start automating your base. Grabbers constantly shift food and plates to wherever you can most easily make use of them. Mixers chop and knead, plates get rinsed by themselves, you build an empire of machines to do everything you could possibly imagine.\n\nBut it's never enough. Your machines grow ever more complicated and yet... there is always more to do. Too much.\n\n[h3] Plate Up: The Roguelike [/h3]\n\nThen you fail. If only you were a little bit faster. A little bit more clever, maybe.\n\nOh, well. Too bad. Time to go again.\n\nYou know I didn't actually think that would work. But if it did, I [b]had[/b] to know. Too bad. Let's try again.\n\nSuddenly you find your stride. You can do this. You can go FOREVER!\n\nOh well, I lost. Time to go again.\n\n[h2] Plate Up! [/h2]\n\nPlate Up is a simple game. You can do everything with 2 buttons.\n\nIt's a bit fiddly at first, but you quickly start getting good with the controls. The improvement pace is massive.\n\nThen you start reading a bit, in between the hectic days. You see the blueprints lying around you, and you wonder...\n\n\"What if I put that there? Or maybe here? Then I could... Oh, but that wouldn't work... would that work?\"\n\nThis is a game which is extremely simple to play, easy to learn, with an enormous depth to master. And once you have mastered it, you can rope in your friends and show off.\n\nBut if you've read this far, you deserve a little prize. A lesson, from me to you.\n\nYou do not lose by making mistakes. You can make loads of mistakes.\n\nYou lose when you panic. If you don't panic, you won't lose.\n\nAnd if you do lose, then you're in a sufficiently calm mood to try again.\n\nThat's why this game is so fun and addictive.", "timestamp_created": 1694621546, "timestamp_updated": 1694621546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884816825389862061", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146226806": {"recommendationid": "146226806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091085315", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 50158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1019, "playtime_at_review": 38206, "last_played": 1699797737}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game.

It can be tremendous fun with friends (also your SO), but runs are easily ruined by bad RNG.\n\nI've been playing with my wife the entire time, and while we had some really great runs, three out of four were usually tedious and frustrating. That's also the reason why I thumb it down (would have chosen \"neutral\" if it was possible).\n\nMy main gripe is how appliances (the parts to build your kitchen with) are obtained. What you get each round is randomized, but there are several game mechanics that can be used to improve the odds for getting the appliances you need. This has gotten way out of hand in my opinion. It's no fun at all building up the \"Research and Duplicate Area\" in your kitchen every run.\nIt can also lead to very frustrating situations when you get a rare appliance you need (e.g. the Conveyor Belt), but you don't have the Duplicate Desk or a second Blueprint Cabinet yet, so you have to ditch it. And of course there are also runs where the RNG simply won't give you an essential appliance.\n\nThen there's the \"hardcore nature\" of the game. One unhappy customer ends the whole run. While I actually like a challenge in games, they've overdone it in this one. You can have a perfectly running kitchen but one simple mistake (by anyone of the players) can end the whole run.\nExample: A group of four customers order salads. Depending on your \"Restaurant Cards\" (more on that later) they can order salad with any combination of the following toppings: Tomatoes, onions, olives. As soon as you serve the first salad, you'll only have a few seconds to serve the other three for that group. The toppings are not actually listed anywhere (like in Overcooked), but you'll have to identify them from the icon over their heads. If you place a wrong salad (let's say with missing olives) on the table, they will not actively refuse it, but you won't be able to add another dish on the table. By the time you realize this, you basically ran out of time and the run is lost.\n\nI mentioned Restaurant Cards earlier. These are modifiers that are applied to your restaurant every few rounds. Players can always choose one out of two random cards. While these cards are a fantastic idea and often create fun challenges, they can be absolutely brutal and unpredictable. E.g. when you choose to open a Caf\u00e8, you can get two restaurant cards that add other main dishes, e.g. Pizza and Dumplings. Either of these cards will completely transform your restaurant, as customers will now [b]always[/b] order  Pizza/Dumplings and [b]occasionally[/b] want a coffee for dessert. Some cards are literally broken, because they overwrite your previous menu (e.g. Brownies/Cupcakes overwrite Cakes).\n\nIn my opinion these major problems could have been easily solved. Instead of the whole, luck-based \"Appliances Blueprint Meta Game\" players should be able to buy appliances via a shop system (with random discounts to keep things fresh).\nAnd instead of one unhappy customer ending the run instantly, it should cost a penalty and the run should be over when the restaurant is bankrupt. The penalty could still be tough and quickly end runs, but at least players would have more control over it (and the \"Extra Life\" appliance is stupid).\n\nMany others minor annoyances in the game have been addressed by modders already, so I highly recommend browsing the Steam Workshop for quality of life improvements if you want to give the game a try.", "timestamp_created": 1693473109, "timestamp_updated": 1693473253, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574942171573638916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145356333": {"recommendationid": "145356333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031204919", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 99, "last_played": 1694964507}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite a lot of fun, and works amazingly well with remote play together (only tested with 2 total players, I'm not sure if more would work).

important\n-depending on what you cook replace : plate, sink then hob asap (depending on what you cook, i've realized some dishes doesn't have plate anymore which is great)\n\nwhile it is satisfying to fully automate your restaurant especially on a hard dish that requires a lot of different appliance, chances are by the time you reach that point your run abruptly ends on ONE card that basically clog the cleaning dish part of your factory called \"Picky Eaters\" there is NOTHING you can do about this card it just ends your game unless you were shone under some unlucky star and got this card at the beginning so you had time to prepare for it and build around it otherwise that's where you die\n\ni don't even understand why it isn't considered as a \"dish\" card since unlike other cards that applies some modifier this one straight up require you to add appliances to work around honestly picking this card alone should give you 500 exp\n\nanyway this game gets fun towards the end where

You pick a floor plan and a menu item and advance through rounds of gradually increasing difficulty, in hopes of being able to ascend to five stars after 15 rounds and \"franchise\" said restaurant. \n\nIn roguelike fashion you are able to upgrade your restaurant with some element of randomness involved, round after round. While you pick a predetermined floorplan, you can place dining tables, counters, stoves, ingredients etc however you please so it does demand some level of \"tactics\" in a way that kind of reminds me of tower defense games. Even though you  have just one menu item, you can opt into challenge cards that add things like desserts, sides, or additional ingredients (e.g. onions and olives to salad) which make the game more complex as the playthrough progresses further. You also can add certain items that elevate the casual/upscale-ness of your restaurant, unlocking perks that will make your playthrough easier (for example, increased patience in the dining room). There is a really chill \"coffee mode\" you can unlock eventually which requires basically no food prep and takes all the challenge out of the game but is a nice whimsical way to pass the time if say, your partner can't handle putting together a recipe. \n\nI've only ever played this game with a patient person who was a good teammate so I'm not gonna say this game is like, friendship ruining or anything, but certainly it has the potential to cause some mayhem as everyone needs to be on their toes. Nobody ever has a designated responsibility (everyone has access to the kitchen and dining room at all times) so you have to be good at delegating and talking about what each person's jobs are at any given moment to be able to keep up with the rush. \n\nEven losing doesn't feel so bad because you still earn experience towards more rewards and menu items, and plus you can kind of cheese it by pausing and quitting to lobby whenever you realize you're in a losing situation. You can have multiple different restaurant saves concurrently as well. \n\nI do wish that the game had more in the way of animations, for example washing dishes, cleaning spills and doing literally anything food prep wise has the same weird animation. Minor criticism but it is there. \n\nIn the end I think that this is a really excellent restaurant sim game and the roguelike elements make it infinitely replayable, as opposed to Overcooked which comes to an end once you've finished each level. It certainly has a lot more staying power and potential so I hope this game is a success.", "timestamp_created": 1691751153, "timestamp_updated": 1691751153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143848045": {"recommendationid": "143848045", "author": {"steamid": "76561199519606039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1691733344}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and great for team building", "timestamp_created": 1691733374, "timestamp_updated": 1691733374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143842547": {"recommendationid": "143842547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278248219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1171, "last_played": 1691650139}, "language": "english", "review": "Pick that plate up.

The only caveat is a SINGLE mistake ends you run after day 3, so it can get pretty irritating if you can't collectively get yourselves together.\n\nStill - this is a great game and definitely worth checking out if you liked Overcooked, and even moreso if you bounced off some of its design choices or want something you can play single player too.", "timestamp_created": 1691502140, "timestamp_updated": 1691502140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143650947": {"recommendationid": "143650947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188955486", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 3653, "last_played": 1700667840}, "language": "english", "review": "I play solo but I love this game so much it's challenging, entertaining, love the integration you can have with Twitch.

(more below)\nCon: Sudden death/failure  (lose one customer, lose the restaurant and restart from scratch)\n\nThe progression system is what ultimately made my wife put down the controller and suggest we just go back to overcooked 2 and do some DLC.  Her words were: \"We just have to restart the whole restaurant every time we play and don't ever really win\".\n\nNow before anyone misunderstands, I do know the progression mechanics in this game.  You get access to new things and new recipes/machines/equipment based on doing well in previous runs.  The problem is how this is presented to you.  It literally feels like hitting restart on a level you've already beaten, except every time you get one new thing added to the next run..... it feels tedious.  \n\nNow overcooked and similar games basically did the same thing, except for one big difference.  There was this big map with different places all over it and when you beat one, it had a big star on it saying COMPLETE.

I tried this on the free weekend and I couldn't bring myself to play more than an hour. There's a great lack of information going into the game, and the controls and UI are unintuitive. Character movement feels sloppy and sluggish, with cheap animations throughout. I've seen mobile games with better designs, graphics and animations than this.\n\nI'm seeing a few comparisons to Overcooked, and I'll say it now - Plate Up is just as stressful as Overcooked. It is not relaxing by any means. Despite Plate Up offering upgrades to your restaurant, these are gone the moment you lose a level. And this is my biggest gripe with Plate Up - the moment you lose a level you're sent right back to the start of a game and have to repeat the easy levels again and again. Also in Overcooked you can stack clean and dirty plates, and therefore have multiple dirty plates in the sink area to wash up. In Plate Up you cannot do this, so you can end up with counters filled with one dirty or one clean plate each, and you can't even place them on the floor, so you can get stuck. You also have to manually go to each table and get their order, AND cook as well, which of course, would never happen in an actual restaurant (the waiter would not also be the cook)\n\nTLDR: Overcooked is still the best cooking game to the date of this review, Summer 2023.", "timestamp_created": 1691207594, "timestamp_updated": 1691207594, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.300982803106307983", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143430474": {"recommendationid": "143430474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162361403", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 603, "last_played": 1691385432}, "language": "spanish", "review": "goty", "timestamp_created": 1691207442, "timestamp_updated": 1691207442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143429545": {"recommendationid": "143429545", "author": {"steamid": "76561199134329343", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1691205792}, "language": "english", "review": "I can see abit of potenial in this game when I first play on day 1.

There's so much more to life but she won't hear of it. She only leaves the house for work and appointments now. The other day I noticed she was staring out the window, motionless, not making a sound. I asked her what she was so enthralled about and she replied \"I need the copying desk to make more conveyors, otherwise the combiner is useless.\" In the morning I asked how she slept and she said she dreamt of new strategies for her next solo run, like starting with a prepping station and upgraded sink. She came home from work and began telling me about all the PlateUp research she had done on her commute. First she took over my computer desk, now she's made her own Steam account so she can play endlessly on the brand new workstation I built for her. I went for a motorcycle ride with my friend and she didn't realize I was gone for 3 hours. When I came home, she told me she almost completed Day 15 on a solo run and would've won if it weren't for the terrible blueprint drops.

Think of it mixed in with Overcooked, but if you could customise a lot more. Want to move where you cook, serve and chop? You can! As well as select the initial layout for your run along with your initial food dish. You can select pre-generated layouts that consist of static walls and doors but once you're in you can change where counters, tables, and all your cooking and cleaning appliances live. The cool thing is if you're not happy with any of those placements, during the prep stage before your next day you can move them to your hearts content. Since this is a rogue-lite, your first run, or first few runs will never be the most perfect. Finding the best/fun appliances/items you want to buy, when and where to spend your money, what cards you get on day 4 whether that be Main Dishes, Extra Dishes, Starters, sides, deserts, or customer cards, and depending on the theme you choose on day 6 can change what decorations you get to choose to spice up your layout with! Thanks to a very nice progression system, you can level up after a run is complete (either by reaching past day 15 or failing beforehand), you can unlock more foods to cook, much larger pre-generated maps and you can generate more at higher levels with seeds and/or with mods you can create your own maps. The replay-ability in this game is huge. Especially when you go from playing alone to playing with your friends! Other customisations also include your character, that thankfully you don't have to spend your money in micro transactions for. Dress up as a chef with a pizza on your head while your friends wear an apron and wash dishes in your runs! Or if you're feeling enticed by the workshop mods, maybe give the maid outfits a try!

You start by picking your starting menu and the floorplan for your restaurant. The goal is to serve all customers before their patience runs out. As the days go on, you collect money which you use to buy new appliances and upgrade your restaurant.  You also pick challenge cards which modify your run by adding a new hindrance or expanding your menu.  If a single customer leaves unhappy your run is over (barring some rare continue items).\n\nMaking it far relies on both mechanical ability to quickly cook and serve customers, but also strategy in picking the right cards and spending your money on the right upgrades to handle the situation.  You fully design your kitchen outside of the actual floor plan, deciding where appliances go and where customers sit, meaning it's up to you to find the most optimal ways to do things.  This is usually a mix of both manually doing things and automation.  Eventually you can automate it so a meal entirely prepares itself.  It's even possible to fully automation preparation and serving.  Eventually though, the lack of space will catch up to you and oftentimes it's not really about automating everything but rather smartly deciding what to automate and what to do manually, as space is limited and automation always takes up more space than manual actions.\n\nThe 'end game' consists of a few different goals. \n \nThe first is franchising, where you simply make it to day 15.  Once there you can quit immediately or keep playing, and after the run ends you can take your starting menu plus 3 of the cards you picked during the run and start a new run with those cards, plus a special franchise bonus card. You can then attempt to Franchise that run, adding more cards and franchise cards until you eventually fail to hit day 15 during your run.  Each time you franchise you go up one 'tier' so the goal is to climb to the highest tier possible by chaining franchises, with it getting increasing difficult.\n\nThe next is playing for Overtime, which happens once you get past day 15.  This is simply trying to get as far as you can within a single run.  This is usually about automation and effectively using space as your restaurant fills up and your menu continually expands.\n\nThen there is speedrunning, where you simply attempt to complete day 15 on a specific seed in the shortest amount of time.\n\nAnd then finally there is Turbo mode, which ratchets up the difficulty by adding a challenge card every day along with a massive increase in customer numbers.\n\nThe game has been out for a year now and the developers are still releasing new content, entirely for free.  No DRM, No micro transactions, Not even paid cosmetics.  Just quality update after update, entirely for free.\n\nThere is a ton of content between the different menus as well as a bunch of seasonal challenge modes, but if you ever get bored of that, the workshop support means you can then just go download some user made menus and try those.\n\nThis game is a rare gem that does everything right. If I had to think of a negative it would be the RNG inherent in the card choices.  Not all cards are the same in difficulty, which is by design.  Some are good to get and some are quite bad, and if you are unlucky you can be forced into a choice between two run ending cards.  But even this is only a minor blemish in what is otherwise a fantastic game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1690930221, "timestamp_updated": 1690930221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143222523": {"recommendationid": "143222523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226491632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7677, "last_played": 1694214425}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been totally hooked on this game, playing at least 6 hrs a day!

It has strong roguelike elements which means progression is locked behind some failed runs. And failure is punished as hard as always, total reset after the first three easy days have passed. Your upgrades are of course randomized so sometimes you just get shit ones. That can make it feel pretty punishing at times. \n\nBut a bigger flaw is the progression, as you level up your save you unlock new types and sizes of restaurants. For the majority of my hours we've been locked to the smallest space possible. Which makes it more a game of tetris and trying to fit everything in the map at all than some sort of smart optimization of your kitchens.\n\nBut with those things out of the way, it's a banger of a game. The graphics are fun and the color blind mode helps those who find some UI things harder to read. Controls are intuitive and most fuck ups were 100% our fault. I played it exclusively as a coop game with 2-3 friends at once. \n\nIt picked up after we unlocked medium sized restaurants, they just work better with a 4 man team. Automation is a neat thing to play with long term and the game really rewards exploiting the hell out of it. So I gotta give this a solid thumbs up.\n\nLastly compared the Overcooked I enjoyed this more. Overcooked just throws as much random crap it can at you till you buckle. Pretty much everytime I lost Plate Up! it felt like my own fault. Overextended, guessed wrong, got cocky etc. There's much more control over how hard you make it for yourself but it's not without chaos. \n\nP.S. for coop voice chat or something is mandatory.",

Those milliseconds of delay between pressing a button and an action going off, facing the right thing only to have the wrong thing grabbed when you are not the host are the difference between succeeding and failing a day.\n\n2) The game needs to provide more automation tools more often. There's no excuse why you can get a 5 star restaurant without ever seeing a single conveyor. It's impossible for me to believe anyone is able to create fully automated kitchens without cheating with how sparse the automation tools are, unless it's all locked away behind levels.\n\n3) There needs to be some better logic to the choice cards between days. Too often I am presented with two choices where both are guaranteed failures.\n\n4) Some recipes are just far too complicated for a game where you're battling against multiple failure timers. I'm looking at you, Apple Salad. They may be fine on their own, but when paired with one or more other menu items, it's a death sentence. \n\n5) Please add some more costume items. The hats are great and there's a large variety of them, but there are only 3 choices for your primary attire, which is boring.\n\n6) The research desk needs to have its appearance rate increased. If the required strategy is to put your first bench in the blueprints cabinet to get a second one early on so you can actually get decent automation, then people don't have a choice.\n\n7) Some of the restaurant designs are nonsensical. Thankfully there are a variety of choices with more getting unlocked as you level up. \n\n8) Tone down the mess making slightly. There's currently more mess than food. People are smuggling in their own food just to throw on the floors.

The main game play centers around running a restaurant and serving food to customers and maintaining the building as your business expands. It sounds in theory a bit frull but I asure you it is exhilerating. Each run comprises many twists and turns as the game throws additional challenges your way while giving you input in the direction your run takes by choosing between two cards or directions along the way. Examples being do you want your restaurant to be fancy or fast? \n\nAfter a completed run you can carry over many of the choices you made (via cards) into the more challenging franchise mode. Although it can vary how difficult running a franchise will be I find it extremely rewarding 2nd act to any successful restaurant run. It also gives you a break before ratcheting up the challenge.\n\nOverall this game is incredibly fun and frenetic in multiplayer and is easy to get the hang of initially but harder to master, as the difficulty ramps over time, but it's a very fun challenge. The game also has a robust modding community that regularly adds new dishes and gameplay options. Also at the time of this review the developers are regularly releasing excellent updates to an already fun game.

Even the mods who didn't use KitchenLib (or the ones who removed it, like some of Milo's mods), still point to the Discord server StarFlux owns/admins for support.\n\nModders who create backdoors should not be verbally(textually?) fellated in public by PlateUp! staff and allowed to continue their assault on the gaming public, yet this is exactly what has happened: https://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gkfgu/addressing_concerns_regarding_the_kitchenlib_mod/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gpt3c/monica_has_been_in_talks_with_kitchenlib/ https://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gnq19/psa_mods_created_by_starfluxgames/ https://imgur.com/xAfF2bw https://www.reddit.com/user/missmonicaplays\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14h0qmj/when_can_the_community_expect_an_apology_from/\n\nMissMonica has repeatedly lied to me, the PlateUp! community, Steam, and the greater whole.

It astounds me that the executive team behind \"It's happening\" (lack of normal English capitalization entirely theirs) would continue to support verifiable lies in their media presence and an affirmative rejection of consumers who feel violated by the laizzez-faire attitude given to their game sessions by Monica, especially considering the violator of assumed privacy has such a personal connection between the primary instigator and aggravating party (StarFluxGames) and the employee covering up the clearly unethical (and even, illegal in several countries) collusion, of which she was made aware previously (and in public) on multiple occasions. I request a full, qualified response from someone with an actual leadership role from \"Its happening\" (lack of capitalization entirely theirs) or Yogcast, since PlateUp! seems to have no firm contacts outside their compromised Discord.\n\nMissMonica is on record for not caring, and even in one instance, finding humor in breaching others' privacy. With her personal ties to StarFlux and the repeated violations of trust from both of them, it astounds me that they are allowed to have this amount of influence in the modding community, this subreddit, and this company.\n\nHonestly, I am probably making my lawyer livid when I say: \"Thanks so much for your feedback!\" https://www.reddit.com/user/missmonicaplays But it won't stop the

If you have it, I strongly recommend you uninstall it (I just did). \n\nI have almost 1200 hours in this game. It has consumed most of 2022 - 2023 for me. It helped to kick start my streaming, and the plate up community helped get me to affiliate on Twitch within 30 days. I love this game, I love the streamers in the community, and I love the viewers in the community. Prior to recent events, I would have told anyone that the PlateUp community had almost no Toxic members. \n\nUnfortunately, I will never play it again as long as the current community manager remains employed by PlateUp and StarFluxGames remains an active play-tester and modder of the game. The community manager is destroying the community for this game, and therefore the game itself.  This individual has long been silencing those with criticisms through locking of threads and account bans across the official Reddit and the official Discord. They will attempt to push concerns into the Discord \"bug report ticket system\" so concerns can be hidden and ignored.  They have enabled the modder StarFluxGames to have back-door access to anyone's lobby who installed the Kitchen Library Mod (which is a base library mod required for 90% of the other mods). \n\nAlthough they claim that this has since been resolved, the individuals responsible for this \"lapse in judgement\" are still actively involved and central to the game's ongoing production. \n\nThis backdoor was specifically there to allow StarFluxGames to \"prank\" streamers while they were live by messing with their game during play. Monica was fully aware of this behavior and allowed this backdoor and StarFluxGames to persist for several months. This backdoor allowed StarFluxGames to access my game on a community night with several members of my community and my 7YO daughter playing. He changed our game mode, set random things on fire, changed our outfits, and more. While this may seem like a \"harmless prank,\" it took control of our stream and community night away from us without our knowledge or prior consent. This happened to several streamers, and what tacetly approved by the plateup team. This even occured during a sanctioned plateup event, with no action taken. During this event the community manager even said \"This modder has access to 30,000 computers...\"  \n\nYou can say, \"well don't play with mods then.\" And sure sure... but the vanilla game has not kept up with the quality of life updates that the mods provide and is essentially dead after 100 hours of play. The mods are what is keeping this game alive.\n\nI'm saddened with the direction the community manager has taken the game and the behaviors that have been allowed to persist without consequence. You can tell me that the backdoor has been patched, Kitchen Library mod updates will be reviewed by the PlateUp Dev team, and you can tell me to not play with mods if I'm concerned about my game and stream's security. None of that means anything as long as the modder is still a primary member of the team and the community manager who enabled and protected this behavior remains in charge. The community manager is also in charge of the play testing  team, of which the offending modder is also a part of. This modder also responds to Discord bug issues and asks community members to provide their game log details often. There was no ban, the modder continues to upload and update his own mods, the modder continues to be active in the modding channel of the discord, and there has been no consequences for these actions.\n\nHere's the punchline of this entire situation: The primary developer and creator for this game has a PHD in Cyber Security from Oxford... so was this backdoor a mistake or intentional? Therefore, was the subsequent cover-up and protection of this modder just as intentional? \n\nAs long as the modder has not been banned from this community, and those who have enabled and protected his behavior continue to have any part of PlateUp, I will no longer play, stream, and support this game.\n\nI'll miss this game, and the community.\n\nPlay at your own risk.\n\nFor Reference:\nCommunity manager locks thread where initial complaint about StarFluxGames and the KitchenLib mod is made: https://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14g8fy7/be_aware_kitchenlib/\n\nAdditional Reddit threads relating to this issue:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gn8vd/kitchen_lib/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gnq19/psa_mods_created_by_starfluxgames/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gmqin/psa_with_the_new_kitchenlib_update_if_you_select/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gpt3c/monica_has_been_in_talks_with_kitchenlib/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gsvgo/kitchenlib_security_privacy_concerns_23062023/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14h73sb/kitchenlib_official_response/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14jgswt/how_to_portion_pizza_while_keeping_the_pizza/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14iirr8/vulnerability_report_unauthorized_access_to_any/\n", "timestamp_created": 1688888008, "timestamp_updated": 1688888008, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.76649397611618042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141649777": {"recommendationid": "141649777", "author": {"steamid": "76561199380975512", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1692431915}, "language": "english", "review": "cook", "timestamp_created": 1688873470, "timestamp_updated": 1688873470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141647697": {"recommendationid": "141647697", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978238315", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 15410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12018, "last_played": 1694479341}, "language": "english", "review": "Outstanding cooperative gameplay and adorable themes.

Every 3 rounds there are different cards which changes the course of the game, so every run is more or less different. The frustration and happiness you will feel throughout the game is unmatched. Playing with friends and sharing these emotions is just so wonderful. There are just SO MANY things you can do in this game and this game feels so refined, especially with mods to help with layouts, UI, etc. This game really opened my eyes to cooking games. Side note, this game is definitely much more enjoyable with friends unless you are going for solo automation runs!!

He hands you the menu to look through and as soon as you pick anything that isn't lettuce he takes the menu away and gives you a completely different menu, this happens repeatedly, so you decide you don't want to eat here anymore. But then all the chefs come out and body block you from leaving your seat saying they recommend the lettuce in their own ways, staying there giving you their opinions on the lettuce until you give in and order the lettuce. They set the table nicely, decorations fit for a queen, 14 different types of cutlery, breadsticks, napkins and all, and then you hear the low rumble from the conveyor belt. Your eyes follow it to its origin and an angry chef does his work at the other end, you recognise him from TV, hes a world famous chef who cooks anything perfectly, he grabs a whole lettuce in one hand and shoves it into a paper shredder atop a golden rimmed plate, he then tidies the dish of lettuce up and smiles proudly at his creation before placing it on the conveyor belt, the low buzzing rumbling as the lettuce slowly makes its way towards you, the belt clumsily nudging it infront of you....
