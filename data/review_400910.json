(Spoiler: it has less to do with the anime girls than you think)\nWell, it's special enough that I bought the game TWO TIMES.\n\nOf course, the anime style is the first thing many notice and can put some people off, but it's all because the creator, GemaYue, genuinely loves bunnies. As such, this game is full of heart and passion in every inch, from gameplay to soundtrack.\n\nIf you can get past the artstyle(or if you love anime), you will find yourself with a hard game in any difficulty from normal to above. As a combination of Metroidvania and bullet hell, this one is about finding new upgrades to make your character stronger...and then losing to a boss for three hours when you realize you need to get good at dodging. This is a game about knowing when to attack and when to dodge, and as it progresses, you will need to learn how to evade the attacks if you want a chance at actually dealing damage. \n\nNot to worry, though! You have some useful temporary buffs you can buy from the main town after you defeat some bosses, and as you find new items, your attacks capabilities increase. You even get a dedicated item that gives you invincibility for a few moments. And there are consumables to recover health that you'll need to manage on some marathon bosses to get to their next phase with enough HP to give on a fight.\n\nThe story is okay, can be kind of confusing at moments, can be cute at others. Nothing extraordinary, really. \n\nThe music, on the other hand... Holy moly there are absolute BANGERS here. Tracks that don't have any right to be this good in a game about bunny girls and bullets flying on the screen, and yet, you'll find a mix of cute and relaxing tunes from the starting forest to threatening boss themes and exhilarating songs that will give you enough confidence to try again just one more time and see if you can defeat that one obstacle that you've been wanting to clear for the past few hours.\n\nMuch of this review has been about the bosses and their difficulty, but that's not to say the platforming is bad. It's standard platforming, but there are some genuinely difficult challenges here and there, and even more with the free Halloween DLC and the Order DLC. If you buy this on Steam, there are even custom maps that will teach you useful techniques to break the game and conquer some of the hardest custom made challenges!\n\nBtw, did I say break the game? Yeah, so Rabi-Ribi is proudly a Metroidvania where you can beat the game with 0% items (there's even an achievement for this). A game where you can wall-jump without the item needed to wall jump. A game where you can use a slide attack to gain height without double jump and so on. There are so many little things about the controls here that make it an incredibly satisfying game to master. Good luck on those achievements, though, the highest difficulties really need you to master everything about this game, from platforming to combat. \n\nSo, what makes Rabi-Ribi special? That it's clearly a game made out of love for games, with so many small details in its gameplay department, challenging bosses with enough leeway to give everyone a fair chance if they want to face them with or without buffs, the possibility to complete the game without collecting any item and it being an actually doable challenge encouraged by the game, an amazing soundtrack and ultimately the feeling of conquering the trials (and bullets) and seeing the credits roll after getting your a** handed to you by every boss.\n\nDon't let the anime style draw you away. This one is special, and very much so. A game that has truly stood the test of time after 7 years, and hopefully will do so for much more.\n\n(Also play Tevi, which is the spiritual sequel to this, there's even a demo)", "timestamp_created": 1696731455, "timestamp_updated": 1696731455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147773932": {"recommendationid": "147773932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393793774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 410, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1699854204}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me lo habia descargado pirata y lo finalize alli... con dinero en mano lo compre, y me lo pienso volver a finalizar..!!", "timestamp_created": 1696642485, "timestamp_updated": 1696642485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147741581": {"recommendationid": "147741581", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971160250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1737, "last_played": 1696598082}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm always impressed by games that blend two uncommon genres together to make something different. Rabi Ribi takes both metroidvanias and shoot'em ups. I'm a big fan of the former, just \"sight\" about the latter. The end result is mostly great, but the game does inherit a lot of both genre's most notorious flaws.\n\nOK, its a game I recommend for sure, but lets start with the bad first because I'm an asshole. Boss design is... Not great. The flaws it inherit from the metroidvania side of things: bosses have invincibility phases; design usually ignores your mobility options and devolves to what I call the \"skip rope then mash button\" type of fights; and tons of bosses have \"quirky\" hidden mechanics that you'll only ever discover if you look up a walkthrough. From the shoot'em up side: it has bullets that blend with the background; regularly throws pattern shots and targeted shots at the same time, creating some real checkmate situations; an overreliance of both memorization and extremely precise inputs required.\n\nStill, despite being one of the game's flaws, its not even close to the worst the genre have ever seen. You even get to enjoy them if you're right at the middle of a Venn diagram of \"Ikaruga's diehard fans\" and \"metroidvania enjoyers\". But for anyone else, for the most part you're just stacking attack buffs and saving resources to dump them all on the bosses before they get to do too much damage on you. Funnily enough, you'll even get some SSS and Max ranks doing this. My worst ratings in the game were the ones I tried to engage with the bosses on the game's terms actually.\n\nAnyway, the second thing the game does poorly is story. I'd honestly recommend just skipping everything and enjoying the game for the gameplay quality only. The plot is a fever dream of multiverses that never explains itself and by the end even seems to actively mock you. Like, there's 3 \"final\" bosses in the game. The first two have understandable motivations and seem to raise interesting questions about the truth of Rabi Ribi world. You would expect the last one to be the sort of \"mastermind\" one that'll explain why and how everything happens and... Well it does. It felt like I was just served the dog ending from Silent Hill 2 with a straight face.\n\nDespite these two major gripes I have with the game, it really is a good metroidvania when it comes to mobility, progression, level design, and regular combat. The difficulty is really hyped up in this game, but it's honestly just your average metroidvania curve. Starts off incredibly hard, gets progressively easier as you get more and more abilities and items. The last minutes of the game are pure kaizo design nonsense, but road until there is good enough that it doesn't really ruin the experience.

The ending there is decent, the final boss is challenging but fair, and the game up until that point was super fun, albeit perhaps a bit too big. Chapter 7 is fine, but the massive boss rush is very, very hard on the wrists. \n\nThe issue comes in Chapter 8. There's a boss fight, I'm guessing the final boss fight of that chapter, that is such a massive difficulty spike after a fairly reasonable difficulty curve for the rest of the game that it honestly soured me on the entire game. I'd been pretty thorough with item collection so I was decently powered and still could only get through about a quarter of the boss's health before dying. She does so damn much damage compared to everything that comes before, takes far less damage, and has incredibly obnoxious status effects.\n\nThe issue is that the game suddenly went from demanding skill to demanding perfection. There's little to no room for error in the fight, which given how long it would take to kill her makes it a miserable experience. And this is on novice difficulty, the second lowest. I can only assume the higher difficulties are even worse.\n\nIf you're going to play the game, play through the first ending at chapter 6 and then just stop.

really, really wanted to like this game. I've attempted to play and enjoy it three separate times, this last one being my longest. Despite the clear amount of love, effort, and attention that have gone into this game, I found the world to be bland and confusing to navigate, the 'story' to be so nonsensical I couldn't follow it even when I wanted to, and the area to area combat mostly monotonous and repetitive. The one element that stands out in this game is the boss fights, which are basically just Touhou bosses you fight with a character bound by gravity instead of one that can float--though in some sections they do just straight up turn you into a floating Touhou character and do the homage point blank.\n\nThe bosses in this game are genuinely fun, though most or all of them suffer from 'learniness' in their attacks and patterns, which could easily be solved with clearer telegraphs of some kind. The characters seem interesting and have unique attacks, but something about the art-style, dialogue, and meaningless character interaction made them all sort of blur together. A world full of anthropomorphic magic girls seems like a premise sure to invite delight, but by the end of my experience I was just annoyed with everyone in the world and wanted them to stop talking and teleport me to the next boss fight.\n\nAn additional shame is that this game has a ton of extra content, like free DLC, post-game fights, and some paid DLC which seems quite robust in terms of playtime. The problem is that I can't see wanting to replay this game in any capacity, let alone to elongate my experience with something other than just a boss rush. I've put 20 hours into this game and still haven't finished a single playthru, and at this point I probably won't, because I don't think one tiny piece of good gameplay makes up for the slog that is everything else. I don't think I'd enjoy replaying the story no matter whether I was doing a speedrun or low% run or whatever, and doing any of these bosses hitless seems a lot more like a chore and excuse for padding out playtime than an actually enjoyable experience.\n\nDespite everything, I would still recommend you check out this game if you think the aesthetic is cool or you want to try the boss fights. Chances are you'll have a much higher tolerance for the nonsensical banter that is the game's excuse for a plot. But if you need a higher standard in your narrative, and want something fun to do from place to place instead of bombing random floors and walls for pointless upgrades, try a different metroidvania.", "timestamp_created": 1693180772, "timestamp_updated": 1693180772, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615718364715576172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145152090": {"recommendationid": "145152090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158206248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 81, "last_played": 1552388322}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game", "timestamp_created": 1693162368, "timestamp_updated": 1693162368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145019481": {"recommendationid": "145019481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198876642504", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2697, "last_played": 1693006148}, "language": "english", "review": "bnuuy", "timestamp_created": 1693004871, "timestamp_updated": 1693004871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144968767": {"recommendationid": "144968767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218022356", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8354, "last_played": 1679022369}, "language": "english", "review": "What a weird world we live in, where the best metroidvania game is a bullet hell with a bunny girl, and a supporting cast of questionably aged characters with perhaps more questionable costumes. \n\nIf you're here for the art style, what you see is what you get. Cute chibi pixel sprites for most of the game. Portraits of cute girls in cutscenes and dialogue. Occasionally CG of a little bit more (no actual ero though). If you're here for the gameplay, you're in the right place. Because Rabi Ribi feels absolutely amazing to play.\n\n\nMovement in Rabi Ribi feels basic at first. Your character snaps directions instantly giving you full control and you get the typical items as you explore that make progression faster: dash, wall-jump, etc. But you'll quickly come to discover that Erina (our bunny girl) has tons of techniques available right from the beginning that the game never tells you about. You can wall jump without the item with precise timing, you can springboard off walls for some insane sequence breaks (the game is beatable with 0% item completion). Most fun, you can quick-fall from the apex of your jump for a burst of movement forwards and down. It's so fun to loop and honestly the only thing I could compare it to is a Melee wavedash. Movement tech with items consumes stamina, which regenerates when not being used. This might seem limiting at first, but you have such a variety of ways to zip around the map that finding fast stamina neutral movement is honestly so fun in and of itself.\n\nMetroidvanias, and to a larger extent all non-linear games, have the issue of managing difficulty with player progression. Rabi-Ribi allows you to tackle its massive roster of ~25 unique bosses (which in a very cute themeing choice are all townspeople you can recruit upon beating them) in almost any order, with bosses having a certain level based on your story and item progression when you meet them. What makes this especially ingenious is that higher levels does not just mean more health and damage, but also unlocks new patterns that become progressively more difficult to dodge, sometimes requiring movement tech specific to a certain item. While the player is expected to do the bosses closer to town first, you can technically travel around the map completely freely and still have a difficulty curve that feels completely natural. Overworld travelling is a lot more about navigating around spikes and platforms instead of fighting enemies, so mobs on the overworld don't play into this difficulty curve too much.\n\n\nCombat in Rabi Ribi is one of the most enthralling video game experiences. It pulls the bullet hell trick, where your character's hurtbox is tiny, making you feel like a god as you weave back and forth between thousands of bright lights and beams that go clean through your character's legs. But by adding gravity and changing the plane on which the game is played, the challenges increase, and you feel so much more skilled than any typical bullet hell. Ribbon, Erina's fairy friend, gives you a ranged attack that can (and should) be charged at all times, and released completely independently of Erina's actions. This always gives you something to manage, and lends to a bit of a more typical bullet hell experience, taking potshots while you sit back at a distance so you have more time to react to the enemy's light show. But the real star here is when you close in for big melee damage with Erina. Erina's hammer has an auto combo which can be mashed for decent damage, but the real fun is that most of your skills can be cancelled into one another. Provided you have the stamina for it, and with some help from Ribbon, bosses can be kept in hitstun for quite lengthy periods of time, effectively turning every one of your openings into a fighting game freestyle combo. \n\nI can't stress enough how freestyle the combat is for this kind of game. It seems like every main item you pick up has uses, not only for exploration, not only for movement, but also has 5 different uses within a fight, either on offense to extend your attack or on defense to help you dodge. Rabi Ribi's items really are some of the most exciting pick ups I can think of across all the metroidvanias I've played. The shining jewel of these items, the standout for multifaceted item usage, and probably my favourite video game item ever is the Bunny Amulet. \n\nErina's Bunny Amulet is a pretty early item that has multiple charges and gives brief invincibility when used. It's immediate value to the player is when you reach an \"oh sh*t\" moment, where you've positioned yourself poorly in a fight or you are met with a new attack that you have no clue how to dodge. It can also be used in the overworld to cheese some otherwise difficult platforming sections. This puts the item in the unique position where it is not ever necessary, but is probably the most valuable item in the game as it lowers the execution demands from the player considerably for any fight, by allowing them to make more mistakes. As you become more familiar with game mechanics though, you'll notice the amulet releases a wave that stuns enemies for a very short duration when used, which can give you an opportunity to attack if you've already closed in considerably on the enemy. The coolest feature of the Bunny Amulet though, is that it resets your stamina bar if not empty, giving you more juice to combo the boss with. Every charge of the Amulet is so interesting since you have to decide whether to save it for a defensive use or spend it to squeeze out some more damage while you can. On top of this your combos on bosses need to be carefully managed to not fully deplete your stamina bar (which doesn't allow for the reset), but you can't rely on having the same amount of stamina every time since you don't know how much you'll need to spend to close the distance between you and the opponent. \n\nThe amount of active, on-the-fly decisions you make, even subconsciously, during combat in this game is wild to me, all while dodging a barrage of bullets at lightning speed. This erratic combat during boss fights is what makes Rabi Ribi truly such an incredible game, and I don't think there's another single player game out there that replicates this. \n\n\nRabi Ribi's story is worse than the average good game, but better than the average good anime game. There are exactly two (2) characters who's personality would take more than one sentence to describe. The girls are all very likeable, and there's a little bit of an emotional arc near the ending and in the post-game and DLC, but I won't pretend like the game's saying something profound here.\n\nThe music is mostly forgettable, but perfectly pleasant. [i]Speicher Galerie[/i] is the only track I'd say really sticks out, with its heavy, somber piano chords that are atypical to the bubbly electronic tone of the rest of the game. It makes for a perfect ambiance in the area leading up to the end of the game, and the last and best fight.\n\n\nI hope I've managed to explain a little bit about what makes Rabi Ribi so special to me. I played this game for the first time 7 years ago, played it most recently 3 years ago, and it still lives in my head. I've never met anyone else who has played it, so I finally took the Steam comments after so long to gush about it for way too many words.

electronic music (I had already heard 3R2 in some rythm games I'd played so the soundtrack really was a treat, triodust is equally as brilliant) and thought \"yep, that's for me\".\n\nHowever,\nI was terrible and inexperienced with the genre so it was a BIG learning curve for me\nSafe to say, I came back to it and love the game so much more now!\n\nBut, if you go in aware that every difficulty presented to you is basically \"normal is hard, hard is extra hard\" and so on, you'll be fine. \n\nThe game contains SO MANY SECRETS \nSo if that's your thing then you'll love this!\nIt however isn't necessary, depending on what mode you decide to play on, to collect everything.\nBut it will give you an edge if you do decide to go the extra mile. \n\nLike any metroidvania, you get more abilities/ attacks and the combat system becomes more fleshed out and fun to use as you do so. \n\nAt the time of writing this review, I'm on the final main storyline boss and I'm well aware there's so much more content for me to uncover, both boss fights and secrets like badges or upgrades. \n\nIf you like metroidvania games, or just think this looks cute and has funky music like I did, I highly recommend this game as it only gets more rewarding the more you play.", "timestamp_created": 1683113359, "timestamp_updated": 1683153228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0,

At first glance you may think this is simply a yuri game with some metroidvania and bullet hell elements, but let me say, this is by far the best metroidvania I ever played. The story is there just to connect the stuff happening, nothing spectacular, but it's something fun and cute, but what this game really shines is on the gameplay: is so much fun.\nAll the main elements of a metroidvania game is there, you often have to go back to previous areas after getting a new move to try and reach different areas you couldn't before, exploring will also reward with itens (if you find them!) that increase your HP, MP, attack and other stats. The bullet hell side of the game is part of the attack patterns of every enemy and boss, some are simple and easy, while others will remind you a lot of Touhou with a lot of stuff happening on the screen.\nWith different difficulty levels, you can pick the one that fits you better, and if you really want a challenge and suffering, you can pick the Bunny Extnction once you unlock.\nThe graphics are simple but really well done, it's a very cute 2D pixel game with a pretty art style.\nThe map is huge and there's a lot of places to explore and secrets to find, and it isn't linear, you can go to different routes in different order. There's a lot of different areas that have some unique elements on them and also there's so many bosses on this game and they are all fun and really hard to fight.\nIf you like to explore, you will have a lot of time on this game, there's also a lot of optional bosses, and after beating the main game there's more post game story, with new areas and bosses, and then after you finish this post game, it will have another one, and another one, with again new areas and new boss. The last boss of the post end game is extreme hard, probably the hardest boss I beat.\nAbout the music, this game have one of the best soundtrack I heard in a game, it have cute and funny musics but also some epic ones, they all fit with each area of the map and with the boss battles.\nAnd last but not least, the replay value is extreme strong here. You can replay on higher difficulties, try different routes, try to get every achievement (and there's A LOT of them), beat the post end game stories, try the DLCs, try the speed run mode (that also allows you to play a complete different character, if you have the DLC), face the boss rush modes, and probably more things that I'm missing right now.\n\nWith all this stuff together you can see how much love the devs putted on this game, I never expected a cute pixel game with bunnies to actually become my favorite metroidvania, but here we are. It was worth! This game deserves a lot more attention than it gets.

other metroidvanias I played, I didn't feel as invested as a did with this one. Story is simple, cute and lighthearted at times but isn't afraid to push it in a scary direction, or include dialog to make you stop and think for a bit. It has a great soundtrack, downside being I've only noticed on the second go cause I was too concentrated on beating the boss and dodging tbh lol. The feeling of achievement after finally beating a boss, learning the unique patterns and fitting damage combos in between attacks is an amazing feeling. You can also beat many of the bosses with minimal items and upgrades, which can be quite satisfying too, but not necessary if you want to progress the plot. Even exploring the map and finding its many secrets is fun, many of which can be mostly accessible with the base move-set and hidden techniques.

So if you're questioning that the devs were just going for the \"lewd\" angle, don't worry, they aren't (though good luck trying to explain that to anyone who just happens to randomly see you playing this game with one of those pictures on screen)\n\nIf you've ever played a good metroidvania game (though it's more Metroid than Vania as there's not that whole swapping weapons RPG game-style going on and it's more of getting permanent upgrades which allow for both more traversal and more options in the moment-to-moment action). As a nice touch in this, the game will show you like two possible bosses that you can reach and fight but if you look around, you'll notice that you could probably reach and fight about five other bosses at that time, all giving a different access to other areas, abilities and extras that is honestly an awesome touch that just proves this is an amazing game.

It piqued my interest since it was a Metroidvania, and I am a huge fan of the genre. However, once I realized that I would be playing as some bunny girl fighting other cute/hot girls, I wrote the game off. How great could a game be if it's trying to attract players with an ecchi style? A few years passed, and Rabi-Ribi came up again as being recommend to me. I noticed that the game has an \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" rating on Steam with a LOT of people having played it. So I thought fuck it, why not try the game and see what all the fuss is about. After having played the game, I agree that this game is really good\u2026..but I still wish it didn't have an ecchi style to the whole thing.\n\nOne of the most unique things about Rabi-Ribi is that while it's a Metroidvania, it's also basically a bullet hell. Normally, I don't like bullet hells since they're typically very \"simple\" and yet insanely difficult. This is because the bosses can do all sorts of crazy shit but you as the player can simply hold down the attack button while moving around slightly, praying to God you don't get hit. Rabi-Ribi is totally not like this. While the bosses can still do a bunch of crazy shit in Rabi-Ribi, the way you dodge them is not just by moving around (though quite a few attacks are dodged like that). There some attacks where you have to jump to dodge, some attacks where you have to air dash to dodge, some attacks where you have to slide to dodge, etc\u2026 You also have access to a \"Bunny amulet\" that can hold up to 4 charges and recharges after a while. You can use this bunny amulet to make yourself completely invulnerable for a brief period of time, which is really useful if there's an attack that you simply have no idea how to dodge (obviously, you want to use this sparingly since if you try spamming it, you'll run out of charges very quickly). I really enjoyed the fact that dodging these bullet hell type attacks was more \"complex\".\n\nNot only is the defensive aspect of Rabi-Ribi more \"complex\" than typical bullet hells, so is the offensive aspect. This is because you're not just holding down the attack button throughout the entire fight. In Rabi-Ribi, you have 3 different forms of attacks available to you:\n\t\u2022 Shooting: You can press the X button to shoot bullets. You can also hold this button and release it after a while to release a charged shot. There are like 8 different weapons you can equip on the fly, and there's a homing type weapon you can equip where you can fundamentally just hold the X button and release whenever it's ready. HOWEVER, this typically does the least amount of damage, so it's much more effective if you can equip a weapon that's harder to aim (e.g. travels in a straight horizontal line), but now you have to dodge the boss's attacks AND try to line up your shots. I really like games where the defensive and offensive options are interconnected in that you have to think about the best way to dodge attacks while at the same time figuring out the best way to deal damage to the enemy (i.e. the optimal way to defend is not the optimal way to attack, and you need to balance the two)\n\t\u2022 Regular attacks: You can press the Y button to do a short range melee attack. Obviously, because it's a short range melee attack, you have to go up to the boss if you want to deal damage to them. The thing is, after a boss has finished using their attack, it's not too long before they move onto their next attack. So while you might be tempted to try and stay as far away from the boss as possible at all times, if you always try to do that then you might miss quite a few opportunities to deal damage to the boss. Again, this is going back to how the defensive and offensive options are interconnected, which I love. Furthermore, there's a decent amount of depth to how you want to attack a boss. You have a regular attack, rising upper, downwards attack, air dash, etc\u2026 While you might have a \"standard\" combo that can deal like 5% of the boss's HP in one combo, I've seen videos where players take off like 50% of the boss's HP in one combo! So the game really rewards you for mastering its systems.\n\t\u2022 Boost attacks: As you deal damage to enemies, there's a boost gauge that increases. You can use this boost gauge to unleash a type of \"ultimate\" attack that does a decent amount of damage. While you might be tempted to use it as soon as possible, there's a trade-off in that you can't shoot while the boost attack is happening. So there's a bit of planning involved in that ideally, you want to use the boost attack when the boss can't easily be shot at (e.g. in the air).\n\nSo there's a lot of depth to the defensive and offensive aspects of the game, which is great. Furthermore, the game has a great progression system and rewards you well for exploring. This is because there are a LOT of different upgrades you can find. There's stat ups, which can increase your max HP, SP/MP, S/MP regen, attack, and pack points. There's badges you can equip that provide strong passive benefits, but you need a certain amount of pack points to equip them. There's items you can get that provide all sorts of permanent passive benefits. All in all, the entire map is filled to the brim with a variety of upgrades to find, so you'll be finding upgrades like every few minutes basically.\n\nRabi-Ribi also has a great difficulty curve. A lot of Metroidvania's run the risk that the late game can be easier than the early game since you can get so many upgrades that you out-scale the bosses. Rabi-Ribi doesn't suffer from this problem. While I'll say that the mid-game can be easier than the early game, the late game is definitely the hardest part of the game. I was trying to go for a no healing items run, in that I tried not using any healing items ever. However, once I got to the \"post\" game, I had to use pretty much all my healing items for every boss I faced. I enjoy a good challenge, so I am happy the bosses kept up/outpaced how strong the players could get.\n\nThe only \"flaw\" with this game is that I wish it encouraged the player to get hit less. For pretty much every single boss, I was using my HP as a resource in the sense that I had no problem getting hit a few times if it meant that I was hitting the boss back. For example, if the boss was sitting in one place shooting hard to dodge bullets, I would quite often just go up to their face and start damaging them, not caring if I got hit or not. I think I would've liked the game more if taking just 1 or 2 hits is a huge deal like in Dark Souls. At it stands now, you can take like 10 hits before needing to heal. But with the bullet hell type nature of this game, that wouldn't really be feasible unless the developer severely toned back the crazy shit bosses could do (or else it would become frustrating). So this is a pretty subjective flaw.\n\nIn regards to the story, it's nothing special. You're a bunny transformed into a human being, and you have to gather a bunch of cute/hot girls (i.e. the bosses) into town so that they can help you save someone. I was really hoping that the game's story would be something like Madoka Magica in that it would totally subvert my expectations\u2026.but that doesn't really happen. The story's ok\u2026\u2026but I wouldn't exactly recommend this game for the story.\n\nOverall, Rabi-Ribi is a fantastic Metroidvania, better than Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night but worse than Hollow Knight. I enjoyed the time spent playing this game throughout my playthrough, as there was never a dull moment thanks to the constant boss fights and maps full of items to find.", "timestamp_created": 1674618425, "timestamp_updated": 1674618425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131459568": {"recommendationid": "131459568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198861000324", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2411, "last_played": 1684341240}, "language": "english", "review": "remember to exercise and stretch your arms and hand. very fun, and i am also in absolute pain", "timestamp_created": 1674564105, "timestamp_updated": 1674564105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131443112": {"recommendationid": "131443112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136282313", "num_games_owned": 1004, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1130, "last_played": 1698544543}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy Buy Buy!", "timestamp_created": 1674536464, "timestamp_updated": 1674536464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131314276": {"recommendationid": "131314276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022517753", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 190, "playtime_forever": 1784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1703, "last_played": 1674367043}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]TL,DR: It's a good game but later content feels more punishing than fun[/h1]\n\nIt's a great game... until its not, frustration can lead to mastery but oftentimes the eventual victory is hollow.\n \nIt starts out reasonably and escalates nicely, the fights become less dodge and attack and more pattern recognition because you've died 50 times with some jabs and stun locking windows, which isn't a bad thing!!

I played it a little, very little, didn't see anything too absurd about it, then didn't touch it for a few years (even because my laptop at the time died and the replacement couldn't handle games whatsoever). When I finally got to have a device that could run Steam games again, I decided to check through my library and saw Rabi-Ribi again. I went \"why not\" and tried it. That time, I stuck with it. It didn't take much longer for me to actually get to the meat of the game.\nGood God was I impressed positively. I'll give you a TL;DR immediately: to me, Rabi-Ribi is one of the best games I've played of all times, stat. Am I exaggerating? Possibly. However, that's how impressed it left me.\n\nIs it rather ecchi? Yep. Is it hard? Some fights took me so goddamn long, some I've had to retort to third-party tools to get through the first time around (and some end-game content, or DLC content, is so tough I've never beat it fair yet, despite how much I've tried and strived already, but I'm far from very good at this type of games). With all that in mind, you know what makes me LOVE this desperately even when so tough? It's a game made with love. You can see the passion of everyone that worked on it, from the art, to the gameplay, to the worldbuilding, to the story, to the music.\nIt's funny that a game that made me go \"Haha, that's Reisen from Touhou\" ended up taking a place almost as big as Touhou with the incredible story and worldbuilding when being such a small project compared to many other games.\n\nI'm certainly one to enjoy the cutesy artstyle and the kind of story it tells truly appeals to me, but I wholeheartedly think there'd be something for everyone in Rabi-Ribi. Unfortunately, it's rather challenging at times, so much so I doubt everyone could complete it with ease. Nevertheless, it's worth a shot because this is truly a hidden gem. Everything is so carefully crafted that it's bound to tug at your heartstrings.\n\nThe quality of every part of the game is superb. It's not some triple A game that redefines the gaming world, nor does it want to be. They made the absolute best they could with this without going overboard; and within their limits, they made something unique and that can definitely \"redefine\" indie games. There are a few titles that truly manage to make you feel incredibly satisfied with your time with them and Rabi-Ribi is one of those. It being a relatively small game (in terms of the production scale) is one of its strengths, because it uses what it can to the fullest and makes perfect use of the medium.\n\nThe story is what shocked me the most. The game might've looked childish at first glance, but I've played Klonoa on PS1 back in the day so I knew well not to judge a book from its cover; but to say I was stunned by where things went would be an understatement. Again, it's not something revolutionary, but the way everything was crafted is so exquisite, so well thought... it truly stole my heart. It even was rather mature in the way things unfolded in places. Yes, there's comedy, there's fluff, but it knows when to hit hard, too, and doesn't shy away from it.\n\nThe gameplay is also incredibly fun and addictive. I always find myself craving to replay some of Rabi-Ribi's bossfights. As I said, I'm far from good at bullet hell games, despite my love for Touhou (and Rabi-Ribi, of course), so I am suck against some of the bosses; but there are a few that truly entertain me to no end. When things remain simple, chaining attacks, learning patterns, and exploiting some of the more complex tricks feels so exciting to pull off, though watching more expert players challenge the toughest bosses on the hardest difficulties is insanely great, making you wish to eventually get to that point.\nThere are definitely some parts I think went too hard and some bits that require you to truly master the game to get through without struggling too much (especially on a first playthrough), but the more insane bits are either extremely late into the story, or in the DLCs.\n\nI wish I could give a better review and go into details as to why I liked something or didn't, but this is what I'm capable of writing down. All in all, I recommend this game to anybody. If someone's skeptical and not sure they like the genres the game dabbles in, they can wait for a discount and get the base game then, play and then decide if they like it and wanna invest in DLCs or not. They cut the price off fairly often, and it turns very cheap, so I'd keep an eye on it. Worst case scenario, you tried at the very least! But I assure you that if you can put up with the game and see what it's to offer, you'll understand why it's such a precious treasure.", "timestamp_created": 1673217440, "timestamp_updated": 1673217440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770280420780181885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130403278": {"recommendationid": "130403278", "author": {"steamid": "76561199124295317", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 340, "last_played": 1690203648}, "language": "english", "review": "Bunny girls reign supreme\n\n\n\nThe gameplay is rewarding and fun too", "timestamp_created": 1673152244, "timestamp_updated": 1673152244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130387242": {"recommendationid": "130387242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083012309", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 11303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11293, "last_played": 1673171204}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to be alone, depressed, not having girlfriend, and always fail in life.\nBut after 180 hours+ of playing rabi ribi, finally I achieved all achievements and these changed my life.

For example, one boss is a girl (Cocoa) who makes bombs (and wastes all her money doing so, so she lives in the streets and ask another character (Rumi) for food), so most of her attacks are her gadgets homing into you, shooting projectiles or throwing a bunch of bombs into the ground that you have to time your jumps to their explosions, while she's in a corner taking cover. While another (Aruraune) will summon vines from below you while you try to dodge other attacks. To compensate this, you have a lot of tools that you find around exploring, every bit of exploring you do feels rewarding, as most of the upgrades you find are very impactful (double jump, wall jump, slide, slideattack, bombs, MEGA bombs, extra types of magic that all of them have different properties and special attacks, flying attack, badges that you can equip up to a maximum to personalize your build, etc).\n\nThe game has very good music for all the bosses, that adapt to the fight (start slow and gets faster as the intensity of the fight increases)\n\nThe difficulty of the game increases as you get more used to the tools you have, at the start you might just chain some hammer strikes, then later you will learn that Erina (the bunny) and Ribbon (the fairy) operate completely independent from one another, so they can attack at the same time (example, Ribbon can shoot and charge her magic while Erina is hitting the boss, making sure that some magic attacks will hit). Then you will fit in the extra tools you found, like start your combo with the Bunny Strike (slide in + hammer to make Erina jump with the hammer to deal massive damage), mixing in moves that will make the boss go up to continue into aerial combos. By the end of the game, you will do complex combos to maximize the damage you do to the boss in the windows you have to retaliate, using the amulet you have (makes you invulnerable and deals damage to all enemies, has charges and long cooldown) to reset your combo and continue pummeling the boss.\n\nYou have a lot of options to where to go, unlike others metroidvanias often cheat (where they lock you out of a major part of the game until you get one specific upgrade in a very linear style), you actually can go to almost anywhere on the map if you find the way, most areas have multiple entrances, so you can actually choose what bosses to fight first (as completing the game requires a fraction of all the bosses, but the postgame boss requires that you defeat all bosses). You can even complete the whole game and postgame without any upgrade or item, it even gives you multiple achievements (beating the game and beating the postgame with 0% items collected).\n\nAs difficulty goes, you have multiple difficulties you choose at the start which affects the difficulty scaling of the enemies (damage and health) and various properties of your tools (you can carry more healing items for example), but most importantly modifies the speed and attack patterns of the bosses (most attack get faster and have more complex patterns to dodge).\n\nFor last, replayability, you can play the game the normal way, as any metroidvania, complete it with no items, which is very hard even in casual difficulty (the game even classifies it as LOW ITEM% difficulty, with + for each difficulty above casual) where you have to learn the patterns of all the bosses because no items even means no hammer, only Ribbon can attack, you can play new game+ which increases the strength of the enemies and lets you collect even more items, you can increase the difficulty and make the bossfights a lot funnier and harder. You have bossrush to fight all the bosses in one go, and you can play with Cocoa through the whole game and bossrush (you need the Digital Artbook dlc), and she has different movement capabilities and attacks, as she prefers staying away from the enemies while using her magic infused special bombs, which she carries an amount of each type and creates more as the fights go on (one even makes a safefield where you cannot take damage for a while, another is a fking nuclear warhead that actually will let you at 1 hp), and likes verticality more (she can do some crazy skips with her pogo). You can even speedrun this game in speedrun mode, because the game is incredible speedrun-friendly (instant resets, skips everything with a button or auto-skips them in speedrun-mode).\n\nAll in all, this is a hidden gem.

The variety of environments, abilities, items, characters, and especially music are really special. Combat is challenging and rewarding. Boss fights are varied and unique. They're all bullet hell kind of fights, but the patterns and types of projectiles vary greatly throughout the game. The characters are all silly and/or lovable, which is very important for a game with this kind of aesthetic, I suppose. Every single environment is beautiful and well-designed. The game rewards you well for backtracking and using new abilities (we don't have the Metroid problem of \"oh great, yet another missile expansion...\" because there are lots of different types of upgrades). I could keep going, but in short, everything about this just feels right. I have to say, I am surprised. I was expecting a good game, but I got an excellent game.\nI've played quite a few Metroidvanias now, and this one is close to the top of the list. I still haven't finished it. I probably will soon.

of the best metroidvanias I've ever had the pleasure to play. The combo mechanics are an incredibly deep addition and make styling on bosses fun and engaging at all times. It's borderline \"spectacle fighter\" deep. The world is really big with tons of secrets and plenty of ways to circumvent the \"intended\" routes and do what you want / go where you want / get what you want. Finally, the bullet hell aspect is wonderfully executed, gorgeous, and very forgiving. Every boss has something new to keep you on your toes, and the higher difficulties provide a meaningful post-game experience. This game is a 10/10 to me.\n\nAll that said, I have one cautionary note: It is impossible not to talk about all the anime girls. The game's story is not horny and has nothing to do with any of their designs, but yeah, there are a lot of girls with less than appropriate clothing. The game contains no nudity, however, no sex, no sex scenes, etc. Just... a lot of anime girls.

Much more forgiving. \n\nWhat I absolutely dislike is the bosses being a drag to defeat. They have tons of HP, therefore you will take so long to defeat them you will likely get bored halfway through the fight and start praying for it to be over.

Nobody goes to Hooters for the hot wings. And this game wears its, ahem, fanservice on its sleeves. But listen to me. I'm a gay man. It's not just that I think the idea of skimpily-clad teenage girls is in questionable taste, it's that it doesn't appeal to me at all. There are not enough Y chromosomes in this game to hold my interest. All that's left in Rabi-Ribi for me are the bullet hell bosses, the metroidvania exploration, and (I can't believe I'm about to write this) the story. And, I swear on me mum, these are some damn good hotwings.\n\nThe bosses are incredible. Most bullet hells give you five-ish boss fights you're supposed to grind until you have them memorized backwards and forwards and can execute them perfectly. Rabi-Ribi has dozens. Like, literally 50+. And every single one of them is bursting with creative patterns, unique theming, and inventive mechanics that require as much puzzle-solving as lightning-fast reflexes. The first phase of the final boss is a great example. Some of her bullets can damage you only when you're on the ground, some can only damage you when you're jumping, and they overlap in ways that force you to jump constantly. You have to frantically plan ahead to dodge when you're not going to be hit by the bullets that turn on the moment your feet leave the ground. That's an especially strong example, but every fight has something that creative going on.\n\nThe metroidvania exploration is also a joy. The map is set up so that you go to each area in the game multiple times, and each time you can explore a little bit further. But more than that, you can also do a little bit of sequence-breaking. You simply take a wrong turn on purpose, follow it the end, already have what you need to get past all the obstacles, and bam! You straight-up run into bosses and advance parts of the story a little earlier than the standard route, and the story has alternate dialog to account for it. Just as frequently, you'll run into an obstacle you can't get past yet. But when this happens, the game gives you plenty of tasty permanent upgrades for your trouble. And then when the game sends you back, you'll breeze through the parts you've already seen only to get your teeth kicked in the moment you get to the new content. It's glorious. It's so meticulously planned, even with all the freedom you're given to go off the beaten path.\n\nAnd the story is actually pretty neat! It's definitely an excuse for anime girl fanservice, I won't pretend it's anything more than that. But what I honestly appreciate about it is that the vast majority of conflict comes from genuine, good-faith misunderstandings between well-meaning characters. Most stories have severe conflict that comes from dangerously evil demagogues who are willfully cruel or from deeply flawed main characters who struggle not to let their worst sides get the better of them. Rabi-Ribi doesn't bother with all that. It's just a bunch of girls who sometimes talk past each other, but when they get it out of their systems and calm down, they all just... discuss their problems. Like reasonable people. Again, it's not deep or philosophically compelling or of any serious literary merit. But gosh darn it, there's something refreshing about it all.\n\nThere's no getting around it, the amount of fanservice in this game is pretty tasteless. And the fact that the characters aren't clearly at least 18 years old makes it decidedly problematic. But even so, there's an actually brilliant bullet hell married to a joyfully explorable metroidvania to be played. And the story's willingness to be nothing more than an excuse for anime girls gives it a sincere happiness that can't help but make me smile. Take it from someone too gay to be impressed by the moe lolis: You really, honestly, actually can get this for the gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1658028010, "timestamp_updated": 1658028284,

through the floor will send you to a one-way fall very far away without warning (not a glitch); the latter can be mitigated by that oh-so-handy autosave slot.  \n\nIf you want a challenge and are okay

Somehow the game gets even more fun every playthrough and the more you learn little tricks and tips. The highs of this game is REALLY high, but it doesn't come with no lows of course. It's just that the high points of this game are so high you keep on forgetting the flaws. \n\n[u]Pros:[/u]\n- Bossfights are GODLIKE. Definitely amongst some of the most fun bossfights I've ever had in videogames.\n-- > They're both unfair and fair at the same time, but they're 100% fun through and through.\n-- > Very rarely do I think \"How did I not dodge that, that's unfair!\" It happens but really rarely.\n--- > (Though there are times where I think \"How do i even dodge this at the first place...\")\n- Banger musics. [spoiler]Look up Mischievous Masquerade.[/spoiler]\n- Movements feels really solid and fast\n- Exploring feels nice. I could get lost for 20 minutes and not realize I got lost. And still had fun.\n- Some secrets are super rewarding to discover yourself.\n- The amount of variety a run can have from others is amazing. They put a whole lot of thought to give secret access for people who lack certain upgrades.\n- Cute anime girls lol\n\n[u]Cons:[/u] (Almost all are nitpicks but still)\n- Number 1 complaint is lack of information.... for... everything.\n- > Ribbon's magic types are not so well described, in particular the BOOST. It's not described anywhere on what each different magic boosts do despite them being really impactful. \n- > eg: [spoiler] Nobody ever told me hammer roll makes you invul to spikes ? ? ? [/spoiler] \n- > Moves/Items has little descriptions about the damage they do etc.\n-- > Sure you have sandbags, but the sandbag in Starting Forest is sorta forgettable (and should've been in town tbh, it's not really near any teleport sites) and the sandbag in [spoiler]Plurkwood[/spoiler] doesn't record damage number. It's hard to tell whether the new skill you get is even worth remembering.\n- Status Effect icons are REALLY nondescriptive. Even the name is a bit weird sometimes. [spoiler] Like Frozen and Cursed may not do things you first expected them to do [/spoiler] \n- NPCs are a pain to talk to when they're clumped up.\n- Town is so big and useless. Town members could be stationed on certain buildings but instead they roam randomly and you gotta check the entire town to find the 1 NPC you want to check on, only for you to misremember which buffs they even give at the first place.\n-- > [spoiler] Also why don't Syaro just offer us the Strange Box right after we beat her?? I've seen very plenty people not knowing about Strange Box cause they don't care about buffs and assumes Syaro also gives buffs. [/spoiler] \n- Map could be way better. Lots of details could be added. \n-- > Having some kind of map note / pin system would be very helpful as well. There are very often times where I see an unreachable item and think \"Oh I'll get that later once I have the upgrade for it\" and did not remember about where it is anymore afterwards.\n- Getting healing is a bit weird, especially how pricey a healing item is. Feels like you're discouraged to buy it, and yet they're key items to have in every fight for most casual players that doesn't like to suffer as much.\n- Some bullet gimmicks are extremely unintuitive. In particular, [spoiler] the \"shoot the bullets back with blue/red\" kind of patterns and Pandora's \"jump to disable bullet\" gimmick. [/spoiler]  [spoiler] Rumi makes it obvious since that's her entire gimmick, but Pandora's was really not that obvious at all. [/spoiler] \n- And finally...... some of these platforming sections are pretty absurd on your first time play.............\n\nYes I wrote a lot more about cons than pros but honestly most of these are nitpicks. Everytime the game gives one bad point, it makes up for it with 10 other good points. Overall extremely super fun fun game.\nIf you're still unsure, at least pick it up on discount then.

It's called \"hentai\". Yes, that's a Japanese phrase, I'm learning Japanese from these videos. Before I get to the part about learning Japanese, though, let me first comment on the cultural implications of hentai. After the second world war, which Japan lost after the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the entire country underwent a period of self-reflection and soul-searching. They wanted to understand how events led to the rest of the world responding with such devastating atomic attacks. This led to a strong antipathy towards war-mongering and international aggression. You may have heard about how the Japanese constitution doesn't allow the country to have an active military. Same idea. A lot of post-war Japanese culture is a reflection of such attitudes. For example, the Godzilla movies are not just about giant monsters fighting each other. They're about the horrors of unbridled atomic technology (Godzilla's always depicted as being powered by or healed by nuclear power), and how such a terrifying force can never be allowed to be unleashed on humanity again. On a similar note, Japanese animation enjoyed a resurgence of popularity after the war, due to the populace choosing to turn towards the comforting images of their youth. Japanese kids, much like kids in our country, like to watch cartoons. As a result, psychologically speaking, cartoons represent a reminder of a simpler and more innocent age. This upsurge in popularity resulted in animated images pervading almost all of Japanese culture: from movies, to television, to advertising, to music videos, and so on and so forth. And because animated images were so widely accepted throughout Japan, they were used for almost every type of source material, or to tell any type of story. Animation was no longer the sole domain of children. You got animated movies that told very mature stories, like Ghost in the Machine or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Sometimes you get stories that involve very mature topics, like war, or murder, or rape, or torture. The Japanese have generally become quite accustomed seeing depictions of such things in their animations. So yeah, that's why I was watching this movie. It's an epic tale about a space crew exploring a distant planet (the crew's all female, because Japan's very into gender equality), and they run into a hostile alien, with a bunch of tentacles... and... well... I don't want to spoil the story for you, but let's just say the crew eventually figure out how to get along with the alien. It's a story about bridging cultural gaps and finding common ground. Seriously, it's worth watching. Ok, next, you remember how I talked about knowing Japanese words and phrases now? It's because these movies are subtitled in English, so I can learn Japanese while watching them. I mean, I know words like yamete, and iie, and iigu, and lots of others. Much better than just knowing konichiwa, isn't it? I mean, I'm developing such an interest in hentai that I might just major in Japanese when I'm in college. Who knows, I might be the one writing the subtitles in the future. Oh, and one last thing, you should know that hentai's considered pretty mainstream in Japan now, and it's also quite common in the western world too now. Everyone's watching it. I mean, if I don't watch it, I'll be seen as some sort of freak at school.

Combining metroidvania gameplay with bullet heck elements might seem like a weird combination at first, but Rabi-Ribi made it work super well! (And do not worry! While this game CAN be challenging, it's not as daunting as Touhou can be!)\nFirst off, it combines many of the former genre's strongest points: Movement is fun, exploration is very rewarding, there's lots of stuff to find... it's all here! But Rabi-Ribi goes a step further and introduces two things that are honestly not as present in other games of it's kind: \nFirst off, it has excellent boss battles - and lots of them - that reward both offensive and defensive strategies\nAnd second, to my surprise, even though there IS some sort of story progression that you should follow, you can totally tackle many of the game's areas in whichever order you want, and even go to areas a bit earlier than you're meant to to grab some upgrades ahead of time - just like Super Metroid! I did not see this approach to game design in many Metroidvanias I've played, so seeing this here made me very happy and excited ^_^\nOn top of all this, Rabi Ribi also features an excellent soundtrack! No wonder it got an orchestral soundtrack DLC five years after its release ^_^ And while I do think the game looks a bit too simple in certain areas, it still got a very cute artstyle with vibrant colors that suits the game very well! The CG cutscenes are also drawn pretty well, though I wish some scenes had less suggestive poses in them - but don't worry, it's not nearly as bad as in Neptunia, to cite one example ._.\n\nIf I had one flaw to point out with Rabi-Ribi, it's that I personally found the story to be somewhat hard to follow. Though I do find the story itself to be pretty cute, and sometimes interesting, it's not told very well, and the English localization can be a bit shaky at times to be honest.\n\nBut at the end fo the day, Rabi-Ribi is just a ton of FUN!

I play a little bit of everything, but that's probably the genre I play the most. This is without a doubt my favorite one.\n\nWhen I first played it, it seemed like a normal metroidvania, one where you go here, you get this upgrade, that lets you go somewhere else... And that was fine, I already loved it when it was just that. Cute characters, mesmerizing music that made the levels feel like these weird, cool, mysterious and otherworldly places. It had this enchanting vibe that I can't quite explain, but I was fascinated by what may look to someone else like just a cheaply made game. Then there's the bullet hell boss fights with incredible music. A meaty postgame with a fantastic true final boss that wraps everything up perfectly...\n\nBut then I took a look at the achievement list, and it blew my mind. The things you can actually do in this game! The way you can break sequence, all the different ways you can play this game, the seemingly essential upgrades that aren't essential at all! I mastered the secret techniques and found another whole dimension to the game.

And its all thanks to one YouTuber in particular, but as a fan of the Touhou Project, it gets my seal of approval.\n\nI do like the content they throw at you such as, CG Artwork, wide range of pickups, big maps to explore and lots of cool soundtracks, No Remorse being the best. Having a community workshop and trying out different mods is also a nice thing, plus getting used to the mechanics was not a big issue either. It feels satisfying whenever you get past a tough, lengthy boss fight on BEX difficulty. I also like hearing that punchy hammer sound when you get a pretty sick combo going, its music to my ears.\n\nAnd of course... Bunny.\n\nA few downsides with the game is having to refight the same bosses multiple times, I know its part of the main story but it became tedious. As for the story, its was mundane and didn't care about it for the most part. The Library Level where you have to air dash, amulet and wall jump in secession was pretty frustrating. And for the newbies, you really got to grind for consumables/buffs if you want to effectively beat the bosses... Otherwise you're in for a hard time!\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nStory: 5/10\nMusic: 9/10\n\nOther than that, Vewy Kute! >_<", "timestamp_created": 1643617931, "timestamp_updated": 1685163826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109110085": {"recommendationid": "109110085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040403666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 425, "last_played": 1676798052}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun and cute.

You have really look past the obvious fanservice and lewd designs of the characters to get anything at all out of this game -- but when you do, hot diggity.\n\nThere's a sense of 'newness', of exploration, an excited feeling I get when I play games that show me things I've never seen before, or take me to places I've never been. I'm old; games like Imperishable Night or Castlevania: SOTN or Super Metroid or Tomba!/Tombi! were my bread and butter during my college years. I loved them for that feeling that I got when I was playing them, that every stage or screen or room or area I visited would show me something new, or have something new for me to discover or solve or defeat. Rabi-Ribi is one of the few Steam Metroidvanias that's managed to light that fire in me again, and I really appreciate it for it.\n\nThe world of Rabi-Ribi is open and expansive, it's built with the idea of discovery and exploration and challenge at the forefront, and it really leans on the player to fill out the space that it's carved for itself in that niche of bullet hell and Metroidvania that emerged around 2015-2016. The game has so many different ways to solve puzzles, and it even encourages you to break it -- impossible platforming, opening secret walls, using unintuitive techniques to pass obstacles, the game not only allows you to do it, it rewards you for it. The developers recognize that sequence breaking is not only possible, it's expected of its players. Heck, I accidentally sequence-broke the entire final stages of the game my very first time through because I was that curious about if I could make a seemingly impossible jump with the abilities I had. My second time through, I decided to see how far I could get without picking up a single power-up. Turns out, pretty much the whole game.\n\nThis is what they want you to do -- to explore, to think and try new things and break the game in your own unique way. For that kind of experience and encouragement, I can overlook some dicey character art.", "timestamp_created": 1641344675, "timestamp_updated": 1641344675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10,

The only reason I played as long as I did is that I like hunting achievements.\n\nAnimated and sprite character visuals and music were all top notch, but that\u2019s about where the positive points of the game end. The characters, dialog, and story are uninteresting, dull, and super simplistic. Maybe 3 characters in the entire game, including the main characters, were very memorable. The story and dialog felt like it was written for elementary schoolers (minus any sexual innuendo, which didn't add to the game either).\n\nThe maps and metrovania aspects of the game were ok. Not great, but not bad. I'd give them a 78% on that aspect probably.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is the platforming and responsiveness. Out of any platformer I've ever played, the controls in this one were the worst. Maybe it's because I was using a gamepad and not the keyboard? Though I doubt it. Having all of the actions essentially bound to 2 buttons plus a controller direction just does not work very well. They did give you the option of having the bumpers have an assignable action, which helped a lot, but a lot more customization was needed. The action lags and timing were also pretty poor comparable to almost all other games I've played. Trying to play the long jump game was just about the most unpleasant experience I've ever had in a platformer.\n\nIn the long run, the real measure of a game in my opinion is how much I would want to replay it in the future.

Ok, plenty of 2D games do that and usually they're kinda awful, so what's so special about Rabi Ribi? Well, what sets Rabi RIbi apart is that it adopts a lot of shmup game design principles too, which complement the bullet patterns to make the game very fun.\n\nFor example, Original mode uses a scaling difficulty system (or rank in shmup terminology), so that the bosses become stronger as you become stronger. This way, you won't get completely overwhelmed even if you don't find a bunch of items. Bullet patterns tend to be aimed or static, rather than being a completely random mess, which makes it actually reasonable to learn how to dodge them. Bosses are also designed such that they use certain patterns at certain HP %. This makes the bosses more predictable, so it is easier to adapt to and learn how to beat them. There's also the tiny hitbox, which is an essential feature for any game that wants to use bullet hell patterns (although I do wish that it was always displayed).\n\nBut even if you ignore the shmup elements, Rabi RIbi is a fantastic metroidvania in terms of the mechanics and world design. The game is very non-linear, and you can progress through the game in pretty much whatever way you want. The aforementioned scaling difficulty complements this really well, so even if you go to a \"late-game\" area very early on, you won't encounter a difficulty spike. None of the areas are gated by items either, so you won't be forced to turn back just because you're missing an item. This makes Rabi RIbi TRULY non-linear. There are also a lot of hidden mechanics which enable the game to be so non-linear, adding a lot of technical depth to the game. It reminds me a bit of Super Metroid's hidden mechanics and movement quirks.\n\nThe combat system is also really excellent. You have a huge arsenal of attacks. Bosses can be stunned by attacking them, which allows you to set the pace of the fight, instead of forcing you to play defensively and focus on reacting to the boss. In fact, if you know how to optimise your DPS, you can beat the boss before she can even do anything. There's also a combo system that rewards you for playing better, instead of having a system that punishes you severely if you make a mistake. The combat is easily the most technical part of the game, and it's very fun to learn and master it.\n\nThere are also a bunch of difficulty options. If you want to focus on collecting items and trying different routes instead of the combat, you can play Casual and Novice. If you want to enjoy the full potential of the combat system, there is Bunny Extinction and NG+ loops. As such, ANYONE will be able to enjoy playing this game. Between the non-linear world design and the highly sophisticated combat, the game has tons of replay value, and I can see myself playing it for several hundred hours more.\n\nThere are still a lot of good things to say about Rabi Ribi. It is honestly a masterpiece that transcends the standards of metroidvanias. In fact, I doubt I'll ever see a better metroidvania in my lifetime. I know the character portraits may be a big turn off, but you'll be missing out on a lot! Plus, you'll mostly be seeing the silly and adorable pixel art sprites anyway.\n\nRabi Ribi is totally worth getting at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1640504141, "timestamp_updated": 1640504148,

When I played Hollow Knight I never even finished the Godhome content. Every time I've tried replaying Symphony of the Night I always get bored and stop playing around the inverted castle. I haven't even 100%'d a lot of the Metroid games.\n\nRabi-Ribi is different. I didn't do one playthrough and then call it quits forever. I didn't stop playing even after doing a 100% all items/all map completion/all bosses playthrough. I ended up spending exponentially more time on this game than I've ever spent on ANY other metroidvania, even getting all achievements, something I thought would be impossible for me back when I first played. What's more, I enjoyed almost my entire time spent playing. Even now I still kind of want to play the game again and do an AFD mode playthrough, or maybe a playthrough on unknown or impossible difficulty. \n\nAll of that, to me, speaks more to the quality of this game than any amount of words spent describing its (all great of course) gameplay systems, mechanical intricacies, how well it controls, the music, etc. I've never played a metroidvania quite like Rabi-Ribi before, and I doubt I'll ever enjoy another to the same degree I did this one, though fingers crossed Tevi turns out just as good. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963625164", "timestamp_created": 1638151833, "timestamp_updated": 1688111111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104140975": {"recommendationid": "104140975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176339125", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13456, "last_played": 1633714929}, "language": "english", "review": "The best platform action game I ever played. 100% completion is quite challenging but yet entertaining.", "timestamp_created": 1637948525, "timestamp_updated": 1637948525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104114308": {"recommendationid": "104114308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346332188", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2218, "last_played": 1696724130}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente juego", "timestamp_created": 1637941086, "timestamp_updated": 1637941086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104106390": {"recommendationid": "104106390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020740356", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3955, "last_played": 1665200270}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth it + all dlc, at full price", "timestamp_created": 1637938875, "timestamp_updated": 1637938875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104009677": {"recommendationid": "104009677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061118216", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2341, "last_played": 1637991519}, "language": "english", "review": "Beat the game, oh hell the bullets... why is novice mode still painful... bunny girl", "timestamp_created": 1637901206, "timestamp_updated": 1637901206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103931595": {"recommendationid": "103931595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348384049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1651322546}, "language": "spanish", "review": "meo juego ctm", "timestamp_created": 1637871053, "timestamp_updated": 1637871053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103873233": {"recommendationid": "103873233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245082146", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1261, "last_played": 1639100608}, "language": "english", "review": "A very cute metroidvania which, despite the difficulty of boss battles, is really an enjoyable game.

The Art is cute, the story is actually funny, and the main character is a bunny with a hammer. Very few other titles try to make a game where the highlight could be placed on the hammer as the one and only weapon. Plus, we got the fairy companion, which is far more welcoming than most other fairy tag-along characters in other titles (this fairy is also your ranged attack option). It is a title that's quite inspired by many other IPs that also exist on Steam, if you know where to look, as well as a title that promotes real nonlinear exploration where any path taken only has \"soft barriers\" of traversal that you can overcome with some core mechanical knowledge. Rabi-Ribi does not require certain mastery to pull off many feats, and the difficulty is very dynamic (you can even skip on 99.9% of the power-ups, and the game is still just as beatable, just harder). That said, there are paths that show up to those that break away from the normal loop and can impress even those that replay the game once or twice more, as well as those that would love to speedrun this game to beat certain times.\n\nNow, by the time of this review being published, my time shows as 3.9 hours, but I have played this game on the other platforms, such as the Vita and Switch, and I had my hundreds of hours clocked on those. On top of the DLC that adds even more to the game's already beefy base content, this game has plenty to enjoy, explore, and revisit every other day. The Steam workshop has other stuff you could use, too. Though, the mod support isn't as active as with other games, I wish the community here was as active. It's pretty much Metroidvania+Touhou in a good sort of way, with some aesthetics similar to 100% OJ and the like.

Other than that, there's no reason to play this\n\nSome notes:\n\n- Played at Hard Difficulty for Base Game, then Casual for Post-Game + DLC\n- Played on PS4 Controller\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\n[b]Mostly Fun Boss Fight[/b]\n\nRabi Ribi at its core is a bullet hell game. While there are some small enemies here and there, it's shine with its bosses. Bosses are incredibly challenging and have so many movesets it's crazy.\n\n[b]Support for Sequence Breaking[/b]\n\nFor people that don't know what Sequence Breaking is, it's basically where you go to an area that normally is locked until some requirement on the story is fulfilled. In this game, not only it's supported, it encourages the player to sequence break. There is some hidden technique (that you can google) that can make players go to a certain level that should've been inaccessible until either the story progresses or the player already gets a certain item. This makes exploration really fun\n\n[b]Extensive Way of Game Mode Modifier[/b]\n\nAside from the sequence-breaking stuff. Rabi Ribi also has many ways for you to play that are feasible. Aside from the usual Boss Rush, You can try no melee, 0% item (not picking any item on the playthrough, even the melee attack!). There's also two types of game mode (One where bosses scale with your story progress, and one where it's not). And for the masochists' type, there's a hidden difficulty on the DLC that is harder than the most difficult DLC, that the dev said that it's not untested (Still doesn't deter players to try it though lol). Shortly, it's great for replayability.\n\n[b]Soundtrack[/b]\n\nThe OST for this game is so damn great. I honestly can't think of any bad track. It's mostly electronic stuff but man they do it well. There's also some variation like calm music and stuff. My favorite is the last song that played on the last DLC Boss, it's just perfect.\n\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n\n[b]Character Art[/b]\n\nCharacter Art is drawn in anime style, which is fine. What is not fine though is mostly the character is drawn in skimpy clothes. Nothing too major, but not comfortable when your family sees you playing this lol.\n\n[b]Environment Art[/b]\n\nThe environment art is basic, nothing special really. Just kinda disappointed because one of the joys of playing Metroidvania is to explore the world. In Rabi Ribi though, there's no interesting landmark, really.\n\nBad:\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nI usually don't get annoyed on the story for this kind of game, but because the start of the game is kinda interesting, it disappoints me.[spoiler] MINOR SPOILER, STOP READING HERE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT Thing is, it sets in a fantasy world at the start, but then gives a hint that not really, it's still connected in our reality. The problem is, it never tried to explain how that works, and when it does, it is sloppily explained. [/spoiler] Coupled with some awkward translation (It's a Taiwan game btw), it just makes it confusing to follow the story.\n\n[b]Spammy Attack Controls[/b]\n\nYou have two ways of attacking, Melee and Ranged. And because of how the game is designed, the best way to get max DPS of your attack is to spam the living hell when you had the chance. Normally it's ok but...\n\n[b]Long Bosses Battle[/b]\n\nThe bosses battle is long, like extremely long. And there's not much breathing room for the battle, so you're always on your edge until you can remember the bosses attack really well. Also of note that bosses are designed to have many phases that you cannot skip. So if let's say you're good for 80% of the game, but have trouble on some of the last parts, then die. There's no other way to play again the 80% part of the game again before you can start learning the last part again. Don't forget the bosses HAVE SO MANY ATTACK, so you need to do it well, No shortcut here. Coupled with the way the attack is designed (see the previous point, spammy), it's just damn exhausting.\n\n[b]Later Game stuff Difficulty Spike[/b]\n\nHere's where I think the game falls apart. While the start and the middle stuff is good, the Later stuff is just too much. Platforming becomes harder, Bosses become much longer, Evade window becoming more smaller. It really is just too much for me.\n\n[h1]Is it fun?[/h1]\n\nIt's fun for most of the parts, endgame stuff though, it's just way too much for me.\n\n[h1]Recommend?[/h1]\n\nIf you like a challenging game, then highly recommend it for you. Just note that it needs a lot of dedication to enjoy the best of what the game has to offer.\n\nIf you were attracted to the anime style only, then don't. There are better games for this.\n\n[h1]Closing thoughts[/h1]\n\nIt's a challenging game, but don't be fooled with the art style, it's not for everyone.

The progression that includes acquisition and improvement of moves, allowing you to reach new places, feels quite smooth too. Cute visuals, as well as cool music, provide a enjoyable ambient throughout all the diverse zones.\n\nAnother big selling point is the all-female cast, which has plenty of lovely characters and features a bunnygirl (!!!) as the protagonist. Even though story is barely more than an excuse to show the girls interacting, it's a worthy one for sure. If you insist on skipping the dialogues, you can do so automatically by playing on \"speed run\" mode.\n\nThe game can be made fit your playstyle. From explorers to rushers, every type of player will find a configuration and/or self-restriction that suits them. \"Casual\" difficulty will welcome newcomers to the genre and people who simply don't come to test their skills, while \"bunny extinction\" and higher will pose the challenge expected from bullet hells.

Each boss has unique patterns, and in some cases unique mechanics, I wouldn't call a single one forgettable. The bosses all scale with either your items or the story's progression, and manage to keep you at the perfect level of difficulty for the time, you should and will struggle at times, often scraping a fight by with a climactic finish once all your resources are drained. \n\nPost-game content is where the game just blew me away, with some of the most intense fights I've ever played. \nThe SP bosses are well above the paygrade of anything that comes before them, with crazy patterns that took me many tries to get down enough to even survive to see the next phases. If you watched these fights as someone who hasn't played the game the patterns will seem impossible, but the more you play the more you'll understand how to move Erina, when to use your invincibility amulets, when to abuse super carrot iframes, when to use the quick drop for positioning and more, and when you're giving it everything you've got against a boss that requires exactly that, it's a feeling most games can't even hope to achieve.\n\nI love this game whole-heartedly but it's not perfect.\nNamely the story isn't anything special, it's not bad but it's something I just skip through now because it's just not that important to anything.\n\nOf course there's also the reason I struggle to get anyone else into it.. The art style and fanservice will shoo some people away who would otherwise try the game, and while I don't mind it myself I do understand the distain.

I don't like certain attacks from certain bosses, however. A few bosses would send out a colorful strobe lights as an attack. It wasn't fun, it wasn't comfortable to look at. I would rather dodge bullet patterns, than look at 2-5 strobes on my screen.\n\nMusic - The music was great, it fit the atmosphere of the area nicely. The song in the first area gave me Kirby 3/Crystal Shards vibes. I got a Seiken Densetsu 3 vibe from another. One song in particular really reminded me of Megaman X4. I know that everyone may not get those feelings from the songs, but I'm just saying that if I'm reminded of games with great music, that is a huge plus.\n\nCons:\n\nStory/Dialogue - The story is really bad. It is repetitive and uninteresting. I don't want to say too much, though, but it really just felt hollow. The dialogue is very unnatural and the characters often linger on a subject until they exhaust the conversation, try to over explain something, or just come off as robotic.\n\nCharacters - I found all of them annoying and nothing more than living tropes. It reminds me of a bad anime. Erina has to be one of least favorites and she is the main character. Ribbon, on the other hand was pretty ok, not bad, and actually questioned the world around her which made her seem like she had a brain, still not great, though. As for their designs, they are average. Nothing bad, but nothing special either.\n\nMap - It left a lot to be desired. It didn't feel cohesive and it was riddled with break-neck transitions into completely unrelated biomes. The on that stood out most to me was a sunny forest transitioning to an icy tundra in one screen. \n\nEnemies - Most of the enemies are bland. Mushrooms, Slime-like blobs with eyes, Fairies, Flowers. The best ones are the bunny-loving girls. They are silly and some of there gimmicks get better in later areas. Most of the enemies, however, just come off as minor annoyances that offer no real threat, and just clutter the world.", "timestamp_created": 1635969972, "timestamp_updated": 1635969972, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541417598724365234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102132517": {"recommendationid": "102132517", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999563951", "num_games_owned": 758, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 798, "last_played": 1694326962}, "language": "english", "review": "Look, I know how this game looks.

The earlier bosses, even the final boss of the \"main game\" are kinda reasonable, with a well defined moveset they cycle through and really tough bullet patterns (as this is a bullet hell game) that you gotta learn with practice.\n\nBut I just am done with this last boss, and it is after I have taken every possible item and power up and buff to prepare for them. This boss literally uses each move once, and goes through all their moves one by one. And each move is COMPLETELY different and not intuitive at all. Every time you want to figure out how to avoid a move or deal with it, you have ONE CHANCE to see it per boss attempt, and who knows in what part of the fight it is. If it's near the end, you have to repeat the last 5 minutes every time of going through the first X moves to get to that last one. It's absolutely ridiculous and really the MOST unfun artificial difficulty boss design I've ever seen in any game.\n\nLeaving out the main part you'll be spending your time on, the bosses, other stuff that's really to dislike about the game is that the dialogue and \"characters\" and story are all 100% worthless. They add nothing to the game and read like really badly translated hentai dialogue. \n\nThe visuals are generic and not very inspiring. The map design is really awful, going for the order of ecclesia kind of \"individual map sub areas that are not connected properly\" instead of one giant clearly visible interconnected map. And largely because of this and poor UI design, the teleport screen (and navigation in general) will infuriate you every time you have to deal with it. \n\nThe mechanics of the game go from acceptable (double jump, shooting) to extremely clunky and unfun to use (wall jump, bomb) to downright dangerous, that screw up your movement and kill you. The air dash and wall jump notably are probably among the worst implemented in any platformer I've played.\n\nThe one big positive I can give the game is that whoever made the music did an absolutely fantastic job.

(Bunny Must Die is the other one but Rabi Ribi doubles down on the bullet hell elements.)\n\nRabi-Ribi takes place in a formerly peaceful world where magicians and kemonomimi girls co-exist. However, with the appearance of the only True Bunny getting isekai'd onto the island (Erina, the player), strange things start happening; people go missing, disturbances happen across the island, and an unusual group of bunny fetishists are on the hunt for your fluffy hide! It's up to Erina to recover the town's villagers that have gone berserk due to the strange \"bunny lover\" phenomenon and figure out a way to get back home.\n\nThe gameplay is unique and combines action RPG metroidvania elements with those of a shooting game. You run around the map on the lookout for items to power your character up and enhance exploration while also shooting and whacking enemies that fire their own barrages of bullets at your (thankfully small) hitbox. Bosses themselves can be tackled in a nonlinear order, and have attacks structured in a way not unlike the Touhou Project's Spell Card system. It's not all just dodging and blasting, however; there is a special learning curve to the game's combat. Learning how to manage DPS on the enemy, combining melee with the right balance of constant charge attacks, and using all sorts of defensive abilities that you attain over the course of the game to avoid damage is key to getting a good grade in boss battles, giving the game a sort of character action-like feel. On top of this are the game's many badges with numerous equip-able buffs and methods of customization, allowing players to create their own builds for any given moment.\n\nDon't expect the game to be over once you beat the apparent final boss, either; once the credits roll, the post game awaits!

Most of the bosses are pretty decent, (there are a LOT of them,) but some of them have some really un-fun mechanics or are just straight up unfair, especially if you reach them before you have a relevant movement ability, which is very possible to do. There's a wall jump trick you can do from the start too but you'd need to look it up. The true final boss in post game has some bad game design, for starters they take 50% less damage through the whole fight, they heal occasionally, and they'll proceed to hit you with debuffs such as attack down, no badges (so all your preferred playstyle tweaks and buffs disabled), and they spend over half the fight in the background. So the fight is literally about 20 minutes long per attempt. They also have moves that will kill you in one hit, that take up 98% of the screen. Then there's a three minute pure survival section at the end... There are some good attacks mixed in but it's mostly a bad experience when most of the rest of the game was mostly enjoyable.

Just close your eyes or just straight up cover your PC/laptop when the CG comes on screen\n\n\nNow for some actual reviewing:\n\n-Imma just say that if you're not familiar with bullet hell games, you're going to have a hard time beating some of the late game bosses (i would know since this is my first actual bullet hell game too) but don't worry too much because your hitbox is small and you have rechargeable i-frames if there's a pattern you can't dodge\n\n-The bosses has a lot of attack pattern, the normal bosses has random attack pattern and 2 phases (100% hp and 50% hp) while most late game bosses has fixed attack pattern and multiple phases. Some of the bosses will change attack pattern when they're on a certain hp threshold\n\n-The map is big and exploring it is very fun. Especially when you get a hold of the movement mechanics in the game. You move so fast while the enemies is having a hard time catching up to you\n\n-The game has some hidden mechanic that can help you in the early game and 0% item run\n\n-If you attempt a 0% item run, a hidden mode will active and will active a mechanic that is disabled during a normal run, so it's not as hard as it sounds\n\n-I didn't expect this game to have a great soundtrack and made me buy a game ost for the first time\n\n-You kinda have to grind if you wanna buy all the items, but i noticed that every time you advance to a new chapter, the amount of EN you get from enemies is increased but damage you received from enemies is also increased. So use this knowledge wisely\n\n-This game can help you in most of the things you do, even breaking the game sequence. There's even an achievement for breaking the sequence\n\n-Pillar\n\n-Miru best tree\n\n\nSo in my opinion, you should go buy this game right now before i force myself to learn how to hack and hack your account and use your money to buy this game\n\nThat's all, have a nice day :D", "timestamp_created": 1631764889, "timestamp_updated": 1644298591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99362761": {"recommendationid": "99362761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198954443510", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 555, "last_played": 1686788115}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate having to kill anything, it's all so gosh darn cute", "timestamp_created": 1631656776, "timestamp_updated": 1631656776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99202081": {"recommendationid": "99202081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092498323", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2177, "last_played": 1686967937}, "language": "english", "review": "challenging fights, amazing ost, cute characters. what's not to like?", "timestamp_created": 1631413893, "timestamp_updated": 1631413893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183186769485474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99167883": {"recommendationid": "99167883", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970405162", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 735, "last_played": 1694122396}, "language": "english", "review": "An unexpected huge platformer with much harder gameplay than its appearance suggests.

could have so many good reviews while being a recommended metroidvania. The answer is: The game is very good and very fun.\n\nThe gameplay is deceivingly simple until you start getting into the real \"bullet hell\" parts of the game, then it becomes a test of skills that's never too unfair and that feels satisfying to complete.\n\nI really recommend this game but there's two things I have to bring up:\n\n1- The story. Now, I'm sure I got distracted near the end or something because the story is weirdly convoluted and hard to follow for a game about a bunny and a fairy. You don't really need it as the main objectives are find items and beat other cute girls but just know that.\n\n2- This is one of those games that has achievements for the sole purpose to make you grind for them and to frustrate you. I'm not a collector of achievements myself but know that some of the harder ones are REALLY hard. In my opinion not worth it but that's a decision you'll have to make yourself.\n\nSo yeah, it has cute art, it's challenging, there's lot of items to find, lots of different places to go and overall is really fun.

And then she must go find her master's sister. Also, immigrants are bad and must be kept out at all cost.\"\n\nSomething like that? It's hard to follow, because I'm pretty sure EVERYONE speaks in third person and it gets super confusing as to what anyone is talking about, or to whom. I know it's supposed to be cute and stuff in Japanese tropes, but in English it is neither cute nor quirky, it sounds crazy.\n\nCharacters are also very forgettable and you probably won't remember any names, which is ironic since everyone keeps repeating it. But you'll at least remember that time they absolutely tried to kill you. Oh yeah, every friend you make in this game tries to kill you at least once. And every time you're just supposed to laugh and play it off like it wasn't a big deal. The game over screens I got indicates they did, in fact, mean to kill me. Bunnies have no rights, after all.\n\nAs for foreigners being so bad? I don't get this plot point. Aside from the main city, everything on the island is trying to kill you, but no one seems to care.

I wasn't sure just what I was expecting but this is an incredibly fun and lighthearted metroidvania style game. The big barrier to entry for some is probably going to be the bullet hell mechanics as each boss unloads waves and waves of magical bullets at you, sometimes to the point that they seem impossible to dodge.\n\nBut honestly, if you stick with it, you start to see how simple it is to just, dance around the bullets without taking a single hit. Not to say there weren't some moments you won't struggle with, but the game allows you some flexibility with the difficulty options and you never really feel overwhelmed by just how intense the battles can get.\n\nOn top of that, the music is incredible and the visuals, while perhaps not the best part of the game, are fun, bright and adorable to look at. Probably the weakest aspect is the story, but even that is fun in just how simple and lighthearted it is.\n\nIf you're looking for something to scratch your metroidvania itch, give this a try!", "timestamp_created": 1628280778, "timestamp_updated": 1628280778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548899054527282715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96915968": {"recommendationid": "96915968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062761332", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 2239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2234, "last_played": 1628164418}, "language": "english", "review": "i do not like this game", "timestamp_created": 1628062929, "timestamp_updated": 1628062929, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96771462": {"recommendationid": "96771462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198995693294", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 3222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1677898164}, "language": "english", "review": "very epic and cute game, I reccomend you play it (people say it may look like weeb trash but it aint)\n\nalso yea i've played this on my switch and beat the game on that, but i got this on pc and decided i want give the game another go... on my pc.\n", "timestamp_created": 1627848448, "timestamp_updated": 1627848448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96559386": {"recommendationid": "96559386", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044811302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1691272395}, "language": "spanish", "review": "una joyita, la historia no es la mejor del mundo pero es muy divertido jugarlo, ademas tiene buenas vistas hehhehehhcvidfsbncxjzcn", "timestamp_created": 1627541616, "timestamp_updated": 1627541616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96508579": {"recommendationid": "96508579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110860412", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1308, "last_played": 1691382650}, "language": "english", "review": "Metroidvania, bullet hell, pixel art, anime girl.

The anime aesthetics and fanservice-y themes can be off-putting at times, and the story is kind of an excuse plot at best, but you'd still be doing yourself a massive disservice if you skip on it. Rabi-Ribi really just has everything you could want from a Metroidvania in a non-linear, bullet hell, bunny-shaped package, and its cartoonish exterior hides an incredible amount of depth and difficulty:\n[*] A cheery aesthetic and a huge map to explore, which gradually opens up new areas as you get new power-ups; fast travel makes exploration easier.\n[*] An in-depth and varied, yet responsive and easy to understand combat/movement system that combines melee fighting with simultaneous ranged magic, along with a huge variety of tools and secret techs to amplify your power.\n[*] Tons and tons of secrets that encourage creativity and exploration.\n[*] Frequent save points and healing when saving/defeating enemies makes for less punishing exploration and deaths.\n[*] A wide range of difficulty settings for players of all skill levels, ranging from Casual to the gruelling Bunny Extinction. On anything Normal and below, the game will also offer assists if you're struggling.\n[*] On the standard difficulty, all enemies and hazards will scale their stats depending on how far you've gotten and how many items you have, which lowers the incentive to grind and look for powerups. For those who like the grind, there's an alternative mode that fixes enemy levels based only on story progression, meaning you'll want every last item. If anything, money grinding is also generally pretty lenient from what I've found.\n[*] Incredibly well designed non-linearity that not only supports sequence breaking, but outright encourages it. There's an insane amount of developer foresight in the sense that no matter what you do, how you do it, and when you do it, there's probably going to be a built-in feature that'll help you out. You can very easily beat the game on low% or even 0% item runs thanks to this, along with a variety of hidden movement techs and secrets that allow access to virtually any point of the map at any time given you know about them. Even if you aren't necessarily sequence breaking, the game is incredibly lenient with how you do things and what order you do them in, with very little railroading outside of a quest system that you don't even have to listen to most of the time.\n[*] An absolute banger of a soundtrack that'll get stuck in your head forever\n[*] etc.\n\nThe levels are primarily exploration-based and don't have too many significant challenges until near the end, but the meat of the game is the myriad of memorable characters and their INSANELY well-done bullet hell boss fights. Even on lower difficulties, they can be quite challenging, but they somehow remain fair even on Bunny Extinction. To elaborate:\n\n[*] The fights are designed to last just long enough to feel like a tough, hard-fought battle without dragging out, complete with many of them starting to take increased damage if the game sees you're struggling to damage them. On the flip side, it's virtually impossible to instakill or cheese them to death, which means you'll almost always experience the full fight.\n[*] Even on higher difficulties, there are virtually no one-shots and bosses don't do enough damage to make taking any hits fatal, which means that you can afford to make mistakes as long as you learn from them. The learning curve with the fights is incredibly good in the sense that you can feel tangible improvement every time you dodge an attack or even die. Dodge Master achievements are a different story, but...well, those are optional achievements. But in a nutshell, the combination of the difficulty and the very tangible learning curve just makes them some of the most enjoyable battles I've ever had in a game, period.\n[*] The attack patterns wielded by the bosses are insanely creative and stunningly beautiful, while also being memorable enough that you can recognize their user just by their bullet patterns/gimmicks. They're also designed to look overwhelming at first, but every attack has multiple viable ways to dodge it (especially when factoring in your various movement tools), which makes you feel really good when you find them. And when in doubt, the game gives you multiple ways to get limited invincibility frames, which opens up a lot more ways to avoid attacks.\n[*] Bosses in this game have gigantic movepools that ensure they usually won't repeat over one fight, making sure you don't get bored. The sequence of attacks they use are generally somewhat fixed (entirely fixed for some of the endgame bosses) which let you predict them, but are still random enough that you'll need to actively react to them in order to win.\n[*] Virtually every attack in the game (with the possible exception of contact damage) is designed to be as fair as possible. There are no infinite crowd-control chains, few cheap shots, and serious debuffs are used sparingly. Basically, you'll almost never feel helpless, and when you die to something, you very, very rarely feel like it was out of your control. \n[*] There's a combo system that rewards you with increased damage output if you can keep the boss under pressure and keep damaging them, rewarding an active playstyle as opposed to hiding from the boss, helped by the fact that if you play in this active way, there are very few periods of idleness in the battles. Not only do you have ranged attacks for this, for bosses that use bullet hell to attack, they're surprisingly generous with how many openings for melee combat they give you.\n[*] etc.\n\nIf you've sat through all of this, and you enjoy Metroidvanias/bullet hells/platformers/all of the above, then I'm not sure what you're waiting for, go play the game or something", "timestamp_created": 1627320239, "timestamp_updated": 1629325703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614629864692687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96388935": {"recommendationid": "96388935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062858477", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2234, "last_played": 1676087986}, "language": "english", "review": "B U N N Y \ud83d\udc30\ud83e\udd55\ud83d\udc30\ud83e\udd55\ud83d\udc30\ud83e\udd55\n\u30da\u30ed\u30da\u30ed~ \n\ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\udc6f", "timestamp_created": 1627280023, "timestamp_updated": 1627463565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96296483": {"recommendationid": "96296483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179004655", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 78, "last_played": 1676023328}, "language": "english", "review": "Bunny girl", "timestamp_created": 1627138495, "timestamp_updated": 1632447677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96041119": {"recommendationid": "96041119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086670692", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1412, "last_played": 1571422799}, "language": "english", "review": "2d platformer bullet hell works surprisingly well", "timestamp_created": 1626732410, "timestamp_updated": 1626732410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95906551": {"recommendationid": "95906551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099064705", "num_games_owned": 1088, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 978, "last_played": 1638101383}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute and funny..

Your attack is very unresponsive with long animations and you can't even attack while jumping. The bosses are no issue unless you play on the hardest difficulty. I saw myself constantly just running into them ignoring the supposed bullet hell and just bursting them down in a few seconds. The screen is filled with so many particle effects that it would be hard to dodge anything otherwise so I guess its for the better. \n\nComing back to the T***s. There is an extra layer to the exploitation to Rabi Ribi that makes it worse than other games. You are one of those Bunny girls out of the playboy and the story bends over backwards to justify that design. You are a buny that has turned into a human. She addresses her owner still as \"Master\", this is a fetish to someone and it is reeeally gross.

The gameplay is nearly perfect - controls are surprisingly smooth, and the game gives you access to a large variety of movement mechanics, attacks, specials, spells, and hidden tech. Level design is very solid - each stage has its distinct features and puzzles the player needs to progress through, and exploring them in search for all the hidden items and easter eggs is very fun. Boos battles are absolutely amazing, and are very well balanced. Each boss battle feels fresh and exciting, with each magical girl having her own unique mechanics and quirks. Simply speaking, the gameplay is fun and exiting.\nArt syle is great in general - character design is very cute (and very lewd). Pixel art is top-notch, and the animations are as smooth as it gets.

The metroidvania aspects play out as you would expect, exploring the various levels as much as you can with your current equipment to earn more and progress further. Traversal based abilities are fairly standard, but an interesting addition to this is \"hidden\" techniques and alternate uses for some skills that can be used to reach certain areas before you have the proper item, if you know how to use them. Exploring is also how you find additional items to boost your character's stats or give her new abilities, which is essential to surviving as the difficulty ramps up. Save point and warp point placement is pretty generous and likely to keep you from wasting too much time when revisiting places. Exploring the world is pretty fun overall.\n\nIn terms of combat, regular fodder enemies may have attacks with elaborate patterns for you to dodge, go down easily enough in most cases, can do a lot of damage as you get through the game. They're good targets for whatever combat abilities you may gain and an occasionally decent challenge during your journey. The bosses are where things really heat up and the bullet hell aspects start to show, with epic musical scores serving as the backdrop for the intense fights against the game's various bosses and their myriad of awe inspiring attacks. They definitely bring forth a significant challenge, but the game also comes with generous difficulty options and assists to help you make your way through.\n\n Other notable aspects, it has a cute and colourful artstyle, nice music all around, mostly naked characters you kinda get used to, and a pretty weird but kinda interesting plot.\n\nIt's great fun overall, strongly recommend it to fans of metroidvania and bullet hell games.", "timestamp_created": 1624655779, "timestamp_updated": 1624655779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604314267635345459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94358136": {"recommendationid": "94358136", "author": {"steamid": "76561199002164160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 10198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2598, "last_played": 1696275745}, "language": "english", "review": "it is a very fun game with nice musik and hard bosses.", "timestamp_created": 1624649176, "timestamp_updated": 1624649176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94067781": {"recommendationid": "94067781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059226227", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5949, "last_played": 1695548931}, "language": "english", "review": "bunny", "timestamp_created": 1624202915, "timestamp_updated": 1624202915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648184537887573242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94012551": {"recommendationid": "94012551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088815088", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 753, "last_played": 1693232737}, "language": "english", "review": "took a while for me to play enough to get past the prologue, but the game is amazing afterwards. people weren't kidding about the gameplay being 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1624117577, "timestamp_updated": 1624117577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93933997": {"recommendationid": "93933997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799354810", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1828, "last_played": 1687143088}, "language": "english", "review": "Exactly as the tags state, a bullet hell metroidvania game.\nDo I regret buying this?

It's not the best ever, but it gave me a lot of what I want. It's a rare Metroidvania that ISN'T extremely linear and vaguely lets you wander around where you want to go, similar to Hollow Knight. Obviously, you're not going to get the outstanding quality of Hollow Knight here and you really shouldn't expect it, but if you want a nice exploration platformer, this is the game for it.\n\nI, personally, also really like that this game is just filled with 99% girls and women. If you're looking at this and thinking \"But is it ACTUALLY gay tho?\" It IS actually VERY gay. There's only girls and the girls also love each other and WILL get canon crushes on each other, and I just think that's good and something that I really like. \n\nIt's also fairly sexy in the designs/art, so take that with what you will, but I liked it a lot and I feel it handled it a lot better than other games might. Like, yeah, everyone is sexy and dressed weird and they know it, but you don't get the \"we grope you scene hee hee!!\" that you get in more mainstream games. If that makes sense. Hard to put into words. It also helps that, again, it's very gay. There IS one scene where random nameless dudes are perving out on the main character, but it is fairly minor, and the main characters beat the crap out of them and say how much they hate them.\n\nThe music is also really good most of the time! You won't get your mind blown by every level, but more than half of the big songs are pretty dang good in my opinion. \n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty good too. It's, again, not the most polished and not the most responsive, but it's certainly a Good Enough in my opinion, and the constant upgrades keep you looking for more and make it feel exciting when you do get one. There is a LOT to explore and find, too. You'll just be CONSTANTLY finding things in almost every nook and cranny and I love that kind of thing.\n\nThe Bosses are your standard bullet hell types, but each boss tries its very hardest to be as unique as it can in that regard, so I respect it a lot. Most bosses have ways for you to constantly keep moving and attacking and don't feel as repetitive as most platformer bosses can feel. Example being: dodge attacks. Wait for boss to be in a \"vulnerable\" state. Attack. Repeat. In Rabi-Ribi, you can just keep attacking through just about most things. Sometimes, it WILL feel like the bosses are HP sponges though, especially in post-game content.\n\nThe story and writing are.... okay. I can't say I am in love with the characters or world, but I do also genuinely really like them. I wonder if this is due to the translation or just the writing in general? It feels all very dry and extremely literal at times. The plot itself is lighthearted mostly though and the world is full of all sorts of characters that don't have time to get enough attention. I think there's potential in all these things, though, and the player will probably be able to enjoy it still.\n\nOverall, I think this will be one of my favorite games I played this year. Whoever created this, clearly just made something they really wanted. Sexy/cute girls who love other girls and they go on adventures through a colorful and weird world. Really enjoyed it for that! It goes on sale pretty often for a good price too, so I think this is an easy recommend. It's not the best game in the world by a longshot, but its got a lot of heart and charm and that's something to enjoy", "timestamp_created": 1623701650, "timestamp_updated": 1623701650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51974332332611084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93407115": {"recommendationid": "93407115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125719175", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 8355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1943, "last_played": 1680867579}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the one game I probably will never be able to platinum.

The story is fantasically non-sensical, but it\u2019s fairly self-aware of it. The control is silky smooth, and the exploration is fun and satisfying as you would expect of the genre. The game controls great, with enough enemies on-screen to make traversal a fair trial. The artwork leans towards the fanservice side, so it might not be to everyone\u2019s tastes. The enemies range from the cute and ridiculous, to also fairly fanservice-y. Each of the main story beats is accompanied by a bit of nice anime art, and meeting each of the bosses starts and ends with a bit of goofy repartee. \n\nOverall, the combat is reminiscent of a late-era Mega Man game, but with a lot more emphasis on enemies filling the screen with colorful bullets. You start off with a melee attack, but quickly gain a semi-automated ranged attack, which can be slightly customized to fit how you want to fight. Some of the enemies are static, and just seem to shoot whether or not you\u2019re nearby. The more dangerous enemies aggressively hunt you down while you\u2019re on-screen, hoping to put you in a bad spot between their shots and the suppressing fire of the stationary enemies. Early on, each one of these encounters is pretty harrowing; some of the enemy deployments can take you down pretty quickly. Once you get enough powerups, though, you may find yourself just running through screens of enemies. However, all of the bosses remain perfectly challenging the whole way. The bosses in particular play out like a bullet hell shooter, with tons of tiny shots filling the filling screen in dizzying patterns, daring you find your way through them. The game also rates you on your performance during these battles, inspiring you to fight elegantly and not just tank shots while mashing on the melee button.\n\nAs you play the game, more areas open up, and DLC expands on some of these areas with higher degrees of difficulty. Some of the areas can be a bit of a trek to get to, but most areas have several teleporters to get you where you want to go quickly.\n\nOverall, if you like 2D exploratory platformers, bullet hell shooters, and/or cute anime girls, this game is recommended.

Yes. That is what this is.\n\nEssentially if you picture any normal Metroid style world layout, that is what you get here. Gaining new powers and attacks that let you traverse the world to new locations you haven't been. However, unlike many of it's more... confidently dressed peers, Rabi-Ribi has possibly the most boss fights and sequence breakable areas that I've personally seen. Seriously, it feels like there's a boss fight every 15 minutes... and there might be. So having said that...\n\nGood god... The combat starts slow but by a couple hours in you got legit combos at your disposal, and so do your enemies. The normal non-boss fodder range from squishy pushovers to literally more annoying then Lucifer, but then you get to the later bosses and realize that you might not even get to see the credits. It is very much a bullet \"hell\" game at times, but in a good way. \n\nThere's a light style system where as long as you vary your attacks enough the gauge will fill. You have a number of melee attacks and moves to pull off as well as a pew-pew pellet shot that takes different forms depending on which laser type you have equipped. The higher the style meter the more damage you do. Get hit and it goes down. So not taking damage is incentivised not only through the usual fear of death but also your damage output taking a tank. \n\nOh, and them sequence breaks. Yea on first playthrough you might be following the normal path, but on repeats? Really, even on the same ng cycle, later down the line you might accidentally hit some buttons together and- what what that? You found a secret move? So now you learned the alternate wall jump technique before you were even supposed to have wall jump and can go virtually wherever you want. In other games you'd be told \"nah ah, you stop that right there you silly billy!\" Not here. You find a place your not supposed to be? Explore to your hearts content. \n\nIs it clear this isn't just some silly rabbit game yet? The whole point of this review is pretty much just so there's another \"THIS AIN'T YOUR TYPICAL WEEB CASUL GAME LOOOOOOO-\" post on here so maybe someone else will actually pick this up.\n\nLook.\nHere me out.\nIt's a very good metroidvania.\nYou have to believe me... It's actually one of the best depending on your preference.\n\nIf you like action games, Metroid, and don't mind some shmup-style-bullet-hell-teeth-grinding difficulty (the good kind) then pick this up and just pretend the game doesn't have what might be the most unfortunate aesthetic to hinder mass market appeal I've ever seen. \n\nOh... and the story is like.. real bad.\nBut that's okay cause that gameplay be like y e e t.", "timestamp_created": 1621001578, "timestamp_updated": 1621001578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739387154579162598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91904809": {"recommendationid": "91904809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247312604", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1299, "last_played": 1623285118}, "language": "english", "review": "SO frustrated, had quite a few crashes but this was the ultimate...

I recently came back to it, and it ticks a lot of boxes that I enjoy. Just unabashedly: A+got-bunny-girls. It's got the usual Metroidvania hooks that are really enjoyable. The combat is fun, but can be tough. It combines simple beat'em up combos with bullet-hell mechanics...I'm not a big fan of bullet-hell games, and as such, I find the combat quite difficult.\nSome parts of the combat don't feel as tight as they should be either. Because they use a stamina meter to limit your combo, chaining attacks together (especially during the early game) feels really unsatisfying. And being able to link between different attack types isn't very smooth either. For example, going from a hammer attack to throwing a bomb is not fluid at all. You also can't have Ribbon (your fairy) shoot while you are attacking.\nThe story on the other hand....really reminds me of the kind of fan-fic-level anime-obsessed stuff I would write as a teenager. It falls back on to every anime trope in existence, the entire cast of only females is dumber than a sack of rocks, cringe-inducing and forced \"will-they/won't-they\" tropes, and an overall mixed tone that isn't well balanced and seems to have an identity crisis between wanting to just be a light-hearted game about girls obsessed with bunnies or trying to tell a story that pulls at the heartstrings.

It seems designed so that you can \"sequence-break\" and go places early, but also acknowledges that you did something special.

Controls were vey unintuitive for the most part. It also expects you to commit for your attack too much. Nothing is cancellable and there are some animatons that a few SECONDS long. There were a lot of cases where I would do a certain attack, the boss would be able to telegraph the attack, does it and hit it with me with some time to spare before I am able to move. Pretty much no boss felt exciting to beat regardless of if it took 1 or 10 tries.\n\nI cannot recommend the game to anyone aside from the people that are up for playing challenging games just for the sake of challenge as it is currently the hardest metroidvania I played (and I played about 45-50 by now.

Looking past all the fanservice and also Cicini because God why did they do that to her design, this is quite possibly one of the best games I've ever played, with amazing exploration, level design, and combat. It's so fun to play, so easy to get into, and when you finally learn all the stuff you can do, using it to break the games in ways you think wouldn't be intended but then actually are... It just makes you feel like a fucking god. A bunny girl god with a fairy semi god. \n\nSo, let me break down each aspect of the game:\n\nStory: 7/10\nThis is definitely a mixed bag for a lot of people but... I actually like the story of this game, its fun, charming, and hey, it has canon lesbians so that's a plus. But the real best parts of the story for me come from everything to do with Noah and the past of Rabi Rabi. I really like how they told it, and Chapter 10 is such a good chapter in the game with how it concluded the story in a great way. \n\nMusic: 9/10\nNot every song is amazing, but when they're amazing, holy SHIT they're good. Speicher Galerie was such a good final area theme, matching how brutal the Library was if you didn't know how to get through it by mastering the mechanics you had at your disposal. \n\nCharacters: 8/10\nPretty good, honestly. There's a few I don't care for, but some of them are really good! Irisu definitely is the one who while she isn't bad, you might not like her, and she needed slightly more time since her arc in the last chapter felt ever so slightly rushed but not enough to make me dislike her. I still like her, she's cool.\n\nGameplay: 11/10\nThis game is fun. Insanely fun. I have spent so much time playing this game and there is definitely a reason for that. It's just so insanely fun, and the design is so well put together. Like. Wow\nThere's so much shit to do in this game that it's kinda insane to complete it all. \n\nDifficulty: As easy or as hard as you want it to be\n\nThere are an insane amount of difficulty choices thanks to both the selection of 5 different game modes and 6 different difficulties (9 if you have the Artbook DLC). I used to play on Novice, which is imo a better starting point than Casual. But now I'm able to finish this game and some of the superbosses on BEX.\n\nOverall: 10/10\n\nThis game has some flaws, but I just love it too much to let those drag it down for me.

That's why I'm giving it a positive over a negative even though it has a real problem.\n\nThe main problem in this game is you rarely get to actually play it. There is SOOOOO MUCH talking in cutscenes that you spend more time reading (mostly creepy/cringy) dialog than you do actually playing. There are times you'll be stuck talking to someone and when it finally ends you'll walk forward for one screen or so and the game will stop again for another cutscene. This happens so often that I literally yelled on my stream last night, \"I just want to play the game!\" in exasperation. I played for two hours last night and I think I only actually \"played\" about an hour and 15 mins, the rest was spent in VN dialog scenes.\n\nI'd recommend this game for the gameplay definitely... but if you can't stand ENORMOUS amounts of Visual Novel sections and creepy dialog about girls wanting to do sexy things to bunnies interesting, you may want to look into the game a bit more before you decide to buy it.\n\nI'm gonna finish the game as I'm streaming it, but I can't give this anymore than a neutral due to the amount of time you aren't actually playing the game.", "timestamp_created": 1612468084, "timestamp_updated": 1612468084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.367234200239181519", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85954020": {"recommendationid": "85954020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008564962", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1554, "last_played": 1690471094}, "language": "english", "review": "bunny", "timestamp_created": 1612458111, "timestamp_updated": 1612458111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85947404": {"recommendationid": "85947404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815969014", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1684540987}, "language": "english", "review": "from what ive played so far, fun and very much worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1612450679, "timestamp_updated": 1612450679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85943688": {"recommendationid": "85943688", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079830711", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2319, "last_played": 1616076761}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth it", "timestamp_created": 1612446508, "timestamp_updated": 1626835137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85927874": {"recommendationid": "85927874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091242525", "num_games_owned": 468, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1015, "last_played": 1613545182}, "language": "english", "review": "game hard", "timestamp_created": 1612423556, "timestamp_updated": 1612423556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491864800453186035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85902862": {"recommendationid": "85902862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110957770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1139, "last_played": 1682196731}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no me lo e acabado al 100, y puedo decir que a sido un gran juego que mescla varios tipos de generos, como un metroidvania, con bullhell, y una banda sonora estupendo, que a pesar de sus 5 a\u00f1os siguen sacando actualizaciones", "timestamp_created": 1612382659, "timestamp_updated": 1612382659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85902167": {"recommendationid": "85902167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142773527", "num_games_owned": 1036, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 3607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2981, "last_played": 1687527659}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game I will revisit often because of how fun it is.\n\nPro's: \nNon-linear with many different ways to play\nCute girls\nCute girls who will beat you without hesitation (for those of you into that)\nAMAZING SOUNDRTRACK! \nGreat replay value \nMultiple difficulties for those who want a challenge or just vibe with the game easily \nThe post game has a post game....

It was also my gateway into the Bullet Hell genre, so that's definitely a plus as well! If both of these interest you then this is basically a must have!\n\nPretty much every aspect of this game is on a masterful level. Erina and Ribbon control really well and the many upgrades feel great to obtain and use. The enemies and bosses are very fun to fight, with the bosses being plentiful with a massive array of interesting attacks. The world is huge and offers tons of areas to discover and explore, each with various events occurring in them. There's a bunch of extra areas with plenty more content if all that somehow isn't enough. I could go on, but I think this generally wraps up how good the gameplay is. It ticks off all the boxes in game design and area design and excels in many of them.\n\nYes, the game is extremely challenging...by default. If you're not confident in taking on tough games, no worries, for there are 2 easy modes made for casual players! If you're worried about being too good, no worries, for there are 3 harder difficulty options excluding the 2 unused options beyond that. Bosses can also have their durability and strength adjusted to be based on area progress or item progress, depending on whether or not you intend to gather all the upgrades. If you change your mind at any point, Skullo can easily change the difficulty for you!\n\nAs for everything else? Narrative is surprisingly great. It keeps itself simple for the most part, which is expected for the theme of the game. Without giving spoilers, parts of the game can and will take darker and much more serious turns, somehow without going overboard with it. Overall the setting is cute and fun, exactly as it should be! The darker elements are welcomed and really add a lot.\n\nMusic is phenomenal. I've often gone back to the music when not playing and my words can't do it justice! Each song, both overworld and battle, captures the scene extremely well and adds so much more to the already great gameplay! The music even makes very good use of leitmotifs, along with varying itself during gameplay.\n\nVisually the game may not be perfect or spectacular in all regards, but it still looks really nice and keeps a joyous and consistent art style. Each area feels distinct from one another and enemy attacks are spectacular to look at!\n\nThere's tons of content in this game. I haven't put over 120hrs into a Metroidvania title before this one! If the huge array on content somehow isn't enough for you (much like how it wasn't for me) there's a bunch of DLC which all add a lot more to the game!\n\nI don't say this often, but this game gets a 10/10 from me. It really is a treat to play! Don't pass on this one if you're into this sort of game.

Turns out, it was one of the best decisions I could've ever made.\n\nWhile Rabi-Ribi may not be a masterpiece, it does so many things right that it's easy to forgive it its faults. The map is well designed, giving you plenty to explore and get lost in, maybe not to the extent of some of its brethren (Axiom Verge and Hollow Knight are two games that immediately come to mind) but it's still fun to navigate around, in large parts due to its movement. Furthermore, this movement highlights one of this game's greatest strength, which is sequence breaking.\n\nGemaYue has largely embraced the speedrunning and sequence breaking community with open arms, providing both a speedrun mode and also not removing any bugs unless they actually caused major problems with the game as a whole, even going so far as including an option to revert the way Hammer Rolls work since speedrunners were using them for zips and the subsequent update broke them. Sequence breaking is further encouraged by means of achievements, incentivizing players to think outside of the box and outright break out of it, something that the map, perhaps both accidentaly yet also quite likely intentionally accomodates. \n\nThat's not to say the game is spotless though. While most bosses are quite fair (within the realm of bullet hell shooters) and well designed, there are several frustrating encounters that, while not impossible, knocked the experience down a bit for me. The other large problem this game has is with its pacing, particularly towards the end, as the finale of the game feels like it largely overstays its welcome and the game should have ended two chapters ago. \n\nThese downsides have not been enough to make me not enjoy the game though. Rabi-Ribi is one of the best Metroidvanias you can play right now, and it manages to keep me playing it to this very day, both thanks to its updates and main game, as well as the ability for people to make and share their own levels.

The gameplay might be good later on (I wouldn't know), but if you look at the artwork and think \"this kinda grosses me out\", steer clear - it doesn't get better in-game.\n\nNearly all characters wear revealing outfits, with the most revealing outfit going to Ribbon, the very childlike fairy sidekick. She is nearly naked. Several characters speak in third-person first-person (e.g. \"Ribbon is lost!\") and constantly refer to their \"masters\". A character found early on is described as peeping on Ribbon in the shower. The main protagonist, who wears a Playboy-esque outfit, is repeatedly emphasized as being a regular pet bunny (with a pet bunny's understanding of the world) given a human form. It goes on.\n\nFactors like these gave me a deep feeling of discomfort that I couldn't shake. It seems like the game assumes its target audience is into these characters, and wants to provide fanservice to them. Based on the mods on the Steam Workshop, they'd be correct - a large chunk of them are nude mods and alternative, skimpier outfits. The game seems to seek to appeal to people who're sexually interested in characters that have an underage appearance and childlike-level intelligence.\nI wasn't kidding when I said I felt sick to my stomach earlier.\n\nI do realize I have a shallow take on this game. \"The game's characters and themes are repulsive!\" isn't a very deep level of critique for any game, and I somewhat feel like a puritan for disliking the game for this reason. I think anyone with a similar perspective as I do would appreciate a review like this pointing out how appearances don't deceive.\nI wish someone warned me before I started playing, so I'm warning you. If you read this and don't care/don't see why what I described would be disturbing or uncomfortable, you'll probably enjoy Rabi-Ribi. Consider it recommended to you.

Mechanically solid, has an absurd amount of content and well designed boss attack patterns. Challenging game that controls very well.\n\nPlayer characters control similar to Megaman games (eg. Megaman Zero) where you have a ranged charge shot and a variety of melee combos & movement options. Combat and movement control is surprisingly varied with hidden techniques the player might find throughout multiple playthroughs.\n\nDialogue, art and story(?) can be super cringey but unless that really bugs you I think it's worth ignoring and skipping cutscenes etc.\n\nRabi-Ribi strives on pushing the player with increasingly more difficult boss fights. There are a huge variety of game modes, superbosses and optional challenges (even for meta-level stuff like speedrunning the game or 0% runs). \nHardcore 2D action fans who enjoy boss fights can get a lot of bang for their buck for all that, others not so much. If you end up enjoying the game there's definitely no lack of content.\n\nLater boss fights take long to finish which can be frustrating if you get stuck. But they have a much larger pool of attacks / unique situations compared to most games so it's more a case of challenge rather than a repetitive/boring fight with a long healthbar.\n\nExploration/world aspect and platforming levels aren't that notable compared to other metroidvanias. But combat design and boss fights are a major strong point.\nI think the post-game \"Is The Order a DLC?\" makes the rest more interesting with focused and challenging platforming instead of fluff but that may not be for everyone either.\n\nPersonally found the soundtrack good all-around too.\n\n[Played through Main game + Order DLC on Hard (standard, no buffs)]", "timestamp_created": 1607004898, "timestamp_updated": 1607077646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.68908083438873291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81500874": {"recommendationid": "81500874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041978401", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 9008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8671, "last_played": 1689628256}, "language": "english", "review": "bnuuy", "timestamp_created": 1606963801, "timestamp_updated": 1606963801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81377712": {"recommendationid": "81377712", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990036156", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 466, "playtime_forever": 3067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2471, "last_played": 1617302783}, "language": "english", "review": "In the early 2000s a gargantuan custom campaign by the name of Visions of the future was created for Starcraft Brood war.

I played it back when it first came out in 2016, so this thumbs up is far overdue.\n\nRabi-Ribi blends familiar metroidvania gameplay with the bullet-hell/danmaku genre. This combination plays out brilliantly, as each new method you gain for exploring and traversing the world (double jump, air dash, ground slide, etc) translates into the boss fights as new techniques you can (and must) use to avoid increasingly complex patterns of bullets. The gameplay rapidly evolves with each new ability you gain, and the difficulty demands you learn to make the most of each tool you are given. The game becomes very challenging very quickly (especially if you are as bad at bullet hells as I am), but it's precisely the difficulty- the split second reactions to slide under a stream of bullets, or air dash against the wall to stay suspended in an opening while lasers fill the screen- that makes the boss fights so rewarding.\n\nThough the game is very difficult, you do have some options to give yourself an advantage. You can carry a small number of healing items, bought from the (cute) shopkeeper in the hub of the game. You can also find upgrades to health, stamina, attack damage, etc out in the world, in addition to badges that offer various effects- such as applying poison to your attacks, or increasing the number of i-frames you are given after being hit.\n\nAnd I'd be remiss not to mention the soundtrack. This is easily one of my favorite game soundtracks. Each area of the game is accompanied by a track that fits it perfectly. The early game sounds upbeat and fun, while toward the end of the game, there are songs that are impactful and even emotional.\n\nI could (as my friends know very well) go on a great deal longer than this. I love this game. The boss fights of no other game give me quite the same feeling as Rabi-Ribi. They are intense and satisfying but not quite in the same way something like souls is. If I could put it into words, I would.\n\nRabi-Ribi delivers one of the most unique spins on the metroidvania genre. The boss fights are amazing, the world is full of hidden upgrades to uncover, and the soundtrack is absolutely incredible.

This is actually one of the largest (overall) metroidvanias I've played. \n\nThe story is rather confusing (what with anthropomorphic bunnies, cats, elementals, and whatnot), seems to be a love story about the bunny-girls, Erina and Erisu. The story has that distinct anime weirdness to it, so you may (or may not) care about such things, but if you're into it, it's a cute story I'm told. I thought it was super strange how everyone in the game world is just super-casual about animals suddenly turning into people; it's like it was a regular thing for them and they couldn't be bothered to be shocked. Whatever.\n\nWeird anime story aside, the gameplay is where this game shines bright. The levels are well designed, fun, somewhat challenging, and unique. The controls are responsive and the level progression gates are pretty creative.\n\nThe \"boss\" fights take that platforming goodness and throw it to the wind in exchange for some bullet-hell gameplay. It's not the kind where if you get hit, you die; it CAN be that if you really want it to be, but if you put the game on \"casual\" difficulty, you can tank all of the battles just fine without dying. I mean, on the final battle, you MIGHT have to eat some health items if you get hit by everything.\n\nThe thing annoyed me most was that the bosses have scripted damage-caps that artificially lengthen the duration of the battle. I get that the devs wanted to show off that bullet-hell dazzle, but I found it to be ridiculous and a poor design choice. Why didn't they just make the bosses health scale with your current DPS instead of making them stop taking damage until a certain time has elapsed?\n\nOverall, Rabi-Ribi is a rather enjoyable metroidvania/BH/VN hybrid, and it's totally worth a playthrough if you pick it up on sale. If you're into the anime waifu scene, then this might be just what you need, but if you aren't, then it's just a pretty decent metroidvania with some weird design choices shoehorned into it.", "timestamp_created": 1597502943, "timestamp_updated": 1597502943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74305138": {"recommendationid": "74305138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062525491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 678, "last_played": 1641618838}, "language": "english", "review": "[Horny art, but a deceptively not horny, amazing experience with speedrunners kept in mind]\n\nArt is a bit too horny, but the story, dialogue, and characters are all surprisingly wholesome and cute.\n\nThe GAMEPLAY THO, very awesome.

Period. You can take all the issue with the 'horny on main' aesthetic you want, but the fact of the matter is if you're looking for any kind of definitive Metroidvania experience, from exploration to music to combat to overall presentation, you will not find a better one and it's been four years since its initial release. It even has DLC, for MORE CONTENT. Everything you could ever want.\n\nThe overall mechanics are incredibly solid, as they need to be from any game in the bullet hell genre alone, let alone this one, and they allow for so much discovery. Literally. The sheer amount of map that's available to explore with hidden items and areas and power ups and easter eggs is staggering, and there's bits hidden EVERYWHERE. But it's all accessible. Everything about the controls makes sense and just generally feel good. The game takes a bit of a hit whenever it decides specifically to not use its own mechanics in homage to other games which came before and likely inspired it. You don't need to play those games though, you have Rabi-Ribi, and Rabi-Ribi is so much better.\n\nThe music. The MUSIC. THE MUSIC! THE SOUNDSCAPE! If only every developer could afford this much time to what and how their game sounds. The score is just so good though. It fits the scenes and varying atmospheres of the game perfectly and still manages to be catchy all on its own. The sounds are satisfying and, almost as importantly, give weight, depth, and feeling to what's being done on screen. This is something that even high budget studios seem to miss quite often, but the developers of Rabi-Ribi seem to have an understanding of the importance of music and sound and the potential impact it can have. It's not always the most noticable thing, but it's part of what separates good games from great games, and great games from games like Rabi-Ribi.\n\nIt even has a good story. NOBODY BELIEVES IN PANTS AND THEY STILL WROTE A GOOD STORY! I know that's a bit of a non-sequitur, but honestly I don't want to say anything about the story because this is all very improvised and I don't know how to reference things without spoiling, and the story is good enough to not spoil. I dunno about the DLC storylines, but the main one is great. Don't like it? Find the other endings, nerd.\n\nAs for replay value, yeah, Rabi-Ribi's got that too.

The upgrades and combat are decently interesting.\n\nLess appealing to me is the scantily clad all female minors cast that is shown during all dialogue, which is at least a quarter of the game (but you can skip, thank Christ). On that note, nor am I interested in \"cute\" conversations or anime expression figures seen during loading screens or displaying character health. \n\nFighting itself is fun, but you need to be prepared for what that is in this game before buying. Exploration has some harsh spikes and easy fights. Nearly EVERY boss fight is a repetitive, but different variation of, a bullet hell where you must cycle through attacking and dodging. This is additionally forced by your most powerful tools having diminishing returns in short time spans.

And all made mostly by a single person.\n\nThis game is about a bunny named Erina who somehow got transformed into human and wants to find their master and then starting to uncover mysteries that Rabi-Rabi island has. A simple task turns into a big adventure with a lot of memorable moments... And all this in format of a mix between bullet hell and metroidvania, with some tough platforming sections here and there. If you want to get into bullet hell games or platformers, playing this could be one of the stepping stones into those two genres in a way... Since it gives you understanding of concepts those games are based around.\n\nThe game offers a wide variety of difficulty settings that can accommodate to each type of player. Starting from a difficulty that anyone can clear implying they try (literally anyone i mean), to difficulty that only the very few can do... Which seems impossible at first sight and is called such in the game as well.\n\nAlso this game is the only one I played that has speedrun mode - a mode that skips all the story stuff and shows in-game timer with item/map% shown as well. Due to the world being open, there are very many ways to build yourself a speedrun route for this game. There are many factors that can impact your route choice, but for some of the main categories there is a couple of really bad tricks that can kill your run in the middle / end if you want a very optimized route...\n\nThis game is perfect for people that enjoy challenges of many kinds, be that simply obtaining all achievements, beating the game fast, with various handicaps, or even beating the game with all items being randomized. (I don't suggest randomizer to anyone who has not memorized every single item location though)\n\nAnd for people who want to enjoy the game casually there is a lot of cuteness, glorious OST and a lot of fun to have...\n\nI tried to be brief with this review and also didn't have my thoughts organized enough, but in short: buy this game if you like any of the following:\n1. Challenges\n2. Cute things\n3. Bunnies\n4. Metroidvanias\n\n\nAlso I [b]REALLY[/b] suggest anyone buying this game to at least buy \"Is the Order a DLC\", this DLC expands the game story, makes it much more interesting and adds new mechanics to the game. For people that want more challenge they can buy Before Next Adventure as well.\n10/10 in all categories. Don't even need to list the categories. (S+)\n\nNote: My achievements were reset and all my timestamps are different from actual ones. Due to it happening due to a certain accident, the developer decided to add a new launch option for me to be able to reset and still stay at #14 (#1, because 13 people were hackers) in achievement leaderboard as I was the first person to obtain every achievement after cocoa DLC was released.\nThe new launch option is -noachiupload, it prevents uploading achievement score to leaderboard so I can reset achievements without affecting the board.\nActual time of completion is about 250 hours.\nAll valid achievement timestamps are here: https://truesteamachievements.com/game/RabiRibi/achievements?gamerid=46228\nWas participating in the beta of Cocoa DLC since day 1.\nObtained every achievement it had at 10.12.2020 (dd.mm.yyyy)\nafter that... my achievements messed up.\n\nArchive of a conversation in rabidb server showing that I did reset it using debug and dev response on it:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nUnxjt4.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/p1gsK3w.png", "timestamp_created": 1594335210, "timestamp_updated": 1607633561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680391848087310791", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72387666": {"recommendationid": "72387666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345242865", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1597871619}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute AF", "timestamp_created": 1594324860, "timestamp_updated": 1594324860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72371149": {"recommendationid": "72371149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105239132", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1001, "last_played": 1698561582}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite fun, able to be played Multiplayerish.

If you thought, \"a weeb's craving for anything anime,\" you are correct. And diving down the 'rabbit hole' of anime, here we have Rabi-Ribi, a bullet-hell Metroidvania where you play as Anime Girl the Rabbit, Erina. She is a rabbit who became a human \u2014 a human who looks like she ran out of a lewd maid cafe while still on duty. And it's up to our bunny girl to find her owner and discover the secrets of why bunnies have disappeared from the world. If you read this sentence and are thinking to yourself, \"What...?\" Don't worry, there's more. During your journey, you will meet new friends, who will immediately try to kill you upon encounter. If you successfully survive annihilation, your new, now non-hostile friend will agree to help you open a portal to a different dimension. It's an outside world full of dangerous degenerates and perverts similar to the ones who play this game. It's in these two worlds where you'll uncover the mysteries of Rabi-Ribi Island. \n\nIf the story doesn't arouse you, that's okay. There's also \u2014 thrilling gameplay. If you're unsure as to whether or not this bullet-hell platformer is for you, fear not. Our female protagonist comes: well-equipped, and by that, I mean she wields the mighty Piko Hammer, a weapon so powerful it could even match the iconic Mega-Buster. Alongside you flies your trusty fairy helper, Ribbon, who decided that wearing nothing but a ribbon cut into two pieces, would protect her from harsh environments such as freezing icy summits and blazing volcanic caverns. She has the ability to cast magic spells that not only assist enemy bosses in giving you epileptic seizures, but also deal massive damage to them as well. It's a win-win situation.\n\nThe gameplay loop is simple. Run about the map, find a boss, die to the boss about 10+ times, receive a \"pity-buff\" to beat the boss, and then repeat. I should also add that there are tons of secrets to discover, upgrades and combos to unlock, as well as those sweet, honeyed CGs players will be anticipating. While you won't find any of that juicy NSFW material most of you are looking for, Rabi-Ribi does not fail to greet players with much bunny fanservice, as it will become apparent that every character in this game looks like they just got bouncing back from Comiket. In other words, hopeful anticipants won't be disappointed.\n\nIn summary, this game gets a lot of things right. Top-notch gameplay, eargasmic music, pleasing visuals, and an expected incomprehensible anime-style plot. Let's get serious for a moment; we all know why you want this game. Don't try to hide yourself with the usual \"for the great gameplay!\"  phrase. If you want to play as a lewd anime bunny girl roaming about beating every living thing to death and then getting pimp-slamped herself to death, you've come to the right place. No shame in calling it what it is, fellow degenerate.

(I played on Hard with Alternative scaling.) Bosses have tons of elaborate attack patterns that often fill the screen with bullets/lasers/etc, which look incredibly daunting and panic-inducing, and thus feel so satisfying when you learn how to best avoid them. Many bosses I've died to over and over, but when you lose to a boss, you can continue right in front of the boss, keeping all the consumables and buffs you had from before the attempt.

The game is a metroidvania through and through - certain areas can't be reached at first, but as the game progresses, you find new items that allow you to reach new areas. There is no leveling system - instead, all character upgrading is done by finding items on the way that increase the character's stats, acquiring badges that grant certain bonuses and buying upgrades at the shop. Despite the lack of a leveling system, there are still plenty of upgrades available.\n\nThe game's main difference from \"traditional\" metroidvania games is the bullet hell element. The beginning of the game is quite easy, but very soon bosses, even the early ones, release attacks that require precise movements in order to be avoided.\n\nThe game feels, looks, sounds and plays great. The art for each character (shown during dialogue scenes) is very well done and the pixelated graphics are cute and well done. It also helps that the game has great sound design and an amazing soundtrack.\n\nThe story is also quite interesting - it gets a bit convoluted as the game progresses and reveals more of the plot, but it works for the most part and shows a story that is a lot deeper than first expected. Character dialogue is also well done for the most part, including some very good translations. Not once during the game did I feel like there was something missing or misplaced in the dialogue because of translation issues.\n\nCombat works quite well. Between all the different attacks that are unlocked as the game progresses, magic attacks for ranged combat, boost attacks and the combo system, there is plenty of variety in combat. More so considering the variety of enemies as well.\n\nI think the only issue I had with the game was with some of the levels from the DLCs, which rely more on platforming than combat - which is okay in theory, but not great in practice. Certain areas from these levels are near impossible to get through without taking damage, which was also one of the reasons why I had to reduce the difficulty from Novice to Casual (since even on Novice the game can be pretty hard and I'm also not going to pretend I'm some kind of bullet hell master).\n\nThe only other thing I could think of besides that is the map system, which is kinda confusing and doesn't really explain to you what each icon means. Sometimes it also doesn't show when an area has a connection to another area.\n\nI think that if they balanced the difficulty a little and improved certain things on the game, a possible sequel (if there ever is one) could be even better than this one.\n\nEasy recommendation, even at full price - just be warned that this isn't an easy game.", "timestamp_created": 1591795022, "timestamp_updated": 1591795022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70540201": {"recommendationid": "70540201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078610814", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 539, "last_played": 1676725380}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont like metroidvanias, but this game is great.

The game consist roughly of 20% story dialogue (VN style), 40% running around looking for more secrets, items, bosses or whatever and 40% awesome boss fights. (Only counts for the Story Mode)\n\nAs expected with Metroidvanias, except for certain parts locked by game or story progression the world is open and you as the player have the complete freedom of choice on what to do when. The story progresses on a certain number of bosses beaten, not specific bosses beaten in order, and you can decide where to go and what items to pick up everywhere. (You even get an achievement for beating the game without ever picking up your melee weapon.)\n\nIn terms of combat, next to the constant bullet-hell-dodging-struggle you face not only with bosses but literally every tiny minion you encounter plenty of throughout the world, you have several different combat abilities. Many melee attack moves as well as several kinds of ranged magic attacks, each having a different attack pattern, charged attack and special skill. All of them are unlocked and upgraded by picking up specific items in the world or buying other specific boosts in the town shop.\n\nMore advanced attack moves are also usable and at some point even needed to clear harder platformer puzzles, which is one of the most common ways how new areas are locked until you find the needed buff somewhere else.\n\nThe boss battles are long, challenging (there are several difficulties to choose from - per (only for some) boss and playthrough), epic and feature enough uniqueness in every last one of them to never get boring.\n\nFinally, alongside the special items you aquire throughout your journey, there are \"badges\" to collect as well. Each one of them giving different passive buffs, but only a (larger with game progression) limited number of them can be active at a time, limited by a point-cost-system.\n\n[hr]\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2554689030[/url]\n\n[hr]\n[h3]Content & Runtime[/h3]\nWith over 20 unique bosses to fight, of which many have more than a single unique bossfight, scattered over 9 (+ town) unique areas with several progress locked sub-areas, dozens of items and badges to find/upgrade, several story chapters including an \"After Game\" and \"After-After Game\", as well as NG+ mechanics, several difficulties to challenge, an additional speedrun and boss rush gamemode - plenty of content is given considering the small and cute appearance of this game.\n\nDepending on how much motivation you have to challenge chasing the over 200 Achievements, ranging from simple game progress to literally breaking the game, and how much of a challenge clearing the game itself is for you, multiple dozens of hours of gametime can be guaranteed.\n\nAnd besides the already good enough gameplay challenging all the awesome boss fights, the game also delivers a story that's worth mentioning - and enjoying of course. Even though the story only really gets serious towards the end and in the DLCs, under the cute and lighthearted mask lies something that, after finishing it, I would even call \"emotional\". Both the main story's ending as well as the true ending in the DLCs building up on that leave a certain impact after clearing, different from the usual \"I finally cleared that awesome boss fight\" feeling.\n\nTo enjoy everything the game and story offer to its fullest, the \"bunnybox\" gives a CG gallery to look at all the story related CG artworks again, as well as a music box where you can listen to all the over 60 OSTs, all the ingame sound effects and even modify the play speed/pitch as it would be affected by certain ingame effects (all if you saw/heared it ingame once before).\n\n[hr]\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2559059588[/url]\n\n[hr]\n[h3]The DLCs[/h3]\nThey do actually add content.\nOf course the soundtrack and artbook are completely optional while the \"real\" content DLCs are highly suggested.\n\nThey do add new sub areas, new items, new bosses, new challenges, new story chapters, new everything - basicly expanding the base game in a way DLCs should. None of them are necessary, though if you enjoy the base game they are certainly worth considering.\n\nOn a side note, even the Artbook is recommendable - it does not only consist of concept artwork and lots of developer commentary, it even features a look at content back when it was in development and some scrapped gameplay ideas, which are fully playable there though.\nOn top of that it delivers the sprite viewer - a mode where you can enjoy and pose all the character (VN story) sprites in the game.\n\nWho enjoyed the game and wants a fair bit more of it will certainly not be disappointed.\nOverall, getting the complete bundle is a good idea when you are confident you'll like the game.\n\n[hr]\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2554689112[/url]\n\n[hr]\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nIs this game worth it?\nCertainly. It looks cute and isn't that expensive (even the complete bundle during a sale is almost nothing compared to all the content) and offers lots and lots to play with. It is a cute little timefiller for whenever you want to kill a few hours, though keeping you occupied for quite some time in total. The difficulty is highly adjustable so that both beginners and veterans will have their fair share of fun.\n\nGetting the bundle in the next sale is recommended, unless you are too unsure if the base game is something for you in the first place - during the 2h refund-gametime you have you can make yourself a crystal clear picture of what awaits you.\n\n\n\n[code]Helpful review?

I didn't run into many issues with the platforming and while the game 'punishes' you when you miss a jump, the level design is such that it doesn't delay you much. It's also an easy game to pick up and put down, as there are save points everywhere.\n\nFinally, I have never played a 'Metroidvania' that allows you this much freedom. They give some loose objectives to move the story forward, but you are in full control of how the story plays out, and many of the achievements are tied to this experimentation, making this game near infinitely replayable if you want to try and get all of the 212 achievements (with the DLC). \n\nBy the time I \"beat\" the game, I had only discovered 69% (nice) of the map and only 68% (almost nice) of items, so I'll be at this for awhile.\n\nI'll finish by saying that while the artwork is certainly suggestive, I found letting my wife know that the game is actually well worth playing to get me past that hurdle (not that she honestly cares that much for my silly hobby). I don't tend to go for games with artwork this style, mostly because it's not what I look for. This is just slightly more racy than the Shantae games, which are also well worth your time, but not nearly as robust as this was.\n\nHighly Recommended.

That's how hard it is simply to beat the game on normal. \n\nThere are skill-walls in the game also when it comes to platforming. Even if you have all items and are pretty much maxed out in the game and don't have problem in fights, but you can't time a jump into air dash (correctly in a tight 0.2 second window) into a triple wall jump, you simply can't get to the next room. And you need to in order to progress the story. That's how brutal this game this.\n\nThe bullet hell action is another story. There's very little \"aeroplane-style\" bullet hell sequences where you dodge like you would a traditional vertical/horizontal scrolling shooter. Most of the game involves navigating bullet hell via platforming. Controlling jump height by length of button press, air dashing, sliding, dropping etc is key. If all of this sounds good, you're going to like this game.\n\nEven tougher than the gameplay is the fact that the cutesy art style and suggestive CG makes this a really tough game to be walked in on.

It's one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played and it's probably my new favorite indie game. At this time with just under 50 hours I've completed all of the primary game content and bosses of the base game and DLC content with a modest completion percentage, minus a couple of the special bosses, but I won't be stopping anytime soon. The game is packed with content and you'll definitely be able to get your money's worth, particularly if you're the completionist type. There's a ton of achievements to hunt down as well as challenge modes: different boss rushes and a speedrun mode. The game even has workshop, something I would never typically expect from a game like this. \nReally, I like just about every element of the game. The music, the characters, the story, but above everything else is the gameplay. The standard metroidvania level exploration is great, the platforming sections were neat and fun. The bosses are what stand out to me most though. They're all unique and super fun. The way you get a glimpse into different characters through their attacks is wonderful and the magnitude of some of the battles at times left me in awe. There's times where I was left feeling like some particular attacks weren't exactly fair; not everything is perfectly intuitive for sure, but all in all I think it just comes down to learning the trick to some of the difficult attacks, which is fine. There's a healthy difficulty to the boss fights, and that's a good thing. They feel like proper bosses, something I find a lot of games drop the ball on. I've seen a couple people complain about the length of the boss fights, but I only consider that a plus, and a big one at that, which further contributes to them actually feeling like proper bosses and that ultimately only means more fun gameplay. \nI'd totally expected a completely generic, superficial story not prior knowing much about the game, but on the contrary even the story managed to draw me in. Honestly some of the character dialogue isn't exactly deep, and as such many of the supporting character personalities fall under simple stereotypical anime character archetypes but nevertheless the bits of lighthearted dialogue among characters in between the proper story segments is nice and makes the game a relaxing, comfy play.  \nIt's not a game that's for everybody; some won't be able to get on board with the game's mix of genres. Even if it's not your typical go-to, I highly recommend giving the game a try as you too might be pleasantly surprised.\nUpdate: Having now spent some 170+ hours playing the game to obtain 100% achievements I actually consider Rabi-Ribi a very strong contender for being my favorite game all-time.

There is no detector or anything so you have to throw bombs everywhere in hopes it blows up a secret passage and even then you may end up needing another power up to get it anyway. Thus you end up backtracking a billion times.\n\nThe game also is rather unfair, most of the time you get hit, it is because the projectiles fill up the already small rooms leaving you with no space to evade. The answer is to either run away or stay behind cover and wait 20 sec till your laser kills them through the wall both of which feel really lame. Bosses are also an issue as most of them end up in trial and error. They usually telegraph the attack beginning but then you still don\u00b4t know how the attack will spread and in which direction it will end leaving you in situations where you are unable to avoid damage. Atleast the saves are fair and often so you won\u00b4t have to redo much and in case of bosses you start right before them again. But that doesn\u00b4t mean bosses are hard, especially later when you get a certain item you can abuse invincibilty frames and do tremendous damge at the same time making them a cake-walk.\n\nAll in all it isn\u00b4t bad but I rather play a better metroidvania as this game is way too overrated due to its cute aesthetic.", "timestamp_created": 1584890011, "timestamp_updated": 1587306160, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.43519359827041626", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65439914": {"recommendationid": "65439914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261035580", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1532, "last_played": 1584755936}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the character design and the music.

It's really after around chapter 5 that it becomes a chore. I'm okay with repeating things, but I'm talking about repeating the same boss fights multiple times outside of boss rush. It has a similar effect to listening to the same music track over and over and over- it gets old fast.

You're looking at the art of this game, the costumes of the main characters, and the bad \"cutesy\" dialogue in the screenshots. You're thinking \"wow this otaku-bait blows\" without even watching the trailer all the way through. But hang on, I promise to god this game is good.  Please bear with me a few seconds.\n\nI thought the same thing too, until I gameshared it off somebody close to me for an hour or more. What looked like a barebones excuse for fanservice with some popular clickbait genres attached ended up being one of the best metroidvanias I've ever played. Playing the game on \"Hard: Alternative\" difficulty is a great challenge with tons of bullet hell goodness, and I never feel like the game is cheating me- I can beat any boss if I grind the patterns enough and learn how to dodge them. The way you deal damage is unique and interesting too, with a combo system that increases your overall DPS if you switch weapons a lot and lay in tons of attacks without getting hit or stopping for too long. Each weapon has it's own use too, and while some are certainly better than others there is definitely a reason to use each one. \n\nAs for the exploration aspect, the best comparison I can make for this game is \"An Untitled Story\" if you've ever played that. After the short prologue, you can basically go wherever you want and do whatever you want. I'm currently on chapter 2 and instead of doing the main story i'm going around and beating the crap out of hordes of optional bosses and adding them to my town. Each boss you beat also is able to buff you in various ways for a small bit of cash and gives you an overall increase in stats! And on top of this all, there are a near uncountable amount of secrets and collectables to find in each area. But don't fear the powercreep: every boss you beat \"levels up\" other bosses you haven't defeated yet, so the game is constantly engaging and doesn't get easy if you accidentally sequence break or explore too much.\n\nThe only main negative I have with this game is that there are a few invisible walls in the world. You can explore a staggering amount of places right from the getgo, but occasionally you'll run into a place where Rabi or Ribbon will go \"Oh no, this looks too scary... let's turn around\" and it feels cheap/stupid. Gating progression via a powerup would have been easily a good substitute, even if it allowed for sequence breaking. Being told I can't explore somewhere when I have freedom to go almost anywhere else just breaks my immersion and enjoyment.\n\nBut yeah seriously, get this game. I promise you it's good, just stick with it past the prologue.", "timestamp_created": 1578246338, "timestamp_updated": 1578246338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638356149196624756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61293082": {"recommendationid": "61293082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198849915394", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1612141455}, "language": "english", "review": "magnificent game, bullet hell with gravity is fun", "timestamp_created": 1578153439, "timestamp_updated": 1578153439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61181772": {"recommendationid": "61181772", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967711230", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1583019361}, "language": "english", "review": "Metrovania, rogue-lite i guess.

Excellent soundtrack and super-fun, super-addictive gameplay. There's not really a plot, but many times the game sets the atmosphere very well! It's as fun as it is hard -- and it's hard as crap, man! It's my first bullet-hell game, but still! What's so great about it is that it's a game that you can slowly improve at with hard work. With so many difficulty levels, and both bosses and \"special\" versions of each boss, and so many achievements, there's always a challenge for anyone at any skill level. Having an all-cute and goofy cast is a plus, too ^w^ My only complaints are that 1) rabi ribi /rarely/ gives you a breather; every second you're under attack, even outside boss battles. 2) if you don't know where you're going, good luck, 'cause all the enemies respawn every time you go from one room to another, and they're merciless. That's not challenging; that's just troublesome. But whatever -- I can let it slide. <(^o^)> btw if you get the soundtrack DLC, right-click on rabi-ribi in the steam games list, open the game's folder, and there you'll find the soundtrack, which again, is awesome. Also, buy the \"Is the Order a DLC?\" DLC. That adds the last two chapters to the game, which are really good. Honestly that DLC should be part of the game....

Essentially, Rabi Ribi is a metroidvania-style exploratory action-platformer game, punctuated by in-depth and challenging boss fights, flavored with anime-style, cute, and at times sexy visuals. When playing a game like this, you aren't playing for the writing, so I'd recommend just skimming the dialogue and not thinking about it too critically, because it takes twice as long as it needs to explain everything it wants to. Long story short, you play as Erina, a rabbit owned by a woman named Rumi, and you've been magically turned into a bunnygirl. You meet a fairy named Ribbon who becomes your companion, and you reunite with Rumi. Between an explanation and information presented in the prologue, you discover that Rumi's sister, Miru, is off missing in a strange world. In order to get her back, you need to go around and recruit (have boss fights with) magic-users on the island the game takes place on, who will power up an artifact that teleports you to the strange world where Miru is, so that you can get her back. That is the main plot, and it's all right conceptually; it's just blandly and at times confusingly written.\n\nNow, moving past that, every other aspect of this game is a true gem. The music ranges from light, spunky, and energetic, to serious, intense, and climactic, but I would at few points say it borders on \"generic.\" The visuals are, again, very cute. The pixel art is extremely easy to read, and all the particle effects (and there are a lot of them, especially in the boss fights) will never leave you guessing as to where is safe and where is dangerous, but it pulls that off while looking pretty, too. The CGs (full-screen drawn art) is very competently drawn, and conveys a genuine style, not like a Western artist trying to *copy* an anime art style -- this is the real deal. These CGs are pretty cute, sexy, and generally pretty fun. I wouldn't say they go particularly far into fanservice, but maybe I'm a bit desensitized, so your mileage may vary if you dislike cute-sexy fanservice for some reason. The movement in this game is tight, and you have an impressive amount of control of your character at any given point. Your movement options are vast, courtesy of double-jumps, wall-jumps, aerial dashes, speedy ground-rolls, slides, slide-kicks, rising-tackles, divekicks, and more. It's a pleasure to play, and danmaku (bullet hell) fans will feel at home with a tiny hitbox much smaller than the pixel art itself that can bob and weave through flashy and hard-to-dodge patterns of attacks. Performance-wise, the game runs like a dream, too, and has great controller support, especially with how Steam handles controller input these days.\n\nBesides the writing, I suppose the only criticism I could see reasonably levied against the game is that the RPG mechanics on offer are either lacking or missing entirely. Basically, you have an experience system for your hammer attacks, your fairy companion, and a carrot-bomb tool similar to Metroid morph ball bombs, and the experience you gain in these areas maxes out within twenty minutes of starting the game, making your attacks start slow and incomplete and climb up to full speed and full extensiveness within that time. In other words, the experience system is purely there as a tutorial, to get you used to Erina's moveset. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, either, just that there are people out there who go into this expecting the steady forward march of level-ups constantly improving the player's capabilities. Rabi-Ribi largely confines powerups to going out and exploring the world instead, with Erina combing the environment with her exploration tools and discovering a myriad of permanent buffs, badges, and tools to use, with a comparatively small number of similar items that can be bought from an in-game shop using a currency you absorb from defeating enemies. In short, it's far closer to Metroid than Castlevania on the metroidvania scale. Just thought that needed clearing up.\n\nBeyond that, though, the game is a dream. Play on Hard for a real casual-filtering experience. I would say that's the \"intended\" difficulty for most people willing to challenge themselves. It's an extremely well-made game that rewards you appropriately for all the hard work you put in to beat it, and if you're one of those people who stubbornly believes cutesy anime games are all fluff and no substance, you owe it to yourself to prove yourself wrong in the best possible way with this game. Just stick with it for at least five hours, and don't be a baby about the stupidly silly writing, and you'll be good.", "timestamp_created": 1574469513, "timestamp_updated": 1574469513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57629416": {"recommendationid": "57629416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100503176", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2341, "last_played": 1621837707}, "language": "english", "review": "good game\n\nBY THE WAY: The final boss has a bug and doesn't make you hit an autosave trigger after you beat her.

It really delivers well on its promise of being a metroidvania/bullet hell crossover, with the former being the format of the bulk of the game, and the latter used for boss fights. But the devs added some pretty strong Alienate the Audience dials, and turned Furry up to 5, Weeb up to 7, Cutesypoo up to 8, Girl on Girl (Romance) to 7 while leaving Girl on Girl (Action) at 0, Fanservice to 3, and both Achievement (Quantity) and Achievement (Completion Impossibility) up to 11. These individually may attract some players, but it's definitely an odd combination that, in whole or in part, will make a lot of potential buyers walk (or refund). I personally appreciate some of those points, and am not bothered by the rest, but do make sure you know what you're getting here. [B]You're playing as a literal bunny girl in an anime fairyland filled only with other animal girls who all have secret, unrequited crushes on each other and all the drama that goes along with that, in a game with hundreds of achievements, the majority of which only the most skilled and dedicated players can possibly earn.[/b] If any part of that sentence turns you off, best to move along.\n\nStill here? Lucky you, because as mentioned this is a truly solid gameplay experience, and I really enjoyed it. On the metroidvania side you have a lot of freedom to explore as you will, which in turn means there will be a lot of wandering around, backtracking, and stumbling into boss fights you won't be ready for (though they all have save points right before, so this doesn't feel unfair); and the mechanics are unique enough to stand out, with both melee and (eventually) a choice of several ranged attacks and specials that hit the genre must-haves while adding a few unique features as well. Only the very beginning is linear, and there's very little hand holding, so you'll need to keep track of every obstacle you couldn't clear, and then cross-reference it against each new upgrade you find that may let you finally pass it. And I'll admit there's a couple of things I never did figure out how to reach, but nothing that prevented me from completing both the game and the post-game.\n\nOn the bullet hell side, the boss fights are insane, with a lot of complex, layered bullet patterns combined with aimed attacks. I can definitely see this being appropriately challenging for skilled bullet hell masters, but I just as definitely am not one. Fortunately, they added enough level-up health and healing item mechanics that players like me can facetank a lot of bullets before dying. Honestly, it feels like a lot of boss attacks are undodgeable, and come more frequently than the cooldown of your one move that gives immunity frames, but there must be a way, as at least a few people earn the \"defeat boss X without taking damage\" achievements. And the challenge level is really well done - on both the \"normal end\" boss and the \"post-game end\" boss I was able to defeat them without deliberate grinding, but did so only after clearing all the game areas accessible before the fight (so \"natural grinding\"?), taking multiple attempts, and finishing with less than 10% health and no more potions. But difficulty is adjustable, so you can find your own appropriate challenge level.\n\n[Oh, and Protip - the game doesn't tell you this until literally the final stage of the final post-game end boss fight, but Erina's hitbox is tiny, possibly as small as a single pixel, and located in her chest. Meaning she can take bullets to her massive head or her legs without damage. This is critical to know when trying to dodge some of the bullet patterns that have gaps smaller than Erina herself.]\n\nSo if you want a non-linear metroidvania with fair but challenging boss fights and a robust post-game (even without DLC), Rabi-Ribi will deliver - so long as you're not too uptight to enjoy it!\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAlso, Irisu best waifu.

It has a lot of excellent things going for it, but I just intensely disagree with some of the core gameplay elements, and they resulted in it being more unfun than fun by the end. \n\nThe main things that hurt it, to me, are the terrible scaling mechanics, and the insanely overlong boss fights. These kind of go hand in hand. The scaling is, I imagine, due to the open-ended emphasis of their exploration. However, it ultimately feels punishing - no matter which mode I selected, and no matter how much I scavenged up every possible power up, it never actually affected the fights because the fights all boil down to \"dodge this bosses' 4-5 attacks for 10-15 minutes while chipping away at an immense health bar\". The earlier fights are actually more fun, but the farther in the game you get the worse it becomes. \n\nTo me, the overscaling makes it feel less like a metroidvania and more like an action-platformer that should have just had the RPG elements stripped out to simplify it. Since the stat powerups are largely meaningless, why have them at all? The ability powerups are (mostly) all fine and fun, and the level design is mostly great, albeit largely pointless because the exploring just gives you powerups which don't do anything. Even the actual boss fights are all well designed, they just start to overstay their welcome starting from hour 3 or 4. I kept playing because I kept expecting it to get back to where the fights were fun but it never did. \n\nThere's a pretty fine line between 2D action games that fall into the side I like vs. the side I don't, despite the \"metroidvania\" trappings here it falls on the side I dislike, closer to games like Ghouls N' Goblins or the like. I'd recommend Touhou Luna Nights over this if you wanted a metroidvania-ish bullet-hell-boss-fight game, as it does basically ignore stat development entirely and focus just on keeping things streamlined, and is better for it. Rabi-Ribi isn't a bad game, but I think it's falls short from good due to the confused design. Somewhere in the 6/10 area, it's obviously higher if you really like long-ass repetitive boss fights (which some people do).\n\nNote: I know the stat boosts don't actually do \"nothing\", but the game is designed to make it feel that way. I had checked a map to make sure I had every possible stat boost when I still had about 6 boss fights to go, and they all were just more of a grind and made you feel weaker than the very first handful of boss fights, which is the opposite of what you should feel when you spend hours digging around for upgrades and buffs. The payoff for getting through those last fights just was never there, the game never got fun again, and the story was so minimal at that point it would have been more fun to read the wiki.", "timestamp_created": 1566114831, "timestamp_updated": 1566114831, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666558623313903809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54625745": {"recommendationid": "54625745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346846217", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 14290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9701, "last_played": 1674164242}, "language": "english", "review": "masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1565852385, "timestamp_updated": 1565852385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546310245990753174", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54622964": {"recommendationid": "54622964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090574477", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 1189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1079, "last_played": 1654149519}, "language": "english", "review": "main character wears a bunny suit\n\nthats all you need to know", "timestamp_created": 1565834232, "timestamp_updated": 1565885034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527996301651000977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54610566": {"recommendationid": "54610566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024697511", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8170, "last_played": 1549753036}, "language": "english", "review": "Just play it.", "timestamp_created": 1565772496, "timestamp_updated": 1565772496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522987842559814453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54577349": {"recommendationid": "54577349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124455026", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 9437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 806, "last_played": 1696632189}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\n\nI'm serious, this is the best game ever made.", "timestamp_created": 1565584612, "timestamp_updated": 1612652506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505085408687591553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54546604": {"recommendationid": "54546604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175754454", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1499411601}, "language": "english", "review": "bunni", "timestamp_created": 1565425019, "timestamp_updated": 1565425019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54540733": {"recommendationid": "54540733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065289986", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2387, "last_played": 1618705303}, "language": "english", "review": "rabbit rabbit", "timestamp_created": 1565388158, "timestamp_updated": 1565388158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54469387": {"recommendationid": "54469387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105963294", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6133, "last_played": 1677345157}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a masterpiece, worth it to play.

The best of it's kind. Accessible to casual gamers and hardcore platformers such as myself. \n\nMetroidvania aspect is okay, but not amazing. I came for the metroidvania and stayed for the boss fighting. \n\nIf you hate all things anime, still give the game a shot. Just get over it and see the gem for the game that it is. Truely non-linear metroidvania game unlike most steam games tagged as metroidvania nowadays.\n\nYou have a small hitbox. Always a plus for platformer games.\n\nIf you love boss fights I would also HIGHLY RECOMMEND the DLCs, especially the recent one. All the bosses introduces in the newest DLC makes the last boss before the release of this DLC look like tutorial bosses. They're that good. Irisu and Miru have the more fun design imo.\n\nBoss design in general is very good in this game that I hope becomes a standard for all platformer games...but that will never happen. Each boss in this game has MANY attacks. A mixture of memorization and reflexes is needed to dodge them. But a first playthrough of the game you'll be very surprised at how many attacks each boss has. There's never a dull moment. Most attacks are dodgeable even if you've never seen it before.\n\nThe only thing that I didn't like was that I couldn't start on the hardest difficulty from the getgo. I'm sure you can get a save file to bypass that but what I did was go through Hell mode (after hard mode) and beat the first main last boss to unlock the next difficulty and move on right away. You could simply do that twice from hard mode to hell mode to unlock bunny extinction - the hardest non-DLC difficulty. I think there are DLC difficulties higher but mostly artificial difficulty introducing harder hitting bosses that's about it. For maximum difficulty you should avoid fighting as many bosses as you can in lower difficulties while you unlock the higher ones.\n\nI would recommend everyone to play to at least hard mode, though even then, I think the game is too easy at that level. On that difficulty you can literally face tank bosses doing max dps and still win because you take so little damage and you have food options that restore life. To me, that's not playing the game but just button mashing. On higher difficulties such as bunny extinction, you are forced to dodge or die.\n\nThe achievements are also fun to do. There are stuff like no items that's possible to do. This was one of the few games I cared to collect all the achievements because of how much I liked the game. Although I did get a bit bored and didn't collect the last few I missed plus with the information that more would be released going for 100% achievements before that happens would be silly.\n\nThe developer is making a spiritual successor to this game that I expect to be as good as this game or better.

[/h1]\n\nI hated this game back when the game was released and did not enjoy the game initially. I thought the difficulty was too high at times. I failed to understand that while the game is marketed to your face to be a painful misery bullet hell metroidvania, it is also marketed to be one of the most 2D platformer player choices one can possibly have as well.\n\nWant the game to be easy? The story is god tier and there's so many good things in the story and let me just gush right now and say that by far ribbon is one of my favorite characters and duo sidekicks I think ever made. Rabi-Ribi has Shantae level's of good story telling with a overwhelming amount of lovable characters! This game is just almost, almost... a masterpiece and a blast to play from start to finish!\n\n[h1] My honest complaints however stem from my experience of playing the game today. [/h1]\n\n* Rabi-Ribi starts off with one of the most cardinal sins in gaming, a painful movement speed slog for a surprisingly long time before obtaining an actual movement speed buff if you factor the main progression, through exploits and intentional sequence breaks, there's faster hidden mechanics and upgrades to reduce the slog to a mere five to ten minutes.\n\n* Some unlocks require you to beat the game multiple times, other's however are far too strict, such as 200% and bunny hell. If you follow a guide, it won't take too much trouble and most play-through are quicker with speed run mode.\n* Speaking of this Speedrun mode, in order to unlock it [spoiler] you must complete the ENTIRE game, one fake credit's sequence later and you are required into a second half of brand new missions and locations before facing an extremely hard final, final bossfight, [/spoiler] only afterwards can you get it.\n\n* Attempting to perform any low% in this game is flat out terrible. I cannot fathom why anyone would enjoy doing this. It is simply a masochist category nobody should ever want to try beyond the normal difficulty, and if you do, I'd encourage trying one of the unlockable game modifiers, one in particular speeding up a certain character.\n\n[h1] And what about the rest, what are the positives? [/h1]\n\n*This speedrun mode, I don't even consider it as such. If anything I'd call it a \"cut all the bullshit out\" mode,  [spoiler] in this mode it skips an entire introduction sequence that is the game's tutorial and pre-prologue. You are encouraged to play this mode specifically through unlocking higher difficulty's and game difficulty modifiers, with even two additional progression systems! The former letting you play through the game normally, each new boss get stronger very slowly as the game goes on... The latter, is a lot different, you are able to face any boss early on before tackling stronger bosses, this time you can fight a majority of the bosses early on to save the pain train for late game progression, as you'd expect, only the bosses that can be fought early on are a breeze but the moment you are on the main path to beating the game, it throws down bosses at their max difficulty at all times, [/spoiler] it encourages either exploration or simply you wishing to suffer as fast as possible.\n\n*Endless replayability, an entire active player base, a dedicated easy to access sort of randomizers with steam workshop mods, and yes, steam workshop mods. \n\n* The story could make a person cry.\n\n* Every single DLC is worth it.\n\nYou won't be disappointed if you enjoy light hearted visual novels, platformers, and the fact that this is a very long game that could take you days to complete. And if you wanted more than rabi ribi or just want to skip this game and the dlc, maybe even save some money, look no further than it's sequel called TEVI.", "timestamp_created": 1562436746, "timestamp_updated": 1700117082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53795199": {"recommendationid": "53795199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279570235", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 972, "last_played": 1635729516}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es un buen juego , la dificultad, los logros para poder desbloquearlos necesita mucho esfuerzo por eso vale la pena", "timestamp_created": 1562421411, "timestamp_updated": 1562421411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53754257": {"recommendationid": "53754257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087286335", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1693271544}, "language": "spanish", "review": "nice game!!!", "timestamp_created": 1562394188, "timestamp_updated": 1562394188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53742851": {"recommendationid": "53742851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066046524", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 736, "last_played": 1591232686}, "language": "english", "review": "Great 2D metroid-vania.

The visuals are an amazing take on old, 8- or 16-bit style, the gameplay is smooth and feels good (even for someone who'd never played a bullet hell prior to this one), and, as just hinted at, combines multiple different genres; it's a platformer, bullet hell, and has some RPG-esque elements; imagine Touhou meets any of the Mario RPGs, except the enemy system is more akin to a New Super Mario Bros.: the enemies exist in the world itself, and boss battles happen in secluded or blocked off areas. It's a really nice system that works very well for the game. The dialogue is well-done, and the characters are very likeable.

So I'll try to summarize.\n\nThis game is a huge metroidvania with a ton of items to collect and a ton of bosses to fight. The objective of the game is to go around the island recruiting bosses by defeating them, if you want the best ending you need to recruit them all.\nThe game somehow managed to put bullet hell elements into the game really well, it's not uncommon for enemies to shoot simple bullet hell patterns at you and for bosses to use complex ones instead.\nBosses are really long. Most last about a minute, but the true final boss (DLC not included) is 15 minutes long with no checkpoints. (DLC bosses are actually either shorter or have checkpoints)\nThe game has \"advanced techniques\" which can let you beat the game without any items (Although in the second half of the game it becomes clear that 0% was an afterthought when designing that second half), or to get several items earlier than intended.\nThe game is VERY accessible, as it has 6 difficulties, from Casual that is easy enough to be anyone's first videogame ever to Bunny Extinction that will challenge even super skilled gamers.\nMy only complaint is the non-DLC true final boss. I already mentioned she's long and has no checkpoints, but she also has some really annoying and/or badly designed attacks that just made me wish it was over already. If you beat her, and want more after that, then please buy \"Is the order a DLC?\" for a MUCH better final impression.\n\nWow, and I thought I didn't have much to say.", "timestamp_created": 1561281520, "timestamp_updated": 1561281520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760329663753509521", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51366386": {"recommendationid": "51366386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044493141", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 15530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10922, "last_played": 1671587551}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good.

If you're looking for a casual game to play, or a challenge, the difficulties will definetly suit almost any skill level. \n\nThe game's soundtrack is really neat and the locales are varied, and two tracking percentages will tell you if there's more to explore: some of these hidden areas are really neat and really push the envelope, like two certain objects above a certain warp stone.\n\nBoss battles mostly boil down to dodging bullet patterns and then moving in, but depending on your difficulty, this can be much easier said than done...or a cakewalk, if you want it to be. Some are more frustrating than others (I'm looking at you, #24!), but most of them end with a sense of accomplishment after defeating them.\n\nUnfortunately, all games have their faults. The dialogue isn't the best, and the character's personalities are pretty generic. Standard enemies are also pretty lame, and certain parts of the game are just much more difficult than the rest of the areas. On the flip side of the hidden areas, some are just so out of the way, that I'm pretty sure you'll need a guide to find them.

There are over 20 different biomes each with their own bosses and often some kind of gimmicks, e.g. underwater movement, strong winds, low lighting, slippery ice etc. It's also very non-linear, you can pretty much go anywhere right from the start, the plot revolves around finding all the girls (basically beating them) and you can do this in any order.\n- The combat/movement system is quite complex. You have a ranged attack that can be charged a la Mega Man and infused with a selection of elemental crystals and then you also have a melee attack that can be used to string combos. You can slide, dash and roll, double jump and wall jump. Moreover, you can set bombs and charge up powerful fullscreen attacks.\n- The game doesn't waste your time with pointless backtracking. The protagonist moves very fast (and even more so after getting all the speed upgrades) and there are warp points basically everywhere. Revisiting prior areas for collectibles doesn't feel like a chore.\n- Catchy soundtrack. Just listen to [url=youtube.com/watch?v=lFEsfCM_dXw]this[/url] or [url=youtube.com/watch?v=Nr84s_mxtNA]this[/url].\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- The story might be cute in the original Chinese, but the translation reads like bottom of the barrel anime schlock fansubbed by high school kids. Typos galore, characters constantly speaking in third person and calling each other \"master\", you'll be rolling your eyes quite a bit. Not to mention that the whole premise of a bunch of magical girls living on a magical tropical island with not a single dude in sight already takes some suspension of disbelief.\n- Dodging bullet hell patterns during boss fights is a fun thing to do, but not for 15 minutes. The bosses are such health sponges it gets quite ridiculous especially towards the end of the game. There's one boss with 5 massive health bars that will take you quite a while to grind down. The game suggests you grind and stock up on consumables. Or drop the difficulty down to casual so you just sit through it in complete boredom. No middle ground.\n- Bad difficulty curve. Most of the game is pretty easy to do on normal, but the later chapters (past the credits roll) do a crazy jump in difficulty. There's a long platforming section filled with lasers in every room that take off a good chunk of your health and require split second timing to dodge. Not to mention the massive HP creep on new bosses.\n- While the VN segments are drawn well, the actual game is quite ugly. Very low effort pixel art. Backgrounds are badly stitched stock images with visible seams. Not to mention that 90% of enemies AND bosses are all variations of the same bunny girl sprite. It becomes an eyesore after a while.\n\nUltimately, the game felt quite hollow to me. It doesn't break any new ground and it's by no means terrible either. Just really mediocre. Kids like it because scantily clad anime girls and lots of stuff to grind? I don't know. It's an acceptable time waster if you have nothing to do, but I'd still suggest looking for your fix elsewhere.

I was playing on Normal difficulty with Standard mode and I must say, it was a good time of adventure. I had my butt kicked in the boll most of the time, but that's because I mostly panic on enemies' pattern attacks. The characters relatively cute and I find it funny with the story too.\n\nI actually had not much to say about this game. Literally bullet hell mixed with Metroidvania.

If you like the idea of chibi girls + a pinch of sadist Super Mario Maker levels then go for it. If you're more interested in something that's like Metroid or Symphony of the Night, then you're probably better off skipping Rabi-Ribi.\n\n\"Hey I drew a bunch of cute anime girls. Wanna make a game and put them in it?\" \n\"What's their personality like?\" \n\"Well, they're just... cute\" \n\"Works for me!\"\n\nPros: \nGreat Music\nChallenging Boss Fights \nNice Character Artwork\n\nCons:\nPoor Sound Effects\nStrange, Seemingly Pointless Storyline\nEarly Level Design vs Boss Fights = Mixed Signals\nRepetitive Boss Design\nInstant Death (final boss only)\nLack of Character Depth\n\nWas there ever a point when you were playing a game with a boss fight that easily takes several minutes to do, and then there's several points where getting hit meant instant death? Well that's in this game. It's just the final boss, but it's nonetheless annoying. You can tell the devs put a lot of time into this game, but there's moments toward the end where you feel like they invited one of those guys that makes impossible Super Mario Maker levels to design some of the spike pit areas. I'm not joking. \n\nThere's this amulet you get early on that allows you a brief moment of invulnerability when you use it. I didn't figure out how to use it until reaching the last level of the game. I pretty much had to figure it out, because the spikes here are almost as deadly as they are in Super Mario. That's another thing. The spikes seem to deal a consistent 60% damage to your health. In a game where you're finding extra health, having to heal up can make those extra health pickups feel like more of a punishment! Games with RPG elements should NOT include damage scaling! \n\nThe thing that really bothers me about this game, is the artistic styling and level design will often make you think you're playing something simple like a Super Mario game. You know, something a little kid could play. Then you get to the bosses and the difficulty goes up significantly. Speaking of the boss fights, they're all very similar. You just dodge a lot of lasers and light balls, and then you hit the enemy with everything you have, and then you repeat. There's no real strategy involved. The most you're challenged to do is time your jumps carefully while dodging a bunch of lasers, stars, bombs, and lights. \n\nI also want to add that none of the characters are really memorable. I like the little fairy, and a lot of the character designs are pretty cute. Just don't ask me to tell you their names or what their personalities are like. Very few of them actually stand out. I could tell you there's an egyptian girl, 2 bear sisters, 2 cat sisters, 2 scientist sisters, 3 fairies, \"master\", a succubus, a water singer, a plant girl, and several others. They could have all just as easily been one character. Actually that might have worked out better because then there would actually be some character development. \n\nI don't mind losing to a boss several times simply because I'm not good enough, and get hit too many times to stay alive. I DO mind losing to a boss fight simply because they used instant death on me. It's not a mechanic I appreciate in any RPG or adventure game. There's a lot of players who love this type of gameplay, and kudos to them for wanting to deal with it. If you don't like boss fights with instant death powers then I suggest making a pass on this one. I mean, it WORKS in some games, but only those where the boss takes like 3 hits to kill. It just doesn't work in a game where  said boss has 100K+ hit points (I'm not kidding). With that said, you CAN do some research and find out how to avoid the instant death debuff (as Remin has noted in their reply to my review).

Not everyone is going to agree on what styles are good, or even which style best matches a particular game. I doubt folks are going to agree on Rabi-Ribi\u2019s style, for example, because not everyone is looking for a bunch of boobs in their face while they explore a sprawling metroidvania. But it turns out that for even the most disinclined players, it\u2019ll be worth pushing past the spectacle to see just how deep this rabbit hole of gameplay and adventuring goes.\n\nErina is a bunny, like literally a fluffy, cotton-tailed rabbit, until she awakens in a mysterious world as a full-figured woman. Lost without her owner, she ventures forth into a land full of strange new sights (even for a transformed bunny girl). She meets tiny fairies, including a rambunctious one named Ribbon who joins her quest, as well as mad scientist girls, catgirls, immortal demigod girls, and weird bunny-obsessed girls who will try to magic you to death. Through all of this chaos your sights are on getting Erina and her owner back to the world they know, but it\u2019s going to take a lot of friends and a lot of fighting, especially when the dark cracks around reality begin to show.\n\nSo obviously this game has a specific audience, if the busty animal girls and fairies that wear nothing but ribbons didn\u2019t give it away. It\u2019s not all mindless, mind you, as the dialogue is at times very playful with the art tropes and there are even some rather poignant creeper photographer enemies later in the game. But they\u2019re still tropes, and unless you\u2019re the target audience for it it\u2019s not going to do anything for you or the story. By the same token, it\u2019s not the point of the game, so if you\u2019re okay with beating bikini-clad princesses down with a clueless Playboy bunny you should be able to enjoy the rest of the bright, charming presentation.\n\nBeyond the boobs (if such a place even exists), Rabi-Ribi is quite the sprawling metroidvania. The first hour or so leads you around with gating, objective markers, and lots of cutscenes to get you properly introduced to the world and its inhabitants. Once you\u2019re set up with your allies, the game proceeds in a chapter structure where you go out and find new friends to invite back to your burgeoning little town (by beating them up, obviously) until you have enough to open a portal to a boss or something more sinister. The story is shot through all of this, stopping you periodically for dialogues between Erina and Ribbon or interjections from your friends, and if you\u2019re not in the mood for reading it can honestly get to be a bit much.\n\nWhen you do have control of Erina, you have a good spread of powers and unique attacks to use. Her favored implement of destruction is the squeaky hammer, which she will unlock new moves and combos for as she uses it. That\u2019s true of all her abilities and Ribbon\u2019s attacks, they\u2019ll level up and gain new capabilities through use. Erina\u2019s hammer uses fast-charging stamina to swing so you\u2019ll need to actually time your attacks, and Ribbon\u2019s ranged magic costs MP which limits how much you can spam it. Most enemies aren\u2019t very challenging though, leaving you plenty of time to explore the vast world and search for upgrades and secrets.\n\nThe bosses are where most of the challenge lies, and they\u2019re a definite highlight of the game. Erina doesn\u2019t have much luck making friends most of the time, so the other animal ladies you run into will want to throw down before buddying up. These fights are very much bullet hell showdowns, with all kinds of attack patterns and beams and gimmicks to deal with. Thematically they\u2019re very much in line with the girl using them, like the scientist throwing vials of chemicals and blasting you with lasers and the Egyptian princess attacking with her staff and sliding walls. Erina\u2019s hitbox is actually tiny and you\u2019ll need to learn that to survive, because attacks can come pretty fast and dense as you whittle down their substantial health bars. They\u2019re thrilling fights, though, enough so to be a major driver that keeps me moving through the game.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to the game than that, which is what really sets it apart from other metroidvanias. The main adventure can take upwards of eight hours, with dozens of friends to haul back to town before buttoning up the plot. Town inhabitants also offer you temporary buffs and passive upgrades, and you earn a special ranking with each depending on your performance in the fight against them. You can buy stat and ability upgrades in town, and find others in the wild, and also unlock badges that can be equipped for additional bonuses like those in Hollow Knight (I know this came first, it\u2019s just for reference). And if somehow you need even more bunny girls in your life, there are multiple gameplay modes and difficulties to explore, and a whole library of DLC.\n\nLook, if you like platformers and anime girls, you\u2019re all set here. The gameplay is solid and robust, and I\u2019m not even going to make the adjoining joke about the characters. I can totally see the art style being a hangup for some, but there\u2019s nothing objectionable in the game beyond appearances. The sound design is less exciting with pretty weak effects and that overly-peppy music you get in a lot of cutesy Japanese games. Aside from the presentation, though, you\u2019ve got a metroidvania of impressive scope here. Rabi-Ribi is big on action and exploration, which should be enough no matter how you might feel about the style.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

The pretty bullet effects\n4, The generic metroidvania feel is great.\n5. The awesome music \n6. There is a easy difficulty for people like me\n\nThings I didn't quite like:\n1. The complicated and irregular maps (sometimes there are just empty holes in the map and you keep thinking there is a room there when there isn't). Also, I would rather have a big map like Castlevania so that I can see where each area joins into the next. \n2. I don't get the story. I played through the beginning part the 2nd time to see if I understood it then, but I still don't. I sorta got the gist of it at the end when I met the boss Noah, but it isn't terribly clear. Basically you are just collecting NPCs to fill up the town.\n3. The enemies and NPCs look too much alike. I kept attacking everything until I figured out that I was only supposed to hit the girls with the bunny ears. Would it kill to have some male characters? What is the obsession with females?\n4. There are some really difficult platforming sections. And by difficult I mean  screen full of spikes, or lasers or some incredibly tricky jumps. \n5. Some parts of the game are just not explained well. Like the orbs and the staffs. I went through half the game without orbs and with most of the staffs missing. I didn't even realise I was using my egg shooter. There are some rooms which I don't know what they are for because there isn't any instructions.\n6. The controls are kinda hard to remember. I basically button mash, but I still don't know how to execute special attacks well. The boss fights are also really long because the bosses have a ton of HP so I tend to get bored halfway.\n\nStill it is a fun enough adventure.

I guess I'll just go with \"yes.\"\n\nI found this game from Christ-Centered Gamer. Long story involving match-3 games, don't wanna talk about it. It forced its way onto my wishlist, but I didn't end up buying it until the Winter Sale in 2018. I bought the Super UPRPRC Edition, which includes everything except the free Halloween DLC. (Would recommend, by the way; the Digital Artbook is much more than the PDF file I was expecting, the Original Soundtrack is just heavenly, and you really can't have the full experience without \"Is the order a DLC?\")\n\nThe instant I started up the game, I realized that I was getting much, much more than I paid for.\n\nThis game is the gift that keeps on giving. The description doesn't do anything in the game justice. This is one of [i]those games.[/i] You know the kind: one of those little indie games where you go in and realize that the developers poured their hearts and souls into every little detail. One where you wonder why all games can't be like this. One where you understand the passion and joy that the developers felt as they crafted a masterpiece.\n\nThe gameplay, of course, is the first point. Everything is fantastic, and the game feels amazing to control. It's a Metroidvania at heart: you go around, find some items, fight a boss, find more items, use those items to find even more items, find a new area, find more items, go back to the old area... it has a good amount of backtracking, but of course, the developers didn't make you suffer through all of it. There's the convenient Warp Stones to get you from area to area, and getting every single thing isn't a big deal in the standard mode. Half of the game is bullet hell, and the enemies and bosses all use pretty tough patterns. It's something that you can get down once you memorize it, so even if you don't have the upgrades, you can eventually pull it off. It's a very satisfying feeling.\n\nThe graphics are mostly pixel art, and it's very pastel-like. Colors are light, sprites are cute, and everything about the game just has that happy tone to it. The environments are all very unique and detailed, and it's fun to even just walk around and look at enemies, backgrounds, Erina and Ribbon, and everything else. Portraits have a more traditional style, and they're all very nice. They look fairly anime-like, but with a certain unique touch that makes them recognizable if you know the game.\n\nThe music is really great. It always fits its environment pretty well, whether it's a peaceful forest, a tense fight, or an unknown location. Buying the Original Soundtrack gives you access to all the files, as well as a fully unlocked sound test. I've spent a long, long time just listening to the music, and it made a lot of the harder parts of the game more enjoyable and less annoying.\n\nThe plot is a good mix of casual humor and serious development. It's a bit confusing, but it has a few twists that really keep the story moving and make you want to find out what happens next. It may not be the greatest story, but it really works well for the game, and I, for one, adore it. It really made me feel emotion, and that's a plus in my book.\n\nThere is honestly too much to the game to cover in a review. There's New Game +, multiple difficulties, fantastic characters, speedrun mode, a multitude of achievements (many of which are based around sequence breaking), minigames, special abilities for Erina and Ribbon, the DLC content, [spoiler]how much I love Irisu and Noah in particular,[/spoiler] and way more. It just never ends. I've only cleared my first playthrough at the time of writing this, and I'm working on 100% clearing it before moving on to New Game + and possibly higher difficulties. Even though I've beaten it before, I just want to keep playing, because I know the developers of this game loved it just as much as I do.\n\nI bought this game for anime bunny girls, and I got a masterpiece I'll never forget or get tired of.", "timestamp_created": 1548584051, "timestamp_updated": 1561572383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57908165454864502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48583598": {"recommendationid": "48583598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371890203", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5135, "last_played": 1685277920}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Que tengo que decir de este juego es...\n\nSIMPLEMENTE UNA MARAVILLA la banda sonora que tiene es bastante buena,la historia te engancha de una manera sorprendente,te encari\u00f1as con todos los personajes del juego (excepto por uno que es el jefe final del la historia despues de pasarte el juego)y la verdad es que tiene un humor bastante divertido y es una muy buena inversion si te gustan los juegos dificiles y si quieres pasartelo al 100% es divertido y bastante largo,aunque no te guste el rollo anime del juego la verdad es que no molesta,mas bien lo hace m\u00e1s carismatico,si te gusto el juego tambien te recomiendo comprarte el DLC de\u00b4\u00b4Is the order a DLC?\u00b4\u00b4 Ya que te explica un poco mas de la historia de un personaje.Simplemente compratelo.", "timestamp_created": 1548578679, "timestamp_updated": 1548578679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48262474": {"recommendationid": "48262474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242878764", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 807, "last_played": 1649211915}, "language": "english", "review": "Well put game especially with all the bullet hell.", "timestamp_created": 1547246373, "timestamp_updated": 1547246373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48182153": {"recommendationid": "48182153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032405986", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2696, "last_played": 1676322085}, "language": "english", "review": "Beat the true final boss and I can now dodge rain in a tornado\n\nNow featuring Poverty Cat from the Rabi may Ribi\u2122 series.", "timestamp_created": 1546924098, "timestamp_updated": 1611968414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467496544122695923", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48168142": {"recommendationid": "48168142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426896714", "num_games_owned": 597, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1230, "last_played": 1686860161}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a splendid mix of 2D platformer, metroidvania and bullet hell game.

Rabi Ribi has the deepest and most balanced and simply best fighting compared to any game I know. Bosses aren't all about dodging attacks, but also executing your own attacks and using situational moves well.\n\nThe following may look overly complex, but all these moves are gained gradually when progressing through the game, so you have time to practice each of them and add them to your fighting bit by bit. It's just really deep, varied and satisfying fighting with pretty much infinite skill cap (which is why the game has so many additional ridiculously hard difficulties).\n\nBasic balance of a boss fight: You have basic hammer combo that stuns the boss if you catch it in it (some bosses jump around like crazy). However, after a combo, the boss gets into a hyperarmor mode where they take less damage and won't be stunned for a few seconds. You CAN keep attacking if you have stamina or other available moves, but you have to watch out for the boss attacks, so bruteforcing is not usually effective. When the boss has around 25% health left, they go in a longer hyperarmor mode and unleash their more difficult \"spellcard\" attacks, you can either survive through them and/or do damage while dodging the moves to kill them before it ends. Boss moves usually consist of bullet hell patterns, simple but quick attacks that you need to react quickly (sometimes in a specific way), and some bosses jump around in tricky ways, doing melee damage if they hit you, and being difficult to catch in a combo.\n\nYou have a charged magic attack (hold to charge and release to shoot), which you can use at range while dodging boss attacks (later you also get a melee projectile attack which you can use simultaneously for quite good DPS, though it gets difficult). You can also use it simultaneously while melee comboing. With magic you also have different projectile types, though the biggest differences between magic wands lies in its boost magic attack that can provide for example extra AoE damage over time, give attack and armor buff for a duration. Boost magic attack has long cooldown (charges by magic attack hits).\n\nThen you have 2 powerful extra attacks with a cooldown to add between basic melee combos situationally: 1. Super Carrot: You have to channel for about a second without taking damage (risky), after which you do a powerful AoE blast, which also grants invincibility for tiny duration, but you take more damage if interrupted. Also does damage upwards, to be used when a boss is floating above you. Very rewarding if you can anticipate a difficult bullet wave or find a spot in easier one and IMO adds a lot of depth to the fights. 2. Bunny Strike, which is simply a powerful dashing attack. Seeing all the situations where you can utilize these attacks is key to dealing more damage.\n\nThen you have Bunny Amulet, which is kind of like a bomb in a bullet hell game (invincibility), though quite brief and doesn't clear bullets. It does a little bit of AoE damage and resets the cooldowns of Super Carrot and Bunny Strike, though it should basically never be wasted as a damage source.\n\nOther moves: You get a sideways air dash (useful in some patterns or moving quickly), and a ground slide for dodging bullets around your height. Double jump (basic stuff). Quick downward descent for some fast zigzag dodging. Wall jump (mostly for exploring). You have a upwards and downwards hammer attacks that you can do some extra damage as a follow-up for basic hammer combo if you have extra stamina.\n\nHere's a video of one of my favourite mid-game bosses (on Hell difficulty), the player here seems to have many late-game abilities, but the bosses scale accordingly. No super carrot usage here, since this boss is so fast (it's slower on lower difficulties).

I've had this on my wishlist for a pretty long time and I've always eyed on it whenever big sales cropped up. At long last, Christmas 2018 and this game was gifted to me by a friend! And lemme tell you, that time was worth it.\n\nThere's so many things I want to talk about with this game, but I'll start from the most fundamental part - the gameplay. It's just fantastic. It's a metroidvania platformer mixed with a bullethell game. And it's so good at being just a great game. The controls are super good - they are responsive, accurate and satisfying in every sense of the word. While at the start of the game you may be limited in terms of movement options, by the time you hit the late-game - you'll basically be going anywhere you want, whenever you want. It's that kind of gratifying feeling that makes exploration in a game like this really fun. Thanks to this, backtracking to previously completed stages never feels like a necessity or a drag because the game properly rewards you with new areas to explore alongside with new items to gain, new enemies to fight and even new characters to discover. It's never over until the game says it's over. And even then it's probably still not over.\n\nOn top of the solid controls, the combat is also very satisfying. While invincibility frames & slight knockback can be a minor annoyance, nothing in this game felt cheap. The game gives you a fair chance but also requires some degree of precision to dodge if you don't want to constantly lose health. Although this being heavily inspired by bullethell shooters, especially during boss battles, visibility can sometimes be a problem, as stuff tends to blend in with the background or with each other even and it may feel like you get hit by something you didn't see. But if you do pay attention while the boss is attacking then it's absolutely not a problem.\n\nThe story is a bit weird. Overall I did like it, but I didn't like the inconsistencies between the main game and the post game. I'm not gonna spoil anything here, but you may notice narrative inconsistencies from time to time. Besides that, the story doesn't try too hard to take itself seriously and that's for the better - you're a bunny girl running around with a fairy and a giant hammer. If this game tried to be ridiculously serious with its narrative then I'd find that pretty jarring for a game of this nature. Aside from that though, there were a few nitpicky quirks with the story, such as a couple of spelling mistakes that made themselves pretty obvious. While I never really outright laughed at this game's comedy, it never bored me and always kept me engaged, which is a good thing since that means it doesn't get very repetitive. Although some of the achievements in this game definitely are funny, I liked the sense of humor of the achievements, especially some of the references.\n\nThe soundtrack is just on another level for me. Well done by all the composers of the soundtrack, especially 3R2 with amazing tracks such as cyberspace.exe, Get On With It, Bounce Bounce and more. I also really liked songs like the Volcanic Caverns theme and Exotic Laboratory theme. But as stated - every song in the game is just incredible. It's rare for me to say that I didn't dislike any of the songs. I'll probably end up buying the game's soundtrack on Steam for listening outside of the game.\n\nAlthough one thing I will mention about the game that I feel is a bit of a negative is that the boss battles can feel a bit repetitive. Almost always you'll be placed in a wide open area with the boss you're fighting and it's really just a case of \"dodge, attack, wait, repeat\". Not a lot of the bosses in the game felt like they really challenged your skill otherwise. I do understand why they designed it like this - so speedrunning the game didn't feel like certain items were crucial in order to progress but because of that, the final result ended up with some repetitive boss battles. The best battle in the game was the main game's final boss because it was the closest thing in the game that ended up being even a little bit mechanically challenging for the player. A close second would be the boss battle in Natural Aquarium due to the higher jump that you get from being underwater, allowing for some flashy combos to be made.\n\nThere is still an entire OCEAN of content I haven't covered - badges, the item shop & how simple its integration is, new game+, speedrun mode, boss rush, etc. but that should be a testament to just how much stuff there is in the game.

The world as a whole is designed well and there are a lot of collectibles to find with a very noticeable climb in power progression, and the soundtrack is actually pretty nice, got your cute songs, and your tense ones, great soundtrack altogether.

You usually get top-down shooters. Some games add rpg elements and turn out pretty awesome but this is the first game that imo succeeds in merging bullet-hell with a platformer. Now, there have been attempts of doing this before but usually the movement (momentum, gravity, ...) either limit the bullet pattern complexity or the difficulty balance.\n\nNot this game. The way the character hitbox differentiates between getting hit by a bullet or by an enemy attack directly along with slower movement while charging make for a really great control scheme that allowed the devs to make some really awesome battles with complex patterns without skimping on anything.\n\nAside the very fun gameplay you get a plethora of difficulty settings (and they can be difficult), an amazing open world castlevania style, tons of easter eggs and achievements to obtain and even (more or less intended?) sequence breaks and secret challenge modes.

This simple yet funny reason is the background behind the birth of Rabi-Ribi, which has overwhelmingly positive reviews in its current Steam evaluation.\n\nRabi-Ribi is a 2D Action Platformer / Bullet Hell Game developed by CreSpirit & GemaYue and published by Sekai Project. The main character Erina was originally a rabbit, but suddenly became a female human in a bunny costume. At the same time, mysterious problems arose in the village of Rabi-Ribi. In addition, Erina's master Miru is also missing. The main storyline of this game is to venture out to find your master. In this adventure you will also meet another playable character named Ribbon who is a fairy.\n\nThe main feature of this game is that it's a 2D side-scrolling / RPG shooting game based on the Metroidvania playstyle. In addition, some of Rabi-Ribi's gameplay seems to be inspired by the Touhou Project games. Despite this, the originality of Rabi-Ribi itself is always fully present. \n\nIn this game you can get stronger by using game money that you receive from defeating your enemies. Since there are some grinding elements, players can enjoy this game without getting bored. Moreover, through its unique combat system and numerous boss battles, players will become more immersed in the game.\n\nThis game is a user-friendly game that considers the player above all else. A variety of difficulty levels are available and the tutorial allows players to learn the game easily. But it is ultimately a game that will be difficult to master. And even though the game was released in 2016, it's still a great game with new content updates. So if you haven't played Rabi-Ribi yet, you're definitely missing out. It's a game that will be well worth your time. \n\n[Steam] Nayanco Curator \u30fd(=^\uff65\u03c9\uff65^=)\u4e3f\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/33855818", "timestamp_created": 1540985456, "timestamp_updated": 1586861970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657415509223937988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45489139": {"recommendationid": "45489139", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971147484", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1850, "last_played": 1540755594}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not the best at this kind of game even though I like the genres that it is part of.

Why is that? Is it because weebs\u2122 like this? Not really, take a look at the reviews and they'll all say the same thing, terrible story, amazing gameplay. And i can attest to that. The gameplay completely overshadows all the honest mistakes.\n\nLet's start with the pros.\n\nThe art is pleasant to look at, the character design is cute (it's one of those girl-only game), and the CG and pixel art both fit into the game. There's a few risqu\u00e9 scenes but nothing that goes too far, and overall the fanservice, while present, is scarce and not a bother. It won't be thrown in your face every minutes if you can bear with it. If you are into that, which is fine, then it'll further enhance the experience for you.\n\nThe music is pleasant and catchy, perhaps a bit lacking in variety, but not to a bothersome extent. Overall the game goes for an uplifting, upbeat and innocent artistic direction, you'll notice it fast. (Which makes the parts where the game takes itself seriously with the story all the more painful rather than engaging, the story would be better and more fitting if it stayed on a silly tone all the way through)\n\nNow let's go over the best parts. The map is quite big, there is many shortcuts, intersections, and the metroidvania elements are good enough to be praised, though i wish the game had a better pace for the abilities that you get pretty much either in the same place at short intervals, or in completely random places you might visit too early or too late.\n\nThe game can be 100% non linear, and you're able to break most if not all the sequences of the game through hidden means, which is probably a plus for speedrunners. There is many achievements tailored for every kind of players and routes. If you take the intended path, the beggining will have a bit too many dialogues, and will restrict your freedom until you reach the town, but after this, you're on your own. You won't be lost however, as the game gives you a clear indication of where to go to progress the main quest.\n\nThere is a good ammount of upgrades you can find so if you enjoy RPG elements, this can be pretty satisfying, although you're in no way forced to go through with it to beat the game\n\nLast but not least, the boss fights. This is where the game shines. This is where you hit gold. Where you can clearly see the devs designed this to be amazing. You'll be able to take down bosses through many means, ranged attacks, a melee combo, strong magic attacks, a few hidden tricks, fancy movement abilities that double down as damaging abilities, waiting for an opportunity to strike them or slowly chipping at their health while they throw at you every once in a while bullet hell patterns that are very fun to dodge. The game isn't spammy or overly speedy, it's methodical, and puts focus on smart dodging skills and positioning. There is a crazy variety in patterns, and new bosses are always interesting to try out and learn what they have in store for you. A few attacks may feel unfair, but you can always learn how to handle them consistently, and if you have trouble with some attacks, the game gives you an invincibility frame \"spell\" on a rather low cooldown. Every boss can be done no-hit, consistently, without the spell i previously mentioned, which is good design.\n\nYou can fine tune the difficulty to your liking, to have either an extremely casual experience, an average difficulty where you'll be challenged without frustration but nothing too easy, or crank it up to the max and get your buttocks whooped to the point where soulsborn styled games, old retro games, and other games with hardcore fighting challenges will look easy. Though you need to play through the game twice or so to unlock the last difficulty. The game also has a new game+ feature allowing you to keep your item progress while replaying through the game with everything hitting harder, having more health, being faster, and so on... up to a few hundreds of times. It's fair to say you have an infinite replayability as long as you enjoy fighting the bosses.\n\nThe content is huge, boss wise especially. And, at its core, the game is a glorified boss rush, if you're into that, chances are you won't regret buying it. I didn't. There is a quick reload feature and escape key will skip an entire set of dialogues if you don't want to bother with them, making coming back into a fight quite fast.\n\nI'll also mention the controls felt tight and responsive, no issues here. Your hitbox is very generous, thus getting hit doesn't feel unfair. The game has a few bugs here and there, but most if not all of them won't break the game or pose a problem. You're a bit sluggish at the beggining but that's quickly solved. Overall playing Rabi-Ribi feels good. I can't put it into word, and feel like i'm underselling it.\n\nAnd finally, the cons.\n\nThe story is just there at best, annoying at worst. It is confusing, aimless, and possibly one of the worst i've seen, much like the bland dialogue that is laughably bad. It's just generic trying-to-be-cute anime lines recycled over and over, which does nothing to add to the characters' personality or story and make you roll your eyes (eg: insert protagonist saying \"Miss [animal or nickname]!\" with the other girl correcting her \"i'm not an X, i'm an Y, how dare you, let's fight\"... times the ammount of characters in the game. That, or the other way around). It's just mindless small talk aswell as peptalk for the majority of the dialogues, and there's way too many of them.\n\nDo your best to ignore it, the gameplay is worth the trouble, 100%. And if you somehow enjoy it, good for you!\n\nI do have a critique for the overworld aswell. Although i did enjoy the secret hunting (this game has a loooot of it), the overworld felt bland and generic, at times becoming a chore to get through the enemies. The few platforming sections felt weird and overly punishing, although they aren't bad, they are thrown in out of nowhere at maximum difficulty, forcing you to adapt to the sudden jump in the difficulty curve and making use of advanced platforming technique you didn't get the time to practice. The hitboxes are a bit unforgiving, and the movement requires precision, but it's not technically flawed, at least. It's even clever for some parts, just not properly introduced.\n\nGet this game if:\n\n- You like extremely fun and satisfying boss fights with bullet hell elements, with quite a decent ammount of diversity in how to approach them.\n\n- You like hidden secrets and achievement hunting.\n\n- You like games that give you a decent ammount of freedom to explore and enjoy challenging yourself (You can disable upgrades you don't like)\n\n- You like cute anime girls, yeah, the game has that, what can i say?\n\n- You like a selection of difficulties that go from yawn inducing to harder than any game you've ever played\n\n- A lot of potential replayability\n\n- Speedrunner friendly\n\n- Want the rewarding feeling of beating a difficult boss after many tries\n\nDON'T get this game if:\n\n- You expect a visual masterpiece or a narrative on par with the best novels, recounting amazing, engaging stories\n\n- If you can't ignore the above even though you can essentially skip all of it in a second\n\nThis game is great, especially for a metroidvania and bullet hell fan like me. You can tell the dev isn't the most experienced programmer or novelist ever, but still made this with a lot of passion and hard work. They also communicate with their community. A purchase that was worth all the money i spent on it.\n\nSidenote: \"Is the order a DLC?\" DLC is ridiculously hard, adding some spammy bosses that will clog the screen with bullets, and some extreme platforming. Only buy it if you're up to the challenge.\n\n\"Artbook\" DLC adds playable content, including two difficulties, some bosses, and few other things.

I liked it [i] a lot. [/i]\n\n[h1] The Story [/h1]\n[i] 5/10 [/i]\nThe story is absolutely the worst part of the game, but in my opinion it wasn't absolutely horrible. It was difficult to follow at times and some events sorta happened out of nowhere, but it flowed nicely enough that I could manage it quite well up until Chapter 4/5, which is the end of the main game. \n\nThe amount of characters that refer to themselves or each other by name instead of \"you\" or \"I\" is absolutely ridiculous. Originally, I thought this trait was exclusive to Ribbon, a small fairy that acts as Erina's (the protagonist) long-ranged assistant. It was cute until I realized characters like [spoiler]Noah[/spoiler] & Rumi did that as well. \n\nThen there's the whole \"Master\" thing. Ribbon refers to Erina as \"Master\" from time to time, Erina & [spoiler]Miru[/spoiler] refer to Rumi as \"Master\". It gets quite on my nerves, but I did have a chuckle when the game pointed their story flaws every so often.\n\n[h1]The Controls[/h1]\n[i] 8/10 [/i]\nAlbeit the quirky setup for performing actions, the controls are surprisingly easy to pick up. They're fast and always responsive, making the bullet hell experience flow that much better. The only issue here is the menus will sometimes activate Ribbon's Boost when backing out, and that gets quite aggravating when it's activated outside of a boss segment. There's also the chance of activating an ability with your hammer that you didn't want if you're a bit reckless with the controller, but that's usually harmless and only impacts people with gamepads.\n\n[h1]The Metroidvania Gameplay[/h1]\n[i]10/10[/i]\nThis is easily the most polished part of the game, which is why it's the only category I'm rating as perfect. Each area comes with its semi-unique assortments and variants of enemies, each with a learnable pattern to maneuver around. The world is littered with not only 5 potions that generously upgrade your statistics, but wands for Ribbon that give her unique attack styles, abilities that give Erina additional mobility, jewelry that upgrade already existing aspects, orbs that make already existing paths more traversable, and badges that allow you to customize Erina to your own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe paths you attempt to travel are rarely blocked by the plot past the prologue, allowing for almost entirely free exploration the entire time. The open world allows you to take on later bosses earlier if you know where they are, and even though some paths are meant to be blocked off until you get a new ability, you can utilize hidden moves that are always available and bypass the obstacles anyway. In fact, the non-linearity gets so ridiculous that you're able to beat the game without picking up the Piko Hammer, Erina's method of attack.\n\n[h1]The Danmaku Gameplay[/h1]\n[i]8/10[/i]\nThe bosses are obviously the main part of the game, and are [i] almost [/i] always a fun fight. Every single boss (and there are a [b] lot[/b] of them) has tons of unique attack patterns that will keep competitive players on the edge of their seat, and will provide tons of replayability for the more casual players. The bullet hell patterns are insane in later chapters and the reasons for executing said patterns even more so. Every boss is fun and has a signature set of moves that really make them memorable. Each equipped with a \"spell card\", these bosses are no joke. Sometimes, however, it's not a joke for the wrong reasons.\n\nIf you don't take the time to empty the world of items, bosses from Chapter 4 and onwards will prove to be absolutely ridiculous in terms of health, resulting in a messy endurance encounter. During the main game, however, this is completely avoidable if you don't rush. Taking time to collect items and balance your playtime in both genres the game provides you, bosses will provide the right amount of challenge. Of course, some players may not be happy about this, as even after items are collected a certain amount of perseverance is required to defeat the later encounters.\n\nEven after the above paragraph, though, the bosses are still a beautiful feature in Rabi-Ribi and interested players should take the time to fight as many as possible.\n\n[h1] The Music [/h1]\n[i]9/10[/i]\nMost of the tracks aren't that memorable, but all of them do their job amazingly. Especially when it comes to the snow & boss themes, the ambiance the audio creates is almost a necessary addition to the areas that vary in intensity to extreme extents. I don't really have much to say here, other than they're some [i] d a r n [/i] good tunes.\n\n[h1]The DLC[/h1]\n[i]9/10[/i]\nThe Artbook is just a wonderful addition to Rabi-Ribi. Yes, you get the art that you paid for - design concepts, commentary, etc - but you also get actual content along with it as a nice little extra for helping out a certain cat person. The missions are fun and unique, and the bonus unsused boss was a nice little addition. Haven't picked up the other DLC, but have heard very good things about it.\n\nThe ONLY issue I have with the DLC portion is that the wardrobe customization is [i] exclusive [/i] to DLC.\n\n[h1]The Extras[/h1]\nNot a large enough chunk of non-post-game extras to actually rate, but I appreciate there being a set of Boss Rush modes that spice up things just enough to be a fun, new challenge. \n\n[h1]The Final Rating[/h1]\nStory: 5/10\nControls: 8/10\nMetroidGP: 10/10\nB.HellGP: 8/10\nMusic: 9/10\nDLC: 9/10\n[b]Final Rating: 9/10[/b]\n\nI know this isn't an averaged amount, but the story isn't important to the point where it's necessary to deduct an additional point from the final rating.

The story, characters and dialogue are just awful, which is a shame, because the portraits are well drawn and the game could have provided some memorable humor given the setting and tone. Instead, almost 90% of the text is redundant and boring (and there are LOTS of text), and the other 10% takes itself way too seriously. There is a huge cast of characters and amost every one of them follows the same anime catgirl personality trope.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a platformer and not an RPG, and some cringue-worthy dialogue you can skip doesn't hurt the excellent gameplay.

Out of curiosity, I took a look at the store page and was surprised to see a metriodvania with all the top reviews praising amazing gameplay rather than only talking about the cutesy asthetic. So, I bought it and was astounded by the fact that this is one of the best designed games I've ever come across, and a killer bullet hell game to boot. I'll just briefly talk about some of the aspects of it.\n\n[b][u] Story [/u][/b]\nThe story is pretty meh overall, and is the game's weakest aspect. However, the game is aware of this and keeps any dialogue to a minimum, and usually tries to incorporate jokes rather than an attempt at dramatic dialogue. Character designs are... fanservicey to say the least, and characters themselves do not have much depth. However, the game's focus on gameplay allows the story issues to not have much prominence.\n\n[b][u] Music [/u][/b]\nAlmost every track in the game is extremely strong and fitting for it's setting, with the majority of the game's best songs being held by the end game and post game areas and bosses. It was one aspect that caught me by surprise, as each and every area consistently had a strong theme to go with it. The soundtrack is definitely worth buying if you are interested in it.\n\n[b][u] Gameplay [/u][/b]\nThis is the biggest strength of this game. The controls are tight and responsive, and enemies and bosses are well designed to bring new challenges and strategies at a constant pace. As well, the game has an extremely well designed and laid out map, with a multitude of secrets, optional bosses and areas, and optional challenges. Plenty of collectibles are available across the map as well.\nThis game also incorporated fresh ideas that, as a fan of metroidvania style games, I have barely ever seen outside of this title. Combat, combo, and boss fight mechanics are extremely well designed, keeping the game challenging no matter how many items you have found, but still easing the difficulty with the aquisition of more. And when i say \"no matter how many,\" I mean that it is possible to complete a run of this game while obtaining anywhere from 0% of the items and upgrades available to 100% of them. That is only possible due to an extremely clever mechanic in the game, [spoiler] Hidden Tech [/spoiler]. I keep the name of this spoilered out since this mechanic is best discovered yourself, and the game will make sure to tell you in the form of an acheivement if you have found something.\n\nOverall, this game is abolutely worth playing for anyone who likes bullet hells, metroidvanias, or just challenging games in general. The DLC is also very much worth purchasing, with the caveat that all of the game's hardest fights are contained in the DLC. With that in mind, perhaps play through the game first and only get the DLC if you find the difficulty to be manageable, as the DLC is sometimes crushingly hard in comparison, while still fair.\n\n9.1/10", "timestamp_created": 1529095861, "timestamp_updated": 1529095861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753556251525878906", "comment_count":

The \"bullet hell\" boss fights and dual protagonist setup with both a melee (Erina) and ranged (Ribbon) character is a unique take on the usual Metroidvania formula. The dynamic difficulty and careful level design give players a lot of freedom to explore the map as they please, rarely being funneled to specific areas and ensuring the player is never under- OR overprepared for fights. Controls are tight and precise; Erina is insanely mobile at full power and yet never feels neither clunky nor unwieldy to move around. An item finder function exists, so 100% item collection (though not easter eggs...) is feasible even if playing blind.\n\nThe only weak point is the story, which mostly exists to fuel the gameplay and character interactions, but that's rarely a strong point for games in this genre and the individual characters are still pretty cute. Take or leave the visuals based on personal preference, mind the game doesn't particularly sexualize its characters despite their pandering designs, but the music is more universally praised ranging from appropriately thematic area tunes, upbeat boss music to energize the player, and epic ballads to set the mood for the biggest showdowns.\n\nRabi-Ribi is perhaps the best example of a \"tough but fair\" game I've ever played. The lowest difficulty is pitifully easy for anybody with working eyeballs and motor skills. It's great to accomodate total gaming newbies, youngsters, and anyone who just wants to solely concern themselves with the exploration aspects of the game and/or follow the story. Successive deaths will offer you a buff to make things easier; the only penalty for doing so is a bruised ego. Consumables are encouraged. Buffs can be purchased from acquired helper characters in town. And it's all totally optional, the player has full control of how challenging (or not) their experience is.\n\nOn the flip side, the game can be UTTERLY BRUTAL if you desire and it does so while remainingly entirely in the realm of fairness (with one exception, the very intentionally cheap and entirely optional \"special\" endgame boss trio). Upping the difficulty doesn't crank damage up to insane levels but makes boss attack patterns faster and more complex, challenging players to tighten their execution while still allowing them to make mistakes.\n\nSeriously, kudos to the design team. Bosses actually modify their attacks based on items collected to ensure that nothing is ever undodgable just because you don't have a specific item. The map has a heck of a lot of alternate paths and secret passages to give players the freedom to explore with a wide variety of item loadouts, including the possibility to complete the game with no items at all! If you're an achievement hunter, some of the DLC ones have alternate unlock conditions based on whether or not you have the DLC (I think just the Artbook cheevos though).\n\nThere's the usual boss rush fare, a \"speedrun\" mode that automatically skips all cutscenes for your pure gameplaying pleasure, and a CG gallery for cutscenes viewed. Sound test is fun to screw around in because you can crank the speed on the music way up or down. Controls are fully remappable and gamepad support is good. Personally I'm not a fan of the way the comic and leaderboard (and in-game cheevo display) are implemented with the Steam overlay, but it's cool that they're accessible from inside the game.\n\nAnd over two years since release, the developer is still showing this game a lot of love too! (Perhaps it helps that they recently released on Playstation Network and are preparing for the Switch release.) Just in the past couple months (as of writing this) they've added local multiplayer co-op out of nowhere, as an \"April Fools\" gift gone serious, and an additional tougher difficulty [i]beyond the two beta difficulties in the Artbook DLC that are already tougher than the highest release difficulty![/i] They are their own game's biggest fan and it really shows with how much care and support they continue to show it well after release.\n\nThis game is worth more than its asking price and worth every gamer's time.", "timestamp_created": 1526833816, "timestamp_updated": 1526833816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617550969123840332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42143148": {"recommendationid": "42143148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150100425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1562797122}, "language": "english", "review": "main character has thighhigh only on one leg", "timestamp_created": 1526829243, "timestamp_updated": 1526829243, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.360594183206558228", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42135891": {"recommendationid": "42135891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003008411", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1926, "last_played": 1675235650}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely worth the play.

I must say that I bought this game expecting a metroidvania, not an anime RPG, so I'll comment accordingly.\n\nThis game is like a hybrid between a metroidvania (hollow knights, ori and the blind forest) and bullet hell (nuclear throne, enter the gungeon, touhou); you explore the world with random mobs, secret rooms, bosses, checkpoints and whatnot, while you also have to dodge crazy bullet curtains projected out. This part was well done. whatever you do the difficulty will be tailored accordingly, regardless of how many skill items you've collected (hell, there's an achievement of \"completing a game with no items collected\"!). Of course you could revert back to a story-related gameplay which encourages exploration. That said, Rabi-Ribi leaves a lot of free space for the player to do whatever he likes - non-linear they say. Although the bosses are vital to the plot, it's made so that you could fight anyone you'd like first and the plot will still make sense. Speaking of bosses, they contribute a huge part to this game's success. As said, fighting them involves in spamming attacks continuously (their HP is insanely high to encourage bullet-dodging) and ultilizing various techniques to dodge mentioned curtain of bullets. To make this trial-and-error process not dull, the pattern of the bullets are really original and once you lose, you know it's your fault, not the game's. The battles are far from being artificially hard (except for the unusually high HP, which again, is for bullet-dodging encouragement). There are 40+ bosses for you to fight with and 5 (or 6?) difficulty levels to engage in. There was a point when you have to fight like 15 of them, one by one without any checkpoints in between. God that was exhausting.\n\nThe soundtracks are pretty short but they do create a vibe and are pretty good. The music and the battle together makes for the satisfaction after you've won a long boss battle. Art's fine, anime standard art.\n\nThat said, I do think this game fits a larger niche than it's destined to at first with tight controls, engaging battles, various items and secrets that are not compulsory so you could do whatever you want, nice soundtracks, art and whatnot.

Wouldn't say it's the best I've played but it's pretty fun. It clearly focuses on exploration and combat more than platforming but it does the first two well enough that I don't really mind the lack of the third. And there's a loooot of boss fights here. And they're surprisingly diverse for mostly being against humanoid characters; just a lot of different bullet hell style fights, mostly. The game world is pretty big by itself with a lot to find, though sometimes hiding stuff in a lot of obtuse ways without giving you the tools to find it all (some of those easter eggs are just, what, whatever). And a few of the bosses aren't too great; too much time invincible being the primary reason. I dig how the strength of the enemies scales as you grow more powerful but there's still some natural curve to the difficulty as well. And I like how some important powerups are just... there. I dunno why but it makes exploring feel more rewarding instead of the game railroading you down a set path to make sure you don't miss anything like some metroidvanias do. The story is pretty weak though and the music is meh, the basic visual style is alright but the cutscene art is all really gratuitous and kind of... bad. I'm overall pretty positive on this one though, but again it's not one of my all-time favorites either.

It has tons of replayability (especially for those who love to set goals), and is a surprisingly difficult game. Don't let the anime art style turn you off. By the way, this game has no nudity in it. If someone says this game has any sexual content in it, they're wrong. That should please those of you who don't like nudity and sexual content in your games.\n\nOnto the actual review.\n\nRabi-Ribi is a game about a bunny girl and a fairy. The plot of this game is very simple, with you needing to bring back someone who mysteriously teleported away. However, despite what you may believe, that's not what has kept me playing for as long as I have been. So, what makes this game so interesting?\n\nThis game is a metroidvania. I've never played a metroidvania game before, so when I went into this, I didn't know what to expect. I really don't regret diving into this. There always seemed like there was something more to do, and something more to collect. Even after finishing the game, it seemed like there was always something I'd either forgotten, or would suddenly find out.\n\nCombat is also pretty interesting. You control Erina, and use Ribbon as your support. The only thing Erina can do is attack with the Piko Hammer. It sounds very simple, but when you have a ranged fairy along with that, combat can become very interesting. What would otherwise be mindless bashing now becomes constant comboing with melee and ranged attacks, while sometimes dealing with various attacks that get thrown your way.\n\nSurprisingly enough, this game has a ton of replayability, especially if you go into this game setting goals. The first goal I had when I got this game was to get good enough to speedrun the game. One playthrough on hard turned into another playthrough on Hell, to another 10 or so playthroughs on Impossible. Each time I've played, I've found something new and interesting. I haven't even done all there is to do. I keep getting caught up in other stuff. I've yet to do a 0% run, and I've yet to get 100% of the map filled.\n\nSo, what makes this game so satisfying? One thing may have to do with the bullet hell.

The world and its art-style are very cute, funny, while the gameplay is energetic and explosive. Jump, shoot, bash, mash, loot, bump, die and repeat - the pace of the game astonishes, even after late-game bosses.\nThe game honestly becomes quite difficult past a certain point in the story, forcing you to understand what you actually do. Rabi-Ribi makes you grow fond of its looks, its general cutesy atmosphere and its yet epic, somewhat difficult, boss battles. In addition, the post-first-playthrough game modes expand the game's lifespan and offer new, challenging ways to play.\n\n[h1]Overall score - [b]9/10[/b][/h1]\n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nRabi-Ribi's world does not have much innovation to offer, nor is its storyline revolutionary or outstanding in any way. It tells the adventures of Erina the bunnygirl, a former actual bunny who doesn't know how or why she was transformed into a human, and Ribbon the fairy, a dweller of a forest who has never left her home. Both of them know nothing of the world in which they begin their adventure, and hardly anything about themselves even. But as the plot develops, the mystery thickens and the story gets more interesting. All in all, although the story may come as quite generic, it has its moments and is still enjoyable.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nRabi-Ribi is all about exploring and fighting. The quest do not guide you as much as in present-day games: the places you want to go to and the order in which you visit them are entirely up to you. You generally do not have a precise objective in mind, stuff just [i]happens[/i]. Most of the time, you notice that you arrived to a quest location because a boss pops out of nowhere.\nThe exploration part can be ignored to a certain extent, but it isn't recommended for a first playthrough as it makes altercations even harder and reduces your number of available moves.\n\n[b]\u2666 Exploration[/b]\nRabi-Ribi's world is rather vast. It is divided into several areas that you can all access at any point through the story. The maps are labyrinthine and brim with items, bonuses and power-ups to discover and pick up. Some are noticeable, most aren't. Illusionary walls, secret passages and hidden areas are scattered around the world. Their hold secret bonuses, but they also serve as shortcuts to get to bosses' fights more quickly. Surely enough, you will get paranoid and try to bomb every wall looking for a hidden passageway. 100%'ing inventory and bonus stats is not a simple task.\n\n[b]\u2666 Fights[/b]\nThe fights are absolutely nuts. Most of any enemy's attacks consists in shooting bullets or lasers - still, who would have imagined that such a variety of patterns could be invented? Fighting trash mobs isn't that unsettling, although their damage might bewilder you at times. However, fighting bosses is on a completely different level. They spam the living sh*t out of you and throw so many projectiles at a time that you will not get out of the battle alive, yet more unscathed, if you do not choose your time to attack wisely. Every boss' attacks are unique and amazing. You need to dodge them cleverly in order to be in position to dodge the next attack. These duels are very challenging, but a hell lot of fun.\n\n[b]\u2666 Items and collectibles[/b]\nAs I said, the map is filled with items and power-ups to pick. Items basically unlock new moves and enable to go to new places (higher, accessible only by sliding etc.). On the other hand, power-ups slightly boost your stats. There is a shop at which you can buy more of these power-ups and where items can be upgraded to improve their combat ability. Items are compulsory to grab to move on in the story, power-ups aren't. You can choose to unequip an item at any time. All this means that you can choose to pick up all the collectibles you find to become stronger, or you can choose not to pick up anything and deactive your items to push the challenge to its limit. But, in this case, the game will become extremely difficult.\n\n[b]\u2666 Difficulty[/b]\nAll in all, Rabi-Ribi is pretty difficult. The game starts off quite easy regardless of the initial difficulty level you picked, but becomes harder over time. More precisely, there are several difficulty spikes past certain events in the story. You definitely take some time to adapt to later bosses and start dying frequently at some point. If you did not collect power-ups, the game gets so absurdly mad that I cannot begin to describe it. At any moment, you may choose to lower the difficulty, but you can never get it up again.\n\n\n[h1]Aesthetics & Sound environment[/h1]\nRabi-Ribi's design suit the game very much. The retro-like graphics fits well with the cute atmosphere and each character's art style is very good.\nHowever, the most gorgeous thing Rabi-Ribi has to offer is indisputably boss battles. Each boss has his own patterns and his own attacks, and you would not believe how many different missiles a skilled team is able to create. No boss resembles another, and the bullet hell they unleash looks like a ballet of forms and colours - which leaves a particular feeling of satisfaction to the fights. You will most probably take a few hits at the start of every battle, because you will be both surprised by the celerity of the attacks and amazed by how colourful they are. \nTo top it off, each boss has its own music that fits its style of combat and attack. The musics are both cute and epic, and they fire you up as much as needed to fight decently. Each area's background music also sounds good, without being invasive. They are calm and often soothing, which makes for a better surprise when it surprisingly switches to an epic one because you have just unexpectedly encountered a boss!", "timestamp_created": 1522665600, "timestamp_updated": 1527527023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41213702": {"recommendationid": "41213702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012830308", "num_games_owned": 819, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 11263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10916, "last_played": 1696547955}, "language": "english", "review": "Actually one of the best metroidvanias in the entire genre.", "timestamp_created": 1522614892, "timestamp_updated": 1696027081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444080501794815063", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41139402": {"recommendationid": "41139402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143993017", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 970, "last_played": 1557323564}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't express my feelings for this game, it has a perfect mix of everything that overall, makes this one of my favourite games I have ever come across.\nThere are many features to a game that can be implemented to craft a perfect game and I think this game takes those elements and makes it into a price worthy platformer. \n\nFor a start, and most importantly, the gameplay. On the surface, the controlls look very simple and the action also looks quite simple and basic which is true in the earlier parts of the game but, as the game progresses, the intensity of merging moves learnt throughout the game into dodging the bullet hell the bosses throw at you makes the game very challenging yet still viable to play. \nThe thought processes of using slower but more rewarding melee moves or faster but less damaging projectiles, healing items and bombs turns this game from a simple bullet hell platformer into a much more complex yet still managable game to enjoy and play. \nThe difficulty however, can be very challanging at the end-game which is understandable for it being th final boss. That is why the importance of difficulty settings is good for this game because it appeals to more than just skilled players but also the lesser experienced players too with an option to decrease the difficulty at any point which I think is vital. \nI would say the gameplay is split into three parts, discovering new parts of the map, finding skills and upgrades, and the boss fights. The map discovery sections are pretty self explanatory but is important and done well in this game because of the interactivity of the maps and the challenges it puts before you, rather than being levels you can simply fly through without any reward. This makes the lesser intense parts of the game still interesting and interactive which many other games seem to lack. Secondly, the finding of skills and upgrades. This part of the game is vital for many player for without them, you will find it very hard to pass though some of the later bosses. This follows the same formule as the map discovery sections because it doesn't send you though a hard tresure hunt without any rewards or purpose that feels stuck in but instead, makes it a high reward and fun journy to the final upgrade. Also, a small feature is the attention to the players level and the level of the enemies of the area. The upgrades you find in the area seem to correlate with the levels of the enemies which again is attention to the reward you get for finding these upgrades. Finally, and  the most fun part of the game is the boss battles that are present at the end of each \"level\" per say and aren't your usual boss battle. These boss battles focus primarily on you and the boss where you need to stratagise your attacks in an attempt to deal as much damage as you can and take the least damage possible until you defeat them. The attack patterns are very inventive and unique which means you rarely see any repeats which makes each new boss a new experience for the user. Another small feature is the use of the ranks in the boss battles that increases up to max depending on your performance throughout the battle. Rather than the rank simply being a title present in your records (,while still important because it drives the player to do even better to get max rank), it has a dual funciton of increasing the players attack by up to %40 at a time which rewards the player for doing well in the battle, usually do to the upgrades collected in the previous area. The final thing gameplay I feel is vital to mention is the continue buffs you are presented with when you die multiple times. Rather than getting to a level and repetitively dying over and over again and getting frustrated, the game gives you the option to have buffs that increase various stats and results in you staying alive long enough to pass the harder sections. This is just a potential helping hand to assist the user, just incase. \nThese features is what makes the gameplay unique and different to your usual game which definetly seperates it from other games.\n\nGameplay aside, the story. While the story of the game is not the best out there, it is still enough to give the game a premise to work off and form a game around which it does very well. The game is basically split into two halves, the first half is the easier section, working on getting skills and upgrading stats to tackle the harder bosses in the game, and the second half is less focused on the working of skills and upgrades and rather focuses on the intensity and implementing these skills against more challanging bosses. \nThe second half acts as a post-main game section that still works off the first half which is more for the experienced players to get a \"second shot\" at some more challanging gameplay while giving the lesser able players a place to stop and more or less, finish the game. \nThis again gives you every oppotunity possible to play the game to your preference and skill level rather than a pre-set path and difficulty which would usually drive away most players.\nThe story itself is moderatly long giving the player lots to do and play for, taking me up to 30 hours just to do the non-dlc story with much more to offer with the dlc options given to you. This means that this game will last you longer than the usual game that can be finished in one sitting which shows that real thought has gone into making this game what is it. \n\nNow another important yet small feature that I think the creators of Rabi-Ribi have done well is the controlls. I played with a controller so I can't make any comments on the ease of the keybindings, but the controlls regardless are very simple and easy to grasp with the given option to change the bindings to more closely suit your preferences which makes you feel a lot less trapped with how the developers want you to play the game but rather how the player themselves wants to play the game.\n\nNow finally, the last important part that feel meeds to be mentioned is the music. In some cases, the music can be the make or break feature of a game, the feature that livens up a battle and overall emphisises the tone of specific scenes. Rabi-Ribi seems to handle this quite well with an extensive range of boss music that really makes you feel part of the boss battles and I belive that some of the music included in the boss battles are some of the best boss music out there. It fires you up for the upcoming battle. There isn't much else to say about the catchy tunes in this game, it is one of the smallest features that have the greatest effect on the game. \n\nThe only negative things about this game is the difficulty of some of the early game enemies. Sometimes they can be too hard to defeat and continue which is vital doesn't happen in the early sections of the game where the player needs to learn how to play the game but this was only present with a select few enemies and even then, it disappeared later on in the game. \nAnother negative that may arise from some players is the duration of the boss battles. While I personally had no problem with this, some of the boss battles can be a bit lengthy such as the final battle for example which takes up to 30 minutes of constant playing and dodging to complete which can be viewed as quite ridiculous but can be seen, especially in my eyes as a higher reward when you finally come across defeating the boss. \n\nI would personally highly reccomend this game if you are up to a complex, cute and challenging bullet hell platformer and the price is worth what you get.

[/h1]\nThe story revolves around the bunny-turned-human Erina. To be honest, the [b] Story[/b] is probably the weakest aspect from this game. Then again, you probably weren't expecting a great story in the first place from a metriodvania. What we have here works, so it doesn't really warrant more than a minor complaint.\n\n[h1] An adventure of improvement and growth.[/h1]\nThis game takes the form of a metroidvania. If you are unfamiliar of the term, it originates from two games that share the same gimmicks, Metriod (the series) and Castlevania (specifically, Symphony Of The Night). You start off without even having your two main weapons, leaving you defenseless and not very mobile with a simple jump. However, that lasts all of 10 seconds when you recieve your trusty Piko Hammer, and it all goes on from there. By the end of the journey, you'll be a high-flying, air-jumping, bash-rolling, uppercutting, hammer-flailing bunny with the power to unleash a massive beam from a carrot. Yes.\n\n[h1] Wherever there's growth, comes challenge.[/h1]\nIf you play normally, the game'll treat you well. It respects your skill, but if you're struggling, it will offer help in the form of the Halo Boost, granting temporary perks that help with the fight. However, if you ask it to, the game can kick your ass so hard you'd probably only be able to hop for the rest of your life. The hardest difficulty, [b]Bunny Extinction[/b], is DETERMINED to make your species extinct by pelting you with an endless barrage of bullets. If you manage to brave the challenge, you'd be able to walk outside and dodge the goddamn rain.\n\n[h1] But most importantly, it's all about the fun.[/h1]\nHonestly, ever since I've got this game, I've been HOOKED. It's just so much goddamn fun, especially if you're a masochist like me. If you want the ultimate challenge, try for the Rabi-Ribi achievement. I haven't even managed to get ahold of that kind of skill after 150 hours of playtime. If you wanna push yourself even further beyond, the speedrunning community is fierce with competition. Can you score ahold of a world record in Speedrun Mode (that's included in the game, mind you).\nNot the kind for fights? The game also functions as a perfectly functional platformer, complete with the ability to make custom scenarios to put our bunny/fairy duo through. Steam Workshop support available, too!\n\nBacked by an absolutely phenomenal soundtrack by the likes of Triodust and 3R2, Lazoi, MWT, Waiting and more, with pretty pixel art and the cutest bunny/fairy duo you can find on Steam, incorporating Bullet Hell elements into a fully functional Metroidvania, jam packed with content and with endless replayability.\nAll in all, I can just say this:\n[h1] If you haven't bought this game yet, you are MISSING OUT. BIG TIME.[/h1]\n\nThat is all. Enjoy!\n\nEDIT: Improved wording.", "timestamp_created": 1518964446, "timestamp_updated": 1559032003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518887817859649658",

On top of that, you get a ton of cuteness, rabbits and anime-esque goodness. But one of the things you must never forget is that this game is [i]very hard[/i]. Although, to be fair, you could play on casual difficulty.\nAlthough there are many items scattered around the expansive map, on standard rules the bosses you encounter become stronger with you such that the advantage is not game-breaking. On another point, the bosses are probably the selling point of this game: with bullet-hell attacks that are always dodgeable (even the flippin' annoying ones), by the end quite challenging, and also always with an excuse to fight you (including atmospheric anomalies). Erina, the Playboy-esque bunny-turned-bunnygirl who wields a giant Piko hammer, has to deal with all this while trying to figure out what the heck happened. And her accomplice in the carnage is Ribbon, just another fairy who is [i]absolutely[/i] not food.\nOn the aesthetics of the game, the more peripheral aspects of this game are pretty good. The 16-bit artstyle used in gameplay flows well, and the areas all look great (even the endgame ethereal areas). Rabi-Rabi Island (and what I presume is Taipei) in this art style looks colourful and bright in most areas, and the endgame ethereal areas also give a sense that you're in a purely magical area. The antialiased drawn art is pretty good too. And the music is good enough to be listened to [i]outside[/i] the game. Respect to GemaYue, Saiste, Triodust and the others for all this.\nHowever, although the story has some mystery to it, it is probably the weakest point of the game, as there are tropes to be found (Saya: \"NOTICE ME SENPAI!\" [i]not a direct quotation[/i]) but not too many. Perhaps GemaYue (the developer) just wanted to focus on gameplay, which is not a terrible idea. There is always the excuses to fight, and even Ribbon has had enough of it. But it's not terrible.\nA neat point about this game is that if you ever find yourself having to 'git gud' you might just, with perserverance, 'git gud'. To exaggerate: Having difficulties on casual difficulty? Well, give it 300 hours and I guarantee you'll be doing 0% BEX runs without ever suffering damage.

It's a good game and quite unique compared to what else is on the market, but your enjoyment of the game may be hampered by aspects of its presentation and whether or not that personally bothers you.  In Short: Great Gameplay but mediocre pixel art (and borderline hentai character design).\n\nRabi is a Metroidvania + Bullet Hell.  It has an insanely huge map with some of the best designed areas I have ever seen.  Several areas can be tackled in any order to progress the main story, while many movement abilities can be circumvented or worked around with clever platforming and creative routing.  It *is* possible to do several sequence breaks that sound impossible on your first playthrough: and most of them even have achievements associated with them.  Even on top of that, a huge amount of map/boss/areas are optional in the normal story.  The game has a pretty intense post-game with escalating platforming and boss fight challenges that will really test and engage you even on normal.\n\nSpeaking of boss fights and difficulties: this game can be challenging.  If you've never played bullet hells, you will struggle in some boss fights even on normal.  When it comes to the THREE higher difficulties than that, bonus bosses, DLC, NG+ looping, and challenge modes like speedrun and boss rush: you will quickly approach the limits of what you can handle.  But the game's patterns are really well-designed and the hit detection is excellent.  As hard as the game can seem, it's always your fault when you get hit.  To a seasoned shmup or fangame player, this game is not that hard as even the hardest patterns are pretty manageable and the extra difficulty mostly comes from boss stats.\n\nThe music is all-around solid but inconsistent.  There are some standout great songs, and some average ones, but nothing bad.  Some of the boss themes are super cutesy and others sound like they came out of a Castlevania final boss fight, but they're all catchy in their own way.  I liked it enough to buy the soundtrack edition.\n\nThe story is pretty generic and mostly forgettable, but it has likeable characters who just want to protect their home and their friends.  Some scenes are vapid hentai pandering, but if that's your cup of tea you'll see that as a pro and not a con.\n\nThe art... this is the part where the game suffers.  First off, the majority of the game is pretty low res pixel art.  This part is decidedly mediocre compared to the 60,000 other pixel art Metroidvanias on the market.  But it really is inconsistent with both the bullet hell patterns/FX and the high res hand drawn character portraits.  When the screen is overwhelmed with bullets it's always possible to see your character... but mostly for the unflattering reason that her sprite looks so much worse than everything else on the screen at that point.  As for the character art and character designs... this game is all women (and little girls) who are allergic to pants.  The playboy bunny costume has an in-universe justification, but there's nothing you could say to defend Ribbon or Miru's outfits.  If their cut-ins are on screen you better make sure your friends and family aren't watching, unless those people are into loli-bait.  Your only argument if they see it is \"but it has good gameplay\".  And y'know what?  It DOES have good gameplay, but it also has these character designs.\n\nI enjoyed this game thoroughly and find the lategame platforming challenges and boss rushes truly exhilerating.

Que sorpresa m\u00e1s grata me llev\u00e9.\n\n[h1] Historia y contenido [/h1]\n\nEmpecemos con el punto fuerte de este t\u00edtulo: este juego tiene m\u00e1s contenido del que tu y yo vamos a querer jugar, mis respetos para aquellos que lo completan al 100% realmente es toda una haza\u00f1a. Pero voy a explicarme, despertamos en un lugar oscuro sin saber como llegamos alli ni donde estamos, al poco tiempo nuestra protagonista Erina se da cuenta de algo !Puede hablar\u00a1 pero \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? ella era un conejo, espera, tiene... \u00bfmanos...? y... \u00bfPies...? !Es una humana\u00a1 escuchas un ruido y vas a perseguirlo, estabas dentro de una caja y pareces atrapada en un edificio; para no alargar el analisis, dire que estamos en un mundo donde existen hadas, magia y los conejos estan casi extintos, as\u00ed que no es descabellado pensar que llegas a una isla con habitantes humanos con orejas de animales, tras volver a casa a encontrarte con tu \"maestra\" parece ser que su hermana menor esta perdida y para encontrarla har\u00e1 falta un monton de magia as\u00ed que tu mision sera buscar gente capaz de utilizar magia para ayudarte y a ello que vas, a darle de martillazos a todos para que te ayuden.\nTodo bien hasta aqui, pero \u00bfd\u00f3nde esta todo el contenido? Pues resulta que tras completar la historia principal a\u00fan queda [b] mucho [/b] por hacer, tenemos un segundo objetivo que no puedo contar por que es spoiler [strike] y no recuerdo cual era exactamente [/strike] pero si te puedo decir que es mas o menos equivalente a toda la historia principal, pero sabes que, aun no has visto nada, tras completar este segundo objetivo (yo tarde unas 40 horas hasta este punto) todavia te quedan montones de cosas para el 100%, claro que todo esto es opcional pero hay algunas cosas que si bien no vas a querer completar de primeras, lo vas a intentar y  no vas a parar hasta completarlas\n\n[h1] Mec\u00e1nicas [/h1]\n\nComo habr\u00e1s leido antes estamos hablando de un [i] bullet hell con gravedad [/i] y no solo eso, de mundo abierto, montones de items por encontrar, un ligerisimo toque de RPG, metroidvania, plataforma, 2D y un monton de bosses por derrotar. El juego realmente se basa en esto \u00faltimo, cada persona que quieras reclutar requerira que le encuentres pasando por un par de salas con enemigos bastante simples y que mueras unas cuantas veces en una pelea contra un boss, ya que saben usar magia es razonable pensar que te atacaran con muchos patrones de balas, \u00bfno...? parece facil pero ponlo en una dificultad alta y veras como los patrones pareceran inesquivables.\nAl contrario que en todos los juegos del genero tu no tienes disparos para combatir al boss, o bueno quizas s\u00ed, pero son de un hada de quien te haces amiga al comienzo, tu tienes un martillo, una zanahoria y un par de habilidades mas, algunos combates son realmente tensos y dificiles as\u00ed que tendr\u00e1s que repetir hasta conseguirlo; este es uno de esos juego que te parecen imposibles al comienzo y al final de verdad son imposibles pero es increiblemente satisfactorio vencer.\nTambien tengo que hablar del mundo abierto, al ser en este formato eres libre de explorar todo lo que quieras mientras tus habilidades lo permitan, recordemos que tambien es metroidvania, asi que puedes buscar items para tener ventaja sobre los bosses donde te atoraste, a menos que estes en modo alternativo; me explico, al iniciar la partida puedes elegir entre 2 modos: est\u00e1ndar o alternativo, en est\u00e1ndar las stats del boss (vida y da\u00f1o) se definen por tu progreso en la historia, de esta manera es posible obtener una ventaja, pero en alternativo las stats se definen por la cantidad de items que tienes, haciendo aun m\u00e1s dificil derrotar a un boss si no tienes alguna habilidad especial e incluso imposible obtener ventaja. Como recomendacion, si piensas jugarte el juego mas de una vez para conseguir logros, empieza por alternativo, me lo agradeceras\n\n[h1] M\u00e1s contenido [/h1]\n\n\u00bfCreias que eso era todo? aun habiendo completado todo lo que la historia te puede ofrecer quedan disponibles dos modos m\u00e1s y un par de DCL\u00b4s, uno de ellos gratuito que a\u00f1ade una zona nueva de plataformeo bastante dificil, el otro de ellos al momento de escribir esto no lo he jugado pero tiene pinta de a\u00f1adir un par de capitulos m\u00e1s post-endgame y un par de bosses; en cuanto a los modos, ambos se desbloquean tras completar el juego principal, uno de ellos es bastante soso y [u] creo [/u] que solo es para conseguir logros [spoiler] speedrun [/spoiler] , pero el otro va a ser un veredadero dolor de cabeza o el mejor regalo que los desarrolladores te pudieron haber hecho: un Bossrush, por si uno solo no fuera suficiente ahi los tienes todos juntos, o bueno no exactamente todos. Existen 3 Bossrush uno de los bosses principales, otro con los Endgame y otro con los Post-Endgame, realmente una locura\n\n[h1] Logros [/h1]\n\nMe parece un poco absurdo hacer un apartado para esto pero creo que lo merece, los logros son en gran parte de donde viene mi exageracion por todo el contenido que tiene, te incitan demasiado a pasarte el juego al menos 4 veces y aun sabiendote las ubicaciones de los jefes, los patrones y demas no es un juego corto precisamente. Tambien estan los que van desde lo mas absurdo como derrotar a una silla y una mesa hasta lo mas dificil como pasarte el \u00faltimo boss del Post-Endgame sin sufrir ni un rasgu\u00f1o, me parece un buen objetivo conseguir unos cuantos de estos, realmente es divertido.\n\n[h1] Pros y Contras [/h1]\n\n+Tiene una banda sonora realmente buena y pegajosa\n+Pixeles y anime juntos\n+Trata sobre un conejo y un hada\n+Vencer a un boss es realmente satisfactorio\n+Montones de habilidades e items por encontrar\n+Es largo\n+Es dif\u00edcil\n\n-Hay zonas en las cuales no puedes entrar por ser el final de la historia pero la justificacion es: [i] Siento como si mi cuerpo no quiziera entrar alli [/i]\n-Si bucas el 100% tendras que repetir el juego unas 10 veces", "timestamp_created": 1516330056, "timestamp_updated": 1516330056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39447345": {"recommendationid": "39447345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205615225", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 5285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1965, "last_played": 1652462102}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game, Beautiful art, Beautiful music, Beautiful retrying 30 times to beat one boss.

While I was playing as Erina, I had to face against lots of unforgettable bosses. My favorite boss to fight against was [spoiler]Arurane[/spoiler], because of she\u2019s one of the bosses, I had the hardest time with, she was very challenging, yet very fun to play against. Meanwhile [spoiler]Irisu[/spoiler] was almost impossible to beat, and was very frustrating to play against, which made me T R I G G E R E D a bunch of times, after dying to her over several times, but at least it was VERY satisfying to defeat her, after 6 hours of trying.\nIn the game, you can do a bunch of cool things, like beating weeaboos with your PIKO Hammer, or try to beat a boss with only your helper [spoiler]Ribbon[/spoiler] or with only Carrot Bombs. The game offers a lot of gameplay, and 186 achievements you can try to get, if you\u2019re a person that wants 100% like me. \n\nIn the end I would say this game is a 10/10!\nThe only thing that was not enjoyable were the controls.

As time went on I was exposed to even more of the OST so I got the game during the last winter sale. I was expecting a generic platformer with good music. The fact that the default controls are so confusing didn't help either, not to mention the game randomly started in Korean one time so I had to spend like 10 minutes finding where to change the language (one time bug).\nHOWEVER\nIt was all worth it. The more I played the more addicted I got. To put it in perspective, first day I spent just one hour playing but at the end of the week I had 2 sessions of 3 hours in the same day. Despite being bad at bullet hell games (hell I died like 4 times in \"casual\"), it was just way too much fun for me to care. The story development is well put together. It does get boring sometimes trying to find certain items without many clues but then again it was a good chance to farm points for later upgrades.

How wrong I was. It's a beautiful blast of sprites, waves of bullets, and what-the-heck-are-you-wearing.\nFirst things first. The gameplay  could be summed up like this: 'Imagine if Cave Story and Touhou got spliced together by some mad scientist.' Because that's Rabi-Ribi for you. It combines brilliant platforming with relentless bullet-hell patterns in a way that I really haven't seen before. The last time someone made a game this ingeniously unique was, as much as I fear to say the name, Undertale. It takes two completely different genres and smashes them together into something completely new. And it works like a freaking charm.\nThe graphics next. (hoo boy.) The sprites are brilliantly made and fit the game perfectly. Joining this is some interesting art that, while initially a bit pervy, mocks this aspect at every opportunity, with people saying that main-lead bunny Erina should really wear more and sidekick Ribbon telling gawking nerds to sod off, saying that this isn't some kind of R-rated game. Yes, this game gets a bit meta at times and I love it for that very reason, but I digress.\nThe music is downright incredible. Harking to its Touhou genes, it churns out masterpieces at every turn. From upbeat tunes like Adventure Starts Here, to the sombre Floating Graveyard, to the relaxing Unfamiliar Place,  to every one of its battle themes (go play the game, don't spoil yourself. It's infinitely more epic when you don't know what's coming.) every note is beautiful, and always sets the perfect atmosphere for what it's used for.\nIn all, this is easily one of the best, most beautiful, most fun games I've played in a long while.

I can only assume that they've eyeballed some of the art and instantly dismissed it as \"weeb game for neckbeard pervs\" or, if the Cuphead tutorial debacle's anything to go by, none of them could get far enough to pass any kind of comment at all.\n\nEither way they're fools, because they've missed out on a real treat.\n\nThe marriage of metroidvania and bullet hell works so well that in retrospect I'm surprised it's not been done more. It's rare to see sequence-breaking and skipping as actively encouraged as it is here, with a wide variety of achievements on offer for deliberately missing what you thought were key items. Even then there's a lot to see, with 22 areas on offer it's not a small game by any means.  \n\nWith such heavy danmaku roots it'd be so easy for the bosses' bullet patterns to descend into maddening walls of relentless bullshit and it's to the designers' immense credit that not only is that never the case, but each fight is unique and memorable. That's not to say there are any gimmes; even on Normal you won't be in for an easy ride and if you're not well prepared you're going to get tonked seven ways from Sunday, but you'll rarely feel like a fight's completely beyond your ability if only you can sharpen up your concentration.\n\nFor me personally, getting value for money from my games is a massive plus point, and at \u00a39.10 I feel like I've robbed the devs blind. Even without the POST-post-game bosses (because the game insists on continuing to throw out things for you to do!) and any of the DLC, the wealth of options that unlock after your first playthrough mean you'll always have a reason to come back. Multiple higher difficulties, a speedrun mode, a boss rush mode, and the achievements for no-damage boss fights and sequence breaks mean that although my time spent is currently 27 hours, there's going to be a damn sight more than that by the time I'm through with it.\n\nIf I had one tiny issue with the game it'd be with the character conversations. I get that if you're buying a game with bunny girls in it weird plot is going to come with the territory but my efforts at trying to make any sense out of it were consistently hampered by characters, in the middle of discussing what I assumed to be story, spiralling off into meaningless asides about day-to-day life, or their relationships with each other. Rather than give up the game or try to keep track I just decided I'd have more fun if I simply didn't bother, and that's how it proved. \n\nRabi-Ribi is a deeply mature game, wrapped inside a deeply childish one. If bunny girls and nonsensical plots are your bag then fair enough, but don't give it a go for those reasons.

Just felt like writing a review for it atm.\n\nIt gives off a 16-bit vibe, with cute, comfortable chibi sprites and characters to enjoy looking at. Don't try to write it off like it's some weeb-shit game, because oh man it's much much more than that. Much better.\n\nRabi-Ribi offers fun to both casual and challenging players in its game difficulties, even giving you a chance to buff up the difficulty or lower it whenever you want while playing by going to a certain place.\n\nIf you are a victim of dying or losing too often it will even offer you help by making you practically invincible and give you buffs, mainly if you become stuck on a boss or stage of the game that proved too difficult for you. This is a great mechanic for those who like it really casual.\n\nI've spent hours playing this game, mainly using a controller for my own preference, and I can tell you that it's not worth looking-over as some weeb game. I recommend buying both the PC and PS4 Versions, to see what fixiates you and your controls best. I actually use an xbox controller for the PC version, funnily enough. After I beat this game I'm going to replay it on the PS4 version and then probably go back to the PC to replay the bossfights and get rid of my previously horrible preformances on them with newer, better ones. You'll get better at the game as you play more of it.\n\nTo summarize:\nIt's a cute, funny game and I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to experience or explore not only a challenge but a story. It's like a playable visual novel; you aren't just reading the story, but playing it!\n\nIf you like bunnies and/or hammers, get this game.\nIf you like fairies, get this game.\nIf you like anime girls, get this game.\nif you like boss-fighting, get this game.\nIf you like super-power having anime girls that you fight as bosses, get this game.\nIf you like cuteness, get this game.\nIf you like stories and/or visual novels, get this game.\nIf you like a challenge, get this game (and set it up to a reasonable difficulty for yourself)\nIf you like it casual, you can also experience the same kind of achievement as someone who likes a challenge that plays it. Therefore, get this game.\nIf you like bullet hell, get this game.\nAnd most importantly, saved for last, if you like your games having involvement with \"sexy\" (boobs and ass), get this game.\n\nWell, what are you waiting for?\nJust try it and fall in love with it already!", "timestamp_created": 1513568097, "timestamp_updated": 1513568395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736924886703491211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38390609": {"recommendationid": "38390609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244710038", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1684424451}, "language": "english", "review": "6 out of 5 \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606!\n\nOhkay, first of all, i'm not really into fighting rpg games at all, but when you incluede \"BUNNIES\".

Also you can add badges to get various effects like more attack power, more defense, the ability to see your enemies' health upon attacking them, and much more!\n\nThe story is so delightfully bizarre I find it hard to wrap my head around sometimes, so I will leave you to discover it!

Yes Yes! A million times YES! This game gets the rare 9.5/10 from me and I haven't had this much fun with a video game in a long time. I reccommend the portable Vita version if you can which is what I got both to support the folks behind this and to play it while I wass sick in bed. Much like the recent 2D Castlevania titles it fits real well on handheld. Overall a fantastic experience if you are into the handheld Castlevania games this is very similar and definitely stands on its own. Even if you are put off by the anime style (which I know some of my friends are) the gameplay itself is great! It does have minor bullet-hell type boss patterns but still very forgiving and rewarding at the same time. ITs not overly punishing and if you keep failing it will throw you a bone in a non game breaking way. It is still challenging.

Whatever happened to that saying about not judging a book by its cover? While there is definitely some fanservice, there is no H-Content, and the game even actually jokes about it at one point in a scene that would make the people that are actually into H-games look bad.\n\n\nBut with that minirant done with, this is a very well made Metroidvania with a very balanced level of challenge. The platforming is not really difficult in most areas and gets harder near the end of the postgame areas, but it's nothing too unreasonable. The main strength of the game is in the boss fights where you will need to learn how to deal with all sorts of patterns.\n\nThere are lots of hidden items to find. Sequence Breaking is encouraged and sometimes even rewarded(there's even an achievement for doing some of them). Most bosses can be fought in whatever order you like, but there are some cases where you have to beat certain bosses to access some parts of the game or other bosses. While glitches do get patched out, there is an option in game to reenable them, so that speedruns can still use them. \n\n\nThe game has many difficulty options. From easy modes that anyone who just cares about the story to get through to ones that should satisfy hardcore players. The only downside with this is that the harder ones have to be unlocked. Patterns get more bullets and get faster with increasing difficulty, but at least up to the game's standard highest difficulty of Bunny Extinction, the game is for the most part completely fair. At least during what comes in the game without DLC, if you get hit, it pretty much is always your fault in some way. Some of the DLC content may not necessarily be fully balanced, but I haven't spent as much time on that to see if I'm just missing stuff that would make things fair. There are higher difficulties than Bunny Extinction in the artbook DLC, but they were cut for a reason, there's lots of unfair stuff in those ones, but some people do enjoy that as well.\n\n\nThe achievements in this will also be a decent challenge if you're looking for a difficult game to 100%. Not only do you have to beat almost every standard game boss without getting hit(though final and postgame bosses do allow some hits), you will have to get through a boss rush of 28 bosses in a row, no heals between rounds, and if you die you will go right back to round 1, on Bunny Extinction or harder(The artbook's Unknown and Impossible do let you have 3 of the healing items compared to BEX cap of 1, but everything else about those probably makes it actually harder than BEX even with more healing available, but I have not finished the game on Impossible yet to be able to check that)\n\n\nAlso nominated for Labor of Love award.", "timestamp_created": 1511876934, "timestamp_updated": 1511878133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551023125648498535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37876677": {"recommendationid": "37876677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021844924", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2722, "last_played": 1478531232}, "language": "english", "review": "It cute.", "timestamp_created": 1511872791, "timestamp_updated": 1511872791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493924587965011597", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37846636": {"recommendationid": "37846636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089804000", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 28213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7620, "last_played": 1697506815}, "language": "spanish", "review": "uno de los mejores bullet hell que he jugado 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1511838913, "timestamp_updated": 1511838913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37828269": {"recommendationid": "37828269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073537653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2612, "last_played": 1674297259}, "language": "english", "review": "im not that good at the game but i enjoyed playing it. it was better then i expected", "timestamp_created": 1511819910, "timestamp_updated": 1511819910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37820403": {"recommendationid": "37820403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061919924", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3346, "last_played": 1528855869}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with tons of content.

This game adds an interesting twist to make it into a platform instead of regular flying setting. This however feel super natural and wonderfully smooth. \n\nEvery boss fight is super unique and mesmerizing. Sound effect, Music Effect, Graphics Effect are wonderfully blended together for an enchanting experience. \n\nMap design are very smart and huge. There are massive number of items and upgrades for you to discover and your bunny and fairy will get stronger and stronger and unlock a lot of extra region/area that you won\u2019t have access to when you first going through the map. \n\nThe story for this game is a bit weak and confusing compare to other aspect of this game. Me finishing first 2 chapter in 2017 and rest chapters in 2021 contributed to my confusion. But even without my real-life time skip the story for this game is still very weird even for a WEEB game. You don\u2019t really need to enjoy the story to enjoy this game through.\n\nThis is also a game that I won\u2019t recommend to 100% achievement grabber as the 220 achievements all need to be earned and some of the achievements need an independent playthrough of its own. I estimated at least 200-300 hours of many playthrough to get everything. There are also a whole bunch of DLC available and you need them to get 100% achievements as developer still upgrading this game to add new boss fight, new mode, new area and new time-based event. \n\n9/10 would be the high mark I gave this game as this is the best platformer, bullet-hell, Metroidvania game on steam. Once you start playing it\u2019s very hard to put down. \n\nBTW Main Story ends on Chapter 6, With post-game it ends on chapter 8 and there is a DLC that i will buy next steam sale ends on chapter 10 bring the story to a final close.", "timestamp_created": 1511401800, "timestamp_updated": 1619145469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613779962062835693", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36877114": {"recommendationid": "36877114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065746208", "num_games_owned": 704, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2204, "last_played": 1625651388}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.", "timestamp_created": 1511398280, "timestamp_updated": 1511398280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36875917": {"recommendationid": "36875917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029039217", "num_games_owned": 574, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4366, "last_played": 1527365575}, "language": "english", "review": "Just play it, look beyond the anime artstyle because it's actually a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1511397992, "timestamp_updated": 1511397992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36868907": {"recommendationid": "36868907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065212581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1559188380}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, this game is a strange beast...

So what's the draw? What kept people coming back to this to reach what I have to assume is really engaging gameplay far later on? I want to write it off as just being due to every character being a half-naked sexy anime babe, but whenever I see discussion of the game online, everyone vehemently denies that that has anything to do with the game being good.\nDon't believe the hype, if you have any doubts about whether or not you'll like this game, just avoid it.

Deadly. Hectic. Challenging. A bundle of many unusual elements together to form one of the most fun games I've played.\n\nRabi Ribi is a game that surprises me with how much it has to offer for a single playthrough and beyond, offering a main playthrough that will last most players around at least a couple of hours. In addition to this, there is a lot of incentive to replay the game with ng+, post-game bosses/content, a free Halloween themed DLC with a hell of a fight, and many ways of rewarding players who wish to go the extra mile of challenging yourself via silly handicaps, speedruns, no items, etc. Non-linearity is embraced throughout a majority of the game with only gradual bits of the story restricting you from particular areas. You can determine how difficult bosses become via scaling with story progress or on the area by choice when you start off your playthrough, the first being more friendly for beginners doing mainly story progress and the latter being for those going off the course exploring to your liking.\n\n Gameplay consists of a chaotic and fun mix of action, platforming, and shmup/bullet-hell elements while navigating a Metroidvania-esque world map with lots of exploration, hidden items, secret spots, and more. While navigating through areas is interesting enough clearing a variety of enemies while looking for fake walls or breakable surfaces, the real meat and bones of how it plays comes together well bundled in the game's many many boss fights, with all having unique patterns that keep you on the edge and get gradually tougher and complex as your difficulty increases. No need to fear though, Erina has an arsenal of different shot types, a hammer to melee with, several unlockable items, and many techniques and tricks up her sleeve to reward skilled players, several which are related to hidden achievements so I will not discuss them here. \n\nIf you feel intimidated by the difficulty or are having a hard time progressing, no need to fear. The game offers easier difficulties, a continue system that offers a special buff to reduce damage taken (not avaliable on hard or higher), and there are healing items avaliable. If you are still struggling with the difficulty you chose, shortly early on in the game is access to an NPC that offers to make the game easier.\n\nOn a final note, I wanted to discuss the art style if it is a concern for those who are not generally a fan of anime styled art, chibis, or any of that. I'd implore for you to look past the looks as it more focused on gameplay while not burdened with excessive fan service despite appearances or preconceptions you might have about the looks of this game.  \n\nStill doing post-game as of this review and enjoying it.

VERY good game. it's challenging, but if you aren't good at games of this type, you can play on easier difficulty setting and if you still fail multiple times you even gain buffs. if you still can't do it, a bit of grinding and buying better equip  and/or finding a few more abilities etc. can help you out aswell. i just finished the main story and i'm SOO happy that there's still so much more to do. the controls are incredibly well done and the bossfights are so fun to do aswell, that you really WANT to find every boss on your own. can only recommend this game.\n\nthe very only tiny mini downside there can be seen in this, is that sometimes the game pauses 2 much between conversations, wasting a few seconds here and there, or has a bit of dots going back and forth before they continue talking. but really that's cherry picking the already perfect cherries.\n\ni already played hollow knight this year and though there won't be another game i can play that will get me as happy and well, this one did just that.\n\nyou really have to play it, looking at a few videos, or screenshots, trying to quickly check if the game is worth it, doesn't do the experience justice and i

A great platformer, bullet hell featuring cutesy characters and great graphical artwork\n\nUpdates, guides, and DLC's still pouring in even after it's initial release a year ago, and with each passing update, makes the game more fun as it is!\n\nFor the initial game it can literally be described in a LOT of words, which is probably why reviews here are so short, but here's what I think about it :\n\nThe visuals are AMAZING. I love how the backgrounds in each levels are thought out really well and immerses you in the environment. Character artwork and sprites complement each other, accurate that their pixel-y selves are distinct even without even seeing their artwork. And the generous use of light colors in its UI, characters, and environment gives the game it's cute, soft, and adorable charm.\n\nThe story is okay, not bad but not that great either. The initial game doesn't tell anything too much about the lore of the island you play on. It does tell you a bit about all the characters and the island itself, along with it's background fairly well. Thanks to that, you might feel attached to one of the characters since all of them have different personalities. (And it might want you to play the game twice or more >:o)\n\nThe gameplay itself is extremely diverse... Able to captivate new-comers to the bullet hell genre to hardcore players thriving for the records in really unforgiving scales of difficulties. I'd let you find out what works best for you in there, there's literally a tons of things to beat if you're up for a challenge!\n\nThe controls? Simple and straightforward. I've only used a keyboard and it's the only thing you'd ever need playing this game (except when you prefer a controller :L). It might seem alienating at first, but trust me, you'd get fitted into it in no time. Even the devs anticipated this and made it so that boss encounters are events in which even the newest player of this genre can easily overcome thanks to their gradual difficulty increase.\n\nOverall, this game is a great all rounder, considering the price (It lowers to being literally almost free during sales), this game is too much to pass on.

Words simply cannot express how good this game is. It is a masterpiece that can be shown to people while teaching them how do one makes a video game. This game will still be good even after 20 years or more pass. It seems that CreSpirit, the developer, understands what a good game is, and not just that \u2013 they can also make one!\n\nRabi-Ribi is essentially a game, in which the player controls a character and explore areas, looking for items, hidden routes and fights with enemies. The game mixes these elements with a bullet hell shooter. It comes out they go with each other really well, although it takes some time to become used to it. The bullet hell elements are present pimarily with boss fights. Regular enemies also attack using bullet patterns, but these are not complex and high in number enough to qualify as bullet hell.\n\nThe difficulty lies in that bullet hells are normally shooters, in which you control a flying object and can move in all directions. In Rabi-Ribi, you control a character which moves left and right, and can jump off the ground. Learning how to avoid bullets with this limited movement takes some time. It is an \u2018easy to learn, hard to master\u2019 type of game.\n\nThe game engine pre-loads a lot of things, so the start-up is slow, but there no loadings later whatoever. If you fail, which you will a lot, even on Casual difficulty, restart happens fast so that you may try again almost instantly. There is plenty of checkpoints and they are in places and times that you would want them to be in and at.\n\nThis game has a story, but it is not really significant. It can be completely ignored and the experience will still be as good. The story is actually a right kind of story for this time of game. The story is a mystery one, which invites and motivates the player to explore the island the story takes place on some more.\n\nIn such a game, as a player, you want there to be well-designed levels. This game have very good level design. It is really fun to explore the maps. At first, you don\u2019t know about there being hidden passages, but the areas are structured so that you would eventually find them. The game guides the player with an invisible hand. You learn things in a way that you may not even notice that the game has told your about something. For example, the player finds a Carrot Bomb item. One of usages of a Carrot Bomb is that it can destory specific blocks of terrain and open up hidden passages. While playing the game, you learn which areas might be destroyable. You almost never look for things aimlessly without cues.\n\nThe game is filled with content and things to do, mainly communicated through the achievement system. It is split into what is referred to as the \u2018main game,\u2019 which is the first five chapters and the \u2018post game,\u2019 which is the remaining five. There are achievements for simply clearing the game. There are achievements for clearing the game in different difficulties. There are achievements for clearing the game in another mode. There is a speedrun mode. There is a boss rush mode, in which you fight all bosses in turn. There is an Artbook DLC, accessible through the game, which inludes some Beta Content which is playable. You can even try to finish the game without collecting any items or not touching any spikes and there are achievements for that, too. These are actual achievements which encourage players to try different ways and styles of play that the game offers.\n\nThe 0% items run is doable, because with the Standard Rule settings, the level of bosses is determined by what you have. In this mode, when one has 0% items, the last boss of the main game is at level 11, which is low. For comparision, in warawaras first playthough it was around 65. The game is also prepared for \u2018breaking it\u2019 by doing things out of order by using Hidden Tech moves and hidden passages you have learnt about. There is a harder New Game+, which starts another loop. If you did not obtain an item that increases jump or a weapon, the system adapts to this situation so that you can finish the game, for example, the height of a pillar of bullets changes in a boss fight. As a player, you will certainly spend a lot of time with this product as it is solid like a rock and polished like a diamond.\n\nThe game is presented with pixel art graphics. These are very good pixel art graphics. They use pastel colours that introduces to you to a world full of love. There is plenty of animation in the spirtes. They move, jump and do things that brings a smile to one\u2019s face. It is co cute and charming you simply want it to play it some more.\n\nThe game is essentially a collection of connected rooms, which are viewed from the side, but \u2013 even with this presentation \u2013 when in a boss fight, there is actually some camera movement like close-ups! It happens so naturally that you may not even notice it happening.\n\nThe background music is simply perfect. It fits really well with all the places on the map and the fights. Actually, warawara bought this game through Steam primarily to get the OST, because the music by Tridust, 3R2 and few others is so great warawara had to own a copy of it. Warawara cannot find the words to describe how the experience of fighing a boss with \u2018Get On With It\u2019 or \u2018The Truth Never Spoken\u2019 (by 3R2) playing in the background feels like. The right music plays at the right times. Simply hearing some of the pieces and watching the trailer for the console version bought warawara instantly. It is simply amazing how well is goes along with the rest of the game. There are also touches like lowering and increasing the speed of music when you gain status effects that alter the player\u2019s movement speed.\n\nTo sum it up, warawara highly recommends this game.", "timestamp_created": 1508768373, "timestamp_updated": 1511376294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35878479": {"recommendationid": "35878479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093816092", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 149, "last_played": 1529459107}, "language": "spanish", "review": "tengo 4 lucas, que me dan?", "timestamp_created": 1508551649, "timestamp_updated": 1508551649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481322735548019409", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35878034": {"recommendationid": "35878034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043214842", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 24881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8630, "last_played": 1682891671}, "language": "english", "review": "Rabi-Ribi is a Bunny Exploration Bullet Hell Action game and the best (only?) of its kind.  It bears many gameplay similarities to Super Metroid, like the exploration aspect, and hidden abilities, upgrades, and items, so if that's your thing, you'll probably love this game.  Beyond the core gameplay though, Rabi-Ribi is quite different, and something very special and unique.  This game is all about cute girls, a beautiful world with colourful environments, lighthearted characters, and nice upbeat music.\n\nThe world in this game is so beautifully designed and makes you want to keep coming back to spend time in it.  The visuals are lovely and I really could not ask for more there.  The artists did a really good job with the visual presentation for the game.  The areas, artwork, and sprites are all really nice, and all the small details like the characters' facial expressions are really great and add so much to the game.  The characters in this game are an absolute joy to be around and they really make the game.  The interactions are cute and fun and it feels great meeting and getting to know each character.  I don't know what it is, but there's just something special about these characters that makes me really feel attached to them.  They really bring a smile to my face and I can really feel the love that GemaYue put into creating them, and the artists put into drawing them.\n\nThe soundtrack is really fantastic as well.  Everything works out really well and fits in with the spirit of the game.  Most of the music is quite cheerful and nice to listen to casually as well.  All of the composers did an amazing job and I'm really happy with the music in this game.  It was also really cool to see 3R2 on the team for the game music, since I've been a fan of his music for years and this was actually part of what got me interested in this game in the first place.\n\nAlso there's a ton of content and replay value with this game, with are 6 difficulties (excluding DLC), 5 main game modes, a speedrun mode, and multiple boss rush modes.  Overall this game is a must-play and I would recommend it to anyone who likes games (that means you!).  I came in expecting a pretty good action-platformer Metroid-style game and ended up with what is easily one of my favorite games of all time.  Definitely grab this game whenever you can.  It's wonderful.  I'd say it's easily worth paying full price even, and I'm a pretty cheap person, so there's not many games I say that about!\n\nAs a side note, since it isn't obvious from the title, I also want to mention the artbook DLC includes various beta version gameplay content (which is described in the artbook DLC page).  If you're just buying the main game now and thinking about DLC later, then it's something to keep in mind, and if you're on the fence on whether or not to get the full package, then I'd say just go for it.", "timestamp_created": 1508549738, "timestamp_updated": 1508549738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628571450710296631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35862756": {"recommendationid": "35862756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053400807", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1912, "last_played": 1700759491}, "language": "english", "review": "You want bullet hell platform? you get rabi ribi.\nAmazing ost, difficulty level options for everyone (from insane to \"I'm kinda new at this\"), charming style...\nYou haven't bought it yet?

Fairies? Characters with animal ears? Cutesy art style? Lighthearted and a little bit silly story on the outside with darker themes on the inside? A variety of different personalities? \n\nIf that didn't spark your interest then perhaps you are more interested in things like a great soundtrack, platforming and map exploration or bullet hell style boss battles? Those things I just listed are only a few reasons why I like this game. \n\n[h1]Cons [/h1]\nI have some performance issues on my laptop. One especially bad room is [spoiler]Seana[/spoiler]'s boss battle room. Aside from that I can't really think of anything else negative about the game. \n\n[h1]Gameplay [/h1]\nRabi-Ribi is a bullet hell metroidvania that encourages exploring and doing things at your own pace. The game provides hints and suggestions what you can do but never truly forces you to follow them. There are only a few areas locked behind story progression and you can't wander around much in the prologue but aside from that everything is basically available for you from the get-go. For instance, the game warns you once when you try to go in deep water or dark areas 'too early' but it doesn't prevent you from going forward if you ignore the warning. \n\n[h1]Story summary [/h1]\nYou play as Erina, a bunny who got transformed into a human for unknown reason while keeping her bunny like features such as bunny ears. Soon you meet Ribbon, a small fairy who acts as your companion and ranged attack. Your main goal is to find Miru, Rumi's sister, who has gone missing. To do this you must find magic users to power up a stone monument called Stele. To recruit helpers you must first persuade them in a form of a battle and trust me, they all find various excuses to have battles with you. \n\n[h1]Difficulty [/h1]\nThe base game offers plenty of challenge for both beginners and experts by having six difficulty settings from Casual to Bunny Extinction. The Artbook DLC has a few more difficulty settings that you can try if you dare. At the beginning four difficulties from Casual to Hard are unlocked and higher ones must be unlocked by playing the game. \n\nI personally think normal is a good difficulty to start with. I don't consider myself being good at bullet hell kind of games (have never played Touhou) and I had heard this game had bullet hell elements so I didn't want to start on hard. On the other hand casual and novice sounded too easy so I went with normal. In return I got plenty of challenge and I felt like I had really improved while playing the game which eventually led me trying it on harder difficulties. If you feel like you've chosen the wrong difficulty to start with then there is an NPC early in the game who can change the difficulty of your game. \n\nSomething to keep on mind is that bosses' levels scale with your progress so the more you do in the game the higher level they get. Their scaling depends on the mode you selected (standard / alternative). They also know what items you already have and use attacks that are possible for you to dodge. A very simple example of this is that in the beginning Erina can't jump very high so the bosses with attacks that you must jump over can't be higher than your maximum jump height. \n\nThe game has consumables that can either heal you or hurt enemies and how many you can carry depends on the difficulty setting. A few items grants you invincibility frames for a short period of time making it possible to avoid taking damage that you'd be otherwise unable to avoid. \n\n[h1]Replay value [/h1]\nI've done multiple playthroughs of the game on various difficulties from Casual to Bunny Extinction. Now you might ask does the game have other replay value than just harder difficulties. In my opinion yes, it has. \n\nFirst of all there is a New Game+ option that you can access within the game after you've cleared the post game. Loop 2 starts the game from the beginning but you keep all your items, your stats gets a boost and you even get more pack points for badges. Enemies are also more dangerous. After clearing Loop 2 you can go for Loop 3. You can keep looping as much as you want.  \n\nSecondly you can unlock the speedrun mode. In speedrun mode it cuts cutscenes and story stuff, shows you playtime, map exploration and collected items %. There are also a few achievements related to speedrunning the game. \n\nMany of the Steam achievements also encourage you to play the game multiple times and some of them are quite interesting. How about trying to find one of the bosses before others or get one of the items while completely avoiding one of the bosses? Or finding a lot of helpers in chapter 1? Or completely forgetting about Ribbon's friends? What if you never picked up the hammer? \n\nThere are also various types of boss rushes available if you are into that kind of thing. It uses characters, items and buffs from the save file you choose. Can you say you've truly mastered the game before doing the True Boss Rush on the hardest difficulty? \n\nOne of the more interesting (but also somewhat tedious) playthroughs I've done has been 0% items playthrough which allows only the bunny amulet, consumables and rainbow eggs. Without the hammer and mobility items all you can really do is jump three tiles high and leave everything else to your trusted fairy companion. Lack of items makes it harder to go through areas for a game that is partly a platformer and it also makes you easy target to enemies. Going through areas requires using two of the hidden techs a lot.\n\n[h1]DLC[/h1]\nI won't go into details but I personally like every Rabi-Ribi DLC. The soundtrack is really good. The Artbook even adds some playable content. Cicini's Halloween adds a new area and a boss battle (+ its free). Is the order a DLC? extends the story, adds two quite large map areas and three boss battles. Before Next Adventure adds new costumes, CGs, new SP bosses and new achievements. \n\n[h1]Other things I'd like to point out [/h1] \nSome players might wonder if the game has a lot of fanservice. I'd say it has and it doesn't have. It depends on where you put the line. Ribbon, a small fairy, doesn't wear much clothing in her default outfit. Some CGs are somewhat fanservicy but overall the tone of the game and CGs is safe. \n\nAside from clothing and a CGs there is some dialogue that can be slightly suggestive later in the game. Considering how you can skip cutscenes and story sections with a button and the real selling point of the game is actually solid good platforming with bullet hell bosses rather than fanservice in any form, I'd say anyone who wants to play this game purely for the gameplay but is concerned about fanservice should still give it a try. \n\n[h1]TLDR [/h1]\nIn my opinion it's a great bullet hell metroidvania with a lot of content, good DLCs and worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1506314518, "timestamp_updated": 1549792533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.65445023775100708", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35196315": {"recommendationid": "35196315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063078395", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1482631210}, "language": "english", "review": "its not good..  its impossible to win. i play for 10 hours and i cant beat the first boss its broken. fuck SUCK ME PUSSYES FUCK THIS GAME", "timestamp_created": 1506314306, "timestamp_updated": 1506314306, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.115271635353565216", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35183861": {"recommendationid": "35183861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236982980", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 401, "last_played": 1499033644}, "language": "english", "review": "And here, we see the rabbit chick in her natural habitat; fighting other rabbit chick clones and other women who want to take her captive. i actually like this game and all its glory and maybe even the \"plot\". it is a bullet hell styled 2D fighting game and has one of my favorite mechanics in RPG's: the badge system (you know, from paper mario).

It's aware enough of this to lampshade Ribbon's skimpy outfit at times. Don't be turned off by the Steam store page description about a bunny-girl costume, because I would not have sunk 200 hours into this game if I just wanted to look at ecchi. You'll see some humorous dialogue teasing at yuri themes as well, but overall, the story of the game is an actual story about Erina, Rabi-Rabi Island, and some of its inhabitants, though it doesn't truly begin to unfold until halfway through the game. The initial premise is that Erina, formerly a pet rabbit of Rumi but turned human by unknown means, is tasked with trying to track down Rumi's sister Miru, who has been magicked away by a stone tablet, and Erina needs the help of other magic-users on the island to power this tablet and follow Miru. But there's a much more interesting story that you'll uncover about the island's origins and a figure from its past as you progress--though it remains bunny-themed to the end.\n\nProgression in Rabi-Ribi is similar to other Metroidvania games in that you start with just a basic jumping ability and go on to acquire myriad upgrades to your attacks, mobility, and statistics hidden throughout the world. In the prologue, you are railroaded towards the town at the island's center, but afterwards you are free to explore almost the entirety of the fairly large overworld, with just a few areas locked behind certain events. Two big twists that delighted me as I played this game: one, every single item, even Erina's primary attack, is optional, if you look hard enough for alternate routes and can wrap your head around the island's layout; two, while the game explicitly guides you (with waypoints and objectives, even) towards a smoothly curved difficulty progression that will help you pick up important items early, you are free to utterly ignore this and go virtually anywhere in any order. One achievement, for example, requires you to traverse the entire world \"backwards\" from the start to avoid meeting a boss just outside of town for most of the game.\n\nIn addition to simple stat ups and new movement and attack abilities, you will find badges tied to the game's nicely tuned badge system, allowing you to equip a limited point value of badges you've found to tweak your stats, gain immunity to various statuses, earn more currency, and the like. It's a fun system that allows you to heavily prioritize offense or defense, as several badges trade one for the other.\n\nThe major attraction in Rabi-Ribi is the boss fights, however. After a few easy bosses in the opening sequence, the game quickly ramps up to a brutal difficulty; outside of the lowest difficulties (which are fairly easy as long as you pick up a few items), this is a game where you will not beat many, if any, bosses on the first attempt. Most fights are fairly short, about five minutes in length, but some late-game bosses can exceed ten or fifteen minutes. If you love the feeling of gradual improvement, learning how to deal with various patterns, progressing farther each time only to be faced with an even more brutal attack, then this game will be a great fit for you. If this is a turn-off, and you're only looking to coast through, it's still a decent game, but you won't get the same sort of value. Those who want to challenge themselves get the option of six difficulties, each of which scales up in difficulty nigh-endlessly with repeated loops of New Game+ (though the actual dodging mechanic starts to fall apart around four or five loops and it just turns into a battle of overpowered offenses). Challenge aside, each boss has their own unique theme (with the exception of two pairs of siblings who have variants of the other's attacks), and it's wonderfully illustrated in their attack patterns. Cocoa, the penniless inventor, fights using an assortment of automated bombs; Pandora, the ancient princess(?) waiting inside a tricky pyramid, can slow your movement and fights with several puzzle- and trap-like attacks; Ashuri feels like a classical Ordinary Magician and takes to her broomstick for several fly-by attacks.\n\nOn top of the story mode, Rabi-Ribi offers a speedrun mode which skips the intro segment and all cutscenes automatically and has a frame-accurate timer plus leaderboards for all difficulties, any%, 0%, and 100%, plus an absolutely brutal Boss Rush mode that places you against absurd odds (the \"True Boss Rush\" mode will easily take over 90 minutes to finish, for perspective).\n\nThe game does have a history of technical issues on some PCs due to its requirement of running at 60 FPS (and no more). However, a late 2017 patch seems to have addressed this.\n\nRabi-Ribi was easily my favorite game of 2016, and continues to occupy me periodically nearing the end of 2017. There is simply so much to do here, especially if you follow the achievement list for ideas for your next challenge, that you are pretty much certain to get insane value from the purchase if the genre is at all to your liking.

Those people are fools.\n\nFor one, despite some ecchi-ish CG art, nothing's flat out NC-18 (No nudity, certainly no lewd acts), this ends up being one of the most solid Metroidvania titles in a long time. Why? It embraces the non-linearity that makes a good Metroidvania. This is a Metroidvania where you can literally go \"Y'know what? I don't WANT my primary weapon. I'm gonna run the game without it.\" And you can challenge the game with just Ribbon (Your 'gun' of sorts). Sequence breaking isn't actively blocked, in fact it's outright encouraged. Some achievements even *REQUIRE* you to sequence break, playing the game out of the \"intended\" order of progression. This right here is what makes me love this game so much. A lot of Metroidvanias will try to prevent you from breaking sequences or doing things out of order. You might be able to get one or two items out of order now and then, but nothing hugely game breaking. This on the other hand, is a game that *wants* you to break it. And for the skilled player, it will reward you for doing so.\n\nOh right, some people may not know what a Metroidvania is. I should clarify that. It's a game where you basically explore a large, interconnected world. More of it becomes available to explore as you find upgrades to traverse more of it.  There's a lot of platforming, as well as fighting. And both are fun as heck here.\n\nOn top of this you have a fun bullet-hell esque form of boss fighting that keeps things quite intense, but due to the upgrade nature of the game, you can always snag more health and attack power to get the advantage in a tougher boss fight whose patterns you haven't quite nailed yet.\n\nThis is a Metroidvania that gets so much right where other games in the genre get it wrong. Virtually the entire world map is accessible to you from the getgo if you know how to bypass certain obstacles with Erina's hidden techs. If you were the type of person who loved being able to go out of order in Super Metroid via walljumps and Machballs, you are going to love the way this game encourages more of the same.", "timestamp_created": 1505319470, "timestamp_updated": 1514748132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796119809150695801", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34915079": {"recommendationid": "34915079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025184635", "num_games_owned": 1562, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1912, "last_played": 1505289156}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I've ever bought.

It can be strange buying or playing a game with a bunny-girl on it, but it's rather worth it once you get past that phase. The gameplay was very enjoyable and challenging. Playing it on keyboard was strange, so it is recommended to have a controller if you have one -- but can be played without.\n\nI would say there's about 15~30 hours of gameplay time in one play-through, if we're including the post-game content and all the exploration that is involved.\nThere is some replay value merit from it; Speed-running if that's up your alley, or doing some of the challenge achievements.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it is played as a platformer, with secrets and [i]Easter Eggs[/i] to find. You explore the world (in any way you want), some areas are inaccessible until mobility items are found. You can attack using the Pico Hammer you'll find, or using your magical fairy friend, Ribbon (and eventually more variety of magics that she can use).\n\nIn the boss fights that you'll encounter to progress the story, each of the bosses have their own unique patterns and gimmicks that you have to dodge through and find the spots they're vulnerable in -- beat them senseless with your Hammer and magical Ribbon!\n\nIn terms of difficulty, there are four initial difficulty settings [i](Casual, Novice, Normal, Hard)[/i], with two unlockable harder difficulties. What these difficulties usually do is change the amount of bullet-density, damage dealt, and patterns used by the bosses. There is also another scaling difficulty, based on how many bosses you have defeated and/or items found. This setting can be found during the initial part of a save file creation.\nIf the difficulty is too spicy (or isn't spicy enough), There is a chance in the first chapter to alter the difficulty.\n\nGraphics are very cute pixel art sprites during gameplay, but there is some nice CG art during the cutscenes! \nMusic is wonderful and fitting to the current scene as well.\n\n---\n\n\nIt also has very cute girls and a wonderful heroic bunny.

Going by the art and reviews you\u2019d assume that it was one of the seemingly endless not quite pornographic visual novels being inserted every which way into steam. Look, there\u2019s a bunny girl and a fairy with no clothes! 10/10 would disappoint family again. Guffaw. It\u2019s worth enduring the beady eyed judgemental stares of your awful friends though, as Rabi Rabi is actually one of the best Metroidvanias on steam.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not as beautiful as something like Ori, Rabi Rabi has very slick presentation with excellent spritework, animation and music, even if the art itself might be more divisive. Rabi Rabi\u2019s big selling point is its non-linearity \u2013 this is probably the most open game of its type I\u2019ve ever played, with an expectation that you will explore as signposting is deliberately vague. Like most metroidvanias mobility options increase the speed at which you can traverse and backtrack and encourage doing so with an enormous number of hidden pickups, and the game opens up very organically. Rabi Rabi is absolutely massive as well \u2013 even a normal runthrough will take 10-12 hours, and a 100% run could easily double that.\n\nYour basic goal is to recruit characters (in largely any order), a certain number of which will allow you to move onto the next story event. You recruit characters, naturally, by beating them up. There\u2019s a lot of boss fights in this game, and even on normal difficulty they\u2019re no slouch, especially early on. This is where the other selling point of Rabi Rabi comes up - it\u2019s also a bullet hell game, with every boss vomiting forth endless patterns of glowing blobs. Even with your tiny hitbox it will test your platforming and fighting skills \u2013 there\u2019s no shame in starting on novice if you\u2019re not a veteran of these genres, whatever the internet might say.\n\nThe boss fights end up being both some of the best and worst aspects of Rabi Rabi \u2013 at their best they\u2019re tense and challenging, at their worst they\u2019re tiresome slogs through seemingly endless HP bars where you inevitably end up dying five minutes in to a ridiculous super attack right at the end of the fight. The open nature of the game means that there\u2019s always a chance you\u2019ll bite off more than you can chew, though the difficulty of the preceding area gives a pretty good indication of whether or not the boss will thoroughly bum you.\n\nIn spite of these flaws Rabi Rabi represents the very best of a crowded genre on steam( alongside Axiom Verge) \u2013 it would be a shame if prospective players were put off by the theme, if only because Rabi Rabi could be the gateway to the world of waifus they secretly crave.", "timestamp_created": 1500931342, "timestamp_updated": 1500931342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470502614974975586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33741879": {"recommendationid": "33741879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006890537", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1149, "last_played": 1513139713}, "language": "english", "review": "I went into this game skeptical.

The game has multiple difficulty options, each of which seems to be balanced meticulously.

So I need to dodge over her and attack her from behind because that attack only hits to the right\" or \"Damn! I really need to get better at using my invulnerability frames.\"\n\nIt's intense, it's rewarding, and it's going to leave you wanting more.

Her partner-in-crime is a fairy named Ribbon (the \"Ribi\") who shoots magic. Together they combine to form Rabi-Ribi, and set out on a quest to find a bunch of people, none of whom are wearing pants. [i]\"This is not some H-game!\"[/i]\n\nThe overworld is metroidvania, the boss battles are bullet hells, the music is pretty good, the gameplay is very nicely polished, packaged in a whimsical anime skin.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n+ Excellent gameplay. Knocked it out of the park here. This is just one line here, but so hugely important to this game, that any detractor seems like a nitpick.\n+ Lots of stuff to do. Lots of bosses, lots of settings, tons of collectibles for the 100% nutters, speedrun timers for the speedrunners, 0% item mode run for the people who think the ground is too soft, casual mode for the babbies, and several harder difficulty modes for the people who wish more of their bones were broken. Erina has a hammer for melee attacks, and Ribbon has ranged attacks, and there's an achievement for playing through the game without picking up the hammer at the start. \n+ Challenging, especially if you want it to be. Are you a bad enough dude to get the \"complete all bosses in MAX rank mode\" and \"complete all bosses without taking any damage\" achievements? Get ready to work for them and git gud or die trying.\n+ Not linear, do things in whatever order you like. You can get a few achievements for non-standard sequences.\n+ Has an atmosphere the polar opposite of Grimdark, Noblebright. There's the smell of a lazy vacation day, where the worst conflicts are just misunderstandings, suffering is a temporary step before a lesson is learned, and everyone is generally content. All the elements of the game combine to a kind of pleasant and carefree feeling. \n+ Music is good. Most of it is forgettable, but there's a few catchy tunes, and the music sets the mood well, which is what it needs to do.\n\n[h1]YMMV:[/h1]\n? Art is very anime. I feel like I shouldn't need to point this out since it's so obvious, but if this is a dealbraker for you, why did you get this far in considering if you're going to buy this? While I'm talking about it, there's nothing more sexualized here than what you can see in the trailer.\n? Writing is also very anime. I can appreciate that this game really rolls with the whole \"most characters are incapable of understanding innuendo\" thing because on some level it's innocent and endearing, but I can also see it becoming grating. \n? Characters. A well-executed combination of the above two points, if you like them or not will be up to your tolerance for anime tropes.\n? The island is experiencing a drastic shortage of pants.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- The story. The characters really drive the story along, but there's nothing outstanding to see here. Each boss battle is framed with some dialogue, but most of the reasons for fighting are contrived, and the game knows it. This kind of goes back to the whole Noblebright thing. There's generally the impression that anything bad is just temporary and things will just work out eventually, so there doesn't really feel like there's too much at stake. Ribbon and Erina really care about the main story line, but the way the world is framed makes me think it would have all worked out on its own.\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\nA very solid, thorough, and challenging game in its genres. [b]Recommended[/b]. Basically the only reason not to get this is if you are allergic to anime, have no interest in platforming gameplay, or are playing video games for their deep and compelling stories instead of reading a book.", "timestamp_created": 1499424872, "timestamp_updated": 1499424872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630162298679351807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33306482": {"recommendationid": "33306482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001180221", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 265, "playtime_forever": 1022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1022, "last_played": 1499334273}, "language": "english", "review": "GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: [u][b]84% YES[/b][/u] / 16% NO\n\n[h1]GOOD[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Cute character designs.\n[*]Fun, colorful environments.

The game has made a breakthrough and got a bit of a charm it used to have when i first played this game.\n\n\n[h1]1: The Game[/h1]\n[b]1.1: General[/b]\nAs for Rabi-Ribi itelf, i love the game's core mechanics. It really was an amazing idea to put Erina in the game. Whatever other people say, i love the lore and story. It wasn't too complicated like the rest and anything that did confuse me a little, got fully explained when i replayed the game on a harder difficulty.  Speaking of difficulty, the game's difficulties actually are different from each other. So thank you for that.\n\n[b]1.2: FPS[/b]\nFor me, the game is running better. There are two ways to play Rabi-Ribi:\n1. Die alot and retry alot.\n2. Do not die alot by a running slow pc. This consumes alot more time though.\nI am using a low-end pc, but the game runs at 60 fps. I used to not like this, but i have definitely improved in concentration and gameplay strategy to be able to easily go with the flow the game offers during the boss battles.\n\n[b]1.2: DLC's[/b]\n[b]1.2.1: DLC 3 [/b]\nFor the DLC's, i think they all have a strong grip on the game, in a way that it is slightly different than the time you played it without, but still lay heavily close to the original game. Months and months after me quitting Rabi-Ribi, i thought the  third, fourth and fifth DLC would heavily differ. The original game was full of story, amazing music and definetely the most important: the atmosphere. Cicini's Halloween was a twist that would make it easier for the fourth and fifth DLC to be accepted. Cicini's Halloween made the Graveyard alot more interesting. Cheers for that! It was just a bit sad that it was mostly based on skill-based platforming than exploring.\n\n[b]1.2.2: DLC 4 [/b]\n\nThe \"Order a DLC\" DLC is a bit weird. It both does amazing work but ruins some parts. The added story was incredible. Absolutely incredible. It makes a fun happy ending for Noah, which was missing in my book for a long time. The added areas were pretty alright, with an exception of the Lilli & Pixie boss battle area, which was outrageously good. It gave the nostalgia the game used to give me back in 2016. Thank you for that! The Boss Battles were super fun and i am willing to re-do them all over again.\n\nThe parkouring in this one was a bit bad, if i may say so. The speedy run you had to do from the top of the ravine down to the Stele was infuriating to do, as not only it forced you down a super specific path (while the game itself is heavily based on it's Open World mechanic), but it also, after finishing this event, blocks you off from the Ravine. In the newly added Hall Of Memories, the fourway passage i had to go down was a painful experience on my mind, but i secretly also like the concept that it requires thinking work. The boss fight in the end brought my opinion fully back up. Again, thanks for the happy ending!\n\n[b]1.2.3: DLC 1 & 2[/b]\nI chose to cover DLC 3 & 4 first, because those were easy to remember. The OST was amazing, i truely enjoyed that aspect. The music in Order A DLC and Cicini's Halloween were close to the original game, so thanks for the art you made! The artbook was also to my likings. The warm welcome of the opening menu to the extra content that there is to see is worth the time.\n\n[b]1.2.4: DLC 5[/b]\n\nBefore Next Adventure is pretty straightforward. As much as i see, the CG's are pretty nice. It does remove a slight bit of the nostalgia. It advantages and disadvantages are equal, which makes it actually really good!\n\n[h1]2: Community[/h1]\nOh boy, here's the part that takes the game down for me. For Rabi-Ribi, the game isn't toooooo popular, and so it relies on two \"unions\": RabiDB and the Speedrun Community.\n\n[b]2.1: RabiDB[/b]\nBefore i go deeper in this, thank you AlexSSZ for the time i was allowed to moderate the place. I certainly wasn't the best at it, but it trained me for other Moderator jobs. RabiDB was the place i spend my time on. I became Moderator in July, 2017.\n\nOne thing i especially noticed, is that salt is also included in this game. The community was REALLY sensitive for mistakes. I had to go for my own sake  and my bad job with mistakes. I know loose cannons are bad at it, but they won't go easy on you.\n\n[b]2.2: Speedrun Community[/b]\nI. Hate. Speedrunning. Speedrunning ruins 70% what the game is meant for; 50% Atmosphere and 20% Enjoyment. GemaYue actually supports this. The game is very very slowly changing. You'll see, trust me. Since i never joined the speedrun community, i know less about it. But i am certain that i do not want to enter that place.\n\n[b]2.3: Now[/b]\nAs of now, the community is now able to make workshop items, which i heavily despice.  I only got the Limited PC Packet and the LINE Stickers when merch would have been sold alot. If they would put the shirts back in store, i would continue buying merch again.\n\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nSo you might want to ask what my point is. The DLC's have pulled me back into the game after my break for a year in Begin 2018. I had so much fun when i bought it, and i still do up to this day. \n\nAs for now, i am disappointed with the community of Rabi-Ribi. I fully neglect it to get the negative influence of them out of my brain. This way, the game will never lose the charm it has always had.", "timestamp_created": 1499020243, "timestamp_updated": 1574807850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494736850261688232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33130513": {"recommendationid": "33130513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232364648", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 1024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1024, "last_played": 1499820045}, "language": "english", "review": "There is not many games that amaze me but wow wow wow this game is so cute and adorable that its the only game ive spent the most time on the past week! this game is a bullet hell game with anime fans in mind. this has got to be the best gift i ever recieved - i love it so much even better that me and a friend will help each other when we get stuck on things seeing as we did things the opposite away. i highly recommend this game", "timestamp_created": 1499000511, "timestamp_updated": 1499000511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524822711944580078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33112384": {"recommendationid": "33112384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137801284", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1727, "last_played": 1656603569}, "language": "spanish", "review": "VICIO.

This game is just absolutely fantastic. If you like metroidvania-type games and bullet hells, you will most likely love this game. It's by far [i]the best action-platformer that I've ever played[/i], and that's not just in gameplay. Ignoring the story itself (which is probably mediocre at best, but charming nonetheless), there are so many ways that you can play and explore this colorful world. Want to complete the entire game without collecting any item whatsoever? You can do that. Want to break the order of which the story progresses? Well, you can do that too.\n\nRabi-Ribi is the very definition of non-linear. You can do what you want, when you want, and in any order that you want. There's a plethora of hidden passageways and secrets. Some of these things also only appear depending on how you're currently playing. For example: if you are going through the game without collecting items, there is a part where you normally would not be able to progress without some specific items (e.g. double jump), but upon reaching this area on a 0% item run, a spring will appear and you'll be able to move forward. And to be crystal clear, this spring will not appear if you have collected any item at all (except rainbow eggs and three other things that are forced onto you), so you wouldn't be able to abuse this. In that aspect, it's appearent that the developers really put a lot of thought into the game's structure, and I think that that should be respected because, nowadays, you just don't see things like this in games.\n\nThe game has eight (six + two DLC) different difficulty levels. Hard and above are there to provide a challenge to those that want it, but those that don't can opt to play on an easier difficulty that is closer to their own skill level.\n\nCasual\nNovice\nNormal\nHard\nHell (Unlocked after clearing Hard)\nBunny Extinction (Unlocked after clearing Hell)\nUnknown (DLC)\nImpossible (DLC)\n\nNow, going back to the word 'colorful': Rabi-Ribi is beautiful for a pixelated world. It's very eye-catching and relaxing to look at. Not to mention that the soundtrack is quite fitting for the overall atmosphere of the game. But although the soundtrack is nice, I don't think that it's anything mindblowing and I can see it being repetitive for some people after a while. There could stand to be more tracks for boss fights, as well, because as of right now it's very limited. But that's just a minor complaint for me, as after the 80 hours that I've played so far, I am still enjoying it.\n\nActually, I think that words cannot accurately express how much I am enjoying this game as a whole. I'm not even good enough at it to do things like True Boss Rush on Hell difficulty or above. In fact, I had some trouble just completing the game on Hard (though, to be fair, I didn't use buffs or consumables). But that doesn't, and never did, take away from the fun that I am having with the game. There are plenty of other things for me to do, and if I ever feel like hating myself, I can just practice until I'm good enough to complete Impossible mode.\n\nAlso, to be honest, I feel like the $17.99 price tag is pretty low (I'd gladly pay at least $40) for how many hours one can get out of it. The game itself is not that long and can be beaten in just a few hours or less (if you know what you're doing), but its replay value is off the charts. I mean, just check out those achievements. And although it's not terribly long, the first playthrough for most people, on average, will probably take 15-20 hours. Personally, it took me between 40-50 hours for my first playthrough because I played on Hard and went around collecting all items without using a guide.\n\n... Anyway. TLDR; Rabi-Ribi provides a challenge for players of all skill levels in a way that almost no other game does, and that's letting you, the player, go at your own discretion. It's also pretty spectacular, and if you love the metroidvania/bullet hell genres, you owe it to yourself to buy this game. Don't even think about it--just do it. I can guarantee that you won't regret it.\n\n(Also, the art is very cute and has some ecchi bits to it. If you're not into that, please don't let it turn you off of buying the game. You'll be missing out, greatly.)", "timestamp_created": 1497715189, "timestamp_updated": 1497715238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 774, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.927709460258483887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32494691": {"recommendationid": "32494691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023427268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3375, "last_played": 1688840644}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first ever bullet hell game I never felt before.

This helps the player not feel frustrated or stuck (especially on boss levels).\nBeing a bullet hell game, true skill comes from mastering the art of movements.

It's possible to use their powers simultaneously, adding to the overall intensity and skill cap.

You play as Erina, a rabbit turned human, with her friend Ribbon the fairy, on a journey to discover why Erina became a human.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly fluid. Most of the bullet hell sections are found in the form of Boss Battles, of which there are tons. The premise of a boss fight is to usually learn their patterns and get better at them over multiple tries, although some will be easily conquerable in one attempt. Erina's hitbox is quite forgiving, but you'll still find yourself being hit over and over if you can't react fast enough. Bullet Hell is a very particular type of genre, one not everyone enjoys, but Rabi Ribi tries its best to be appealing to everyone by offering multiple game difficulties from the get go, from masochistic (for people like me), to, 'I'm just here for the 'story''.\n\nCombat itself is simple, you have your main attack, the hammer, which you use for the bulk of close combat damage andRibbon attacks using spells which are very useful for long range combat and keeping up a combo, Erina controls very tightly and very rarely will you take damage out of fault other than your own. There are a multitude of powerups that affect combat, and each makes combat more interesting and fun.\n\nThe game, as a 2D platformer, of course offers ton to explore and discover. You can completely bypass some powerups in your first playthrough, and there are tons of upgrades hidden across the map, some in plain sight, others very well hidden. The game also offers multiple ways to play, such as speedruns, boss rushes, and 0% item runs.\n\nRabi Ribi's main flaw is its story. Its very simple and, while that's not inherently a downside by itself, you won't find any grand tale in this game. It usually just comes down to 'we need helpers, go find some' do a plot point 'we need more helpers'. There are some good moments here and there, and an anime fan would definitely enjoy the entire thing, but its definitely not my cup of tea.\n\nAs many others have said before me, do not judge this game before you have played it. The game looks like a girly anime game that should be written off before even being played, but if you're a fan of Metroidvania games like Shantae or Dust, or a fan of Bullet Hell games such as Touhou or Nuclear Throne, you'll find yourself enjoying Rabi Ribi a great bunch.", "timestamp_created": 1491329579, "timestamp_updated": 1491329579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58749997615814209", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30907786": {"recommendationid": "30907786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059359525", "num_games_owned": 813, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2844, "last_played": 1547835021}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun!
