(the trains move on the train tacks. make your massive railway today)\n\nThis game has everything the enterprising procrastinator, ADHD haver or anxiety sufferer could ever want. It's easy to understand, easy to navigate, has a beautiful relaxing soundtrack, and the prettiest art i've possibly ever encountered in a video game. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1700610049,

Every little pop or thump is perfect, the random sounds of the different landscapes you move over haven't gotten old yet, and the music is vibing perfectly with all of it.\n\nIf you have a spare moment now and then that could use some chill or need the perfect introvert time game, pick this one up!", "timestamp_created": 1700080035, "timestamp_updated": 1700080035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150164288": {"recommendationid": "150164288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054891148", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 951, "last_played": 1700048653}, "language": "english", "review": "The great relaxing game!", "timestamp_created": 1700048689, "timestamp_updated": 1700048689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150162552": {"recommendationid": "150162552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969731874", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 850, "last_played": 1688234704}, "language": "english", "review": "Good.

I've put a good many hours into this while listening to podcasts and kind  of turning my brain off and it's great. Will say that it does support controller gameplay, but the best way imo is to use mouse and keyboard.\n\nPossible spoilers(?) or gameplay information: [spoiler] For those wanting to play for score, there is a perfection mechanic that promotes getting perfect-sided tiles to boost score while also meeting requirements on certain tiles. Each requirement you get will give you more randomly generated tiles to play around with. So, it's kind of RNG but most of the time you can make it work out with what you have already played. [/spoiler]\n\nI would highly recommend this for casual gamers who would like to do something relaxing before bed or find a time-waster game that appeals to one's perfectionist self. Will say it's very satisfying [spoiler] seeing the \"Perfect\" pop up when you fully place down 6 tiles around the center tile [/spoiler], which really makes you want to keep doing it throughout the board. You can also unlock additional textures for tiles while playing the game, so have fun with that.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps.

The overwhelmingly positive reviews intrigued me, but I was not moved to purchase. One day a streamer on Twitch was playing it, but I didn't recognize it at first. \"Wow this game looks great! This is right up my alley! What's the name?\" \"Dorfromantik\". \n\nFrom that moment I've been hooked. I downloaded it that day, and have already sunk over 8 hours into it over the weekend. Even my partner loves it, and she never games. There is something so rewarding about placing the tiles - especially when they match up perfectly - getting points, and watching your beautiful map grow bigger and better, that hits all the right spots. Hidden behind the very simple mechanics and beautiful design is an incredible depth and loads of strategy. Sure you can have an amazing time tinkering around and creating a cute little countryside, but you can also spend minutes agonizing over each tile placement and thinking ahead to reach those high scores.\n\nBetween this depth of play, the ease to enter and exit a game, and the gorgeous graphics and sounds, you'll be hooked just like I was. Fans of the board game Carcassone will feel at home, and to a lesser extent Settlers of Catan or Ticket to Ride. Even if you don't game, and ignore the quests and points, just making a really cool map with all the beautiful and varied tiles is bound to bring enjoyment.\n\nDorfromantik will undoubtedly be at the top of my favourite games list for some time, which is crazy to think that I had slept on it so long. I encourage you to give it a go!\n\nFor the Devs: Possible future improvements - not that they're really needed - but perhaps a new tile or two that can be unlocked and are ultra rare could be a great addition to the ones already available! Also, perhaps a 'power up' system could be interesting, where you can bring in certain powers to a game (for example, the ability to 'hold' a piece until later, or randomize one, or to undo two tiles instead of just one, or the ability to ignore the first loss of the round).

You try to place down randomly-generated hexagonal tiles so that their borders match neighbouring tiles. For example a tile might have trees on three sides, houses on one side, and farm fields on two, and you'd want to place it so that the edges with trees are placed against the side of another placed tile that also has trees, while the side with houses is against the side of another tile with houses, etc.\n\nRailways and rivers are a bit different as they have to be connected so that one railway track/river goes into another without ending at the edge of a tile.\n\nYou only have a limited number of tiles, but you can get more with \"quests\". A quest can be generated by a tile when you place it, or by special tiles that appear on the map, with the quest activating when you reach the tile. A quest is visible as a little speech bubble above a tile with a number indicating that you will be rewarded with more tiles if you connect that number of a specific feature to that tile. For example, it might say to connect 20 houses to that tile. Most tiles have multiple houses on them, so you won't need to connect 20 tiles with houses, but the connection needs to be continuous, with no other features like fields or water separating some houses from others, even on single tiles. It is the same with trees, water, etc.\n\nYou earn points every time the side of one tile is matched with a side of another with the same feature. You also earn an extra tile every time you get a perfect placement (a tile with all its sides matching the features on neighbouring tiles). Once you run out of tiles it's game over and you get your score.\n\nSome things I would've liked to see are some sort of campaign and/or scenarios with unique challenges to keep things interesting, as the game is a little bare-bones, but the concept is good enough that it is still okay without. There are at least a few different modes to play around with: \n- classic (normal gameplay)\n- quick play (awards fewer tiles so games don't last as long)\n- hard mode (tiles have more difficult/varied feature combinations)\n- creative mode (unlimited tiles and can place any you want)\n- custom mode (allows you to specify some parameters like how often features appear on tiles, add a time limit, etc)\n- monthly challenge (everyone is provided with an identical seed and a limited area to place tiles, you can look at leaderboards to see how your results compare to others)\n\n\nOverall it is a recommend from me. Price is a little steep for a simple puzzle game but not too bad.\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1696794614, "timestamp_updated": 1696794614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147888579": {"recommendationid": "147888579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274114500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 776, "last_played": 1677880698}, "language": "english", "review": "A pleasing and relaxing game.

Although my first game went well (I placed 780 tiles with a score of 42k) it also revealed to me that there are some serious flaws with this game's design. In particular, I would highlight four principal design failures:\n\n1. As the size of the map expands, it becomes increasingly difficult to remember the ever-expanding wishlist of specific tile arrangements you're waiting for. It also takes longer and longer to find the correct place to put a tile as the number of possible placements continually increases. The result of this is that the pace of the game drags and the game increasingly feels like a tedious administrative chore. This problem could be fixed by having a button you can click in order to highlight any particularly good locations for a tile (e.g. 3+ matching sides). \n\n2. The number of possible tile combinations is so high that the chances of getting the right tile combination become very slim, particularly once you have more than 3 sides to match. This leads to a sense of frustration which is at odds with the intended relaxing game experience. This problem could be fixed by including a new type of tile - a wildcard tile - which automatically morphs into the perfect tile once placed. This could be a special quest reward, for example, or perhaps could be awarded each time you achieve a certain number of natural perfect placements.\n\n3. The mechanics of the river and railway tiles are fiddly and frustrating. The difficult of managing these pieces, combined with the ridiculous water station tile, means that the only viable tactic is to create an area just for them on one edge of the map. This leads to an unnatural and aesthetically displeasing map. These tiles should be removed as base tiles and instead should be overlay tiles that you place on top of existing tiles (as in Civilization V). This would not only alleviate issues 1 and 2 above, but could allow for more variety of quests (e.g. a quest to connect two closed town areas with a railway, a quest to create a railway which bridges over two different rivers or spans a large area of water, a quest to create a river which travels through three pure forest tiles, etc.).\n\n4. The gameplay is fundamentally just not interesting enough. More thought needs to be put into how to make a game which has mechanics beyond tile rotation. This game needs things special base tiles which actually do something (as opposed to being purely cosmetic), overlay tiles that go on top of existing tiles to allow placement of rivers, railways and roads, a greater variety of quests, maybe even power-ups which could be won by closing an area (e.g. dynamite to destroy a previously placed tile, an axe to turn forest into plains, etc.), etc.\n\nThere is the foundation of a good game here, but it needs significantly more development to make it enjoyable to play.\n", "timestamp_created": 1695378933, "timestamp_updated": 1695378933, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624988913536071777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146736385": {"recommendationid": "146736385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084817845", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1700173897}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaxing cute game :)", "timestamp_created": 1695328866, "timestamp_updated": 1695328866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146731190": {"recommendationid": "146731190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024495055", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 316, "last_played": 1693091656}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality, relaxing building game, with no time limit pressure. \nDoesn't take long to feel relatively skilled at playing.", "timestamp_created": 1695324239, "timestamp_updated": 1695324239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146696782": {"recommendationid": "146696782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994714210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1678147254}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1695287501, "timestamp_updated": 1695287501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146695193": {"recommendationid": "146695193", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125972385", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1698066458}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaxing, visually nice", "timestamp_created": 1695284464, "timestamp_updated": 1695284464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146693110": {"recommendationid": "146693110", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027180015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 257, "playtime_forever": 5928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5928, "last_played": 1695279172}, "language": "english", "review": "While many copy cats have emerged since Dorfromantik, this romantic village puzzle game has paved the way as a classic.

Better said, this is a game that has funny tags. If you look up above at the most relevant tags you see \"City Builder\", \"Turn Based Strategy\" and \"Puzzle\". Of those three I'd say only puzzle is 100% relevant. Especially in terms of what you'd really expect from these tags traditionally. When you think \"City Builder\" you normally think of games like Tropico, Cities: Skylines or Simcity. Yes, you can build a very large town by connecting lots of house tiles that could constitute a city, but it's not what you think it is. Same goes for Turn-Based Strategy yeah, you lay down one tile at a time. So one could call that a turn. But it's not like Civilisation or Total War where there are clearly defined turns as such.\n\nThat being said, was this a delightful discovery? Absolutely! It's addictive, soothing and simply fun. This game is to me, a classic example of \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" and \"you should really give a wide net of games a go!\". While I do enjoy board games and this game very much feels like one, it certainly was not what I was expecting. And it turned out to be an incredibly pleasant surprise!\n\nThe graphics and feel of the game are all very lovely. My only criticism is the music. I think it's ok, but honestly, I think they could have been a bit more adventurous with it and gone with something a bit more melodic rather than something that feels like it would play in the background at a spa. Like I get what they were going for, they wanted something calming and inoffensive to try to appeal to as many people as possible, but I don't generally agree with this sort of thinking. Things designed by committee are rarely good. I think they should have let the composer be a bit more adventurous.\n\nAll in all.

And it could be played that way, if you didn't care about the score, unlocking additional challenges, or completing quests. If, however, you're the kind of person who does care about your score, unlocking additional challenges, or completing quests, it's a stress-filled RNG nightmare. You start with six quest types (or challenges) unlocked, and as you progress through the game you can reach preset tiles on the map and complete their quests to unlock a new quest type (or challenge).\n\nFor instance, you may encounter a preset tile with a bit of forest and a quest to connect 500+ trees to it, and if you succeed at the quest you can unlock one of the remaining challenges. It doesn't seem to matter what kind of quest tile you encounter when it comes to unlocking the next challenge, and no consideration of which quest tiles have been placed at map generation is made when the game rolls your starting tileset. This is where the problem comes in. You can run into a til that wants 40 or 50 more field tiles attached to it, but the rest of the game you get primarily water or forest tiles, or city tiles, or even meadows, and you can just never complete that quest.

E.g. some sort of tile inventory, more flexibility on tile placement, something where the puzzle edges aren't all fixed and can be adjusted, allow you to cycle through tiles, etc.  Edit:  They could also add a system where it is easier to see when a tile placement is optimal, because if you're trying to be careful and strategically place your tiles, it's extremely tedious to find optimal placements when your board is large -- again some happy medium between doing it for you and being able to help filter information so it's not so tedious.", "timestamp_created": 1689719803, "timestamp_updated": 1689720111, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477272719144821167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142368950": {"recommendationid": "142368950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139853617", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1682921203}, "language": "english", "review": "It's basically one-person Carcassonne it's about as stimulating as a screen saver.", "timestamp_created": 1689718949, "timestamp_updated": 1689718949, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480233460664749146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142368671": {"recommendationid": "142368671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311553500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1430, "last_played": 1689716994}, "language": "english", "review": "Carcassonne, but way better :3", "timestamp_created": 1689718662, "timestamp_updated": 1689718662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142339872": {"recommendationid": "142339872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366195029", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 30718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 27782, "last_played": 1700299222}, "language": "english", "review": "5 hours feel like 5 minutes, i love it so much\n", "timestamp_created": 1689697950, "timestamp_updated": 1689697950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142333241": {"recommendationid": "142333241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079466224", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1697126628}, "language": "english", "review": "Super relaxing game with a hint of puzzle aspect.

Everything is simple and not overstimulating. With multiple modes and a wide variety of different biomes.  Biome being one of the most complicated words used. It does not use a wide variety of colors to distract the player. At times, I'm totally engrossed that I'm sitting up in my chair and calculating every move. Other times, I've been able to sit back, play while watching TV or simply falling asleep.  I've even played this game while I'm sitting in the queue to go into a dungeon or raid while playing World of Warcraft (WOW). It's that simple to play or to get involved with. \n\nWith a creative, easy, and hard mode, there is something for everyone. \n\nThis game does not take a major computer to run. I have had this running at the same time several major other programs and WOW at the same time. This takes up so little CPU and requires there are really no GPU requirements, it will fit in on the most basic computer.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nTeachers & Parents Will Find This Educational\n\nThis game requires some thought be given to the placement of tiles and the ability to assess your decision and count what the results are going to be. There is basic hints along the way with an undo ability built in for fixing a misplaced tile.  This is common sense for adults who have been through basic middle school. On the other hand students as young as kindergarten and who can count will find this game fun with the long run of being beneficial to their growth. \n\nWith all math you need the ability to understand a mathematical equation, understand the order of operations and then work on the answer. From basic math to advanced balancing of chemical formulas its a matter of understanding what to do first and where your move one part of the answer to the next. \n\nThis game does the same thing. With smaller numbers but it can teach a student to do fast thinking because the flags in the game tell you yes, no, or what your placement could calculate, to if you place the tile there. The same thing we teach students. We have children/students use pencils because they can erase the answer when they are wrong. Calculate your numbers really quickly before you give you final answer.  With a\n\nIt also teaches you to slow down. It is not a speed game, it is a matter of evaluating your options.  With a basic theme and no multiple scenarios i.e. water and transit for humans, it allows a younger player to learn and evaluate. \n\nIt has the a 'Jackpot Pavlovian System' built in to allow for the student to be excited about what they have done and wanting to play more. It also has a scoring system which between siblings or students would encourage challenges and an eagerness to do better.  Younger children will only see they are being allowed to play a game, not as a chore. \n\nThe game is on Steam. All younger children want to be like their parents and older siblings. Steam is considered the adult place to get games. Younger children will see it as a treat or reward, while adults will know they are learning something from games. \n\nThis game could easily be placed in the educational category to increase audience size.  I would highly recommend the producers of the game to offer this to school districts for educational purposes.  As a professional sales person and account manager this game could easily be packaged and sold to school districts - parents would buy it for their children based on a recommendation from a school district.  \n\n[b]PTA SUPPORT[/b] I spent eleven years for all my children's school PTAs. I served as a board member, auction chair, Ways and Means Vice President and finally as President. If any of the teachers or math departments from my schools had asked me to supplement their curriculum with this game, I would have easily put this to a motion and gotten approval. \n\nThank you for producing such a wonderful game. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1689196678, "timestamp_updated": 1689196865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141932585": {"recommendationid": "141932585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067241919", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 10148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 201, "playtime_at_review": 2164, "last_played": 1700689065}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a lovely addictive game, you can play it in your own pace but it will never feel slow or boring.

I regret the hours I put into this game. \n\nI say this as someone who has scored 54,000+ points on a run, which places me above the top ~3% of players approximately, judging from the global achievement stats.\n\nAt first glance you may mistake Dorfromantik as some sort of chill city builder, but it actually is a very not-chill rogue-like jigsaw puzzler. The twist over a normal jigsaw is that you are allowed to \"misplace\" the pieces, e.g. the terrain depicted on an edge of the hex piece doesn't have to match the neighboring pieces. However, only \"perfect\" placements (where all 6 edges have a matching neighbor) grant you an extra piece to play with, and stave off your inevitable death.  \n\nAnd therein lies my central complaint of the game: Poor UI when it comes to perfect placements. As you play and build out the puzzle, the number of gaps in it will steadily increase as your surrounding terrain restricts appropriate placements. A single hex hole will only have 1 perfect matching piece after all, and there tens of thousands of terrain combinations (albeit some are more common than others). It's up to you to keep a mental list of all the combinations you need, vs what's currently in your hand. \n\nFine. What's frustrating is that you'll eventually forced to place a non-perfect tile to achieve a mission or just survive for another piece placement, and these ruined tiles are nearly indistinguishable from the perfect ones. You may think you have the exact piece for a given opening, only to find out you don't get as many perfect placements as you originally thought (or any at all). In my final run I was so fed up with this trial-and-error, that I eventually just slammed down my pieces to end the game, even though I could have spent more time finding more optimal placements to continue playing and get a higher score.\n\nIf there was a clearer indicator in the UI for marking non-perfect tiles, that would greatly relieve the montony and stress of filling in the gaps, as the barrier for finding a sufficient neighboring piece is greatly reduced.\n\nOther thoughts:\n[list]\n[*]Matching terrain can sometimes be difficult to tell due to irregularity in the representation (related to the problem above). But at the very least matching edges light up white when you're testing piece placement.\n[*]The unlocks and general progression could be more enticing. They're all just reskins, that's it. The biomes are pretty cool as they change the palette of a region via a gradient, but the rest are features that are so small that you're not really going to notice them on a large map. And they tend to be samey anyway.\n[*]A \"session\" or run takes quite a long time. My 18 hours recorded was only from two sessions after the tutorial. If you play cautiously and optimally you'll live longer, but also the gameplay becomes a slog as you have infinitely-increasing choices of where to place tiles.\n[/list]\n\nThere was some fun to be had, but overall Dorfromantik is a stressful chore.", "timestamp_created": 1688011468, "timestamp_updated": 1688011468, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592222273349761963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140882395": {"recommendationid": "140882395", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981635946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1696468948}, "language": "english", "review": "Chill.

Yes, but also... strangely stressful. Under this whole aesthetic of idyllic central European countryside there's a surprisingly deep game of matching tile edges, managing groups, closing off regions, fulfilling quests. You can, of course, ignore all of that and play creative mode exclusively, but I'd feel like this would be a waste of game.\n\nThere are two reasons to pay attention to these systems. One - score. That one might not seem that important, but it's fun to try to beat your own high score! Besides, it often leads to achievements, which in turn unlock new tiles and biomes. And two - it replenishes your tile pool. See, your pile of tiles is always limited - and once you run out, it's [strike]game over[/strike] session complete. So if you want to keep expanding your little world, you have to keep paying attention to these things.\n\nThe mixture of those systems and the incredibly chill aesthetic - both in terms of look and the soundscape - create a very unique and potent brew that just washes your worries away. And I think this is the main reason why the game is so beloved by many.\n\nFor example: this one time, I had a mental breakdown so severe, my entire concept of reality collapsed and even thoughts of suicide didn't bring any solace. I got out of it with the help of therapy, philosophy and some research, but what kept the mortifying existential dread at bay was this game. The chill feeling was strong enough to make me forget I spent too long gazing into the abyss, and undoubtedly made my recovery quicker.\n\nWith all that said, I wish the game had more object types on the tiles. There are only 3 common ones (there's more, but they're much less common): houses, trees, and fields. I get it, that's rural Europe for you, but we also have mountains! Meadows! Swamps! Admittedly, the devs are from Berlin (I think), and the state of Brandenburg is almost completely flat - so maybe that's what they were going for.\n\nI wasn't sure if I'd like Dorfromantik, but it entered my life when I needed it, and returned some kind of peace to my soul. I won't claim it would do the same to you, but I'd say it's nice to place a few tiles every now and then.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988-Garlic-Bear%2527s-Library/]Curator page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1686475564, "timestamp_updated": 1686475564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803970396518707275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139874537": {"recommendationid": "139874537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198854372215", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1687732750}, "language": "english", "review": "yes\n", "timestamp_created": 1686464039, "timestamp_updated": 1686464039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139873272": {"recommendationid": "139873272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227951212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1699884332}, "language": "english", "review": "A cozy, beautiful puzzle game\n\nWho can say no to it?", "timestamp_created": 1686461597, "timestamp_updated": 1686461597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139864394": {"recommendationid": "139864394", "author": {"steamid": "76561199040420504", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1693863553}, "language": "english", "review": "<3", "timestamp_created": 1686444783, "timestamp_updated": 1686444783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139859136": {"recommendationid": "139859136", "author": {"steamid": "76561199033796994", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 50973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 707, "playtime_at_review": 39656, "last_played": 1700413006}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it.

While I've had quite a bit of fun playing the game, I couldn't stop thinking how this game could be better. I like its visual style, changing biomes, those little ships and trains cruising through the map. Dorfromantic has relaxing atmosphere and brings joy from looking at those unique lands you can build there. But also I was always a bit frustrated because I couldn't really find any special strategy that could help me survive longer in a game. At some point you just get not enough new tasks and start to slowly spend more tiles than you are awarded with. So often after each completed task you wait for new one to start and you waste tiles waiting for it to show up. So many times you have like 3 field tasks, 2 with water, and all the tiles with forrest/city/train tracks are just waste. New tiles are 100% randomized and you're never awarded with tiles that you need - which would be great idea - you can either get lucky (rarely, due to high number of possible combinations), wait for ages for 100% matching tile or simply use one that matches partially. It would be so cool to get a special tile as an award - one that can be placed in any place and will fit all surrounding tiles. Or if you could swap current tile with different one. No. Obviously carefully considering each move can prolong the game, but eventually you will run out of tiles anyway. And while this is intentioned - what I don't like is the fact that final result is mostly dependent on that random nature of the game. If you scored higher than usual - it's luck, not your newly invented strategy or smart decisions. So it quickly becomes boring, as I don't see any incentive to play again if it's just luck that can get me further than before. It's definately worth checking out, spending some time with it, but the novelty and discovery evaporate quite fast and you're left with a bit of disappointment.", "timestamp_created": 1686295556, "timestamp_updated": 1686295556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139762659": {"recommendationid": "139762659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881759131", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "playtime_at_review": 2031, "last_played": 1699931692}, "language": "english", "review": "such a relaxed and cute game!", "timestamp_created": 1686275696, "timestamp_updated": 1686275696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139755817": {"recommendationid": "139755817", "author": {"steamid": "76561199443300331", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 801, "last_played": 1693629715}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite \"chill out\" games, period.

doesn't require you to put so much thought and you can just chill and create or if you are feeling like completing the quests for longer game play you can.\n\nI'd recommend it to anyone who wants to just take a vacation without going anywhere, it's easy to pick up and put down, but it's just as easy to spend hours attempting to best your own high score. \n\nAnd if you just wanna create un-ending

What makes landscapes relaxing is their underlying 'humanity', so when your creation turns 'inhumane', relaxation *can* go out the window. Also, as long as the music sticks to saxophones parts reminiscent of a Christopher Cross song, no problem.

But just as I let my guard down, you unleash the hidden beast within.\n\nYou claim to be a \"relaxing building strategy and puzzle game,\" but what you really are is a tactical mastermind that feasts upon my feeble attempts at creating idyllic landscapes. Yes, I see through your ruse, Dorf Romantik. You're not fooling me any longer.\n\nSure, the game starts off easy enough, lulling me into a false sense of accomplishment as I place tiles, creating quaint little villages and serene forests. But then, out of nowhere, you hit me with these so-called \"quests\" \u2013 the windmill that demands six grain fields or the deer that wants a 50-tree forest. Well, guess what, Dorf Romantik? I don't negotiate with terrorists.\n\nAnd let's talk about those \"unlockable tiles and biomes,\" shall we? Oh, how exciting it must be to discover new lands, filled with new challenges! Except, you know what I don't need? More challenges. I have enough of those in my life already. If I wanted to feel the crushing weight of my own inadequacy, I'd just check my bank account or try to assemble IKEA furniture.\n\nOh, and don't even get me started on the high score system. You mean to tell me that not only do I have to suffer through this relentless hexagonal hellscape, but I also have to compete against others for the highest score? What kind of sick, twisted game are you playing, Dorf Romantik?\n\nBut perhaps the most egregious sin of all is the undo button and rotating the last tile to not lose. Yeah instead of losing my mind over the placement of a stupid lake tile, I could just enter creative mode but again there's the score I have to worry about.\n\nIn conclusion, Dorf Romantik is a heartless, diabolical game that masquerades as a calm, peaceful retreat from the chaos of life. But don't be fooled, my friends. It's a hex-shaped nightmare that will slowly, mercilessly grind your sanity into dust.

You will be challenged to keep the groups together to reap the rewards of more tiles for you stack to keep you playing further. The challenge then is do you close out a group, or risk it for further rewards.

The idea is that you create an idyllic village scene by placing various tiles around.  In an attempt to make some kind of game out of this objectiveless sandbox, there's a few limits to what you can and can't do... you can run out of tiles, and you've given what seem to be procedurally generated \"quests\" that just involve specific arrangements of tiles (like placing three tiles with \"forest\" edges together, how challenging).  You might as well play dominos with only one player, that's pretty much what we're dealing with here, only slightly more visually appealing.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard, there's some minor technical foibles that aren't helping.\n\nThe game features lazy low-polygon \"retro\" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the mid 2000s.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks bad as a result of their decisions, a compromise PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.\n\nBecause this is a console game, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the inferior console gaming appliances that the game was designed for.  These are unfortunate compromises and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was a second thought for the console-centric developers.  The game is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for consoles forces upon a game.  Once more, console peasants have made gaming worse for everyone.\n\nThis looks and feels like a mobile app, but it doesn't seem to have made it to the app stores.  It's unclear why this was put on Steam/Nintendo Switch instead of the app stores it seems to have been designed for.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).\n\nRegardless, for all intents and purposes \"Dorfromantik\" might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nAnother unusual point, the software contains stock/store assets and other packages, but the \"developer\" here hasn't credited the people who actually did the work for the software (a scarecrow asset, a number of Unity packages for UI and graphical effects and so on).  While this isn't necessarily against the license for the use of those assets, and it's not an unusual practice for this kind of code reuse, claiming the work of others as your own without crediting them (I checked the credits) is highly unethical.\n\nAll of that might be forgiven, but the pricing can't be.  Dorfromantik has the almost comically optimistic (if it wasn't so sad) price of $14 USD (plus TWO soundtrack DLC's for $6, making this games true cost a whopping $28 USD, near AAA pricing), for which you could easily get any number of recent AAA games.  The developer seems to genuinely think this is a better game and thus should cost more than the entire Mass Effect trilogy, The Witcher 3, Subnautica, Deep Rock Galactic, the list goes on.  I know, right?\n\nYou wanna talk about city building?  This costs more than Cities: Skylines!!!\n\nThis is also competing with over 9,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this massively overpriced product.  Given the defects and quality issues with the software, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1682683302, "timestamp_updated": 1682685333, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.2596474289894104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137415590": {"recommendationid": "137415590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037371601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1689974357}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've played Carcassone the board game this is like a solitaire version.

The size of your stack of tiles dictates how big a landscape you can build. Initially, not that big it would seem. However, you are given 'quests' as you proceed (build a forest with this many tress, a town with this many houses, a river this long etc), and as you complete these quests, you will gain more score and new tiles will be added to your stack allowing you to extend your landscape further. And this is really it. Once the stack is empty, it is over and you are left with a wonderful landscape and a high-score to chase. \n\nSimple but with just the right amount of engagement to make it fun but not so much to ever make it stressful.

[b]But there is no next level.[/b] It's the same one, over and over. There's some unlocks, but not enough to hold interest.\n\nAt this price point I expected a full game, but this feels like a basic tablet app, or the \"casual mode\" to a more fleshed-out game.\n\n[h3]Potential[/h3]\n\nHere's where this review gets long. I'm gonna talk about how much potential this game has, and share some ideas, because tbh that's what makes it so disappointing, how much more it could have been.\n\nIt could have:\n\n- New levels with their own challenges, restrictions, reskinned tiles, and special tiles unique to that level or area. Eg, a city area with factory tiles instead of farm tiles and trams instead of trains; a beach biome with more water tiles and no farms; a fairy kingdom with oversized mushrooms and dragonfly flight routes instead of train tracks; a zoo world where you get bonus points for grouping birds/mammals/fish etc, or a theme park world where massive roller coasters replace train tracks... there's endless possibilities with this game's engine.\n\n- More mechanics besides \"put tree next to tree\", eg. bonus points if you put a train station next to a village of >10 houses, or if you connect villages via railways. Atm you're incentivised to keep everything separate, [i]especially[/i] train tracks which heavily restrict their adjacent tiles.\n\n- Having a choice between 2 tiles would be great. I actually enjoyed the game for a while when I was imagining how I would build the area, with its history and current culture -- but despite being simple, the system is too restrictive to give you any lasting sense of creative freedom. Having a choice of 2 tiles instead of 1 would give players a feeling of control and authorship, and let them steer the direction of their current world so each new one feels less repetitive, without disrupting the core score chasing mechanic too much. (Yes, there's a Creative Mode, but I need some restrictions and goals to keep me interested and motivated).\n\nThere's [i]just so much[/i] you could do with this game's concept, I could go on for ages with other ideas. I'm still gonna try another run, maybe try to unlock everything and see if my opinion changes, but as said, atm this feels like either an app store game or an early access build.", "timestamp_created": 1682464809, "timestamp_updated": 1698419160, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520830392837524414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137297469": {"recommendationid": "137297469", "author": {"steamid": "76561199143351406", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1043, "last_played": 1689194823}, "language": "english", "review": "Very relaxing game.

There isn't a story line or even an ultimate goal.  There are quests and points, but ultimately they don't matter.  The object of the game is to create a landscape however you want with the tiles that you're given.  Sure you can produce your own goals like try to play as long as possible by earning more tiles, or scoring the most points possible, or try to unlock all the tiles that the game has to offer, but at its core this game is a creative endeavor to do the best you can with what you have. \n\nI can see the appeal of the game if you want something just to pass the time with.  The game is pretty, and the music is soothing.  But ultimately, for me, the payoffs of the game just aren't enough for me to want to keep playing.  Honestly it does feel like a .99 game you might find on an app store under \"relaxing sim/puzzler\" but sim and puzzler is used rather loosely here.  There is no real simulation of people, no economy, no resource gathering beyond tiles.... It's a terrain generation game.  \n\n There are goals and quests....  Each tile is hexagonal, and each side has a \"biome.\"  You can line up biomes together to make larger villages.  Some terrains have hard rules like railroads restrict the end of the tile to only railroads.  Some tiles come with quests where you might need to connect 100 forest together in a continuous chain/blob, others ask that you get precisely X houses no more or less.  Sometimes there is a tile in the distance that is highlighted that you're supposed to build and connect to.  You get extra points for placing a tile that perfectly matches the biome to its 6 neighbors. The tiles, as far as I can tell are randomly generated, so you have to work with what you have if you want to maximize your score.  Some events like getting a perfect match gives you more tiles, but you start off with 100 tiles.  When you run out of tiles, the game is over, and you start over, with anything you've unlocked from the previous playthroughs.  There really isn't any penalty for not matching biomes up well, nor failing to complete quest objectives.  \n\nThere are also a creative mode which lets you generate/change the tiles to whatever you want so you can paint the map to how you like, stripping all of the loose game mechanics entirely from the game.  So if it frustrates you that the game \"ends\" you can turn that off.  \n\nI can see how this game can appeal to a certain kind of game player in a certain mood, but ultimately, this game is not for me.", "timestamp_created": 1681914919, "timestamp_updated": 1681914919, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035069942474365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136957494": {"recommendationid": "136957494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255778950", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1182, "last_played": 1684668421}, "language": "english", "review": "Good, simple, chill and pretty", "timestamp_created": 1681912472, "timestamp_updated": 1681912472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136943641": {"recommendationid": "136943641", "author": {"steamid": "76561199133245717", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1700270174}, "language": "english", "review": "genius game", "timestamp_created": 1681884552, "timestamp_updated": 1681884552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136942422": {"recommendationid": "136942422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044994461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1670818181}, "language": "english", "review": "Bland and uninteresting gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1681881291, "timestamp_updated": 1681881291, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.363326996564865112", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136939677": {"recommendationid": "136939677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043799030", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 133, "last_played": 1682173980}, "language": "english", "review": "I lost track of time whilst playing it\n\nThis game has been blatantly ripped off by a mobile gacha game called Reverse 1999, which has a minigame that is just Dorfromantik for free.", "timestamp_created": 1681874771, "timestamp_updated": 1699196976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136936703": {"recommendationid": "136936703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128928754", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1617385224}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game to relax with BUT buy it on Switch instead so you can play it in bed", "timestamp_created": 1681868794, "timestamp_updated": 1681868794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136934472": {"recommendationid": "136934472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869462996", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1695617899}, "language": "english", "review": "YOOO I LOVE THIS GAME.

And I still do love the quaint visuals and how the world comes together as you build it. But soon I realised that the game didn't really have the depth to achieve any of the goals I wanted from it.\n\nAs a relaxing game it fails because your continent soon grows too big to manage effectively and then you'll find your game ending sooner than you'd like because you ran out of pieces. You have the ability to port your game over to sandbox mode, which is nice, but by default it automatically borks up the colours and alienates your world from you. And by removing all the quests and connection bonuses alongside the introduction of the tool that'll make pieces, it instantly gives you a sense of pointlessness. What I really wanted was to just have the regular game continue. Let me go into piece 'debt' and continue playing because I want to accomplish all those quests. Or just give me 10 extra pieces and a slap on the wrist and say I didn't get the gold medal. Whatever, at least I still have a reason to keep playing...\n\nAs an engaging puzzle game it also dropped off for me because I realised I was just doing a computer's job. It's not very difficult to constantly scan the exterior of your board and compare the next piece to all the available slots. I made myself a document containing data on all of the available placements on my board and what each side required. Then when I got a new piece I could just look at my spreadsheet and it'd tell me if this piece fills any of the holes I needed it to. If you could communicate the game data to an AI, it could play this game. Which means it's not really a game, nor a puzzle. It's just work.\n\nI mean look, I have 20 hours on the game, the game's $20 aud when not on sale. It's not the worst purchase you'll make but idk.

That, sadly, is an often overlooked element of design especially in games with roguelite progression systems, which this technically has, but Dorfromantik neatly sidesteps that by being a good, fun game first and allowing for progression as a nice cosmetic bonus for skilled play.All around excellent, and while I don't think it's probably for absolutely everybody I do think absolutely everybody should give it a try before deciding, because it's utterly wonderful.", "timestamp_created": 1679733708, "timestamp_updated": 1679733708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135352292": {"recommendationid": "135352292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052380921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2154, "last_played": 1693280988}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game!", "timestamp_created": 1679707194, "timestamp_updated": 1679707194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135344947": {"recommendationid": "135344947", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979930641", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 671, "last_played": 1672934923}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game for what it is: Casual, relaxing, a modicum of puzzle gameplay and the feeling of setting up an itty bitty diorama of a town.[hr][/hr]I usually put this game on when I have a migraine or need to sit through a work from home meeting that I don't have anything to contribute towards. It's absolutely perfect for that, and if it sounds enticing I highly recommend it.[hr][/hr]The gameplay consists of placing 6-sided tiles that randomly have different attributes on each side.

There are certainly min-max strategies to getting high scores, but it's never interested me to take this game that seriously.[hr][/hr]The more connections you make successfully, the more tiles are added to the stack allowing you to build further. There are special tiles to unlock by hitting certain milestones or physically stretching your towns in one direction for a while, like a little scene of a deer in a clearing in a forest or a tugboat on a river.The vibes? Immaculate. Chill background music and adorable visuals give this game a really cozy charm.

And you can only place tiles directly adjacent to other tiles, making it basically impossible to plan routes for things like rivers and railroads.\n\nOverall, while I liked the aesthetic, I realized after about an hour and a half it was tedious and frustrating more than fun and relaxing.\n\nThe music fits the vibe really well and the controls are easy enough to pick up, and I'd give it a pass for how the different land types do not blend well at all, but the gameplay just isn't enjoyable.\n\nF+", "timestamp_created": 1679007719, "timestamp_updated": 1679007800, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6293831467628479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134770966": {"recommendationid": "134770966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097644428", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 350, "last_played": 1679418856}, "language": "english", "review": "So I got this game from humble bundle and I am so glad I did.

Dorfromantik does.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to a hexagonal Carcassonne, where the challenge is in the tile laying not the upkeep and maintenance, but without Carcassonne's ridiculous point counting system.\n\nI think even full price is well worth the enjoyment you can get from this.\n\nGREAT ON STEAMDECK\n", "timestamp_created": 1677780212, "timestamp_updated": 1677780212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763945698738098145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133918219": {"recommendationid": "133918219", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988620441", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 2117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 362, "last_played": 1683499458}, "language": "english", "review": "ISLANDERS is so much better.", "timestamp_created": 1677767640, "timestamp_updated": 1677767640, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479918420314788818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133875110": {"recommendationid": "133875110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096319627", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1677697501}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1677697506, "timestamp_updated": 1677697506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133872226": {"recommendationid": "133872226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182009021", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 556, "last_played": 1678307672}, "language": "english", "review": "i have other wonderful open world games with great storytelling or online games to play with friends but the hexagon calls\n\ni also now hate railway tracks", "timestamp_created": 1677693920, "timestamp_updated": 1677693920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133871400": {"recommendationid": "133871400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039504497", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1677733759}, "language": "english", "review": "interesting, but seems to lack depth/replayability. if you're okay setting your own goals and/or treating it more like a sandbox, it's fine. but i felt a little frustrated in terms of figuring out the 'right way to play.' once your city gets to a certain size, i felt there was some grindyness/success tradeoff as well, as you could either spend a long time trying to place a piece to 'better' effect, or just start plopping things down. the quests felt too procedural/random, and it didn't really feel like skill was 'rewarded' in consistent ways. but ... for a game in humble monthly bundle i totally enjoyed a few rounds.", "timestamp_created": 1677692918, "timestamp_updated": 1677692918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133839944": {"recommendationid": "133839944", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985880550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1677634774}, "language": "english", "review": "good game \nBut not for me", "timestamp_created": 1677642161, "timestamp_updated": 1677642161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133839438": {"recommendationid": "133839438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023140631", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1677357328}, "language": "english", "review": "So... its really not much of a game.

Each quadrant of the hex can contain one of the following: meadow, forest, city, fields, water, or train track. Your goal is to place the tiles such that each biome forms continuous groups, which is both worth points and aesthetically pleasing. The tiles are weighted so that you don't usually end up with a chaotic mess on every tile; normally there'll be a \"theme\" to the tile - such as woodlands, which will generally have three or four of the corners filled with trees, maybe with some meadows or houses/city on the other sides. Water and train tracks are annoyances, since you can't mismatch tile borders like you can with anything else - if you want to cap off a train track, the tile you're placing must have a track ending on it; which makes it harder to complete perfect tiles around them.\n\nYou start off with 50ish tiles, and there's only two ways to earn more - completing missions, which requires you to expand one biome to either a minimum size, to an exact size, or to close out a zone so that it's fully enclosed by other biomes, each of which earns 5 tiles; or to place 'perfect' tiles - a tile that is surrounded on all sides by biomes that match that tile - which earns 1 new tile per perfect tile.\n\nAnyway, the game is very relaxing with pleasant music and the graphics are beautiful. It's easy to pick up, but tough to reach ever higher high scores. There's a bunch of achievements, which unlock unique tiles or new map themes.\n\nIt's fun.

They can be rotated to match sides for bonuses. Simple enough, but the hook is keeping your pile of tiles flowing.\n\nWhile you can simply go for making a pretty scene, there is something satisfying about using lots of tiles to make a large diorama of your own design. Getting more tiles through completion of challenges, and perfect matches does not impede the relaxing style either.\n\nAs you play, you will unlock new tiles like a Beaver Dam, or Old Tree that can crop up in you your tiles for more variety. On top of that, you will unlock new themes like Enchanted or Fjords which you can toggle for extra appeal or flavor. They can all be on at the same time too, so you can get a whole cornucopia of variety if you so choose.\n\nWhen your game ends, you can continue it in Creative Mode if you really liked how it turned out, or you can start a again. You can also save your maps that you might have taken a liking to, so even if you can't add anything else to it, you can show it off or just admire the boats, trains and nature sounds.\n\nOverall my recommendation of Dorfromantik is Recommended.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Very relaxing atmosphere.\n    [*]Easy to pickup and play.\n    [*]No time limits means you are free to just go at your own pace.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]RNG can sometimes be annoying.\n    [*]Other than challenges, one might simply lose interest.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]N/A\n[/list]\n\n[h1]System Specs[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]CPU: Intel Core i7-11700K 8-Cores up to 5.0 GHz\n    [*]CPU Cooler: Corsair H100i\n    [*]GPU: NVIDIA 8GB GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n    [*]Memory: 32GB CORSAIR VENGEANCE 3200MHz (2x16GB)\n    [*]OS: MS Windows 11 Home\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1676084429, "timestamp_updated": 1676084429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132555948": {"recommendationid": "132555948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310357144", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1641, "last_played": 1698354601}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a relaxing game to unwind to.

It's easy enough for a 5 year old to pick up in 5 minutes, but the tactics and concentration can take MUCH longer to master.\nThe game's repetition is its greatest flaw, but much as I found it unimaginative to play, there's something beautiful and mesmerising about it. The gentle music and the cute little landscapes had me thinking about the game FAR more than I actually played it. They combine to create something truly blissful. That said, the concentration and tactics required to master it are not at all relaxing - in fact, it's more like a stressful exam. The game depends upon what appears to be random tiles, but that randomness can also be your downfall where, no matter how flawlessly you play, you may simply never receive the tiles you need to attain the high scores or unlock more cards or specials.\nI would give this a 7 out of 10 if Steam had scores, and it's great to see Toukana continuing to enhance it.

The replayability is really good and the challenge/achievement system is staggered in a way that ensures you don't get them all right away. Unlocking certain achievement paths happens in game when you reach certain preplaced tiles and finish the quests they give you. \n\nIf you focus on unlocking all of the quest paths, you could probably unlock them all in under twenty hours. I, however, didn't know this was how you gain access to them, so I've racked up over 60 and haven't unlocked them all. I'm fine with this, but want to reassure you that, if you don't want to play this many hours before completing the game, you may not need to.\n\nAside from the achievements, the things I enjoy most about this game are the visuals, the turn-based play style, and the random selection of tiles ensuring replayability. Each game progresses slightly differently and you can take your time thinking about the right move before making it. As you unlock new biomes/seasons/skins in the game, the color and style gradient between the tiles gets more and more complex, leaving you with a really pleasing rainbow of a landscape. It's very nice to look at.\n\nIf you like thoughtful puzzle games, this is a must-have!", "timestamp_created": 1674744814, "timestamp_updated": 1674744814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131582828": {"recommendationid": "131582828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019318006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 534, "last_played": 1698348034}, "language": "english", "review": "very relaxed pastime. good for just taking a short break", "timestamp_created": 1674733880, "timestamp_updated": 1674733880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131574016": {"recommendationid": "131574016", "author": {"steamid": "76561199011211442", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1674717793}, "language": "english", "review": "IT IS LIKE STARING AT THE SUN.", "timestamp_created": 1674719615, "timestamp_updated": 1692598671, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131568385": {"recommendationid": "131568385", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994565125", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2966, "last_played": 1698154523}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the only time I get romantik", "timestamp_created": 1674709958, "timestamp_updated": 1674709958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131566324": {"recommendationid": "131566324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203058298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 467, "last_played": 1677343383}, "language": "english", "review": "Tile world gud :)", "timestamp_created": 1674706453, "timestamp_updated": 1674706453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131562437": {"recommendationid": "131562437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086907779", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 484, "last_played": 1689876107}, "language": "english", "review": "Good relaxing game.
