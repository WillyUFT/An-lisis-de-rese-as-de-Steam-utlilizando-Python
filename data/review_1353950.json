So far, the story isn't too unique/niche or cliche, putting it at a good place to please a large audience. In terms of mechanics it's simple and user friendly, UI included. In terms of content, I like that you have to write things down, it's unique, at least to me it is. Also, there's a nice balance of giving you what you need and having to figure things out yourself. The only issue I had was that unless you figure something out, you're stuck in the apartment thinking with not much exploring available (again it's just a demo). In terms of visuals, if you're into the simplistic, easy on the eyes style, you'll love this. It's described as neo-noir and fittingly so, personally I really like the palette. \n\ntldr: It's simple, beautiful, and though-provoking.
